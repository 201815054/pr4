In a statement on Wednesday, HSBC said its Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio, managed by its asset management arm, will focus on investing within the metaverse ecosystem across five segments - infrastructure, computing, virtualisation, experience and discovery, and interface.
""The metaverse ecosystem, while still at its early stage, is rapidly evolving,"" said Lina Lim, regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions, Asia Pacific, at HSBC. ""We see many exciting opportunities in this space as companies of different backgrounds and sizes are flocking into the ecosystem.""
The metaverse comprises a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialise and play. It has come into sharper focus since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name to Meta last year to reflect its bet on the sector.
HSBC said its discretionary portfolio was designed for its high net worth and ultra-high net worth professional investors and accredited investor clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Last month, HSBC said it was buying a plot of virtual real estate in an online gaming space, becoming the second global bank to invest in a popular metaverse platform after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) set up a presence in blockchain-based Decentraland.

HSBC is putting $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business, in line with its ambition to become Asia's top wealth manager by 2025.
Global wealth managers, including UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), have been ramping up headcount in Asia as countries such as China and India minted more billionaires and millionaires.

As a result, Cano stock price is down about 8% heading into the New York open today.
Despite cheap relative valuation to peers, Tassan says he can't recommend CANO shares to investors. Among other things, the analyst notes that an FY22 capital allocation prioritizes revenue retention over growth.
On the 4Q21 call, management signaled that affiliate tuck-ins would be FY22 investment priority #1. CANO will pare back FY22 de novo builds vs. 54-59 originally forecast. We believe this year's ramping investments in affiliate tuck-ins will draw attention to CANOs practice of consolidating affiliate financials. Because affiliates are already consolidated, tuck-in M&A yields effectively no incremental membership, revenue or adjusted EBITDA. It is an investment in retention, not growth. ""We do not think this dynamic is widely appreciated, but expect heightened scrutiny in FY22,"" Tassan said in a client note.
Tassan estimates that owned providers generate 50% of CANO's P&L, with the remainder generated by affiliated providers.
He further expects that owned providers will deliver $1.72 billion of revenue in FY23E and $145 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Overall, the analyst says that the fundamental outlook is uniquely challenged, hence the downgrade to Underweight.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Wednesday, extending the losses that they posted on Tuesday in response to warning words from Lael Brainard and other high-ranking Federal Reserve officials.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 282 points, or 0.8%, at 34,360 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was underperforming with a loss of 1.7%. 
The moves came as benchmark 10-year interest rates rose to a new high for the year of 2.64%, having lurched higher on Tuesday when Brainard, nominated as the Fed's new vice-chair, said that the Fed could start selling bonds out of its portfolio as early as May at a faster pace than previously envisaged. 
Brainard's comments were echoed later by Kansas City Fed President Esther George and San Francisco president Mary Daly. They led analysts from Deutsche Bank to conclude that there is now a high risk of the U.S. economy going into a recession in 2023 as the Fed is forced to raise interest rates above their neutral level in order to bring inflation down. Richmond Fed president Tom Barkin was meanwhile quoted by newswires as saying Wednesday that he thought interest rates were still around 2.5% below what the Fed considers neutral.
Barkin added that the economy ""no longer needs"" Fed intervention to support it. Last week's March labor market report had showed the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest since the start of the pandemic at 3.6%, Barkin said.
Long-term interest rates were in focus with the day's earlier economic data, as the Mortgage Bankers Association said its reference 30-year mortgage rate had risen another 10 basis points last week to 4.90%, its highest since early 2019. Recent data have shown increasing mortgage finally starting to have an impact on the housing market.
Early selling was broad-based, with money flowing out of megacaps such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the FAAMG group. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock, all lost over 2%, while Nvidia stock lost 4.0% and Tesla stock 3.6%, the latter's Shanghai plant still remaining closed due to an extended COVID-19 lockdown.
Also grabbing headlines in early trading was  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK) stock, after the medical device company attracted the attention of another short-seller. Stryker fell 3.6% after Spruce Point Capital accused it of creative accounting and highlighted that it has only $1.5 billion of unrestricted cash, but over $15 billion in debt.
 Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) stock fell 4.2% after a sharp rise on Tuesday in response to JetBlue's all-cash offer, which at current levels represents a steep premium to Frontier Group's (NASDAQ:ULCC) offer for the discount airline. JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock, meanwhile, fell another 9.3%

Investing.com -- Array Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock surged 14% Wednesday after the solar tracker technology provider issued an upbeat outlook following a robust fourth quarter.
The company is projecting its 2022 revenue to be higher by over 85% at the midpoint of its guidance range of $1.45 billion-$1.75 billion. It expects its legacy business alone to grow at around 40% at mid-point, despite module challenges and supply chain disruptions.
The company’s acquisition of Soluciones Técnicas Integrales Norland, one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of solar trackers, was completed in January.
Array’s estimate-beating performance came in even as it ran into higher-than-expected material costs in the quarter due to changes in its supply chain plan to maintain customer delivery schedules.
The company’s executed contracts and awarded orders at the close of the year totaled $1.8 billion, a new record.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 22% to $220 million, primarily driven by continued strong demand for its solar solutions. Margins eroded due to higher raw material and freight costs.
The company’s adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was impacted by the mix of deliveries which skewed heavier on the legacy, lower margin projects than it had forecasted.
Adjusted net loss in the quarter was $7.8 million compared to adjusted net income of $10.6 million in the same period a year ago."

LONDON (Reuters) -European investor campaign group Better Finance said on Wednesday it has set up a foundation to help 30,000 investors recover the 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) they lost when German payments company Wirecard collapsed in 2020.
Better Finance said the foundation has been set up under Dutch law to target the global parent of EY, the accounting firm which audited Wirecard's books.
""The advantage of using a Dutch foundation opens up the possibility of reaching a settlement with EY, including EY Global, for all injured Wirecard investors in Europe,"" said Marc Tuengler, managing director of DSW, a German investor group which has teamed up with Better Finance to set up the foundation.
""The choice of a Dutch foundation offers options that are not available under German law,"" Tuengler said in a statement, adding that he envisioned a timeline of three to four years for the legal process.
EY said it continues to regard claims against EY Germany, including any claims by DSW, as unfounded.
""All first-instance court rulings by various chambers of the Munich Regional Court 1 that have already been issued in this context confirm EY's position: there are no claims against EY for damages,"" EY said.
The Munich Higher Regional Court similarly has referenced the high hurdles for sustaining claims against EY, it added.
Wirecard, founded in 1999, began by processing payments for gambling and pornography websites before becoming a fintech star and a member of Germany's blue chip DAX index.
It ended by filing for insolvency in June 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, after disclosing a 1.9 billion hole in its accounts that EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.

Klaus Nieding, of Nieding+Barth law firm, said if EY in Germany or globally is unwilling to settle amicably, then the investors will go to court, with litigation costs covered by the foundation.

(Reuters) - Wedding guests should prepare for a few surprises at this year's post-pandemic U.S. nuptials as people discard their sweatpants for sheer layering and body-hugging dresses.
Retailers are racing to tailor ensembles that capture that mood, with evening gowns and cocktail dresses taking pride of place at stores and websites as the United States prepares for 2.5 million ceremonies, the most since 1984.
""We have absolutely seen a push for sleek, bold, and more sensual styling with this year's brides. After spending the last few years living in loungewear, she is embracing all things celebratory,"" said Lori Conley, the executive in charge of merchandise at fashion brand Anthropologie's bridal business.
Apparel inspired by period dramas ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and HBO's ""The Gilded Age"" is also gaining popularity, Durand Guion, head of Macy's fashion office, said.
The rebound underscores a return to pre-pandemic lifestyles in the United States as vaccinations have helped with the removal of restrictions and eased fears of infections. 
Total sales in 2022 of wedding-related products and services such as attire and catering will likely jump 31% to $68.66 billion from a year earlier, also well above pre-pandemic levels, The Wedding Report estimates. 
BHLDN, Anthropologie's wedding gown designing arm, has nearly doubled its inventory from last year, while clothing rental company Rent the Runway's assortment for special occasions, which includes weddings and other social events, is 10% higher from pre-pandemic levels. 
""The thousands of styles that we're bringing in are more over-the-top celebratory in attitude than we've ever had on our platform in the past. We are embracing sexier styles and more fashion forward merchandise,"" Rent the Runway Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jennifer Hyman told Reuters. 
Department store chains Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) are also stocking up on evening gowns and party wear, with Kohl's expanding space dedicated to dresses by 75%.
For Rent the Runway, the return of weddings and parties provides an opportunity to re-energize subscriber growth - its main revenue source - after the health crisis hit demand. 

Months of supply chain disruption are still haunting retailers, however, with recent COVID-19 lockdowns in China likely to add to headaches over keeping shelves stocked.
""The supply chain was supposed to be largely back to normal by the middle to the end of the year. But as we move into wedding season ... it doesn't feel like supply is totally back to normal,"" said Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans.

Investing.com -- Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock climbed 12% in premarket trading Wednesday after the cannabis producer reported an unexpected profit for the third quarter.
The company’s distribution tie-up with supermarket chain Whole Foods, which will sell the hemp powders produced by its Manitoba Harvest subsidiary, was also adding to the gains.
Tilray said it is on course to hit its target of $4 billion in revenue by the end of financial year 2024.
Quarterly net revenue increased 23% to $152 million, driven by 32% growth in cannabis revenue to $55 million, 64% rise in beverage alcohol revenue of $20 million and wellness revenue of $15 million.
Tilray said its merger with Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) has yielded $76 million in savings on a run-rate basis to date. It expects to reach an $80 million synergy target by May-end, five months ahead of schedule.
The company said international cannabis revenue soared over 4,000% from the prior-year quarter with market share in Germany, Europe’s largest market for the item, close to 20%.
Tilray said Whole Foods will market the brand’s Hemp+ Matcha and Supergreens powders exclusively at its North America locations.
Net income in the quarter was $52.5 million with adjusted EBITDA at $10.1 million, making it the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA."

Total visits to Pelotons US, Canada, UK, Germany and Australia sites for F3Q declined 24% y/y, vs down 1% in F2Q, but continues to be well above competition. Q/Q total visits were up 3%, while street estimates call for a significant Q/Q decline in gross adds (lower conversion rates are likely in F3Q vs F2Q), Post said in a client note.
Peloton term searches were down 28% YoY, worse than the decline of 21% in the prior quarter. Similarly, downloads for Peloton were down 49% YoY, much worse than the 27% decline in F2Q. For Post, this signals that the reopening headwinds continue to hurt Peloton.
Net-net, Post continues to be generally positive on Peloton, especially after the new CEO Barry McCarthy took over.
Key driver for stock on earnings call likely to be sentiment on new CEO's commentary on business model changes and potential subscriber growth acceleration, with risk that Peloton incurs higher upfront costs to accelerate subscriber growth. Other risks are lower usage metrics on reopening and a potential seasonal increase in F4Q churn. We think Peloton subscriber and content base are strong assets in the space, with advantages vs peers to transform business model under new CEO. We also think highly of new CEO Barry McCarthy's track record at subscription companies, Post added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kyle Ash snapped up 2,000 pounds ($2,615) worth of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares as soon as he heard that Elon Musk had become the social media company's largest shareholder. 
The 25-year-old retail worker from Reading, Britain bought into Twitter on Monday after shares surged 27% on news of Musk's investment in the San Francisco-based company.
Ash paid $49 per share on average, versus the $44 price target from analysts covering Twitter's stock. Bullish bets that go against Wall Street's conventional wisdom have been a hallmark of the ""meme"" stock trading frenzy that has swept many individual investors in the past 15 months.
Ash, who has also invested in meme stocks such as video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and movie-theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, said he hoped celebrity billionaire Musk would bring the same hype to Twitter's stock. ""Everything Elon touches creates a wave in the beginning. I have faith in people's faith in him,"" Ash said.
Millions of investors flocked to Twitter's stock after Musk, who has more than 80 million Twitter followers, disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company, making it the most bought U.S. stock by retail investors on Monday, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research shows. The $152 million inflow to the stock on Monday was the largest among all stocks and ETFs on U.S. exchanges for the day.
Musk has developed a loyal following of investors who stuck with his company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for most of the past decade while it was still struggling to streamline production of electric cars and make them affordable. 
Tesla is now among the world's most valuable companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.
Musk, who is also behind other ventures such as rocket maker SpaceX, is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $290 billion. 
Musk's popularity with retail investors was one of the reasons why Twitter agreed this week to offer him a seat on its board of directors, people familiar with the matter said. 
Musk and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. 
Twitter shares have fallen behind peers amid the company's push to make its advertising more lucrative and generate more revenue from subscription products. The stock sank 38% in the 12 months to April 1, before Musk unveiled his stake, versus a 13% rise in the S&P 500 Index. 
Retail investors account for 9.9% of Twitter's investor base, according to Vanda. While that is higher than Tesla, where retail investors account for 1.5%, it is significantly lower than AMC, the most popular meme stock, where retail investors account for 40.9% of the investor base. 
""Given Musk's following on social and other media, we expect the news to drive significant retail investor interest in, and activity for, the stock,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analyst Justin Post said in a research note this week. He cautioned that the hype could also attract investors who like to short stocks.
GAMESTOP, AMC PLAYBOOK
In investing in Twitter, Musk is borrowing a page from the playbook of AMC and GameStop, whose leaders have also capitalized on their popularity with retail investors to place bets on other companies.
Last month, AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp, a troubled gold and silver mine operator. Retail investors followed, and Hycroft shares are now trading at seven times what they were worth a month ago. 
An investment by GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen in retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) last month led to a doubling in that company's market value. 
Some analysts cautioned the boost in Twitter's stock based on hype may not be enough to keep retail investors engaged. 

Musk's long-term contribution to Twitter will hinge on whether he can help make the company more profitable, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a note this week.
""The goal is to better monetize the platform, and we think Musk can only help, not hurt the process, with his recent criticism of the company as a refreshing sign,"" Zino wrote.

Fiat Chrysler and Peugeout-maker PSA merged at the start of last year to form Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker. At the time of the merger PSA did not have any production facilities in Italy. 
FIM CISL said overall Stellantis production in Italy fell 13.5% year-on-year in the first quarter due to the semiconductor shortage, which is weighing in particular on the Melfi and Sevel plants, two of the group's main sites in the country.
In particular, car production fell 2.6% to 123,484 units, while van production fell 30.4% to 56,690, it added. 
Melfi covers around 40% of Stellantis car production in Italy, while Sevel is Europe's largest van production plant.
FIM CISL Head Ferdinando Uliano said exceptional factors such as the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing chip shortage were becoming a constant.
""The war in Ukraine is having an impact on supplies,"" he said while presenting the union's quarterly report on Stellantis production in Italy. 
""There was hope that 2022 could mark an improvement on semiconductors and raw material supplies, but we now doubt this can happen,"" 
FIM CISL said that based on trends seen in the three months, 2022 production could fall below 600,000 vehicles, with cars amounting to less than 400,000 units.

That would mark a fifth consecutive year of declining output, including COVID-hit 2020, and compares with a total of over 1 million vehicles leaving the assembly lines in 2017, the last time Fiat Chrysler reported rising annual production in Italy.
Stellantis declined to comment.

Last month, the company warned that issues related to the supply chain could halve its 2022 production target to 25,000.
Rivian's factory in Normal, Illinois can produce 150,000 vehicles per year, with the company planning to increase that capacity to 200,000 by 2023. Rivian currently makes its R1S sport utility vehicle, R1T pickup truck, and a delivery van for Amazon in that factory.
The carmaker plans to open another factory close to Atlanta in 2024, which is set to increase the company's capacity to 400,000 vehicles annually.

""We have more confidence in our 2022 production forecast of 25.5k (and company indicated well positioned to deliver on their 25k production guidance), but we are slightly adjusting our deliveries for 2022 to account for longer in-transit times. Our new 2022 delivery forecast is 23.7k vs. ~24.9k prior and this does modestly tweak our 2022 P&L forecast.

Now, attention will turn to the release of the minutes of the Fed meeting last month, when the policymakers decided to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018, for guidance on the path for future interest rate hike path and any comments on tapering.
Money markets are currently factoring in the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 225 basis points by the end of the year, which, when including March’s 25 basis point increase, would mean the most aggressive annual tightening since 1994.
Elsewhere, the U.S. is coordinating with its European allies on a new round of sanctions, including a bar on all new investments in Russia, on the back of mounting allegations of atrocities by Russian forces in Ukraine. 
In corporate news, executives from a number of oil companies, including BP (NYSE:BP),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), have been invited to appear in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss the high gas prices and the industry’s role in pricing markets.
Additionally, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) announced Tuesday it had made an unsolicited $3.6 billion bid for  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), attempting to create a stronger competitor to the four major U.S. airlines.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, with traders having to balance supply concerns on the back of likely new sanctions on Russia with fears of weaker demand after a build in U.S. crude inventories and a prolonged COVID lockdown in Shanghai, the Chinese financial hub.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed a build of just over 1 million barrels for last week, the first increase in crude stocks in three weeks.
Investors now await official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the session for confirmation.

(Reuters) -Carlyle Group Inc said on Wednesday it has raised $4.6 billion for its second credit fund that provides debt financing to companies, including family-owned businesses and private equity-backed firms.
The new fund, Carlyle Credit Opportunities Fund II, exceeded its initial target of $3.5 billion and is expected have up to $6 billion to deploy when accounting for its ability to borrow.
The fund has already invested $3.8 billion of its available capital in 22 businesses across North America and Europe, Alex Popov, Carlyle's head of illiquid credit strategies, said in an interview. It is nearly double the size of the inaugural fund, which collected $2.4 billion from investors in 2019 and had generated a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 15% as of the end of last year.
""We are continuing to see significant transitional capital opportunities in the current market,"" Popov said.
The fund provides transitional capital for companies and businesses for circumstances including ""a major acquisition, expansion into a different market, or a change of ownership,"" he said.

Carlyle's investments include a 320 million pounds debt financing package to The Caffè Nero Group, a British coffee chain. Carlyle also provided financing, alongside  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), for Digital Intelligence Systems LLC, a Virgina-based outsourcing firm, to acquire a smaller rival, Signature Consultants LLC.
Carlyle has been seeking to bolster its credit platform, which had $73 billion in assets under management as of December. Last week, Carlyle reached a deal with Fortitude Re to raise $2.1 billion in equity financing for the reinsurer and manage $50 billion of its assets. Carlyle also agreed to acquire credit manager CBAM in March, which will add an additional $15 billion to its assets under management.

Musk, who now holds a 9.1% stake in Twitter, has been buying shares of the social media giant almost on a daily basis for more than two months, according to a new 13D filing which suggests that Musk wishes to take on a more active role in Twitter's business.
The previous 13G filing indicated that the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO holds a passive stake in the company, meaning he has no plans of exerting influence. However, the new SEC filing now shows otherwise.
The filing shows that Musk currently owns 73,115,038 Twitter shares, which were worth roughly $3.73 billion at the trading close.
In addition to becoming an active investor, Musk will also be joining Twitter's board of directors, said Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal.
The new filing showed that Musk made the biggest purchase on February 7 when he acquired over 4.8 million Twitter shares for $176 million.
During his time on Twitter's board and 90 days after, Musk will not be able to increase his stake in the company to more than 14.9%, the filing said.

21,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) factory shutdown has stretched out to at least 12 days, much-needed semiconductors are piling up at manufacturers amid a shortage of truck drivers, and bankers are camping in their offices as Shanghai’s Covid-19 lockdown disrupts businesses in China’s financial hub. 
Cases are at a record in the city, now the epicenter of China’s worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, and the lockdown has been extended indefinitely. While the country is sticking to its rigid Covid-Zero containment playbook, President Xi Jinping’s request to limit the economic consequences is becoming harder to achieve in the face of the highly transmissible omicron variant. 
The lockdowns and virus containment measures threaten to slow China’s economic growth this year to below the government’s 5.5% target, according to Bloomberg Economics. They also risk further havoc on already stressed global supply chains, with companies from chip giant Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to a South Korean noodle maker caught up in the fallout.    
Why China Is Sticking With Its Covid Zero Strategy: QuickTake
Electric-car pioneer Tesla on Tuesday told some suppliers and workers that its Shanghai factory -- which has been shuttered since the city went into a phased lockdown on March 28 -- will remain closed at least through Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. 
Following a separate a two-day shutdown in March, Tesla has now lost 12 days of production in recent weeks, including this week’s holiday. The first Gigafactory outside Tesla’s home country produced half of its vehicles last year, and builds cars not just for the lucrative Chinese market, but for export to Europe and elsewhere in Asia. 
A spokesperson for Tesla China didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Staff at banks and fund management firms that were called back to work before the lockdown started remain stuck in their offices.
One fund manager said he and colleagues plugged up a floor drain on concern it could facilitate viral spread after a few people on the level above tested positive but were delayed moving into a quarantine facility, mandatory for all Covid cases in China regardless of severity. 
Workers are worried about an outbreak emerging, and while the firm has been trying to come up with a solution it’s a difficult problem to solve, said the person, who asked not to be named talking about private company matters. 
What Bloomberg Economics says:
Shanghai’s lockdown has dealt a blow to China’s economy. But an out-of-control outbreak would lead to an even worse outcome. Choosing lockdowns -- despite their growing costs -- suggests China is not yet ready to take an alternative Covid exit path. -- Eric Zhu, economist
Some companies, including chip giants Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SMIC, as well as iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. have been able to keep plants running by implementing a so-called closed loop system where workers live on-site and are tested regularly. For the likes of SMIC, a new headache is emerging: securing the trucks they will need to get their chips to clients. A representative for SMIC declined to comment on logistics.

South Korean companies are also being affected, with operations at the Shanghai plants of noodle maker Nongshim Co., confectionery manufacturer Orion Corp. and cosmetics producer Amorepacific Corp. suspended since early this month. The companies all told Bloomberg News that they have been following instructions from local authorities and don’t know when they can reopen.
Singapore’s  Spindex Industries Ltd  (SI:SNEX), which supplies precision components used by the automobile industry, has extended the closure of its Shanghai plant until April 10 or whenever local authorities allow work to resume. The uncertainty over the extension of the lockdown is expected to have a negative impact on the company’s financial performance, it said in an exchange filing.

""Currently it is not possible to estimate the influence on Sabra's or the company's results.""
Strauss, a maker of snacks, fresh food and coffee with an Israeli market share of 12.4%, last month said it posted 2021 profit of 639 million shekels ($199 million) on a 7.4% rise in revenue to 8.7 billion shekels.
Sabra, its international dips and spreads joint venture with  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), recorded in the same period a 42% drop in operating profit to $11 million due to an increase in manufacturing costs as a result of the partial shutdown of the plant in December as well as increased labour costs.
After an inspection and warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December, Strauss had said it started an adjustment plan at Sabra's plant in Virginia bringing a temporary reduction in production capacity and manufacturing costs.
In February, Strauss had said it expected a return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2022.
But it updated that timeline on Wednesday, blaming further delay on manufacturing disruptions in the past few days.

""There will be substantial delays and changes in scope and timing to the adjustment plan,"" it said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores worldwide, has bought nine solar photovoltaic (PV) park projects in Germany and Spain for a total of 340 million euros ($373 million) in its push to generate more renewable energy than it consumes. 
The world's biggest furniture retailer said on Wednesday it was buying the projects, which would have a combined capacity of 440 megawatts, from German developer Enerparc. 
""The expected production ... will be sufficient to cover all IKEA stores and warehouses in the two countries, making the operations of Ingka Group climate positive,"" it said in a statement.

""We have to decide on a calendar to take 100%, but I think it would take minimum 18 months,"" Gallego said during an event called 'Wake Up Spain,' held in Madrid. He didn't detail how much IAG would eventually pay for Air Europa. 
The company will also have to secure antitrust approvals in several countries, Gallego said.
IAG announced in late 2019 it had agreed to buy its smaller rival for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) with the goal of building a big hub in Madrid, but the COVID pandemic and antitrust concerns derailed the merger.
As the pandemic tipped the airline industry into crisis, hitting Air Europa particularly hard, shareholders in both companies agreed to cut the deal's price tag to 500 million euros. 
Spain's government approved a 475 million euro rescue package for Air Europa in November 2020, a part of which could be converted into equity, meaning the Spanish government has also been involved in the talks since then. 
Negotiations had all but ground to a halt until last month when IAG agreed to grant Air Europa a 100 million euro loan convertible into a 20% stake.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS shareholders on Wednesday approved the bank's climate roadmap, after its first-ever such vote faced pushback from several investors and climate campaigners as not going far enough.
In all 77.74% of shareholder votes backed Switzerland's biggest bank's climate proposal -- presented to investors as their first ""Say-on-Climate"" -- setting interim targets to progress towards net zero emissions by 2050.
""Our 'Say-on-Climate' advisory vote is a key milestone on UBS's journey to net zero and as the first bank to have taken this step proactively, we are pleased with this result,"" UBS said in a statement.
The approval rate was the lowest of any of the proposals put to shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting.
UBS in March set targets aiming to cut its financing of fossil fuel emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, joining other lenders setting targets for the first time this year.
However, NGOs and shareholder groups pointed to gaps in the proposals.
""Globally we welcome UBS's decision to submit its climate plan to shareholder vote and the bank's commitment to net zero,"" said Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive at Swiss pension fund adviser Ethos. ""However, the current targets do not cover essential element(s) of the banking activity.""

Ethos recommended investors reject UBS's climate roadmap, saying its new reduction targets covered less than 50% of UBS's lending portfolio, excluding key areas such as capital markets underwriting. 
Proxy adviser Glass Lewis had recommended investors abstain from voting over a lack of disclosure concerning governance of the vote, while ISS had recommended approval.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust body is investigating the trustee units of State Bank of India, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank for suspected collusion on fees, triggering a lawsuit by a group representing them, documents seen by Reuters showed.
Indian regulations mandate that companies raising debt appoint a so-called ""debenture trustee"" to protect the interests of investors. The trustees charge a fee from the companies issuing the debt and make independent due-diligence checks on them.
The three under investigation - SBICAP Trustee Company, Axis Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship - are among the leaders in the business in India overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars by rendering trustee services for not just debt securities, but also real estate and other investment funds.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in a confidential December order stated the Trustees Association of India - a body where the trio are founding members - last year ""substantially"" increased the fee for assisting companies raising debt and prevented members from going below a floor price, thereby hurting competition.
The association has launched a court challenge in Mumbai that seeks to quash the antitrust investigation directive it has termed ""illegal"" and ""capricious"", according to court filings. The lawsuit will be heard on Thursday.
The antitrust probe and the impending court hearing, details of which have not been previously reported, could have ramifications on India's nearly $500 billion corporate debt market by altering costs and affecting the way trustees operate. 
A finding of cartelisation could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the fee was fixed by the trustees, or 10% of annual revenue for the period of violation, whichever is more. 
SBICAP Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship didn't respond to requests for comment. Axis Trustee, which is listed as President of the Trustee Association in documents, also didn't respond.
The CCI, which does not publicly disclose its cartel probes that are underway, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
COMPLAINT BY BORROWER
The antitrust case was triggered by a complaint from Indian gold financing company Muthoot Finance. When it wanted to raise debt in August last year, Muthoot received a costing proposal which was 300% higher than previous rates.
The documents showed that when Muthoot protested, IDBI said in an August email ""the new pricing structure is decided by the Trustee Association"", adding that ""any deviation by us in quoting the price would lead to adverse repercussion on us"".
The CCI, while ordering its investigation, noted: ""Such collective decision making by the association ... affects competition in the markets.""
In February it asked the trustee association to submit their meeting records and explain its role in fixing a minimum fee structure, one document showed.
The trustee association has defended itself in the court filings by saying the higher fee was justified as their cost burden had gone up over the years due to enhanced regulatory compliance requirements. 
It said it had informed the market regulator SEBI last year that the pricing structure will be decided by trustees, but it ""will not be below the benchmark floor price"".
The group said that the matter, by law, can only be investigated by a ""specialised sectoral regulator"", in this case SEBI.
SEBI, already ""provides enough checks and balances to deal with any price rigging (cartelisation),"" it argued.

Before approaching the antitrust body, Muthoot also lodged a complaint against the trustees with SEBI, which is still being reviewed, the documents stated.
SEBI and Muthoot did not respond to Reuters queries.

The European Commission has already proposed new sanctions including banning Russian coal imports and halting trade worth nearly 20 billion euros ($22 billion), and the White House said late Tuesday that its new measures will target Russian banks and officials and ban investment in Russia.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions already levied by the West as punishment have roiled markets, causing sharp rises in commodity prices, prompting fears of sharply slower growth this year. 
German factory orders fell 2.2% on the month in February in the runup to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, falling for the first time in four months and underscoring concerns over weaker growth in Europe’s largest economy. 
Also, dragging on the European markets are set to receive a negative handover from Asia and Wall Street after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard raised expectations of aggressive interest rate rises by the U.S. central bank, added to by hawkish comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard, normally seen as one of the more dovish members of the central bank policymakers.
This puts the focus firmly on the release later Wednesday of minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting, with investors looking for clues over the likelihood of a 50 basis point hike at the U.S. central bank's next meeting in May.

Treasury markets are in full-fledged selloff mode ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting. 
With a half-point interest rate rise mostly baked in for May, the debate has moved on to whether the Fed could kick off balance sheet reduction next month as well.
On Tuesday two normally dovish Fed officials, governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly, precipitated a fresh Treasury selloff with suggestions the run-off might commence next month -- alongside a rate hike.
Ten-year Treasury yields have jumped to the highest in three years, up some 20 basis points since Friday. And with the Fed apparently poised to become even more aggressive on inflation, the 2-year/10-year Treasury curve has normalised, having been inverted for around a week.
What bears watching is the ""real"" or inflation adjusted Treasury yield, the variable that can determine how much sense it makes to invest in riskier assets such as stocks and emerging markets.
Ten-year real yields remain negative but at -0.26%, they are on their way back to zero, levels not seen since March 2020. Remember, they were below -1% at the start of this year. 
On stocks, Tuesday's Nasdaq-led Wall Street selloff carried into Asia, pushing Japan's Nikkei 1.7% lower. Some stabilisation is creeping in however, with European shares marginally lower and U.S. equity futures flatlining. 
Europe has other problems to contend with, and not just the prospect of economic recession caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. French markets have woken up to the possibility that the country's two-round presidential election (April 10 and 24) might yield a shock win for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
The euro has slipped to a one-month low versus the buoyant dollar. Further weakness may be bad news for the inflation outlook especially as factory inflation is likely to have topped 30% in March.

Backed by China's Ant Group and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), Paytm raised $2.5 billion in India's biggest initial public offer (IPO) last November, but made a dismal debut on widespread concerns over its high valuation. 
Its shares, which have lost more than 70% from its IPO price of 2,150 rupees, rose as much as 4.3% on Wednesday to a near three-week high of 635.4 rupees following the news.
""We are encouraged by our business momentum, scale of monetisation and operating leverage,"" founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said in a letter to shareholders.
""We expect this to continue, and I believe we should be operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven in the next six quarters.""
Sharma said his stock grants would vest only when the firm's market capitalisation crossed the IPO level on a sustained basis.
Paytm shares also suffered after the central bank last month barred its payments bank from adding customers, and ordered a comprehensive audit of its IT systems, citing ""material"" supervisory concerns.
The company denied last month a Bloomberg News report that said the Reserve Bank of India had found Paytm Payments Bank's servers to be sharing information with China-based entities that indirectly own a stake in the firm.
On Wednesday, the company also said the number of monthly transacting users of its app was at its highest during the quarter with 41% annual growth to 70.9 million.

It disbursed 6.5 million loans during the quarter, for a total value of 35.53 billion rupees ($470 million).

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely lower Wednesday ahead of the likely imposition of new Western sanctions on Russia as well as concerns of aggressive monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The United States and Europe are set to announce later Wednesday new sanctions to punish Moscow over alleged atrocities in Ukraine, something Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky described as ""war crimes"" in a speech to the United Nations security council.
The European Commission has already proposed new sanctions including banning Russian coal imports and halting trade worth nearly 20 billion euros ($22 billion), and the White House said late Tuesday that its new measures will target Russian banks and officials and ban investment in Russia.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions already levied by the West as punishment have roiled markets, causing sharp rises in commodity prices, prompting fears of sharply slower growth this year. 
European markets are also set to receive a negative handover from Asia and Wall Street after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard raised expectations of aggressive interest rate rises by the U.S. central bank to take monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.
This puts the focus firmly on the release later Wednesday of minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting, with investors looking for clues over the likelihood of a 50 basis point hike at the U.S. central bank's next meeting in May.
Also weighing was the sharp contraction in China's services sector in March, with the Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index falling to 42.0 from 50.2 in February, weighed by a surge in coronavirus cases.
Back in Europe, German factory orders fell 2.2% on the month in February, a hefty drop from the revised gain of 2.3% the previous month, ahead of the release of Eurozone producer price data for February.
In corporate news, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is likely to be in focus after the German carmaker’s finance chief Arno Antlitz told the Financial Times that the company is likely to ditch many models by the end of the decade to concentrate on producing fewer cars overall but more profitable premium vehicles.
Oil prices edged higher unchanged Wednesday, with traders having to balance supply concerns on the back of likely new sanctions on Russia with fears of weaker demand after a build in U.S. crude inventories and a prolonged Covid lockdown in Shanghai, the Chinese financial hub.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed a build of just over 1 million barrels for last week, compared with the 3-million-barrel draw reported the previous week.
Investors now await official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the session for confirmation.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $102.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $107.11. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,920.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.0880.

""The key target is not growth,"" Arno Antlitz told the Financial Times newspaper. ""We are (more focused) on quality and on margins, rather than on volume and market share."" 
Antlitz said VW would reduce its range of petrol and diesel cars, consisting of at least 100 models spread across several brands, by 60% in Europe over the next eight years.

The paper said VW’s new strategy was a sign of profound changes in the auto sector, which has attempted for decades to increase profits by selling more cars each year, even if that required heavy discounting.
Former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in the wake of a diesel emissions scandal, had made it his goal to beat Toyota and General Motors (NYSE:GM) to the title of ""volume number one"" by 2018.

A startup two years ago, it is now the first licensed digital private bank in Switzerland, Chief Executive Schuyler Weiss told Reuters. 
""Yes, we are digital. But first and foremost we are personal private bank. We want to tailor the experience. You give a very human experience to our client,"" he said.
He said Alpian, in which Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) also has a stake, aims to have 5,000 customers by the end of the year. The company is entering a market segment that has hardly been occupied so far. 
Traditional asset managers for millionaires and billionaires like Julius Baer or big banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) usually provide their full range of services only to clients with several million dollars in assets. 
Retail banks or even smartphone banks such as Revolut or N26 have only a limited and standardised offering. This also applies, for example, to the U.S. robo-adviser Wealthfront, which UBS acquired this year.
Weiss said the group was primarily targeting clients with liquid assets of 100,000 to 1 million Swiss francs ($108,000 to $1.08 million). Weiss would not disclose fees, but called them ""significantly less"" than those of traditional private banks.
Alpian has secured 48 million francs in several rounds of financing so far. 

The firm, which also has offices in Rome and London, aims to employ around 100 people by year's end, from just under 70 now.
An initial public offering was not envisaged for now, but another round of financing was possible. Alpian wants to break even in 2025. ($1 = 0.9281 Swiss francs)

(Reuters) - U.S. stock buybacks appear to be hitting new records as companies head into quarterly earnings season, even as some investors worry about the growing threat of inflation, a potential recession and stagnant share prices. 
New repurchase announcements by U.S. companies reached over $300 billion in the first quarter, with March showing a strong year over year increase, suggesting buybacks have remained resilient in recent weeks, according to financial data firm EPFR, Informa Financial Intelligence.
Seen as a major contributor to Wall Street's gains in the past several years, stock buybacks will be in the spotlight when results are unveiled. Companies typically buy back their shares when they are feeling confident about the future and view their stock prices as undervalued. 
Investors are broadly worried about inflation and the threat of a recession on corporate outlooks, which could sour the willingness of companies to return money to shareholders in the form of big buybacks and dividends.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Monday his bank would reduce its stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules.
Also on Monday,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) said it would pause billions of dollars of stock buybacks to invest more in employees and stores at a time when the coffee seller faces growing unionization of its U.S. workforce.
""I don't think these are one-offs. I think you're going to see more companies perhaps slow down their buyback process and be more like they were in early 2020, thinking, 'how much cash do I need on my balance sheet to weather this particular storm if in fact we go into a recession',"" predicted Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
Graphic: S&P 500 buybacks hit record highs- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/BUYBACKS/akvezjyawpr/chart.png
S&P 500 companies plowed around $880 billion into buying their own shares last year, up from $520 billion in 2020, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report last month estimated S&P 500 companies in 2022 will spend $1 trillion buying up their own shares.
EPFR, Informa Financial Intelligence analyst Winston Chua, who tracks new buyback announcements, said that - at least for now - companies appear to be aggressively repurchasing their shares. New buybacks announced in March reached about $74 billion, compared to $54 billion in March 2021, Chua said. 
Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank in London, predicted that major companies' relatively strong balance sheets will give them the security to continue their current strong pace of buybacks.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' earnings to have grown 6.4% in the March quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, compared to over 30% growth in the prior quarter. 

The benchmark stock index remains down almost 6% from its record high close in early January, partly recovering from a loss of about 13%.
""Earnings look robust yet there is huge volatility. That's a classic thing company boards would look at,"" Peters said.

Analysts said Kaisa's move could set an example for other distressed property developers, including China Evergrande Group and Shimao Group, to introduce state-owned enterprises or local governments for their restructuring.
Chinese state-owned firms are expected to acquire more assets from highly indebted private developers as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over the crisis-hit property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy. 
Kaisa said in a filing late on Tuesday the cooperation agreement will include new opportunities in property development in the Greater Bay Area, as well as other businesses such as cultural tourism and ferry.
The agreement is ""conducive to... revitalising (its) assets of commercial and residential projects, and alleviating short-term liquidity difficulties,"" the firm said in the filing.
Kaisa, the second-largest U.S. dollar bond issuer among Chinese developers after Evergrande, is restructuring its $12 billion offshore debt after defaulting on some bonds last year.
China Merchants Shekou, a flagship company of China Merchants Group, specialises in the development of commercial and industrial parks, while China Great Wall, owned by the finance ministry, is one of the country's four biggest managers of distressed debt.

""This is the first major restructuring announced by a developer so far and we think market should consider it as positive because this should pave the way for the smooth solving of its problems,"" Raymond Cheng, head of China research at CGS-CIMB Securities said. 
Kaisa's shares listed in Hong Kong has been suspended from trading since April 1 as required by listing rules because it was not able to publish its 2021 financial results by the March 31 deadline.

The slide suggests sentiment remains weak in the sector even after Chinese regulators over the weekend sought to defuse U.S. delisting risks with a radical rule change proposal.

(Reuters) - Australian fertility services provider Virtus Health said on Wednesday it will consider a revised buyout offer from minority owner BGH Capital, weeks after it accepted a sweeter bid from rival suitor CapVest Partners.
In a takeover battle that has seen Virtus shares climb 55% since last December, private equity firm BGH Capital, which already owns 19.9% of Virtus, is now offering A$8.0 per share, valuing the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) specialist at A$683.5 million ($518 million) in total.
The revised offer is at a discount of 0.9% to Virtus' last closing stock price, and is 4.6% higher than BGH's previous offer of A$7.65 apiece.
Melbourne-based BGH's new proposed bid comes weeks after Virtus unanimously recommended to shareholders - including BGH - a cash offer of A$8.25 per share from investment firm CapVest, valuing Virtus at A$704.8 million. Virtus' deal with CapVest allows it to consider a superior proposal from BGH or another party.
London-based CapVest did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
""Virtus board is considering the BGH takeover bid, and in particular, whether it constitutes a 'superior proposal' under the transaction implementation deed signed with an entity controlled by CapVest Partners,"" Virtus said in a statement.
Shares in Virtus which has operations in Australia, Ireland, Denmark, Britain and Singapore, were up 0.7% at A$8.13 as of 0251 GMT while the broader market was down 0.7%. (AX)
BGH's new off-market takeover bid is structured as an all-cash offer, with no reliance on any tax rulings or capital returns, the private equity firm said.
The offer would provide shareholders with ""an opportunity to divest as much Virtus stock as they deem appropriate"" without having to pay brokerage fees, BGH said.

China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.55% by 10:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.28%. Chinese markets re-opened after a two-day holiday, and the Caixin Services purchasing managers index for March 2022 was 42.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.74%, with markets also re-opening after Tuesday’s holiday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.94% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.88%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.82%.
U.S futures fluctuated in reaction to Wall Street’s losses overnight. Treasuries extended their losses, with the 10-year yield at the highest level since 2019 and in Asia Pacific, Australian and New Zealand bonds also dropped.
Worries about the war in Ukraine, triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, also remain. The U.S., European Union (EU) and Group of Seven are coordinating on a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, which could isolate the country even further and increase the war’s economic impact.
The sanctions under discussion include a U.S. ban on investment in the country, an EU ban on coal imports and increased penalties on financial institutions. They could also target Russian President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, political figures and tycoons.
On the central bank front, Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said that getting inflation under control is “paramount,” adding that the central bank could begin paring its balance sheet more quickly as soon as May 2022.
Brainard’s comments drew even more attention to the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due later in the day. Investors will be parsing the minutes for clues on how fast the central bank will hike interest rates and the pace of quantitative tightening. Concerns are also mounting that a more restrictive Fed monetary policy could lead to an economic downturn.
“The key risk for Wall Street correlated world stock markets remains the Federal Reserve tightening cycle,” Jefferies LLC global head of equity strategy Christopher Wood said in a note. Debt levels mean the impact of a tighter monetary policy will be much quicker, particularly if quantitative tightening comes alongside rate rises, the note added.
Investors will also be paying attention to speeches from other Fed policymakers throughout the week. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak later in the day, while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at separate events on Thursday.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Did Elon Musk break U.S. securities laws again? 
Former securities officials and professors said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive may have missed a key disclosure deadline and filed the wrong paperwork when he bought 9% of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), a platform regularly used by the outspoken billionaire. Securities and Exchange Commission regulators could use any shortfall to try to punish Musk more for other lapses, some believe.
Musk on Monday disclosed that he bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the micro-blogging site's largest shareholder and triggering a rise of more than 27% in the company's shares. The filing said that March 14, 2022, is the date of the event that required the disclosure.
U.S. securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company, and in Musk's case the 10-day deadline was March 24. A late report could lead to a per-violation civil penalty of up to $207,183, according to Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
That is a financial slap on the wrist for Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $302 billion, according to Forbes, but the SEC could look into market manipulation allegations regarding the Twitter stock purchase and seek harsher sanctions in an ongoing investigation regarding his Tesla stock sales, experts say.
""This is not really a gray area. He acquired it and didn't file within 10 days. It's a violation. And so this is a slam-dunk case from the SEC perspective,"" Adam C. Pritchard, a law professor at University of Michigan Law School, said.
In addition, Musk filed a ""13G"" disclosure form for investors who plan to hold their shares passively, even though it emerged on Tuesday that Musk will take a Twitter board seat in order to push change at the company. 
That means he should have filed the ""13D"" form used by activist investors, officers and directors who have the ability to influence the management and policies of an issuer, said several lawyers. 
Eleazer Klein, co-chair of the global Shareholder Activism Group at Schulte Roth & Zabel, said Musk's use of the 13G form was not appropriate and that regulators could have reason to review the matter. 
Musk on Tuesday amended his earlier filing and filed the 13D form to report a change in his status to an active investor.
The SEC is already investigating Musk's Nov. 6, 2021, tweet asking his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. 
Musk is also bound by a 2018 SEC settlement that requires him to obtain preapproval on some of his tweets, after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said that he defrauded investors. 
Musk says the SEC is harassing him in a bad-faith effort to punish him for criticizing the government, and he is fighting to nullify the deal.
Pritchard said the SEC could ""tell a court that he's a recidivist violator of the securities laws and that he needs to be dealt with harshly.""
SEC and Tesla did not respond to requests for comments. 
Tesla shares closed down 4.7% on Tuesday. 
""REAL RISKS"" 
Musk also made comments about Twitter after his purchase but before disclosing his stake.
On March 25, Musk tweeted a poll: ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?""
A day later, Musk said he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform.
""Musk is taking real risks here,"" said Georgetown Law's Velikonja. Musk was playing a game with the SEC officials, saying, ""'Stop me if you can, but you can't,'"" she said, adding, ""I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file.""
Musk has been critical of Twitter and its policies of late, accusing the company of failing to adhere to free-speech principles.
""Arguably, his social media posts about potential alternatives to Twitter can be seen, in light of his previously undisclosed stake, as a form of market manipulation to affect the share price, but proving that seems difficult,"" said Howard Fischer, a former SEC counsel and a partner at law firm Moses & Singer. 
""The fact that the revelation of his stake caused a price rise that resulted in Musk's stake increasing in value is something that the SEC might look into.”
Twitter shares have surged since mid-March when Musk purchased his stake. The stake, valued at around $2.4 billion at the closing price of March 14, jumped to $3.7 billion as of Monday's closing price.
In addition, some well-timed trades in Twitter options days before Musk revealed his purchase are raising eyebrows among options analysts. 

The SEC would likely investigate if anyone who knew about the acquisition of the shares traded in advance of the filing, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement attorney and government investigations and securities enforcement practice chair for law firm Dickinson Wright.
""I really think that would be the focus rather than the tardiness,"" Frenkel said.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has complained of increased military pressure by Beijing to try and force the democratically ruled island to accept its sovereignty.
The package would include training, planning, fielding, deployment, operation, maintenance and sustainment of the Patriot Air Defense System and associated equipment, the Pentagon said, in a notification to Congress.
""This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" it said. 
""The proposed sale will help to sustain the recipient's missile density and ensure readiness for air operations. The recipient will use this capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen homeland defense.""
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties and the anger such weapons sales always generate in Beijing.
Taiwan's presidential office noted this was the third arms sale announced since President Joe Biden took office, and showed the ""rock solid"" nature of their relationship.
""Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself, and continue to deepen cooperative partnerships with the United States and other like-minded countries,"" spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement. 
Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.
The Pentagon said Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) was the prime contractor for the possible sale.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it expected the deal to ""become effective"" within the month.

RCCOL found that ""Chinese patrons were assisted in illegally transferring up to A$160 million in funds."" 
""As a first step, we are acting on the Royal Commission's findings that Crown's China Union Pay process breached important Victorian regulatory obligations, was illegal and constituted serious misconduct,"" VGCCC Chair Fran Thorn said, with the regulator promising there will be more to come. 

An inquiry in October had declared Crown unsuitable to hold a gambling licence in Melbourne, but allowed it to run its biggest-earning casino under supervision.

(Reuters) - WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said the future of Hollywood is in the blockchain as he prepares to leave the media company that he helped lead into the streaming era.
Kilar said he saw new opportunities at the intersection of storytelling and technology although he declined to discuss his next pursuit. 
The veteran tech executive said he had no plans to retire after announcing his departure from AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unit WarnerMedia ahead of its merger with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc in a deal expected to close this month.
Kilar's career has straddled Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and he sees blockchain, the digital ledgers that keep track of transactions across computer networks, as transforming the entertainment business, especially as the process of acquiring unique digital collectibles such as Non Fungible Tokens becomes simpler.
""I think that's going to be a potential wave that's going to be coming to Hollywood, in the same way that the DVD wave came to Hollywood in the '90s,"" Kilar told Reuters in an interview after he announced his departure to staff on Tuesday. 
""Obviously, that changed the economic fortunes of a lot of these companies, WarnerMedia included.""
The blockchain may also open up new forms of financing, Kilar said.
STREAMING WAR 
Kilar has a long track record of pushing technology and change in entertainment.
The former Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive was recruited to lead Hulu, because he did not rely on a set of assumptions about the way television should work, according to executives who were involved in the creation of Hulu. 
Within two months of Hulu's launch in March 2008, the site, once dubbed by critics in the blogosphere as ClownCo, surged in popularity.
Kilar left Hulu in 2013, following disagreements with the company's owners, the former News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), NBCUniversal and the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which had pushed for more advertising and an end to the free version of the service. 
Kilar launched his own subscription video service for social media content, Vessel, which was subsequently sold in 2016 to Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and four years later he joined WarnerMedia, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading.
That experience led him to changes which threaten to reshape Hollywood. Faced with closed movie theaters and surging competition online, Kilar shattered the traditional release ""windows"" for films, which have always brought movies into homes after lengthy showings in theaters.
Kilar premiered new films in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day, during the pandemic. The experiment began with the premiere of ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on Christmas Day 2020, and continued through 2021. 

The move provided a steady flow of new entertainment to the service at a time when the pandemic had disrupted production schedules throughout the industry. It also helped the fledgling HBO Max, and the HBO cable TV network, to add 73.8 million subscribers.
“History has shown that incumbents tend to fight trends that challenge established ways,"" to their detriment, Kilar wrote in a 2011 blog post.

(Reuters) -Twitter Inc said on Tuesday it will offer Elon Musk a seat on its board of directors, a position the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss and entrepreneur plans to use to bring about significant improvements at the social media site after disclosing a sizeable holding.
Musk reported in a regulatory filing on Monday that he had amassed a roughly 9% stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), making him its largest shareholder. 
""Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months,"" Musk tweeted. Parag Agrawal is Twitter's CEO. 
Beyond the promise of big change at Twitter, Tesla Inc's CEO, who often chooses unconventional paths, has provided little detail.
Musk will be involved in strategic decisions, including the direction of Twitter's Bluesky project and the addition of an edit button, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
He will not have a say on the platform's moderation, what speech gets banned or whose accounts get restored, the source said - a policy that applies to all board members.
Twitter shares closed up 2%, at $50.98, on Tuesday, after gaining over 27% on Monday. Tesla shares were down 4.7%. 
Musk's appointment will potentially block chances of his making a takeover bid because Musk, whom Forbes ranks as the world's wealthiest person, cannot own more than 14.9% of Twitter's stock either as an individual shareholder or as a member of a group as long as he is on the company's board.
The disclosure of his stake on Monday stoked widespread speculation, ranging from a full takeover of the platform to taking an active position. 
Musk has not indicated an interest in acquiring the company, the source said.
Musk on Tuesday made an amendment to the securities filing to report a change in his status from a passive investor to an active one, amid controversy that he may have filed a wrong paperwork. https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-may-add-sec-ire-with-late-report-about-twitter-stake-2022-04-05
“Not one to shy away from controversy or speaking his mind, Musk always carries some compliance risks,"" said Andrew Wang, managing partner at Runnymede Capital Management. 
Musk also disclosed in his filing on Tuesday that he bought the combined 73 million shares in Twitter for $2.64 billion from Jan. 31 to April 1. That works out to an average price per share of $36.14.
Twitter shares had closed at $39.31 on Friday, ahead of Musk's disclosure of his stake.
""INTENSE CRITIC"" OF TWITTER SERVICE
Twitter executives tweeted out congratulations after the announcement. There is hope that Musk's presence can revive the platform, which has struggled to attract users, and possibly stir interest from retail investors. 
""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term,"" Twitter CEO Agrawal said in a tweet.
Musk, who calls himself a free-speech absolutist, has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a Twitter poll asking users if they believed the platform adheres to the principle of free speech. 
After disclosing his stake on Monday, Musk put out another poll on Twitter asking users if they want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media platform has been working.
Bluesky is a company funded by Twitter to develop a new operating standard for social media. The company is working on building an open protocol that would allow different social media companies to operate together. 
Musk reached out to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Agrawal shortly after he built his stake on March 14, telling them he wanted to join the board, according to a source familiar with the situation. They were eager to bring him on board, believing he could bring buzz to the platform as well as good ideas, the source said.
Dorsey tweeted that he is ""really happy Elon is joining the Twitter board!"" adding that Agrawal and Musk will be ""an incredible team."" 
NERVOUSNESS
Musk's board position ""may lead to some nervousness about Mr. Musk getting too much influence about the way Twitter is run, with a view to bolstering his own personal brand and that of his companies,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, has made a number of announcements to his over 80 million followers on the social media platform. 
""Our day-to-day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees,"" a Twitter spokesperson said. 

His board term expires at Twitter's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, the company said. 
Musk's new role as a board member at Twitter could be a further distraction from work at Tesla. He is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and tunneling venture the Boring Company. He said in January that Tesla would not launch a $25,000 electric car, saying, ""We have ... too much on our plate, frankly.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on global indexes fell on Tuesday while U.S. Treasury yields rose to multi-year highs as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard put investor focus on the possibility of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the central bank to curb inflation.
The U.S. dollar hit its highest in nearly two years.
Brainard said she expects a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.
Separately, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly pointed to the next meeting, scheduled for May 3-4, as a possible start to the balance sheet reduction.
Wednesday brings the release of minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting. The ECB will publish its equivalent minutes on Thursday.
Tech and growth shares led the decline on Wall Street, with higher rates seen as a negative for growth stocks.
""For the rest of this week, the market will be driven by interest rates and it will be driven by the Fed's comments about interest rates,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Investors were also keeping a close watch on developments on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the West preparing to expand sanctions to include a ban on all new investments in Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that Russia must be held accountable over allegations of war atrocities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 280.7 points, or 0.8%, to 34,641.18, the S&P 500 lost 57.52 points, or 1.26%, to 4,525.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 328.39 points, or 2.26%, to 14,204.17.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended up 0.2% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.97%.
In Treasuries, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 13.1 basis points to 2.543%, while the 2-year note yield was up 7.2 basis points at 2.500%, leaving the 2-10 spread at 3.97 basis points after having been negative for the most part since last week.
The dollar index rose as high as 99.526, the highest since late May 2020.
The euro weakened amid concerns about the outcome of the French elections. It was down 0.6% at $1.0901 and matched a low of $1.09 hit on March 14.
The Australian dollar gained, boosted by the prospect of policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Aussie dollar rose 0.4% to US$0.77521, while the New Zealand dollar gained 0.2% to US$0.6937.
Soaring global energy and food prices mean almost 60% of developed economies now have year-on-year inflation above 5%, the largest share since the late 1980s, while it is above 7% in more than half of the developing world.

Oil prices eased Tuesday, partly because of the rising U.S. dollar and increasing COVID-19 cases.
Brent futures fell 89 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $106.64 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.32, or 1.3% to settle at $101.96.

The report comes on the same day as WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar announced his departure, just ahead of the closing of a merger between the AT&T (NYSE:T) unit and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc.
A representative of AT&T did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Earlier in the day, Variety reported that Andy Forssell, HBO Max executive vice president and general manager, is leaving the company.
Sarnoff joined WarnerMedia in 2019 and oversaw HBO and HBO Max, the Warner Bros studio, cable channels and the consumer products division. Forssell, who reports to Kilar, also joined the firm in 2019.
AT&T on Feb. 1 agreed to spin off WarnerMedia in a $43 billion transaction to merge its media properties with Discovery. Shareholders of Discovery and the U.S. Department of Justice have cleared the deal.
Discovery CEO David Zaslav will lead the merged entity, AT&T had said earlier.

The automaker said the move will be made gradually, starting in December and due for completion in November 2023.

The move by the agency, which had already pulled its authorization for the sotrovimab therapy in much of the U.S. northeast last month, sent shares in Vir Biotechnology 11.5% lower.
The highly contagious BA.2 coronavirus sub-variant is estimated to make up about three of every four COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the latest government data.
GlaxoSmithKline and Vir have said treatment with sotrovimab retains neutralizing activity against the BA.2 sub-variant, but others, including researchers from Columbia University, disagree.
Vir Biotechnology in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the two companies were preparing a package of data to support the use of a higher dose of sotrovimab for the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant, which will be shared with regulators globally, reiterating the companies' plan from last month.
Vir still expects to recognize about $1.1 billion in collaboration revenue when sotrovimab doses are delivered in the first half of 2022.

The companies also plan to submit an application for full approval of the drug in the second half of the year, and expect to start two late-stage trials in the second quarter to assess whether sotrovimab can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised patients, Vir said.
GSK spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer said the company will continue to work with governments and health systems, and ensure ongoing access to sotrovimab.

Gonzalez will continue to serve as an adviser until she leaves the company on May 20, the filing said.
Gonzalez had reported to former CEO Kevin Johnson, who said in March he would retire as the coffee chain faces a growing unionization drive at some of its U.S. locations.
Returning to the CEO position for the third time, Schultz on Monday suspended billions of dollars of planned share buybacks, saying he could put the cash toward employees, stores and customers.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares closed down 4.5% at $84.12 after falling more than 3% on Monday.

(NYSE:SAVE) confirmed media reports it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) for $33 per share, making the total bid value approximately $3.6 billion (all-cash transaction). This price offer represents a roughly 40% premium to  Frontier Group Holdings  Inc's (NASDAQ:ULCC) cash and share offer for Spirit in early February, with an implied value of approximately $23 a share at current prices. Following the news, Spirit's shares rose more than 22% today before being halted, while JetBlue closed around 7% lower.
According to the industry analysts, the Spirit and Frontier merger, which was expected to bring about $1 billion in annual savings for consumers and make the combined company the nation's fifth-largest airline by market share, makes sense due to the overlapping business models and different regional strengths of the companies. In a Spirit and JetBlue merger, the analysts see less of a clear fit, given that both airlines are heavily concentrated in the Eastern US. Furthermore, Spirit keeps costs and fares low by charging extra for add-ons, while JetBlue, the sixth-largest airline in the US, offers more premium options and free in-flight perks.
While the board of directors of Spirit has not made a decision yet on which deal to pursue, it will review JetBlue's bid.
Either deal has the potential to face scrutiny from the Biden administration. Several progressive lawmakers expressed misgivings about the Frontier and Spirit merger during the last month, with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont warning about the risks related to ticket prices increases and lower customer service if the deal goes through."

Focus on the Fed will continue on Wednesday, when the central bank releases minutes of its March meeting.
“For the rest of this week, the market will be driven by interest rates and it will be driven by the Fed’s comments about interest rates,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Investors also remain focused on the Ukraine crisis, which has led to rising commodity prices that stand to worsen an already-worrisome inflationary picture.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase on Tuesday started to allow holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies to cancel them, two sources familiar with the matter said, giving some investors a way to liquidate what have largely been frozen holdings.
The move comes after the London Stock Exchange (LSE) halted trading in the depositary receipts of Russian companies roughly a month ago after prices plunged due to a slew of Western sanctions slapped on Russia for its invasion of the Ukraine. 
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.
The sources did not want to be identified because the information was private.
JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, is the issuer of a handful of depositary receipts in Russian companies listed on the LSE, such as oil major Rosneft, according to Refinitiv.
Investors in depositary receipts have the right to cancel them, but issuers suspended cancellations after the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring local Russian shares. With those restrictions recently lifted, issuers are able to reopen cancellations.

JPMorgan is the second depositary receipt issuer to reopen cancellations after BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) started offering clients an option to withdraw from the receipts and receive in turn the underlying shares in Moscow for a fee last week.
Last week, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said the country was mulling forcing Russian companies whose depositary receipts are traded abroad to return to the domestic market.

Investing.com --  Spirit Airlines  Inc (NYSE:SAVE) shares surged in the final 30 minutes of trading on Tuesday after a report from the New York Times said fellow carrier JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) has launched a bid for the company.
The report, citing three people with knowledge of the matter, said JetBlue has made a $3.6 billion offer to acquire the budget carrier. 
A potential deal could spoil Spirit's planned merger with fellow budget airline  Frontier Group Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:ULCC). At the time, Frontier said the combination with Spirit would see the combined company ""accelerate investment in innovation and growth and compete even more aggressively, especially against the dominant “Big Four” airlines, among others.""
However, the supposed bid from JetBlue will see it pay $33 per share in cash, an approximately 40% premium to Frontier's cash and share offer for Spirit.
The NY Times said Spirit's board has yet to make a decision on which deal to pursue but plans to review JetBlue's bid in detail.

Investing.com -- The Dow slipped Tuesday, as tech was pressured by surging U.S. government bond yields after Federal Reserve officials continued to talk up the prospect of aggressive monetary policy in upcoming meetings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, or 280 points, the S&P 500 fell 1.2%, and the Nasdaq slumped 2.3%.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who is awaiting a confirmation vote to take the reins as Fed vice chair, said the Fed is “prepared to take stronger action, if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”
Brainaird also said the Fed could start to “reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.”
The hawkish remarks come ahead of the release of the Fed’s meetings from its March meeting expected to reveal more about the central bank’s plan to begin balance sheeting reduction.
Treasury yields jumped sharply, with the 10-year yield rising above 2.5% rising to a nearly three year high to growth sectors of the market including tech.
Big tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) excluded, was in the red. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), were down more than 1%, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), however, bucked the trend lower, adding to its gains from a day earlier after the social media company announced that Elon Musk would join its board.
Consumer discretionary stocks also dragged the broader market lower as weakness in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and casino stocks including Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (NYSE:LVS) offset gains in cruise stocks.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) was up 1% and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) rose more than 2% after the latter reported record one-day bookings, stoking investor optimism about the return of demand for cruises following a pandemic-fueled lull.
Energy stocks were on back foot as oil prices gave up gains even as the European Union detailed plans to impose new sanctions on Russian oil imports.
“If this [an EU embargo on Russia oil] were to happen, demand would switch to an even greater extent to other sources of supply, which would result in considerable price rises,” Commerzbank said in a note.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) led the sector to the downside.
Utilities and consumer staples, defensives sectors of the market, bucked the trend lower, to end the day in the green.  
On the economic front, services activity in March slightly missed forecasts, though economists continue to expect the sector to rebound as the reopening gathers pace. 
""Demand for services remains robust, and we expect that this will continue through the Spring and into the Summer at a minimum,"" Jefferies said in a note.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Major online platforms face a yearly fee up to 0.1% of annual net income to cover the costs of monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring them to do more to police their content, an EU document shows.
The Digital Services Act (DSA) rules are likely to be agreed between EU countries and lawmakers later this month. Levying such a fee would be a first for the European Commission, which is the bloc's executive body.
The move comes as the Commission seeks new sources of revenue to fire up the region's economic growth in the wake of the pandemic and also foster a greener and more digital economy. It would need scores of experts to enforce the new tech rules.
""The overall amount of the annual supervisory fees shall be based on the estimated costs the Commission incurs in relation to its supervisory tasks under this Regulation,"" said the document, which was seen by Reuters.
""The fee shall not exceed 0.1% of the global annual net income of the provider of very large online platforms (or very large search engine) in the preceding financial year.""
The fee should be proportionate to the size of the service as reflected by the number of its recipients in the EU, it added. The Commission defines very large online platforms subject to the DSA as those with 45 million or more monthly active users.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told lawmakers and member states last month that the fee could raise between 20 million euros ($22 million) and 30 million euros annually, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Not-for-profit providers of very large online platforms and very large online search engines will be exempt from the fees, the document said, a move that will benefit companies such as Wikipedia and research bodies.
Vestager's proposal is likely to get the nod from member states and EU lawmakers, which are scheduled to meet on April 22 for the fourth round of negotiations and widely expected to result in a deal.
""We believe it is possible, we see progress,"" EU lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, who is steering the DSA in the European Parliament, told Reuters.
The Commission declined to comment on the negotiations.
Commission sources said a comparison could be made with national telecoms regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority which impose fees on entities under their supervision.

""We want the implementation of the DSA to be a success, and support supervisory fees that are proportionate, backed by a detailed methodology, and commensurate with industry standards,"" Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said.

Investing.com – Stocks fell on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve official hinted at more aggressive tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check in the months ahead.
Lael Brainard, who is awaiting confirmation as Fed Vice Chair, said getting inflation down was a top goal of the central bank, which could start to reduce the size of its balance sheet by May and shrink rapidly.
Those words were enough to send tech stocks tumbling, with the Nasdaq down more than 2% in late trading.
But the world will be watching for the words the Fed officials shared during their meeting last month for guidance on what the Fed plans to do next. Those words, in the minutes of the meeting, come out on Wednesday.
Investors are also bracing for a fresh round of sanctions on Russia to be announced this week, which could take aim at the financial and energy sectors, after reports of atrocities on Ukraine civilians.
Meanwhile, the markets are awaiting the next batch of earnings, which start pouring out later this month. With war in the Ukraine creating more uncertainty by the day, energy prices remain elevated and investors will be eager to hear what corporate executives say about costs and labor trends.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Awaiting Fed minutes
Market participants will be keeping a close eye on the FOMC March meeting minutes, which will be released Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET. Traders will be examining monetary policymaker's thoughts on the future interest rate hike path and any comments on tapering.
2. Inventories
The Energy Information Administration's crude oil inventories data, which measures the weekly change in the number of barrels of commercial crude oil held by U.S. firms, will be released tomorrow at 10:30 AM ET. Analysts forecast a draw of 2.056 million, above the previous draw of 3.449 million barrels.
3. Energy execs testify
The House Energy and Commerce committee invited a bunch of oil company executives, from  BP  PLC (LON:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and others, to answer their questions about high gas prices and the industry’s role in pricing markets.

""Even if the government is not actively supporting the environmental agenda, we are maintaining our investment plans with private companies emphasizing that this is important for them to be more resilient to the effects of climate change,"" Martin Spicer, IFC's director for Latin America and the Caribbean, told Reuters.
Spicer's comments highlight the investment group's willingness to keep sustainability as its main guideline for investments in the country. About 60% of the nearly $2.8 billion invested annually by the group in the region have this condition.
In addition to ongoing investments in renewable energy projects, IFC sees opportunities for it to participate in sanitation-related projects in the country after a new framework for the sector was approved, according to the executive.
Besides the environmental agenda, IFC, which is part of the World Bank Group, has also discussed investing in more basic education projects using technology and health, especially for emerging businesses.

In March, the group signed a $150 million loan to Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil to finance small businesses in the health sector in the country.
""Investing in venture capital is part of our business,"" Spicer said, adding that the effects of the pandemic in Latin America have opened up a number of new opportunities to support companies with high growth potential in such areas.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday they will develop a series of lower-priced electric vehicles based on a new joint platform, producing potentially millions of cars from 2027 in a bid to beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in sales.
The announcement expands on plans for GM to begin building two electric SUVs for Honda starting in 2024 - the Honda Prologue and an Acura model.
The automakers said the new deal is for ""affordable"" EVs, including compact crossover vehicles, built using GM's Ultium battery technology. The compact crossover is the biggest selling auto sector in the world with annual volumes of more than 13 million vehicles, the companies said.
The companies declined to say how much they are investing as part of the new collaboration.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Tuesday at an Axios event the pricing will come in below the $30,000 price tag planned for the electric Chevrolet Equinox SUV. She said the new lower-priced vehicles would be ""attainable EVs.""
She said the new vehicle is part of GM's plan to surpass Tesla in EV sales.
""We have a very important goal... that by mid-decade, by 2025, we'll sell more EVs in the U.S. than anyone else and to do that, you need to have a portfolio of vehicles,"" Barra said, noting GM plans a wide range of small to large EVs. ""We definitely can scale and can do it quickly.""
The companies said they will also discuss future battery technology collaboration for electric vehicles in a push to drive down costs.
The deal is part of GM's push to achieve carbon neutrality in its global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles in the United States by 2035. 
Honda has said it aims to reach carbon neutrality on a global basis by 2050.

The Japanese carmaker owns a stake in GM's Cruise self-driving car subsidiary and the carmakers are co-developing the Cruise Origin autonomous EV. The companies also have a joint venture to develop and produce hydrogen fuel-cell systems at a plant in Brownstown, Michigan.
""Honda and GM will build on our successful technology collaboration to help achieve a dramatic expansion in the sales of electric vehicles,"" Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on Tuesday said it has sanctioned KPMG LLP's former vice chair of audit for his role in a high-profile scandal involving leaked information from the accounting industry oversight body.
The PCAOB fined Scott Marcello $100,000, its largest ever penalty against an individual, for failing to reasonably supervise KPMG personnel who engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain and use confidential PCAOB information. The settlement marked the first time the PCAOB has imposed sanctions for ""failure reasonably to supervise,"" the board said in a statement.
PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said the ""first of its kind"" disciplinary action was a sign of the board's commitment to sanctioning top-level personnel at the largest firms.
During Marcello's tenure as KPMG's vice chair of audit from July 2015 until April 2017, several of his subordinates obtained confidential lists of upcoming audits, which they used to help pass the firm PCAOB inspections. Marcello failed to take appropriate action after learning about the leak in early 2016, the board said.
Marcello could not be reached immediately for comment. KPMG fired Marcello and five employees involved in the scheme in 2017. The Justice Department later charged the five employees.
A spokesperson said the KPMG is a ""stronger firm as a result of the actions taken since 2017 to strengthen our culture, our governance and our compliance program"".
KPMG, one of the Big Four accounting firms, paid a $50-million civil penalty in 2019 to the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the leak and other misconduct that agency's enforcement director at the time described as ""astonishing"" in its breadth and seriousness.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. authorities on Tuesday announced criminal and civil charges against the former head of a now-defunct British company for making a fraudulent bid to buy U.S. aerospace and defense company  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) for about $13.8 billion.
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Melville ten Cate and his London-based Xcalibur Aerospace Ltd were never in a position to complete a tender offer for Textron, including because they lacked financing.
Prosecutors said ten Cate, 53, a dual U.S.-Dutch citizen now living in Dubai, is at large. He could not immediately be reached for comment.
The defendant was accused of making overtures to Textron over nearly two years before placing a Nov. 9, 2020 advertisement in the New York Times - which he never paid for -offering to buy Textron shares at $60.50 each, a 56% premium.
According to the SEC, ten Cate falsely claimed on Xcalibur's website to have lined up $11 billion in financing, and in an interview with the regulator's staff lied about the financing and his company's ability to complete the tender offer.
Xcalibur claimed to have produce high-speed unmanned aircraft systems.
Shares of Textron rose as much 15.9% after the tender offer, which the Providence, Rhode Island-based maker of Beechcraft and Cessna business jets dismissed as ""fictitious."" Textron reported having 228.9 million shares at the time.
The Justice Department separately accused ten Cate of trying to defraud banks and investors out of $500 million by inflating Xcalibur's financials and prospects, and saying the company had nearly 9.8 billion British pounds ($12.8 billion) in cash.
""Fraudsters talk big and hope no one looks too closely at the bottom line,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan said in a statement.
The Justice Department charged ten Cate with tender offer fraud, securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.

The SEC filed related civil charges and is seeking a fine. Both cases were filed in Manhattan federal court.
A British court put Xcalibur into liquidation last July, the U.S. authorities said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian Economy Ministry official Caio Mario Paes de Andrade has emerged as a strong candidate to lead state-run oil company Petrobras, after energy consultant Adriano Pires declined the government's nomination, a government official told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The source, who requested anonymity to comment on private discussions, said Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has avoided participating actively in the selection process, but he supports the nomination of Paes de Andrade given his defense of a smaller and more efficient public sector. Guedes has long called for the privatization of Petrobras.
Paes de Andrade and the Economy Ministry declined to comment on the matter. 
The Mines and Energy Ministry said it was evaluating new candidates to lead Petrobras.
""At the moment we are looking at profiles, not names,"" Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque told Reuters, without saying whether Paes de Andrade was in the running for the position.
Paes de Andrade, who holds a master's degree from Duke University and currently advises Guedes on digital governance, had been considered for the job even before Pires was tapped to be chief executive, according to a second government source.
Pires backed out of the nomination on Monday, saying it was clear he could not reconcile his consulting work with running the oil company, known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
Pires had been tapped by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to take over as the top executive of Petrobras on March 28, following disagreements between the far-right leader and current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna over the company's fuel pricing policy.
Newspaper O Globo first published on Tuesday that Paes de Andrade had become a likely candidate for Petrobras CEO. Valor Economico and O Estado de S.Paulo also reported that Paes de Andrade was in the running.
According to the O Globo report, which did not cite specific sources, several ministers are now backing Paes de Andrade for the job and he has already been interviewed by Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque.
Asked on Monday about who could be chosen for the job after Pires declined, Guedes said he had ""no light"" to shine on the matter. 

Petrobras said in a securities filing late on Monday that it had not yet received any information from the Mines and Energy Ministry on who could replace Pires.
Petrobras shares were little changed in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo, slipping 0.1% as the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1.2%.

Generali had asked IVASS in February whether a 16.3% combined stake acquired by two of its main investors, Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, and a third smaller shareholder Fondazione CRT, would have required prior authorisation.
Generali declined to comment on the IVASS decision.
Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle that has cast doubts on the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, whose term ends in April and is backed by the largest investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and the outgoing board. 
The three investors had struck a consultation pact last year to challenge Mediobanca over the renewal of Generali's board.
Caltagirone quit the pact in January, to prevent, sources said at that time, regulatory scrutiny on whether the alliance was indeed a consultation pact or represented a more substantial concert party which could have seen its voting power curtailed.

Del Vecchio and CRT dissolved the pact last week. Caltagirone has put forward an alternative candidate for the role of CEO in a challenge to Donnet's reappointment.
As part of its ordinary supervisory activities, IVASS continues to closely monitor events regarding the company's shareholding structure, and it reserves the right to take steps if needed, it said in a statement.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc has secured rocket launches with three companies, the company said on Monday, as it spends billions on putting together a satellite constellation to beam broadband internet that will rival Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink.
The e-commerce giant said its Project Kuiper has secured 83 launches over five years and includes a deal with Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and chairman Jeff Bezos. 
The race to beam broadband internet using thousands of satellites in low earth orbit is heating up, with SpaceX so far gaining advantage over other players. Project Kuiper plans to launch its first two prototype satellites by year's end. 
""Amazon is investing billions of dollars across the three agreements. Together, it is the largest commercial procurement of launch vehicles in history,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters.
The contract includes 18 launches with Arianespace's Ariane 6 rockets, 12 launches with Blue Origin's New Glenn - with an option to add up to 15 more - and 38 launches with the Vulcan Centaur rocket made by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
Together, they will provide capacity for the company to deploy the majority of its satellite constellation, the company said.
The deals are betting on three heavy-lift rockets that have yet to fly and whose development has been delayed. Arianespace’s Ariane 6, under development, could launch up to 40 Kuiper satellites each mission, said the company’s chief executive Stéphane Israël. 
Also under development, Blue Origin’s New Glenn will carry 61 Kuiper satellites while ULA’s Vulcan will carry 45, the companies’ CEOs said Tuesday at a conference in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Dave Limp, head of Amazon’s devices unit, said the company “wanted diversity in our launch partnerships,” which includes previously announced deals with ULA and rocket startup ABL Space.
""It's the largest contract ever signed by Arianespace in its history,"" ArianeGroup CEO André-Hubert Roussel told Reuters, declining to provide financial details. ""It's the result of two years and half of talks with them,"" he said, adding that the launches would take place between 2024 and 2027.
Project Kuiper aims to use over 3,000 satellites in low earth orbit to beam high-speed, low-latency internet to customers, including households, businesses and government agencies.

Securing launch capacity from multiple providers reduces risks associated with launch vehicle stand-downs and saves costs that can be passed on to customers, said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper.
Blue Origin's BE-4 engine, which will also power the Vulcan rocket, has faced multiple delays.

The iPhone maker is expected to provide updates on new software, including the iOS 16, at the conference. 
Prior to 2020, Apple hosted the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, with thousands of developers and Apple employees in attendance. The event was moved completely online for the first time in June 2020 due to the pandemic. It was held in an online-only format last year too.

This year, however, the company said it will host developers and students at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California on June 6 to watch the keynote and State of the Union videos along with the online attendees.
Apple released its low-cost version of iPhone SE with 5G capabilities at its annual spring product launch event last month.

82,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 01:32PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Thousands of auto workers have been furloughed and food prices are soaring as Western sanctions pummel the small Russian city of Kaluga and its flagship foreign carmakers, with more sanctions likely to come. 
The Kaluga region, 190 kilometres (120 miles) southwest of Moscow, says it has attracted more than 1.3 trillion roubles ($15 billion) in investment, mostly foreign, since 2006.
But Western sanctions imposed in recent weeks after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine have exacerbated lingering component shortages and halted production at two flagship car plants, Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Sweden's Volvo. 
A third, the PSMA Rus plant that is a joint venture between Stellantis and Mitsubishi and employs 2,000, may halt production soon due to a lack of parts, Stellantis' chief executive said last Thursday. 
""It is not clear what will happen. They don't give us any concrete information,"" said Pavel Terpugov, a welder at the PSMA Rus plant. 
Terpugov said he needs twice as much money to buy groceries than before the sanctions. Analysts have forecast Russian inflation could soar to 24% this year, while the economy may shrink to 2009 levels.
The United States and Europe are weighing more sanctions against Russia after Ukraine accused Russian forces of civilian killings in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave was found in Bucha, outside Kyiv.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" and the Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha.
One source of hope for some in Kaluga, with its 325,000 residents, is the West may be reluctant to hurt its own companies. 
""Does it make sense to impose sanctions on its own plant and lose money?"" said Valery Uglov, an auto mechanic at the Volkswagen plant. ""Does it make sense to lose the Russian market?"" 
""We hope to return to work as soon as possible and everyone will have confidence in the future again,"" Uglov said.
Volkswagen, whose factory employs 4,200 people, in early March suspended operations. A spokeswoman said production remained frozen.
Volvo Group, which employs over 600 people to build trucks, also suspended production.
Even before the sanctions, Russian car sales had contracted from 2.8 million units from when the Volkswagen factory opened in 2007 to 1.67 million units last year, damaged by both sanctions after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Some factories cut output last year due to disruptions caused by the pandemic.
""We have had similar furloughs at the factory... but now, of course, the situation is different, more serious,"" said Alexander Netesov, a warehouse foreman at the Volkswagen plant. ""But we are waiting anyway, we are not losing hope,"" he said. 

In a sign of the squeeze workers are feeling, Netesov said a new Polo car he ordered with a factory discount had increased in price by 20% since his pre-order.
Others in the city, which also boasts production by pharmaceutical and food companies as well as Samsung (KS:005930) televisions, derive optimism from the fact that almost every crisis that has ravaged the Russian economy over the past two decades has been followed by a boom. ""I hope, we all hope, that in the near future everything will stabilize,"" said Angelina Minnigulova, a marketing executive at Volkswagen dealer KorsGroup, which has seen a fall in demand as car prices soar.

FROB said on Tuesday it had bought a 4.24% stake in Sareb, set up in 2012 to take on bad loans after the financial crisis, to raise its holding to 50.14%. No price was given but several sources with knowledge of the matter said it was merely symbolic.
The move comes after the government in January approved a legal framework allowing FROB to surpass the 50% threshold in Sareb following the EU order.
FROB didn't say which banks had sold their stakes but a source at Sareb said some smaller holders, such as Bankinter, had tendered their stakes. Bankinter declined comment.
Santander (MC:SAN) remains the biggest private shareholder with a 22.2% stake, followed by Caixabank with 12.2%.

Several Spanish banks have been planning to sell their stakes in Sareb, which has struggled since its creation as a slump in real estate prices has depressed the value of loans and assets, but most had retained their holdings for tax reasons.
After selling 17.1 billion euros of all debt issued, Sareb still holds 33.7 billion euros in senior debt.

The investment cements a ""very strategic, very deep partnership that we want between the two groups,"" Farfetch CEO José Neves told Reuters in an interview, noting it was the largest deal for the online retailer in the U.S.
The move comes as luxury groups rush to meet strong demand for high end fashion and accessories in the U.S., which emerged as the key market for the sector last year, boosted by a quick rebound in local consumption.
Under the partnership, Farfetch will power the website and mobile application of Bergdorf Goodman, the New York-based luxury department store that Neiman Marcus acquired in 1972.
Both Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus will join Farfetch's online marketplace, adding brands in key markets globally, the companies said.
The expansion of Bergdorf Goodman's ecommerce business into markets abroad could take place in a ""matter of months,"" once the store's platform is outfitted with services from Farfetch, said Geoffroy van Raemdonck, CEO of Neiman Marcus Group.
The deal is a ""strategic opportunity for Farfetch to stand out among service providers and to benefit from the strength of the local US customers,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein, noting the move represented consolidation of the sector with Farfetch benefitting from sales assistant tools developed by Neiman Marcus. 

Farfetch joins Neiman Marcus' existing investors, which include PIMCO, Davidson Kempner Capital Management and Sixth Street.
Neiman Marcus, which was forced to file for bankruptcy in the wake of the pandemic, has had brisk sales this spring, noted van Raemdonck.

The news sent shares of Carnival up nearly 4% in afternoon trading. The stock traded up more than 8% earlier in the session on the New York Stock Exchange. The news also earlier lifted rivals  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings.
Carnival said in a news release that the week of March 28-April 3 showed a double-digit increase from the previous record 7-day booking total.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)removed its COVID-19 notice against cruise travel on March 30, roughly two years after introducing a warning scale showing the level of coronavirus transmission risk on cruise ships.
Miami-based Carnival said 22 of its 23 ships are now back in operation at its U.S. ports.

Cruise operators said the health agency was discriminating against the industry, when hotels and airlines could operate with limited or no restrictions.
In the wake of the Ukraine conflict, Carnival has already modified its trips to avoid stopping at Russian ports in the summer, and will also withdraw from any halts in the country for the remainder of the year.

Investing.com – Acuity Brands stock (NYSE:AYI) plunged 9% Tuesday after the lighting products maker cited cost increases and shortages of raw materials as major challenges.
The company uses steel and aluminum to make its products, and prices of both of those materials have climbed to record highs in recent times in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A shortage of microchips is another worry for the company.
The company has also decided not to apply recent price increases to its backlog, honoring original agreements, according to MarketWatch.com. This is even as margins eroded in the second quarter.
CEO Neil Ashe told analysts in a conference call the company's backlog rose slightly from last quarter. He said transportation costs should ease, assuming upcoming talks with labor at the West Coast ports are resolved soon.
Net sales in the second quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 17% year-on-year to top $909 million.

(Reuters) - The European Commission proposed sweeping new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday including banning coal imports and halting trade worth nearly 20 billion euros ($22 billion) in retaliation over possible war crimes in Ukraine.
Here is a rundown of the measures, which must be approved by all 27 European Union states. 
They could be adopted this week.
IMPORT BAN
The proposals include banning imports of coal, wood, cement, liquors and seafood worth about 9.5 billion euros ($10.4 billion) a year, according to the European Commission. A source said the restrictions would also hit caviar, vodka, rubber and chemicals.
Coal alone is worth 4 billion euros a year, the Commission said. As a comparison, the EU imported about 100 billion euros of oil and gas from Russia last year. The Commission said it was working on possible sanction on oil, as well. 
EXPORT BAN
Brussels is proposing a ban on exports to Russia worth another 10 billion euros a year, including of advanced semiconductors, quantum computers, and other electrical and transport equipment. The export of technology for liquefied natural gas (LNG) would also be banned, according to a source.
SHIPPING
Russian vessels and trucks would be prevented from accessing the EU, further crippling trade. Energy products, food and medicines would be exempted, meaning for example that LNG cargoes from Russia would not be affected.
Applying the sanctions may be complicated, officials have repeatedly said because it is not always easy to identify the origin of a cargo ship.
The new sanctions would effectively halt transport of goods by road and sea. The EU has already banned air traffic with Russia.
RUSSIAN BANKS
The commission also proposed banning all transactions with VTB and another three Russian banks which have already been excluded from the SWIFT messaging system.
INDIVIDUALS
Thirty six more individuals, including oligarchs and politicians, will be added to the EU's sanctions list, according to an EU source. The existing sanctions list already comprises hundreds. In addition to this, separatist leaders would also be added.

COMPANIES
The Commission also proposed a ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement in the EU and the exclusion of all financial support to Russian public bodies.

(Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday as investors awaited a batch of fresh sanctions on Moscow, while France's blue-chip index slumped after opinion polls for presidential elections due later this month tightened.
French markets woke up to the risk of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's elections against Emmanuel Macron after Le Pen captured 48.5% of voter intentions in a poll on Monday - the highest she has ever notched.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.2%, paring back some gains made earlier in the day, while France's benchmark CAC 40 index lost 1.3% to clock its worst day in nearly a month.
""A victory for Le Pen would worsen public finances and place a question mark over France's place in Europe, unnerving investors,"" said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.
""At best, (Le Pen) would undermine and frustrate European policymaking and at worst, seek to dismantle EU structures from the inside... If polls continue to move in her favour, investors are likely to become much more concerned,"" Hinds said.
The spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds – the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt – rose to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the COVID-19 crash of 2020.

""With the pending transaction with Discovery nearing close, now is the right time to share with each of you that I will be departing this amazing company,"" Kilar said in the memo to employees on Tuesday. The merger is expected to close this month. 
Kilar took over as head of WarnerMedia in April 2020, just before the launch of the HBO Max streaming service. He oversaw a sweeping restructuring of the company that summer, focusing it on the streaming service and installing new leadership. 
A veteran tech executive who had worked at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and was the first CEO of the Hulu streaming service, Kilar broke with industry norms in 2021 with a decision to release new movies simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.
That announcement blindsided the talent community, with Christopher Nolan telling one industry trade publication that he and other filmmakers ""went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.""

The decision, however, provided a flow of fresh content to the fledgling streaming service and helped accelerate its growth. HBO Max and the HBO television network now boast 73.8 million subscribers.
""We've elevated technology, product, and design to the highest levels in the company,"" Kilar wrote in his memo. ""We're operating as one team, proudly and successfully going direct to consumers across the globe. It has been deeply gratifying to lean into the future alongside each of you and to do so with conviction.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter criticised the Canadian government's proposed bank tax in prepared remarks to shareholders on Tuesday, calling them a ""knee-jerk reaction that sends the wrong message to the global investment community.""
Porter said the proposed tax on banks' profits would ultimately affect shareholders, including pensioners and retail investors.
Canada's third-largest lender emailed Porter's speech to media after a positive COVID-19 test kept him from attending the meeting. Chief Financial Officer Raj Viswanathan read an abridged version during the bank's first in-person shareholders' meeting since the pandemic.
The Canadian Liberal party's plan to raise corporate taxes on the country's most profitable banks and insurers, announced as a campaign pledge in September, became more likely after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed a surprise deal with the left-leaning opposition New Democratic Party last month.
Most banks have been critical of Trudeau's plan to raise additional taxes.
Porter also criticized Canada's lagging private sector investments in research and development, which ""are where they were 20 years ago,"" and productivity challenges that existed even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and to warn that a shortage of workers poses a ""serious problem"" for the country's prosperity. 
""The key point here is that we need more investment, more innovation, and more skilled labour if we are going to overcome sluggish growth,"" Porter added.
He proposed the creation of a federal commission to help address these issues.

Scotiabank's board chair and CFO said at the meeting that Porter had tested positive for COVID-19, explaining his absence from the event. 
""The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and, as a result Brian is fully isolating,"" Viswanathan said at the event. ""Thankfully he has been triple vaccinated and we expect a full and quick recovery.""

""It's unacceptable and what I really don't understand is that you could want this and that people think this is okay,"" Sigrid Kaag said in an interview with Dutch broadcaster RTL after the publication of the airline's annual report.
This showed that Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith would receive several million euros in pay, benefits and annual and long-term bonuses in 2021, although the bonuses will be deferred.
A spokesperson for Air France said that Smith's fixed pay has been unchanged since before the pandemic and noted that he will not receive any bonuses he has been awarded until Air France has repaid most of the bailout money it received during the pandemic.
Kaag said the Dutch state, which bought a 14.3% stake in Air France-KLM in 2019 in order to exercise more influence over it, would vote against Smith's pay at the annual meeting in May.
The Dutch government agreed a 3.4 billion euro bailout package of loans and loan guarantees for Air France's Dutch subsidiary KLM in 2020, as part of a wider bailout for Air France.
Smith agreed to give up his bonus and a quarter of his salary in 2020 after an outcry over his pay in the Netherlands. 
Air France's annual report showed that Smith was awarded base pay of 900,000 euros in 2021, benefits of 287,000 euros, an annual bonus of 1.1 million euros and a long term bonus of 1 million euros. 

However, the bonuses will be deferred, under a decision by the European Commission, until Air France-KLM has repaid 75% of its bailout money.

The new authority, whose creation is set out in a draft bill, will bring together functions previously performed by the Bank of Spain, supervisor CNMV and the Directorate General for Insurance and Pension Funds.
It will take on those bodies' responsibilities in the regulation of financial entities, investment companies, payment companies, and so-called fintechs or providers of cryptoassets.
In Spain, codes of good practice have had mixed success in the past, as in the case of mortgage contracts, where lenders were given room to directly renegotiate terms with clients. Mortgage complaints still account for the lion's share of those filed with the Bank of Spain. 
The independent financial customer ombudsman authority will fall under the umbrella of the Economy Ministry and will be free of charge for financial customers. It will be financed through a fee estimated at 250 euros ($273), levied on the financial firm involved, for each accepted complaint.

No timetable has yet been set for the progress of the draft bill or the creation of the new authority.

Investing.com --  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 4% Tuesday as reports came in that two large buyers have declined options to purchase more of its Covid-19 vaccines, a sign of a waning pandemic bringing down demand.
The African Union and Covax, the World Health Organization-backed group, decided not to obtain more of the vaccine as developing nations struggle to turn supplies into inoculations, Bloomberg reported.
Less than two months ago, the company had forecast higher vaccine sales for the second half of the year, pinning its estimates on Covid-19 becoming a flu-like endemic illness that would lead people to take shots on a regular basis.
While the African Union agreed to purchase 50 million doses for delivery in the first quarter, the body of 55 member states opted not to acquire another 60 million doses in the second quarter, according to the wire agency.
Covax turned down two purchase options - one for 166 million doses in the third quarter and a second for 166 million doses in the fourth.
Moderna said it has signed deals for $21 billion in 2022 vaccine sales, up from $19 billion announced in February.",,,,,

While buybacks typically slow at the end of each quarter ahead of the earnings season, spending by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases as a percentage of market capitalization fell to its lowest since the first quarter of 2017, strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote in a note. The dollar amount of the buybacks was still higher than during the other first quarters “post-crisis,” they said.
Companies also announced fewer plans for future stock buybacks, the strategists said, with announcements as a percentage of market value coming in 50% below the pre-Covid five-year average. 
The trend is a stark reversal from the fourth quarter, when oil and gas producers drove a surge in buybacks, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, although that was before energy prices hit their highest in over a decade. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has driven commodity prices to historic highs, threatening to crimp corporate profit margins. 
BofA strategists also said they saw a greater case for dividends to outpace stock repurchases in 2022 “amid political risks to buybacks, a rising cost of debt (fewer levered buybacks) and elevated valuations versus rising demand for dividend income.”

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday said it is opening a review to ensure all defective batteries produced by LG Energy Solution have been recalled by automakers.
The auto safety agency noted Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler-parent Stellantis, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hyundai Motor have issued recalls since 2020 due to internal failures in high-voltage vehicle batteries that pose fire risks.
NHTSA said the equipment query covers 138,324 vehicles and will communicate with LG ""and other companies that might have purchased the same or similar equipment from LG, notify them of this defect in any vehicles they manufactured, and to ensure thorough safety recalls are conducted where appropriate.""
An LG Energy Solution spokesperson in a statement said the company understands the request by NHTSA is a follow-up procedure, adding, ""LG Energy Solution will fully cooperate with the inquiry."" 
Among recalls cited by the agency were GM's recalls of its Chevrolet Bolt EV that prompted it to halt sales and production of new models in August.
In October, LG Chem Ltd, which owns LG Energy Solution, said it would take a charge of 620 billion won ($510 million) in its third-quarter results in connection with the GM Bolt recall.
NHTSA noted in February that Stellantis recalled 16,741 2017-2018 Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicles after the automaker said hybrid battery packs produced by LG were involved in 12 reports of vehicle fires.

The automaker said it ""has not yet determined whether the battery packs were defective or the root cause of the fires.""
NHTSA also cited a March 16 Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) recall of 351 ID4 vehicles from the 2021 model year over batteries that may contain insufficient soldering points and potentially unreliable connections inside the high voltage battery. VW said vehicles may break down while driving, potentially leading to a crash.

Investing.com – First Solar stock (NASDAQ:FSLR) traded 3.6% lower Tuesday after BofA Securities downgraded it to ‘underperform’ and cut the target to $65.50, around 23% lower than its current level of $81.51.
Analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith was earlier ‘neutral’ on the stock with a target of $76.5.
According to StreetInsider, the analyst believes that too much “good” news is priced into the shares, making them “susceptible to significant derating”.
The U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating alleged circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties by solar manufacturers in Asia. While one would expect any punitive measure by the Department to be a tailwind for the company, the analyst believes the policy has consistently failed to drive pricing power.
“We highlight still rising aluminum costs, and pass through on elevated bunkers as yet to materialize on freight in particular,” the analyst wrote in a client note.
The company last month disappointed with its fourth-quarter numbers.
October-December net sales rose 50% to $0.9 billion but were still short of estimates. Full-year sales were $2.9 billion, and the company is now projecting that to fall to at least $2.6 billion in the current year. Sales could be even lower at $2.4 billion, according to the company’s guidance.
The company closed December with a contracted backlog of 26.2 GW.
The company issued a wide range for its 2022 projected operating income, implying a significant fall to $55 million-$155 million in 2022 from $587 million. The company blamed this on production start-up expenses and underutilization of losses related to factory upgrades.
The company is setting up new factories in India and Ohio."

Morgane Boulard, a representative for the CFDT union at Amazon Logistics, told Reuters that 1,200 staffers had joined the walkout since it started on Monday.
At stake is a dispute over an overall annual pay rise. Amazon has offered a 3% rise, while unions say a 5% increase is a minimum. 
Boulard said a group representing several unions had agreed that it would not hold talks on any offer below 5%. 

Five unions - Sud, CFDT, CGT, CAT, CFE-CGC, have called for the strike. Unions and management are due to meet again on April 14, Boulard added.
""Within the framework of annual salary negotiations, we proposed wage increases that were above the average (increase) of the Transport and Logistics branch as well as other advantages, and these issues are still being discussed,"" Amazon France said in a statement.

107,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has blocked the Russian government from paying owners of its sovereign debt from reserves held at U.S. banks, raising the spectre of default unless Russia can find other sources of cash or a workaround within 30 days.
Russia has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far, despite unprecedented Western sanctions imposed after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But the task just became a lot tougher as Washington tries to up the pressure.
WHAT DID THE U.S. TREASURY SAY? 
Russia was due to pay $552.4 million on a maturing bond on Monday as well as an $84 million coupon payment on Monday on a 2042 sovereign bond.
The U.S. Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use foreign currency reserves held by its central bank at U.S. financial institutions to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a ""case-by-case basis.""
But, as of Monday, the U.S. Treasury said it would ""not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at U.S. financial institutions."" 
""Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" a spokesperson added. 
Roughly half of the $640 billion in Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves has been frozen by the United States and its allies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""
WHAT HAS CHANGED? 
The U.S. Treasury said the size of the payment due on Monday - the largest due on sovereign debt since the Feb. 24 invasion - had presented ""the right opportunity to force Russia into more difficult decisions.""
However, there was no suggestion U.S. banks might be banned from acting as correspondent banks - or processing any Russian debt payments. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been processing the recent debt coupon payments as a correspondent bank.
Russia may already have been using funds from the half of its reserves that have not been frozen by sanctions, and it could still turn to those resources to avoid default. 
It also still receives billions of dollars from exporting crude and gas. Analysing tanker traffic data, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates Russia's March oil export earnings will total $12.3 billion - up sharply on March 2021.
Moscow said on Monday it expected higher oil prices will boost its April revenue from energy sales by 798.4 billion roubles ($9.6 billion). 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?
The bonds have 30 day grace periods, meaning Russia still has time to pay before default is triggered. 
Russia's willingness to pay means - so far - it has swerved its first default of any kind since a 1998 financial crisis, and its first on international market debt since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
Russia has also been working on managing its external liabilities - last week it bought back about three-quarters of a $2 billion bond payment by paying in roubles just before it matured on Monday. The move was targeted at local rather than international owners though reduced its dollar liabilities. 
But there is another deadline looming: transactions by U.S. persons and entities with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund in relation to debt payments are only allowed under a temporary general licence 9A issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

That licence is due to expire on May 25 and the U.S. Treasury has not commented on whether it will be extended. 
Russia has more payments due on May 27, and has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis, roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.

Tereos, the world's second-largest sugar producer in volume and with large operations in Brazil, has been reshuffling its top management and reviewing its strategy since 2020 when a long-running internal feud led to the ousting of its chairman and CEO.
De Mot, a 58-year old Belgian, was previously interim manager in charge of transformation at airport services group Swissport. He also held board member and executive positions in the maintenance services, minerals production and packaging industries.
It is the first time that Tereos has appointed a non-French to lead the cooperative, the group's spokeswoman said. De Mot will start on April 7.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their Easter getaways disrupted or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand as pandemic restrictions are eased in Europe.
High rates of COVID-19 in Britain have caused staff absences for airlines and airports that were already struggling to recruit after workers deserted the industry during the pandemic. 
Low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) was one of the worst affected, saying it cancelled around 60 UK flights on Tuesday and expected to pull a similar number in the coming days. It cancelled more than 200 at the weekend and another 62 on Monday. 
Paul Charles, head of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said it could take at least two or three months to get through a nasty cocktail of staff shortages, COVID illness and a backlog in approving security passes for airport and airline workers. 
""It's ironic that the very desire to get people booking again, post-pandemic, is causing more difficult transport issues than those created by COVID itself,"" he said.
EasyJet said it was rostering additional standby crew, but it had cancelled some flights on routes where it runs frequent services so passengers had options to rebook.
British Airways (BA) cancelled 662 flights in the week to Sunday, aviation analytics firm Cirium said, though that includes long-haul flights suspended due to sanctions and restrictions, such as on Russia and COVID-affected parts of Asia respectively. BA declined to provide a figure for cancellations.
The carrier was also hit by another IT failure on Wednesday. The number of flights cancelled due to staff sickness in recent days was in the single digits, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
But delays in government-required checks for new staff were hampering the ramp up of flights into summer, he said, and it had already trimmed its planned increase in services by about 20 flights a day until the end of May.
ON THE GROUND
Staff shortages are a problem on the ground as well as in the air.
Queues at Manchester Airport, Britain's third busiest after London's Heathrow and Gatwick, snaked out of one terminal on Tuesday, and passengers complained of hours waiting at the baggage carousel.
The airport has apologised for the disruption.
""As we continue to recover from the pandemic and passenger numbers grow, security queues may be longer than usual at times,"" it said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Britain's Airport Operators Association said its members were increasing staff as quickly as possible.
But a combination of a tight labour market, delays in the security checks for new and returning staff as well as COVID-related absences could put some airports under strain. 
""This may mean longer queues at peak travel times,"" it said. 
Dublin Airport warned passengers that lengthy queues were likely for weeks as it rebuilds its operation and recruits and trains new security staff. Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier whose passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels last month, has called on the Irish government to use the army to deal with the delays, fearing the impact on the key Easter holiday period.

Germany's biggest airport operator Fraport also warned passengers of Easter delays.
The group, which runs facilities in nine countries and the main airport in Frankfurt, aims to hire 1,000 worker this year and recruited about 300 in January-March, a spokesperson said.

Investing.com – Stocks of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) were trading higher Tuesday after Australia picked the two defense contractors to build and supply missiles to it to counter China.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the two companies will partner a new government-backed firm to domestically build guided weapons for the military. The country currently sources its missiles from the U.S. and other countries.
Australia plans to accelerate the deployment of new long-range missiles.
The report quoted the country’s Defense Minister Peter Dutton as saying that missiles made in the country could also be exported to the U.S.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat from China has prompted several countries to have a re-look at their defense preparedness and forced them to commit much more than they ever did.
Australia has committed to expand the size of its standing military by 30% and build a new submarine base on its east coast that would be able to host visiting U.S. vessels. The country is now a part of two alliances – the Quad and the AUKUS. QUAD includes the U.S., India and Japan while the three-member AUKUS also comprises the U.S. and the U.K."

Analyst Brad Erickson downgraded the online used car retailer from Outperform to Sector Perform, setting a price target of $138, down from $155.
The analyst said in a note that they are ""no longer able to justify the risk/reward as asymmetrically positive for CVNA and thus, downgrade to Sector Perform.""
The analyst added that the company's acquisition of US auction business Adesa ""raises the downside risk from any perceived demand shortfall.""
""Adesa’s upcoming multiyear integration is likely to be challenging. We need more confidence in unit growth necessary to justify the capacity hyper-expansion & cash generation to support the ever-rising b/s leverage and likely future capital raises,"" concluded Erickson."

Peabody, the biggest U.S. coal producer, jumped as much as 7.1% before the start of regular trading in New York. Arch, the second-biggest miner climbed as much as 6.3%, while Consol Energy Inc. gained as much as 8.6% as prices spiked in Europe.
Russia supplied about 18% of global coal exports in 2020, with Europe as the largest buyer. The prospect of restrictions on Russian coal has already upended international energy markets, driving prices to record highs, though in recent weeks they have erased some of those gains. 
However, it may be hard for U.S. suppliers to take advantage of surging international prices, said Ernie Thrasher, chief executive officer of Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC., the biggest U.S. exporter. Miners have already sold most of their output under long-term contracts and have few spare tons to deliver to Europe. Increasing production will be difficult because the long-term prospects for the dirtiest fossil fuel are grim, and producers have had little incentive to invest in new capacity. 
Those issues have been exacerbated by tight labor markets, while supply-chain bottlenecks would make it difficult to deliver additional tons to export terminals, Thrasher said. 
“I don’t see any ability for the industry to expand production,” he said. “It’s like looking at a sweet dessert that you just can’t reach.”
Prices in the U.S. have also been surging, surpassing $100 a ton last week for the first time in 13 years.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, struggling for direction as both the U.S. and Europe ratcheted up the sanctions pressure on Russia. 
On Monday, the U.S. Treasury had confirmed that it will stop Russia from servicing its foreign debt with dollars held in the U.S. banking system, forcing it to draw down reserves at the central bank instead. Earlier Tuesday in Europe, EU leaders proposed their first sanctions on Russian energy, albeit on coal, rather than on the oil and gas exports that bring Russia most of its export earnings. Both measures are relatively modest, incremental steps that reflect still-high levels of reluctance in Europe to accept economic pain as a necessary measure to end the war, even after evidence emerged at the weekend of atrocities committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian civilians.
By 9:45 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126 points, or 0.4% at 35,048 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was up by less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.4%, losing some of the sheen it gained on Monday thanks to Elon Musk's announcement of a stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Twitter stock continued to gain in early dealings, rising 6.4% after the social media giant offered Musk a board seat. 
However, the mood darkened after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard indicated that the Fed may start reducing its balance sheet at its next meeting in May, while Kansas City Fed President Esther George warned that the central bank may have to deliberately slow the economy in order to bring inflation down to a sustainable level. 
Among early movers, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock stood out after the cruise operator said it had had the strongest week for bookings in its entire history. The message also lifted the stock of other cruise operators, who can apparently look forward to a summer of pent-up demand being released after two years of devastation at the hands of Covid-19.
Carnival stock rose 8.5% to its highest in nearly two months, while Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock rose 5.6% and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) stock rose 3.6%.
Leisure-related services in general have appeared to be benefiting from strong tailwinds in recent days, with employment data signaling a strong hiring trend to cope with resurgent demand. That picture was further fleshed out on Tuesday as the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing PMI broke a sequence of three straight drops, rising to 58.3. The employment subindex rose to 54.0 from 48.5, while the prices subindex rose to equal its all-time high of 83.8, a reminder of the inflationary pressures bubbling almost everywhere in the economy at present.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.8% after it flagged what may be the most profitable quarter in its history, the result of oil and gas prices that have skyrocketed as the world economy has reopened in the wake of the pandemic and as sanctions against Russia have forced western nations to chase non-Russian supplies on the open market.",,,,,

Sono said on Tuesday it would produce its first vehicles in Finland with supplier Valmet Automotive, rather than in Sweden as originally envisaged. 
The company had said in 2019 its production partner would be National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), the Swedish electric vehicle unit of Evergrande Group, but a binding agreement was not signed.
NEVS was in talks with venture capital firms late last year to find new owners as its Chinese parent struggled under more than $300 billion of debt.
Sono, founded in 2016 in Munich, is developing a fully-electric vehicle with solar cells integrated into the body, boosting the car's range by an average of 112 kilometres per week beyond the 305-kilometre range of its battery.
Valmet Automotive, whose largest shareholders include China's battery cell manufacturer CATL, also produces cars for Mercedes-Benz and makes battery modules at two plants in Finland, with a third opening in Germany this year.
Sono, which began trading on the NASDAQ in November to try to attract early-stage investors after finding itself on the brink of insolvency, is currently working to validate its mass production plans with vehicles being built in Germany.
It expects to produce a low four-digit volume of cars in its first year, with a view to ramping up to 43,000 a year, it said.
The net price of Sono's vehicle, currently 23,950 euros ($26,271), will rise to 25,126 euros once the company hits 18,500 reservations from the around 17,000 registered so far, it said, citing rising manufacturing costs.

The company aims to keep costs down by offering just one model, relying on third-party production and using off-the-shelf components from suppliers including Vitesco and Hella GmbH, it said in a November regulatory filing.

In the company's first major product launch since Barry McCarthy took charge as chief executive, Peloton said Guide is available for purchase in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia beginning Tuesday.
The Guide, which is available to existing all access members at no cost, has a TV-connected camera that displays workouts and helps users track their movements and is different from the Peloton's other products such as bikes and treads that focus on cardio exercises.
Peloton, a pandemic winner, unveiled the 'Peloton Guide' last year and had fixed a starting price of $495.

The company replaced co-founder John Foley with former tech executive McCarthy in February, amid investor pressure over sagging sales.
Under McCarthy, the company intends to explore various pricing models in select U.S. markets, as it hoped to attract more customers and return to profitability.

Smith estimates that Bitcoin miners made a slightly higher profit in March compared to February as the cryptocurrency's price surge outstripped global hash rate growth.
On the other hand, overall bitcoin mining profitability measured by daily block reward revenue per EH/s is down 46% from the record high it touched in November as a result of a significant jump in global hash rate and a drop in Bitcoin price.
Several publicly-traded miners are generating record revenues as a result of their own hash rate growth outshining the broader market, Smith said.
The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency has recovered in March, averaging $41,800 during the month, 3% higher than in February.
Bitcoins' 7-day rolling average price as of March 31 is almost in line with the price at the start of the year, though it remains down roughly 32% from its November peak. The cryptocurrency's realized daily annualized volatility plunged to 62% in March from 80% in February.
Smith noted the surge in the network hash rate in March as more mining equipment is deployed around the world. The analyst explained that a growing network hash rate bodes well for network security, however, it weighs on miner profitability as it makes the process of solving a block more difficult.
""We estimate the average network hashrate increased 1.6% to 201.0EH/s in March. We note the monthly average network hashrate has increased 47% and 16% over the past six and three months, respectively. The rate of increases seems to be abating in recent weeks, which makes sense given rising miner hardware costs and fairly stagnant bitcoin prices,"" Smith said.
The best-performing mining stock in march was Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), surging 23%, while Stronghold Digital was the worst performer, down 54%."

Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock gained 5% in premarket Tuesday after the cruise operator reported its highest booking week in its history.
The company said the March 28-April 3 week showed a double-digit increase from the previous record seven-day booking total.
The surge in bookings reflects the strength in so-called “revenge travel” as people look to break free and travel after two years of the pandemic.
The company said 22 of its 23 ships are back in guest operations across all its year-round U.S. homeports. Its final ship, Carnival Splendor, will return to service from Seattle on May 2, the company said.
Its newest ship, Carnival Celebration, will join the fleet at PortMiami in November.
According to the company, by 2022-end, Carnival will have more capacity sailing than it had in 2019. In 2023, Carnival will put into service another new Excel-class ship, Carnival Jubilee from Galveston.
With the restart of cruising in Australia now set, Carnival is finalizing plans for its return there and will be announcing those details soon.
Gains in the Carnival stock also boosted shares of Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL)."

The world's richest person in the past months has said he is a free speech absolutist, while being vocal against Web3, a term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralized and whose commercial backbone is the non-fungible token (NFT).
Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Musk, though active proponents of cryptocurrencies, share skepticism around the metaverse, NFTs and Web3, what some deem to be the evolution of the internet.
From ridiculing Twitter's new CEO to calling NFT profile pictures ""annoying"", here's a list of Musk's tweets and comments on Twitter, Web3, NFTs and free speech.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -French stocks and bonds fell on Tuesday as markets started to acknowledge the risk of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's presidential elections against incumbent Emmanuel Macron.
France's benchmark CAC-40 equity index was down 1.3% by 1215 GMT, underperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index which was flat.
French government borrowing costs also surged, with yields on 10-year debt up 10 basis points.
The spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds -- essentially the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt -- rose to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the COVID-19 market crash of 2020.
Le Pen, whose presidential campaign has gained momentum in recent days, on Monday captured 48.5% of voter intentions in an opinion poll of a likely runoff against Macron, the highest score she has ever notched.
The Harris Interactive poll for business magazine Challenges said a Macron victory - which pollsters had considered almost a foregone conclusion - was now within the margin of error. 
""Markets woke up on Le Pen,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
French banks Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) took the biggest hits with losses of 4-6%, far more than the 1.3% fall on a broader European banking index.
One trader said the selloff was particularly notable in stocks seen vulnerable to a Le Pen election. 
""Look at Vinci and Eiffage, their underperformance is a casualty of Le Pen risk"", the trader said, pointing to the far-right leader's plans to nationalise French highway operators.
Shares in the two infrastructure groups fell around 5% on the day.
The turmoil rekindles memories of the 2017 election when fears of a far-left or far-right win sent French government borrowing costs soaring and pushed stocks sharply lower. 
Many investors see Le Pen's platform, which aims to keep the legal retirement age at 62 years, as generous in terms of public spending. She is also viewed as less business-friendly than Macron. 
""Le Pen would likely be seen by markets as less reliable on public spending and economic competitiveness, and an unenthusiastic motor and/or unreliable partner for Germany and NATO at a crucial moment for Europe and the West,"" NatWest economist Giovanni Zanni told clients last week. 
FRENCH DEBT
Zanni reckons a surprise win for Le Pen could deliver a 50 basis points hit to French 10-year spreads over Germany -- essentially the premium demanded by investors to hold French debt. That would take the spread to a similar level as Spain which has a lower credit rating.
In the run up to the 2017 election, spreads had blown out to nearly 80 bps. 
Francois Raynaud, multi-asset fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, said selling French debt -- known as OATs - versus the German Bund through 10-year futures was a good hedge against a surprise election result. 
""By default, it seems judicious to us to take up protection by being underweight in terms of French weightings versus other indexes, or via the OAT futures,"" Raynaud told Reuters on Monday, before the latest sell-off.
Many investors remain unfazed -- Grace Peters, head of EMEA investment strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank, still favours French stocks, especially luxury and energy which are less vulnerable to the domestic economy.
""A Le Pen victory is the wild card out there which could be disruptive. But the base case is still for Mr Macron,"" Peters said.
Others are scanning markets for risks. 

The euro fell a quarter percent against the safe-haven Swiss franc on Tuesday to a one-month low but Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, sees the euro's risk premium as likely to rise in coming weeks.
""Might financial markets also be showing signs of complacency ahead of the polls? We think that is a significant risk,"" he said.

129,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 08:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani has reflected on the most recent Apple's App Store revenue growth trends.
Revenue growth in March was 8% to push the Q1 growth rate to 7%. Although this growth rate is low, the analyst is encouraged that it increased in March after 9 straight months of deceleration.
The acceleration should continue going forward as comps begin to get much easier in April. While the App Store remains the largest component of services revenue, it has become less important to the overall business as evidenced by Dec-21 results. App Store revenue growth last quarter was ~13%, but growth for the overall services business came in at an impressive 24% (worth noting AAPL has called out Advertising as the top contributor to their services growth for 2 quarters in a row now), Daryanani said in a client note.
The current growth rate is much lower than the 17% consensus, although the analyst warns that the growth rate is likely to remain in the single digits.
Comps get easier starting in April, so we expect a return to double-digit growth at that time. The entertainment category remains a standout in terms of growth, likely due to the proliferation of streaming services. China and Japan remain the main drivers of the decel as both countries lap periods of strong growth, the analyst added.

Germany, which relies on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and 25% of oil needs, has supported Western sanctions against Russia but has balked at the prospect of a near-term energy delivery cuts.
Germany will likely face a steep recession, with the energy intensive chemical industry exposed in particular, if sanctions were extended to Russian gas and oil.
Workers' purchasing power is already taking a hit from 7.6% inflation in March, the highest level in Germany in more than 40 years, as prices of natural gas and oil products soared.
The wage talks were the first due to conclude in an industrial sector in Germany after the invasion of Ukraine.

(Reuters) -Britain's Go-Ahead said it plans to expand its transport operations and reinstate its pre-COVID-19 dividend policy after a months-long strategic review, lifting its shares on Tuesday.
Go-Ahead, which runs more than 6,000 buses in England and Britain's largest passenger rail contract, said it plans to turn around underperforming businesses and grow in existing markets, which include Norway, Germany, Singapore and Ireland.
Its shares were up 6.8% to 900 pence at 1010 GMT after it said it plans to explore acquisitions and is looking at new urban mass transit services such as metro and light rail.
""Transport is at a tipping point as we recover from the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Christian Schreyer, who was appointed in November, said in a statement.
Go-Ahead plans to pay at least 50 pence per share in dividend for the year ending July 2, and said it would start distributing between 50% and 75% of its underlying earnings per share as payouts to shareholders from the current fiscal year.
The group suspended dividends in March 2020 after its operations were hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Go-Ahead's new strategy comes after it was fined 23.5 million pounds ($31 million) last month by Britain's transport department for overcharging by the operator's London and Southeastern railway franchise.
Schreyer said he was confident about the group's future.
""Go-Ahead's core strength is in commuter transport and we see opportunities to grow by encouraging people to leave their cars at home, by winning new contracts and through carefully selected acquisitions,"" he said.
Go-Ahead is also targeting annual operating profit of at least 150 million pounds and an increase in revenue to around four billion pounds in the medium-term, up by around 30% from 2021 after excluding recently discontinued operations.

Peel Hunt analysts said Go-Ahead could achieve the targets without new international contracts.

According to a GM release, the venture will particularly target the compact crossover segment, the largest in the world with annual volumes of more than 13 million vehicles.
“Our plans include a new all-electric product for North America positioned at a price point lower than the upcoming Chevrolet Equinox EV, building on the 2 million units of EV capacity the company plans to install by the end of 2025,” said Doug Parks, GM's Executive Vice President, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, in a press release.
The new EVs are expected to go on sale in 2027, starting with North America.
The companies will also work toward standardizing equipment and processes to achieve greater affordability, GM said.
“GM and Honda will share our best technology, design and manufacturing strategies to deliver affordable and desirable EVs on a global scale, including our key markets in North America, South America and China,” said Mary Barra, GM Chair and CEO.
GM is working to accelerate new technologies like lithium-metal, silicon and solid-state batteries, along with production methods that can quickly be used to improve and update battery cell manufacturing processes.

KKR has told TIM it cannot confirm its 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) bid unless Italy's biggest telecoms group provides access to its data under a due diligence process, according to two sources with knowledge of a KKR letter to TIM's board.
TIM, which is pushing ahead with its own standalone plan, wants to give the fund access only once a formal bid is made.
KKR said in its letter it remained interested in buying TIM but would not confirm a bid without a due diligence as the war in Ukraine had changed market conditions, the sources said. TIM has cut its outlook and suffered a series of credit rating downgrades.
The letter said KKR remained available to assess deals that would create value for TIM and all its shareholders, the sources added. 
""Whilst at present we are not able to reconfirm our proposed offer, we remain at your disposal to either complete due diligence or explore any other transaction in the interest of shareholders and the country of Italy"", KKR said in comments seen by Reuters.
TIM shares slipped in Milan to just 0.31 euros, a long way short of the 0.505 euro price at which KKR's non-binding approach was pitched last November.
""The odds of the deal seem now very low,"" analysts at Banca Akros said in a note.
RESHAPING TIM
TIM boss Pietro Labriola is pressing ahead with a strategy to revamp the company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its services business in an attempt to unlock what the debt-laden group calls its untapped value.
As part of this, TIM has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber.
Such a deal, advocated by the government, would entail a role for infrastructure and private equity funds, including KKR, sources have previously said.
Separately, European private equity fund CVC has approached TIM about potentially taking a stake in an enterprise services business that could be spun out of the group.TIM's board is expected to discuss KKR's letter and the proposal from CVC on Thursday.

The portfolio comprises small and medium-size business loans secured by real estate.
In 2020, an entity affiliated with funds managed by Fortress Investment Group bought the portfolio from Alpha Bank, one of Greece's four biggest lenders, with a gross book value of about 1.1 billion euros. Fortress assigned transitional servicing to Greek loan servicing company Cepal.
DoValue will assume the servicing of about 50% of the initial portfolio comprising small business non-performing loans secured by real estate assets in Greece.
Greek banks have been cleaning up their balance sheets from NPLs via outright sales and securitisations in an effort to reach single-digit ratios to bring them close to euro zone averages.
Last October, doValue agreed a deal with National Bank, one of Greece's largest lenders by assets, to service a 5.7 billion euro bad loan portfolio. 

Verona-based doValue was set up in 2015 when UniCredit spun off its debt-servicing arm in a deal with Fortress Investment Group, the U.S. fund that was later bought by SoftBank.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks have begun quietly trying to persuade the European Union to tone down proposals to toughen scrutiny of non-EU lenders to ensure the planned measures don't also curb companies' access to international finance. 
Surprise EU proposals to 'clarify' when banks based outside the bloc can serve customers in the 27-country union with or without a local branch were tucked away in a draft reform of bank capital rules last October.
The proposals have put banks from Switzerland, Britain, Japan, the United States and elsewhere on the alert as many foreign lenders currently offer wholesale services in the EU directly from abroad without having to set up a costly branch there.
Bankers fear that political fallout from Brexit is prompting Brussels to build up autonomy in EU banking while making it harder for companies to shop around globally for services.
""The proposals represent a major change to the existing regimes regulating cross-border business into the EU, rather than a clarification of existing treatment,"" the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a lobby group representing Europe's wholesale capital markets, said in a note to members.
""The proposals would have a significant adverse impact on the ability of EU financial institutions, corporates, governmental entities and individuals to access international markets and cross-border services,"" AFME said.
Under national laws in some EU states which predate the single market, foreign banks can offer wholesale investment banking services such as advice on floats or mergers without the need for a local branch.
There are no figures available on this largely opaque activity.
Many foreign banks have operations in the EU but fear they would no longer be able to draw on expertise they have outside the bloc when needed. Those without an EU branch already may not have enough ad hoc business in the bloc to justify a branch, bankers say.
""This came completely out of the blue, though we thought something like that would happen because of Brexit,"" a senior official at a global bank said.
""Now that it's there, it's a wild card and it's very hard to predict what will happen.""
EU states and the European Parliament have the final say on the proposals with deliberations ongoing.
European banks, with more influence inside the bloc than their UK or U.S. counterparts, are putting together a submission to the EU. 
The banks say an EU branch should be a requirement for core banking, such as deposit taking and lending, in all cases. This would end the discretion some EU states have exercised, an official familiar with the planned submission said.
Investment services, however, should be governed by the bloc's ""MiFID"" securities rules, which have provisions to exempt a branch requirement for specified activities, the official said. Under the proposal as written, some of these activities could require a branch, the official said.
""We want to strike a balance between the objectives of the European Commission in terms of control, but without unnecessarily limiting too much the access of European companies to global services,"" the official added.
Bankers also want a cost/benefit analysis on the proposals from EU banking and securities watchdogs the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.
WHO CALLS THE SHOTS?
A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU body which drafted the proposals, said its intention was to clarify where a branch is required when offering banking services such as deposit taking.
They also clarify how this is separate from providing investment banking services under national laws in EU states, the spokesperson said.
""The proposed clarification will ensure that there is a level playing field for all banks operating in the EU, and that our supervisors have at their disposal the necessary tools to protect the financial stability of the European Union and its member states,"" the spokesperson added.
The European banks are treading carefully to avoid turning up the political heat from several factors which already make the outcome unpredictable, though few expect the status quo to remain.
EU finance ministers on Tuesday formally agreed to increase ""strategic autonomy"" in EU capital markets, partly to cut reliance on London-based financial services.
Bankers say they also don't want to be caught in the power battle between EU states who want to retain some say over banking on their national turf, and their regulator, the European Central Bank, which wants more visibility on foreign banking activity.
The proposals have also opened up debate over whether and who should decide if a foreign bank branch in the EU should become a subsidiary, adding further costs.

The ECB is also assessing whether new Brexit hubs opened by international banks in the bloc have sufficient staff and activity to justify their licences.
""The whole debate is about how much to tighten and who will call the shots,"" a banking industry official said.

Investing.com – Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock traded 0.3% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company suggested its first quarter profit could be its highest since 2014.
Provisional numbers from the company for its quarter ended March 31 indicate operating profits from oil and gas could touch $9.3 billion when the company declares its numbers on April 29.
The boom in profits comes on the back of record-high oil and gas prices which have continued to make new peaks, most recently pushed higher by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Booming economies, harsh winters, and a stubborn OPEC+ that has been slow to raise output have otherwise kept the prices up.
International crude futures touched a 14-year high of almost $140 a barrel during the quarter.
The estimates suggest total earnings for the quarter of about $9.8 billion at the mid-point of Exxon's estimates, Reuters quoted Scotiabank global equity research as saying.
Impairments to  Exxon Mobil 's Russian operations could hurt the final results. The company last month said it would exit Russia, joining rivals and other companies following the invasion of Ukraine.
It holds a 30% stake in the Sakhalin-I offshore oil asset in Russia’s Far East and has $4 billion in assets at risk. It faces a 1-2% hit to production and revenue from the move.
Operating profits in refining could touch $1.8 billion, $300 million higher than the fourth quarter figure while the chemicals business could erode as much to $1 billion.

Under the latest extension terms, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s Optum unit, which offers healthcare data analytics services, will pay a $650 million fee to Change if the deal is not completed due to the court's decision, which is expected after a two-week trial scheduled to begin on Aug. 1.
UnitedHealth announced its $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare in January 2021, saying that it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.
The companies had originally planned to close the deal in the second half of 2021, but UnitedHealth extended the closing date to April 5. 
In its complaint, the U.S. Justice Department has said the deal will give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs, as both UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims.
Change Healthcare also said it would pay a special cash dividend of $2 per share to its shareholders at the time of closing.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's largest private lender HDFC Bank's $40 billion acquisition of its biggest shareholder could face regulatory hurdles due to the stake it would give the bank in the insurance sector, analysts said. 
Sources told Reuters last year that the Reserve Bank of India, which acts as regulator for the financial industry, wants banks to limit ownership stakes in insurance companies.
HDFC Bank's acquisition of HDFC Ltd, announced on Monday, will create an entity with a combined balance sheet worth $237 billion and will include the target's insurance and other financial subsidiaries.
HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO are among the leading life and general insurance companies in the private sector, and analysts say the RBI is unlikely to be comfortable with the size of the insurance operations the deal will give the bank. 
HDFC Bank's management said on Monday that they have asked the regulator for clarity on complying with its rules, but analysts believe it may not be easy to come by.
""Considering there are lot of subsidiaries that need to be merged, there could be some regulatory overhang, particularly in the insurance business where the central bank is not very comfortable with banks increasing their stake,"" said an analyst at a domestic brokerage house.
HDFC Bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. The RBI also did not respond to a request for comment. 
One way of folding the subsidiaries into HDFC Bank could be to create a holding company structure, but that could have a negative impact on the balance sheet in the short term, analysts said. 
""If a holding company structure is enforced then the equation changes. Cost goes up as stamp duties and taxes will go up,"" Macquarie said in a note on Tuesday.
In the short term, return on equity (RoE), a key financial metric, will also go down as a result of meeting certain regulatory requirements, the Macquarie note said. 
As a shadow bank - a finance company outside the scope of traditional banking regulation - HDFC Ltd has a higher cost of funds compared to the bank. 
Post merger, the entity may therefore in the short term also see a higher cost of funds, which could affect its margin, said a portfolio manager at a retail brokerage firm.
""Due to this and other ambiguities regarding the deal and the performance, the stock may not see a big valuation re-rating immediately,"" he added.

HDFC Bank shares fell as much as nearly 3% on Tuesday, while HDFC Ltd slipped more than 2%. Both stocks had surged around 10% on Monday.
If it clears the hurdles to a deal, HDFC Bank will shrink the gap in size with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India, and pull further away from peers such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.

PARIS (Reuters) -French food group Danone said on Tuesday that ""all options are on the table"" regarding its business in Russia and that there was no decision at this stage to exit the country.
This was after a source close to the matter said Danone was looking at possible ways of withdrawing from Russia, as the West prepared new sanctions on Moscow after dead civilians were found lining the streets of a Ukrainian town seized from Russian invaders. 
The source had added no decision had yet been taken.
""The position of Danone regarding its business in Russia has not changed. All options are on the table and the group is monitoring the situation in close cooperation with the French government,"" a group spokesperson said.
A source had said earlier that Danone was ""reviewing a possible withdrawal from Russia,"" adding the company wanted to avoid losing assets or exposing local staff to trouble as well as avoid cutting the local population from food supply if it pulled out.
The company earned about 5% of its revenues in Russia in 2021 and less than 1% in Ukraine.

Last month Danone said it would continue local production in Russia of essential dairy and infant nutrition products, but had cut other ties with the country over its war in Ukraine. [L2N2VQ1AA]
The company said at the time it had ended other imports and exports as well as all investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, in Russia, and that it would not take any cash, dividends or profits from its business there.

(Reuters) - DP Eurasia, which runs the Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) brand in Turkey and Russia, said it plans to stay in Russia, but could not give an outlook for the full year because of uncertainties linked to the war in Ukraine and inflation.
As many international companies limit their exposure to Russia following the launch of what it describes as a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24, DP Eurasia said last month it would limit further investment in the country.
However, CEO Aslan Saranga told Reuters on Tuesday the company planned to continue to operate in Russia and that it had a responsibility to stakeholders.
""We have franchisees over there, half of the stores, even if you want to close these stores, we cannot,"" he said.
The company said it could not give an outlook for 2022, citing uncertainties over the impact of the Ukraine conflict and high inflation in Turkey.
DP Eurasia, the largest pizza delivery company in Turkey and the third largest in Russia, has 188 stores in Russia and Saranga said it had not seen any major change in consumer demand since the start of the war in Ukraine.
It has about 3,000 employees in the country, compared to about 10,000 in Turkey, Saranga said.
The company's full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 58.5% to 208.4 million Turkish lira ($14.19 million), driven by a strong performance in Turkey and recovery in Russia.
It returned to a positive like-for-like growth rate of 9.6%, helping it to improve adjusted EBITDA by 907% in Russia.
Russia is its second-biggest market, representing 26% of its system sales, which comprise sales both from its own and franchised stores.
DP Eurasia, which also operates in Azerbaijan and Georgia, announced the launch of a new coffee shop and product brand, COFFY and has opened 11 stores in Turkey.

Saranga said the company tested the format during the pandemic and added the coffee is 30%-40% cheaper than its competition.
""The launch of a new coffee shop brand, COFFY, in Turkey is an exciting development and allows DPEU to leverage its existing infrastructure,"" Liberum analysts wrote in a note.

The Ariya, Nissan's second EV-only model after the Leaf hatchback, will now go on sale on May 12 in Japan. The company had most recently flagged a late-March launch.
The Ariya was originally slated for a mid-2021 launch but was delayed by COVID-related chip shortages. Sales in Europe are due to start this summer and the United States in the autumn, Nissan has said.

A limited-edition version of the SUV went on sale in Japan as planned in January.
Nissan pioneered mass-market electric vehicles with the Leaf in 2010.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, with investors taking a cautious stance ahead of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, the start of the new earnings season and the continuing war in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 90 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, ending up 1.9%, helped by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock gaining nearly 30% after billionaire Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in the social media giant.
Investors are focusing this week on Wednesday’s release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting. Expectations are growing that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May, after hiking by 25 basis points in March, especially after a jobs report that showed an unemployment rate falling to a new two-year low of 3.6%.
Ahead of the minutes, Tuesday sees the release of ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI data for March, at 10:00 AM EST (1400 GMT), which is expected to show increased momentum in March. Speeches from Fed policymakers Neel Kashkari, Lael Brainard and John Williams will also be closely studied.
The first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week, with companies having to cope with the ramifications of the Ukraine conflict, in addition to soaring commodity prices and supply chain constraints.
The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for the first quarter of 2022 is 4.7%, according to data from FactSet, which would mark the lowest earnings growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Twitter will remain in focus after Musk posted a poll asking users of the social media platform if they wanted an edit button, just hours after taking his hefty stake in the company.
Investors will also continue to keep an eye on the latest developments in Ukraine, with reports suggesting the European Commission is set to propose that Russian coal is part of a new round of sanctions following mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian troops on Ukrainian civilians.
Oil prices traded higher Tuesday on the prospect of these additional sanctions on Russia, adding to the strong gains seen in the previous session.
Additionally, the industry body American Petroleum Institute reports its weekly inventory data later in the session, after recording a drop of 3 million barrels last week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $104.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $108.82. Both contracts settled more than 3% higher on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,929.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded marginally lower at 1.0967.

The investment comes shortly after Musk tweeted that he is considering building a new social media platform. The billionaire also published a poll on Twitter, questioning the social media company's ability to adhere to free speech principles.
Yesterday, Musk asked Twitter users if they want to have an edit button on the platform, with over 1.2 million users voting in just three hours. More than 75% responded they want an edit button, a feature that Twitter has been working on for some time.
The poll was followed by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweet in which he urged users to vote carefully.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, also known to be a big Musk admirer, expects this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter.
""We will be following Musk's comments/future regulatory filings closely to see if Musk ultimately pursues further conversations with the Twitter board and/or goes to an active stake and above the key 10% threshold. For Tesla purposes, we view this move as Musk just further building out his tentacles,"" Ives said in a client note.
For Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Twitter shares overreacted given that investors don't know the rationale behind Musk's investment.
""Don't bet against Musk, but we wonder about the rationale behind his investment,"" Thill said in a client note.
Thill reiterates that investors are still focused on Twitter making major progress on 2023 revenue and daily user targets. Moreover, Jefferies believes the Twitter stock is expensive as it trades at over 100% premium compared to Meta Platforms (FB).
On why Musk decided to invest in Twitter, Thill believes he may be motivated to change Twitter's moderation policies.
BofA analyst Justin Post expects that Musk's investment will drive significant retail investor interest in, and activity for, the stock. Along these lines, the analyst also sees a greater risk to short sellers due to potentially higher retail interest/activity.
Moreover, Post is positive on Twitter shares as Musk may end up in the boardroom.
""We think Street doesn't expect an outright acquisition, but does see an increased potential for positive change at Twitter. The type of form used (13G) often indicates the investor isn't seeking to acquire control, or to influence who controls it. Twitter is more vulnerable than some of its Internet peers to outside pressure because its founders don't have special voting control,"" Post said in a memo.

(Reuters) - Last week, a top U.S. banking regulator warned of growing risks as banks start to capitalize on the popularity of cryptocurrencies to offer related services to clients.
Here is how some of the biggest banks operating in the United States have gotten involved in crypto: 
CUSTODY SERVICES
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) announced in February 2021 that it would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin for asset management clients, one of the first announcements of its kind for a major Wall Street bank. The launch is expected later this year. 
Clients will be able to store bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, in BNY Mellon crypto wallets, which will be created in partnership with crypto infrastructure company Fireblocks. 
U.S. Bancorp went live in October with bitcoin custody services. Bitcoin company NYDIG is acting as a sub-custodian for the bank. The services are geared toward institutional investment managers with private funds.
 State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) in March said it intends to offer cryptocurrency custody services in partnership with crypto infrastructure platform Copper.co, although it cautioned that the offering was subject to regulatory approval. 
Meanwhile,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) quietly revealed plans to develop a service to hold and trade cryptocurrencies for institutional investors in a 2020 report published by the World Economic Forum, adding it had already completed a proof of concept. 
Also in 2020, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) completed a proof of concept with crypto wallet provider Curv to develop a secure method to transfer tokenized securities. It said the development was a step toward creating an integrated custody solution for both traditional and digital assets. 
Deutsche Bank and BNPP did not provide an update on these projects when contacted by Reuters. 
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
A slew of big banks began offering wealth management clients exposure to crypto in 2021, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) leading the pack. CNBC reported in March that Morgan Stanley was enabling access to three bitcoin funds for clients with at least $2 million in assets held at the bank. 
In July, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) allowed its financial advisers to accept buy and sell orders from its wealth management clients for five cryptocurrency products, according to Business Insider.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co also began offering its wealthy clients cryptocurrency exposure in the summer of 2021, as did State Street.
JP Morgan and Wells Fargo both registered private bitcoin funds in partnership with NYDIG in August. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s wealth management unit created a digital assets group in June to facilitate investments in cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and central bank digital currencies, according to media reports. 
In March of this year, regulatory documents revealed that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is offering wealthy clients access to an ethereum fund through crypto company Galaxy Digital. 
TRADING
In March 2021, Goldman rebooted its cryptocurrency trading desk after mothballing it in 2019. That team, which sits within the bank’s Global Markets division, deals bitcoin futures and nondeliverable forwards, a derivative that allows the bank's clients to take a view on bitcoin's future price. 
In March of this year, Goldman Sachs went a step further and became the first major U.S. bank to carry out an over-the-counter crypto trade in partnership with Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused asset manager. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in July 2021 green-lit trading bitcoin futures for certain clients through a partnership with CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME), according to a report https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/16/bank-of-america-approves-bitcoin-futures-trading-for-some-clients-sources from CoinDesk. Bank of America declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was ""currently considering strategies related to cryptocurrency and other digital assets.""
Citigroup said last August the bank was considering offering bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients, although media reports said the bank was awaiting regulatory approval. Citi had no immediate comment. IFR reported in December that Citi had recently cleared its first bitcoin futures trade through CME Group.
PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) is also waiting for the OK from regulators to allow its customers to trade crypto. 
RESEARCH COVERAGE
Banks are also plowing money into research.
Bank of America kicked off digital assets research coverage for clients in October.

Morgan Stanley stood up a new crypto research division in September, in what the bank said was a recognition of the “growing significance of cryptocurrencies ... in global markets.”
Citigroup in November said it was looking to create this year 100 new roles focused on digital assets, including blockchain and digital currencies, at its institutional division.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Latin American bankers expect investors to overlook political worries in the region this year and keep investing in local companies, buoyed by strong commodities prices and a comfortable distance from geopolitical risks in eastern Europe.
The volume of mergers and acquisitions in the region fell 30% in the first quarter from a year ago, while share offerings fell 69%, with rising interest rates and volatile markets hurting on both fronts, bankers and lawyers said.
""Volatile markets impacted valuations and delayed deals,"" said Felipe Bittencourt, head of advisory at Vinci Partners. He said he expects lower M&A and equity issues volume in the region this year, as higher interest rates raise the required rates of return for capital invested in companies.
However, several deal advisors said the opportunity for returns far from the war roiling Ukraine and its neighbors had kept investors engaged in Latin American markets. Bankers see a growing flow of deals among healthcare, energy and tech companies, including fintechs. 
""Despite recent problems in Europe and our upcoming elections, corporate and investor sentiment remain positive. We should have more deals,"" said Brazil-based Luiz Muniz, partner and head of Latin America at Rothschild & Co.
He pointed out a healthcare deal is again topping the regional tables: hospital chain SA Rede D'Or Sao Luiz SA agreed in February to acquire insurer Sul America SA for 13 billion reais ($2.81 billion).
Another highlight of first-quarter dealmaking was the restructuring of airline Aeromexico, in which Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) became the largest shareholder alongside Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). 
Bankers are hoping presidential elections in Brazil, the region's largest economy, will not throw off momentum, as leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, now leading the polls, has tapped centrist running mate Geraldo Alckmin, signaling a coalition with moderate economic policies. 
The drop in new equity issues last quarter tracked a global retreat, as interest rates rose in the United States and Latin American countries. 
Analysts see ongoing headwinds for initial public offerings (IPOs), but an easier rebound for follow-on offerings, which dominated first-quarter issuances. Energy and commodities companies such as power holding Equatorial Energia SA and food processor BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) were among the larger issues.
""Clients expect higher discounts in share offerings as investors are more cautious,"" said Pedro Juliano, head of investment banking in Brazil at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) 
Even an October election approaching in Brazil, investors expect the government to keep pushing to privatize power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, in a deal close to $15 billion.

The Shanghai-based automaker is holding talks with both local and overseas automotive companies to expand its network of battery charging stations, said Hui Zhang, Vice President of Nio Europe.
The company expects to increase the number of its charging stations from 800 to 5,000 by the middle of the decade. Nio hopes the battery swap technology will help it gain a strong position in Europe, one of the most competitive electric vehicle markets.
The company expects to build 1,000 battery swap stations outside China by 2025, primarily in Europe and the U.S., a market that Nio wants to target after Europe.
""We want to be a well-established player in the premium segment [in Europe] by 2025,"" Zhang said.
Nios's plan involves licensing its battery-swapping solution to other carmakers in an effort to expand the use of this technology which the company believes will address concerns related to the limited number of battery chargers and the time needed to charge a car.
To address these worries, Nio developed a battery swap system that involves unscrewing the bottom of the electric vehicle and replacing the battery through a hatch on the floor of the charging station.
The battery swap process takes just a couple of minutes, significantly faster than even the quickest electric car chargers that take about an hour to power up an empty battery.
The Chinese carmaker went public in 2018 and has sold 180,000 vehicles in China. While dozens of other Chinese carmakers have developed their own battery swap technologies, only Nio has commercialized the product until now.
Nio stock price is up 1.5% in pre-open Tuesday."

Buybacks were at the lowest weekly level in the past 12 months, and down YoY for the first time in over a year.
While the $ amount of buybacks in 1Q was above other 1Qs post-crisis, as a % of S&P 500 market cap, 1Q buybacks were the lowest in five years. Meanwhile, 1Q S&P 500 buyback announcements (as a % of mkt. cap)  ""while similar to 1Q21 levels"" were 50% below the pre-COVID 5-year avg, Carey Hall said in a client note.
The combination of strong supply (IPOs) and less demand (buybacks) suggests a reversal of a multi-decade bullish trend for US equities (shrinkage).
As a result, Carey Hall says dividends may dominate buybacks in 2022 amid several risks - politics, valuations, rising demand for dividends - to the latter.
Last week, BofA's clients were selling US equities ($3.4 billion) with clients selling both stocks and ETFs. Once again, hedge funds were leading the way, followed by institutional clients. On the other hand, retail clients were buying stocks once again.
""While retail flows have decelerated, the group remains net buyers. Retail flows have been positive all but one week (3/14) YTD. Our retail client flows have been a positive 'not contrary' indicator of subsequent near-term S&P 500 returns, and actually a slightly better signal than HF flows,"" Carey Hall added.
On a sector basis, clients sold stocks in six of the 11 sectors, led by Consumer Discretionary and Tech. Conversely, Real Estate, Materials, Energy, and Industrials saw inflows.
""Sales of Consumer Discretionary stocks have accelerated in recent weeks and last week were the largest ever in our data history since 2008. We have been cautious on labor-intensive Consumer Discretionary stocks as wages have continued to rise and the sector currently ranks worst in our tactical S&P 500 sector ranks and has been deteriorating in rank in our small-cap sector ranks,"" the strategist concluded.

Family-owned Boehringer said in a statement on Tuesday that full-year operating income came in at 4.7 billion euros ($5.16 billion), up from 4.6 billion a year earlier.
The Jardiance group of products, managed in a partnership with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), had 3.9 billion euros in sales, up 25.5%. The diabetes treatment is increasingly used to cut the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients and also for the treatment of heart failure.
Sales of pulmonary fibrosis drug Ofev rose 21.2% to 2.5 billion euros.
Growth in animal health products, such as antiparasitics for dogs and cats, was fuelled by more people acquiring a new pet during the pandemic, but Boehringer said it expects to ""see a normalization of the market growth trend"" in 2022. 

For 2022, Boehringer predicted slightly lower group operating income on higher spending on research and development, while revenues are expected to increase slightly.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Macellum Advisors GP LLC on Monday urged Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) Inc to be more open about its sales process, urging the retailer to give bidders and shareholders a fuller financial picture of itself.
The firm, in a letter to Kohl's board, asked the company to say when it plans to accept final bids and explain how much access potential buyers have to management and data to shape their offers. It also asked Kohl's to pre-release first-quarter financial results before next month's annual meeting. 
    Macellum, which has 5.4% stake in the retailer, is pushing to take control of Kohl's board and wants the company to sell itself, arguing that a new ""capital-intensive"" three-year standalone strategy is hurting the share price.
Kohl's said its board is ""thoughtfully and thoroughly evaluating proposals to realize full and fair shareholder value and weighing those against the value-creation potential of a compelling strategic plan."" The company said it will not let Macellum drive ""process decisions.""
Kohl's share price, which traded at $60.54 on Monday, has climbed recently because investors are holding out for a sale, Macellum said. But the investment firm also accused the retailer's board of ""putting its thumb on the scale to keep Kohl's mired in operational mediocrity"" and said directors squandered their credibility with shareholders through a secretive and confusing sales process.
""A number of sizable shareholders have informed us that they are extremely frustrated with the Board's poorly communicated process,"" the letter said.
Kohl's last month said it had contact with more than 20 parties and had signed confidentiality agreements with some. 
At least three interested parties, including luxury department store operator Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Company, private equity firm Sycamore Partners and a group that includes Acacia Research Corp, a holding company for business controlled by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, have made bids for Kohl's, which is valued at $7.8 billion, sources said. Some have offered to pay as much as $70 a share, the sources said. 

Several bidders expressed concerns about the speed of the sale process and their ability to access information for diligence purposes, the sources added. 
    Representatives for the bidders declined to comment.

Lower capacity and increased passenger demand are already driving fares higher for those booking flights from June onwards, O'Leary told the Irish Independent newspaper, citing ""very strong"" forward bookings .
""What we're seeing at the moment is prices are slightly lower than they were in 2019, pre-COVID, through March, April and May. They're somewhere between 5% and 10% higher at the moment through June, July, August and September,"" O'Leary said.
""I think fares will be up this year in the peak summer months by between 5% and 10%.""
The Irish low-cost airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, on Monday reported that its passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time last month.
O'Leary, who told the newspaper he had no intention of retiring after nearly 30 years in charge, said it would be too optimistic to say that COVID-19 is over for the airline industry but he does not expect any ""COVID scares"" this summer. 

""Travel is recovering strongly. I think people are fed up. We have been locked up at home for the last two years on Zoom calls. They want to go travel again. Families want to go on holidays again,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Asian equities witnessed steep foreign outflows in March, hit by worries over higher inflation as commodity prices soared due to an escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine. 
According to Refinitiv data, cross-border investors sold Asian equities worth a net $16.23 billion in Taiwan, India, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand in the last month, the highest outflows since net selling of $33.32 billion in March 2020.

Sales of branded grocery products fell by 5.1% in the four weeks to March 26, while sales of own-label, or private-label, products created for chain stores were down 1.9%, the market research company said.
The share of sales for own-label products rose from 52.4% to 53.2% compared to a year ago, it said.
""As we leave behind the pandemic, it's clear that shoppers are re-evaluating what they spend,"" said Mike Watkins, NielsenIQ UK head of retailer and business insight. 
""Whilst some of the changes in grocery spend will be due to consumers simply having a different basket mix compared with last year, our data also shows that consumers are now increasingly shopping for private-label products as part of their coping strategy.""
Sales of private-label products in the ambient or packaged grocery category increased by 3.3%; a significant change in a category where brands dominate, with 61% share of total sales, it said.
UK inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and is heading for 9% later this year, according to the government's budget watchdog, which predicted living standards in 2022 would fall by the most since at least the 1950s.
Overall grocery spending fell 4.1% year-on-year in the period, the steepest decline so far recorded in 2022, NielsenIQ said on Tuesday.

However, the period was the final comparison against extensive lockdown measures, indicating a potential return to growth post Easter and into the spring. 
The strongest performing retailers were M&S, with sales up 9.4%, and German discounters Lidl and Aldi, up 8.6% and 5.6% respectively. The three were the only retailers to gain market share, it said.

Some 131,507 current and former workers are involved in the shareholder scheme, according to the company's 2021 annual report released last week. The company is private and wholly owned by its employees, it said. 
The filing, published on Saturday, does not break down the dividend distribution.
It comes as U.S. sanctions continue to weigh heavily on Huawei's business, with full-year revenue tumbling 29% last year to 636.8 billion yuan. 
Net profit jumped by a record 76% to 113.7 billion yuan, but that was mainly due to the sale of its budget-brand smartphone unit Honor and server businesses under U.S. pressure.
The United States imposed a series of trade restrictions on Huawei throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns, which Huawei denies.

The restrictions impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses.
Guo Ping, Huawei's current rotating chairman, said last week that the company still hopes to find a solution to sustain its smartphone division and will ramp up investment in research seeking microchip ""breakthroughs"" after losing access to certain advanced technologies because of U.S. sanctions.

""It certainly seems someone was aware of Musk building a stake, which is information that would likely be readily available across trading desks due to the significant size of the position,"" said Joe Kunkle, founder of options analytics firm OptionsHawk.com in Philadelphia.
The trades stood out since they were betting on Twitter to advance sharply within a relatively short time frame, Kunkle said.
For example, someone bought 3,900 of the April $43 calls for about $530,400, just minutes before the end of the trading session on Thursday. In all, 21,706 of these contracts changed hands on Thursday, overnight making them the fourth-largest block of open contracts on Twitter, according to Trade Alert data.
The contracts would also capture any share price moves following Twitter's earnings results, expected on April 28. 
With Twitter's share price jumping on Monday, the trades stood to make big gains. For example, the April 29 $43 calls, which traded for an average price of $1.26 on Thursday, changed hands at an average price of $6.92 on Monday, a gain of more than 400%, according to a Reuters analysis of the trades.
Bullish options on Twitter have drawn unusually heavy activity ever since Musk tweeted on March 25 that he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform, while questioning Twitter's commitment to free speech, Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS, said.
""I find it interesting that the calls were bought in a big hurry, late in the day ahead of the end of the quarter. If I was a regulator, I would be looking into these trades,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
""It's not a smoking gun, but it deserves scrutiny,"" he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scans for unusual trades ahead of news announcements and has used such data to bring insider trading probes in the past, public filings show.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the trading in Twitter's options. Twitter and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the trading activity.

TUCSON, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. self-driving truck companies have a golden opportunity in the form of a nationwide driver shortage, but their robot drivers still are not ready and neither are their biggest potential customers.
The uncertainties surrounding autonomous trucking come at a critical time for the U.S. trucking industry, which faces a record shortage of 80,000 drivers as demand for online shopping and rapid delivery times is straining supply chains.
Private investors, who have so far poured nearly $9 billion into U.S. AV trucking companies according to data from Pitchbook, are hoping that self-driving trucks eventually catch on. Among the companies developing the technology are TuSimple Holdings Inc, Aurora Innovation Inc, Embark Technology Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo.
But large logistics companies, who represent the tech startups' coveted future customers, are in no rush to sign big contracts. They continue to test the technology of multiple providers in limited partnerships.
""Everybody is at a point where they're hedging their bets,"" said Eric Fuller, the Chief Executive of US Xpress Enterprises (NYSE:USX) Inc, a carrier and trucking brokerage that manages 6,000 of its own tractors. 
The company has announced partnerships with TuSimple and Aurora. Fuller, who also sits on TuSimple's advisory board, said US Xpress was working with all the other AV companies, but had yet to announce more partnerships.
The companies say they have developed technology that can safely pilot a 33,000 pound (15,000 kg) truck down a busy highway and are pushing toward commercial launches.
They provide the sensors and software, and some have partnered with truck manufacturers to incorporate their technology at the assembly line, but all rely on large logistics companies to pay for their offering. 
The U.S. Southwest, primarily Texas and Arizona, where weather and regulations are favorable, has emerged as the testing ground for heavy-duty autonomous vehicle (AV) companies.
Large logistics groups such as DHL,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and  Ryder System Inc  (NYSE:R) have launched pilot programs with several autonomous trucking companies. 
But logistics giants also say they are still in the early stages of exploring the technology and are waiting to see which startups have the team, capital and network to survive and prove self-driving to be feasible on a large scale.
'SHAKING THINGS OUT'
While much attention has been focused on self-driving taxis, industry experts increasingly bet on driverless trucks to be the first autonomous vehicles to generate meaningful revenue due to the less complex driving environment in which they operate.
Making a meaningful dent in the U.S. market of 2.3 million trucks will take time, however, and industry experts project no more than a few hundred-thousand autonomous trucks over the next decade.
Logistics companies hope robo-trucks will one day take over monotonous long-haul tours, but not replace existing jobs. 
Human drivers will prefer to spend more time on shorter, complex routes near their homes - routes that are still too difficult for self-driving technology.
Pitchbook analysts expect the global AV trucking market to balloon from around $530 million in 2023 to $167 billion in 2035.
""There's still opportunity for more players. We're not at a point where we're shaking things out,"" Jim Monkmeyer, president for transportation at DHL Supply Chain, said during a February visit to TuSimple's testing facility in Tucson, Arizona.
DHL Supply Chain, which operates some 1,500 trucks and manages around $3 billion of annual North American freight spend, has so far partnered with TuSimple and Embark and put in reservations for future trucks with both companies. Those orders are slated to be fulfilled in 2024.
Monkmeyer said DHL had contracted with multiple providers to reduce its risks, but added that placing truck reservations early was crucial in order to be among the first to explore the new technology.
Monkmeyer and his logistics colleagues say self-driving trucks offer the potential to increase freight capacity and reduce cost, with robots, unlike humans, not subject to a mandatory 11-hour daily driving limit.
LOWER COSTS
But the economics pan out only once the driver is out of the cabin.
So far, only TuSimple has removed its safety drivers in a handful of night-time trial runs along an 80-mile (130 km) stretch of highway between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona.
The company is planning to present per-mile cost calculations in the next few months, Cheng Lu, TuSimple's former CEO, said in late February, just days before the company replaced him in a surprise move. 
""Your cost has to either be lower than what today's costs are, or there is a clear line of sight to be lower,"" said Lu, who now serves as an adviser to the new CEO.
Drivers account for more than 40% of per-mile costs, according to data by the American Transportation Research Institute.

Graphic on current per-mile trucking costs: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ulCdyo
Autonomous driving could halve driver costs, with the companies planning to charge between 35 and 45 cents in per-mile subscription fees, according to two industry experts.
But the companies, three of them publicly listed, are far from generating meaningful revenue, let alone profit. Embark recorded a 2021 net loss of $124 million, TuSimple had a loss of $411 million and Aurora lost $755 million. 
For the logistics partners, access to sufficient capital is crucial when determining whom to partner with, DHL's Monkmeyer and US Xpress' Fuller said.
TuSimple said it ended 2021 with some $1.3 billion left in cash, Aurora with $1.6 billion.
But the companies also confront other real-world hurdles as they try to release their technology on a larger scale.
Ryder, which operates nearly 240,000 trucks and around 800 U.S. maintenance locations, has partnered with TuSimple, Waymo and Embark to explore how self-driving trucks would fit into its network.
The logistics company wants to understand how to service the host of lidar, radar and camera sensors and whether trucks operating around the clock require different maintenance schedules.

In the long run, the tech companies also had to tackle more challenging driving conditions, such as snow, said Ryder's head of new product development, Karen Jones.
""I can't just run an autonomous business in the Southwest and Southeast, you have to figure out how to get to the Northeast,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk on Monday disclosed a 9.2% stake in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), worth nearly $3 billion, making him the micro-blogging site's largest shareholder and triggering a rise of more than 27% in the company's shares.
Musk's move, revealed in a regulatory filing, comes on the heels of his tweet that he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social media platform, while questioning Twitter's commitment to free speech.
He also started a poll asking Twitter users if they want an edit button, a long-awaited feature on which the social media platform has been working. It was followed by Chief Executive Parag Agrawal urging users to ""vote carefully"". 
In less than three hours of starting the poll, more than 1.2 million users voted, with over 75% of them backing an edit option. 
Last week, in another poll, Musk had asked if Twitter alogrithm should be open source. More than 82% of the users said yes, while former CEO Jack Dorsey said, ""the choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone.""
A prolific Twitter user, Musk has over 80 million followers since joining the site in 2009 and has used the platform to make several announcements, including teasing a go-private deal for Tesla that landed him in hot water with regulators. 
Of late, however, the world's richest person has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a Twitter poll asking users if they believed the platform adheres to the principle of free speech, to which over 70% voted ""no.""
In December, Musk put out a meme that compared CEO Agrawal with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and showed Jack Dorsey as a close associate who was later on executed. 
Twitter's latest quarterly results and lower-than-expected user additions have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters to end long-running stagnation.
""It does send a message to Twitter ... having a meaningful stake in the company will keep them on their toes, because that passive stake could very quickly become an active stake,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC.
Musk - who, according to Forbes, has a net worth of about $300 billion - has been reducing his stake in Tesla since November, when he said he would offload 10% of his holding in the electric-car maker. He has already sold $16.4 billion worth of shares since then.
A regulatory filing on Monday showed that Musk owns 73.5 million Twitter shares, which are held by the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, of which he is the sole trustee. Vanguard is Twitter's second-biggest shareholder, with an 8.79% stake, according to Refinitiv data.
Twitter shares rose 27.1% on Monday to close at $49.97. The stock, which had fallen 38% in the past 12 months through Friday's close, on Monday added as much as $8.38 billion to its market capitalization, which now stands at $39.3 billion. 
BUYOUT? 
""Musk's actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all-out buyout should not be ruled out,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a client note.
The stake in Twitter is more likely to result in positive outcomes for shareholders than negative ones, said Ryan Jacob, chief executive officer of Jacob Asset Management, who said Twitter is one of the fund's largest holdings.
""If (Musk) decides to take an active position and Twitter goes private, it will probably be at a higher price than it is now,"" he said. ""If it gets other companies interested (in acquiring Twitter), it'll probably be at a higher price than right now.""
Musk has previously made early-stage investments in companies, including online payment processor Stripe Inc and artificial intelligence firm Vicarious.
He is also the founder and chief executive officer of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm the Boring Company. 
Twitter was the target of activist investor Elliott Management Corp in 2020, when the hedge fund argued the social networking company's then-boss and co-founder, Jack Dorsey, was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running what was then called  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). 

Dorsey, who owns a stake of more than 2% in Twitter, stepped down as CEO and chairman in November last year, handing the reins to company veteran Parag Agrawal. 
Meanwhile, Musk and Dorsey have found some common ground in dismissing the so-called Web3, a vague term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralized.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms briefly restricted hashtags related to civilian deaths in northern Ukraine, where bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces, a company spokesman confirmed on Monday.
The killings in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have drawn pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West.
Meta spokesman Andy Stone said automated systems that scan for violent imagery on Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, were responsible for blocking hashtags including #bucha and #buchamassacre.
""This happened automatically because of the graphic content people posted using these hashtags. When we were made aware of the issue yesterday, we acted quickly to unblock the hashtags,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Facebook and Instagram permit the posting of graphic and violent content when it is shared to raise awareness of possible human rights abuses, but deletes the content if it is extremely explicit or celebrates suffering.
The social media company also adds warning labels to some graphic posts that users must click through before they can see the images.
Human rights groups have critized Meta's approach to removing violent content during conflicts, saying its practice of purging the data from its servers after 90 days results in the deletion of critical evidence of war crimes.

Stone said Meta was ""exploring ways to preserve this type and other types of content when we remove it,"" specifically in relation to the war in Ukraine.
Russia has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Energy consultant Adriano Pires has backed out of the Brazilian government's nomination for him to take the helm at Petrobras, the country's Mines and Energy Ministry said on Monday, in the latest blow to succession plans at the state-run oil company.
""It was clear to me that I could not reconcile my consulting work with the exercise of Petrobras' command,"" Pires wrote in a letter published by the ministry on its website. 
Pires' decision to turn down the chief executive job came a day after soccer magnate Rodolfo Landim declined a nomination to chair the board of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known.
Pires had been tapped by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to take over as the top executive of Petrobras on March 28, following disagreements between the far-right leader and current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna over the company's fuel pricing policy.
The government will now need to find suitable replacements for the two top spots at Petrobras just days before the company's April 13 annual shareholders' meeting.
Pires' decision to back out from the CEO job was reported earlier on Monday by Brazil's O Globo newspaper. Preferred shares in Petrobras fell 1% after the O Globo article was published, but later recouped their losses.
Pires' nomination had been facing internal compliance-related hurdles at Petrobras, as his consultancy, Rio de Janeiro-based CBIE, advises companies that do business with Petrobras, two sources with knowledge of the matter had previously told Reuters.
An internal compliance committee had also recommended against Landim's becoming the next chairman on conflict-of-interest grounds, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private internal deliberations.
Reached for comment, Landim said that he decided to withdraw from the board nomination in order to dedicate all his energy to Flamengo, the Rio de Janeiro soccer club he leads.

In a note to clients, analysts at Brazil's Itau BBA maintained their ""outperform"" rating on Petrobras shares given what they described as strong fundamentals, but said uncertainty at the top would create negative noise.
""This uncertainty regarding the nominees to the chairman and CEO positions, arising so soon before the company's next general shareholders' meeting, will likely trigger some volatility in the stock this week,"" the analysts wrote.

The news fueled concern about the retailer's approach to organized labor, days after employees at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, voted to form Amazon's first union in the United States. 
The Athena Coalition, a labor and activist group that is critical of Amazon, posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ""This needs to stop.""
Amazon said it had no plans to screen many of the words highlighted by The Intercept, which cited company documents and a person familiar with a November 2021 executive meeting on the project. The idea was to foster community and encourage high-performers while preventing ""the dark side of social media,"" The Intercept reported. An automatic word filter could block employee messages mentioning slurs, swear words and terms like ""slave labor,"" ""robots,"" and ""pay raise.""
In a statement, Amazon said, ""Our teams are always thinking about new ways to help employees engage with each other. This particular program has not been approved yet and may change significantly or even never launch at all.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Thirty-four investors managing more than $7 trillion in assets have warned 17 of Europe's largest companies, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), that they could challenge board directors over their accounting of climate risks.
The move is the latest push by investors to pressure companies and their auditors, charging them with not moving fast enough to adapt to the world's transition to a low-carbon economy or being clear enough about the potential impacts.
In letters sent between December and February and seen by Reuters, the investors told the companies their accounts did not reflect the fallout from climate change on their assets and liabilities. For example, some assets may depreciate faster in value while demand for certain products may fall. 
The need for faster action to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate its worst extremes was reiterated by U.N. climate scientists in a landmark report on Monday.
""Investors cannot understand the true value of a company without knowing the embedded climate risks,"" Natasha Landell-Mills, partner and head of stewardship at investment manager Sarasin & Partners, one of the signatories to the letters, said in an interview. 
Others to sign include the fund arm of HSBC, French public pension scheme ERAFP, and BMO Global Asset Management EMEA, part of U.S. asset manager Columbia Threadneedle.
Investors have tried to press the companies on the issue before. In 2020, through the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, they laid out a series of steps boards needed to take to align their accounts with the Paris Agreement on climate, including changing key accounting assumptions.
The investors found that most companies failed to adequately respond, prompting the latest string of letters warning boards they faced opposition at their upcoming annual general meeting.
""From next voting season you should increasingly expect to see investors vote against Audit Committee directors’ reappointment, where high-risk companies fail to meet the expectations,"" the letters said. 
Shareholder votes could also be cast against companies' decision to retain their auditors or a request to approve their financial statements, Landell-Mills said.
AUDITORS ALSO CONTACTED
Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), Arcelor Mittal, BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Equinor, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Saint-Gobain, Shell (LON:RDSa),  Renault  (PA:RENA), CRH (NYSE:CRH), ThyssenKrupp and TotalEnergies also received letters.
The letters were copied to the companies' lead audit partners. Separately, the investors also contacted the largest accountants in Britain, the United States and France over the issue.
Landell-Mills said votes would be influenced by the latest annual reports, and that Sarasin had decided to vote against the financial statement and auditor at Rio Tinto's AGM, and abstain on whether to reelect the Audit Committee's chair. 
She added she was pleased to see Shell include a 'sensitivity analysis' in the notes to its accounts, released after the letter had been sent, that showed impairments could hit $27-$33 billion based on average prices from four 1.5-2C climate change scenarios. Landell-Mills said she still wanted to know what a pure 1.5C scenario would mean for impairments.
Air Liquide and Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) both said they were liaising with the IIGCC, a European membership body for investors collaborating on climate change, and that climate risks were factored into their accounts. Anglo American said it was engaging with IIGCC.
Mercedes Benz, formerly Daimler, said it was in ""constant and constructive"" dialogue with the investors and would update its sustainability strategy on April 11. Equinor referred to its energy transition plan as being on a Paris-aligned pathway.
Enel said it would not comment on talks with shareholders. Glencore declined to comment on the letter, but its 2021 annual report contains a sensitivity analysis. 
ThyssenKrupp shared a letter sent in reply to IIGCC member Rathbones Investment Management in which it said it understood investors' need for more detailed information and was ""currently examining how we may implement your inquiry"".
The rest of the companies did not respond to requests for comment.

While many companies have pledged to get to net-zero emissions and are under growing pressure from regulators to disclose their efforts, the majority have yet to align their business practices, including their accounts, with the goal, the investors say.
""We can’t rely on 'business as usual' accounting assumptions as the energy transition unfolds. Along with our commitment to be a net zero investor, ensuring company accounts are aligned to a 1.5°C degree future is a crucial first step,"" said Matt Crossman, stewardship director at Rathbones.

LONDON (Reuters) - Major British financial companies collectively narrowed their gender pay gaps last year, but some went into reverse gear, including UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), a Reuters analysis found. 
Companies in Britain with more than 250 employees have been required to publish the difference between the pay and bonuses of their male and female employees since 2017. They had an April 4 deadline this year for disclosures up to April 2021.
Several financial companies this year also published voluntary ethnicity pay data - some, including UBS,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and M&G, for the first time. Where the companies further broke down the data by ethnic group, Black staff suffered the biggest pay discrepancies.
The gender pay exercise has cast a poor light on the country's financial services, which are critical to the British economy but also one of its most unequal sectors.
Reuters collated pay gap data from 21 major financial institutions. It showed an average mean gender pay gap of 32.1% - slightly more than 1% narrower than the previous year's average.
Despite the improvement, the gap is much wider than the average for all UK employers, which stood at 14.9% in the year to April 2020. 
""Given how important the sector is to the UK, it would be far better if financial services were leading rather than lagging,"" said Ann Francke, CEO of the Chartered Management Institute.
Pay gaps at some of the British arms of large global investment banks remain stubbornly large, which the institutions blame on men being over-represented at senior levels.
Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International once again accounted for the industry's widest gender pay gap among the firms surveyed, with men working for the bank in Britain on average getting 51.3% more in pay per hour than women. 
This was down marginally on 51.8% the previous year.
""I assure you that while progress may at times seem slow, our diversity and inclusion agenda remains front and centre,"" Richard Gnodde, CEO of the unit, told staff in a memo on Monday.
Deutsche Bank and UBS both lost ground, with their gaps widening by around 1% respectively to 33.4% and 29%.
Deutsche Bank said it was targeting having at least 35% of senior roles held by women by 2025, while UBS said progress would not be linear, but it expected to meet its goals over the medium to long term.
Insurer Admiral was the only financial firm surveyed by Reuters to have a pay gap below the UK average, at 14.4%, although this widened from 12.8% prior.
The analysis also included  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), PGMS (a Phoenix unit), abrdn, Schroder Investment Management, St James's Place, Legal & General and Prudential. 
ETHNICITY PAY GAPS
Several of those surveyed also voluntarily disclosed ethnicity pay gap figures for the year to April 2021, reflecting an increased focus on racial inequality in the industry in recent years. 
Four companies - UBS, NatWest, Lloyds and M&G - showed ethnic minority staff were paid less on average than white colleagues.
Aviva showed the reverse, while HSBC and Barclays' data showed close to parity.
However, both HSBC and Barclays provided a further breakdown that showed Black employees on average earned significantly less than other ethnic groups.
Barclays said the bank's Black employees had a 19.2% gap, while HSBC said the gap was 22.9%. 
Both Barclays and HSBC said the figures reflected under-representation of Black staff at senior levels and that they had adopted policies to try to address this.

The government has come under pressure from equality campaigners to make ethnicity pay gap reporting mandatory for companies.
""Mandating gender reporting took us from thirty to thousands of employers paying attention to inequality - people of colour deserve the same focus,"" said Jemima Olchawski, chief executive of women's rights group the Fawcett Society.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd is likely to post its highest first-quarter profit since 2018, analysts' estimates showed, driven by brisk profits on memory chips as solid demand helped to keep prices firmer than expected.
Operating profit for the world's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker likely hit 13.3 trillion won ($10.9 billion) in the quarter ended in March, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 13 analysts, which is weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate. That would be up 41% from 9.38 trillion won a year earlier and the highest profit for its comparatively sluggish first quarter since 2018. 
The South Korean tech giant will announce preliminary results on Thursday. 
Samsung (KS:005930)'s Q1 chip profit is likely to reach 7.6 trillion won, more than double the previous year's 3.37 trillion won, according to an average forecast of six analysts. 
Its chip business contributes about half of the tech giant's profits.
Chip prices held up better than expected in the first quarter, analysts said, despite pulling back after a surge over the past year when clients built up stocks to guard against supply chain bottlenecks. They noted that strong demand and cautious investment spending had given a boost to the sector.
""Solid chip demand from data centres, chipmakers' conservative investment to defend against falling prices, and high-end product sales have limited the decline in memory chip prices,"" said Doh Hyun-woo, analyst at NH Investment & Securities.
Samsung's mobile business profit is estimated at 4.04 trillion won according to an average forecast of six analysts, slightly down from the previous year's 4.39 trillion won but above its mobile profits during the same period in 2017-2020. 
Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S22 smartphone in February, which likely sold about 8 million units during the first quarter according to Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities. 
Samsung has the largest share of Russia's smartphone market at about 30 percent, but Roh said a halt in shipments there would have little effect since Russia and Ukraine account for only an estimated 2% of Samsung's total, and this would be offset by sales to other regions.
Samsung said in March that shipments to Russia had stopped after the invasion of Ukraine, although services such as Samsung Pay continue to be offered in Russia according to social media messages. Samsung shares have fallen about 12% year-to-date, hurt by worries over the impact of the Ukraine crisis on global tech device demand and concerns about low production yields at its cutting-edge contract chip manufacturing operation.

Samsung's co-CEO last month addressed shareholder concerns about its manufacturing processes for chips with 5-nanometre or narrower circuitry, saying they were gradually improving.

The bulk of the pay package comprises a long-term performance award for Baszucki, which was valued at $232.2 million. 
Baszucki, who will not get any other direct compensation through 2027, will receive the award in parts over the years only if Roblox shares achieve certain milestones, the filing added.
The so-called ""Long-Term Performance Award"" is a pay method followed by some companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as a way to retain top executives by tying their earnings to company performance. The plan has faced criticism, as it has led to payouts worth billions to founders.

Roblox, which made it's market debut in March last year, posted an 83% rise in revenue, but a wider-than-expected 25 cents per share loss in the fourth quarter in February.
Roblox shares closed trading at around $50 on Monday, about 28% lower than the closing price on March 10, 2021, their first day of trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Monday urged jurors to convict a former senior Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker for helping loot billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, while the defense accused the government's star witness of lying. 
In her closing argument in Brooklyn federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said the defendant Roger Ng received more than $35 million in kickbacks from the ""brazen"" bribery and money laundering scheme, and must be held accountable.
Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo countered that his client, who had been Goldman's former top investment banker for Malaysia, was falsely implicated by his former boss Tim Leissner, the star witness.
""He never stopped lying ever, and he didn't stop lying in this courtroom,"" Agnifilo said, referring to Leissner.
Closing arguments are expected to end on Tuesday, followed by the judge instructing jurors on the law and the start of deliberations.
The nearly two-month trial stemmed from one of the biggest financial scandals in history.
Prosecutors have said Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through three bond sales, but that $4.5 billion was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a fine of nearly $3 billion and its Malaysian unit agreed to plead guilty. The scheme's suspected mastermind, Malaysian financier Jho Low, remains at large.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to launder money and violating an anti-corruption law, and will likely be the only person tried in the United States over 1MDB.
Prosecutors said Ng helped Leissner embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
""The harm to the people of Malaysia is immeasurable,"" Smith told jurors. ""It is deeply unfair to everyone else who plays by the rules.""
Leissner, 52, pleaded guilty in 2018 to similar charges as Ng.
Agnifilo focused his closing argument on Leissner's credibility, after Leissner admitted during testimony that he ""lied a lot.""
While the defense acknowledged that Ng introduced Leissner to Low, Agnifilo said his client played no further role, and Leissner lied to get a lighter sentence.
""Roger is basically the fall guy for this whole thing,"" Agnifilo said.
Smith acknowledged that Leissner was seeking leniency by testifying, but said other testimony backed up his story.
""What he told you about the crimes he committed with the defendant and others is backed up by and consistent with other evidence,"" Smith said. ""You already know the defendant is guilty from the other evidence.""
Ng has acknowledged receiving $35 million from Leissner, but jurors will need to sort out what the money was for.
Leissner said that money represented kickbacks from 1MDB, and that he agreed with Ng to tell banks processing the transfers a ""cover story"" that it came from a legitimate business venture between their wives.
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, testified for the defense that she invested $6 million in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's then-wife, Judy Chan.

She said the $35 million was her return on that investment.
Low was indicted in 2018 alongside Ng. Malaysian authorities say Low is in China, which Beijing denies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp will pause billions of dollars of stock buybacks to invest more in employees and stores, longtime former chief executive Howard Schultz said on Monday on his return to lead the global coffee chain for a third time.
Schultz disclosed the plan in a letter to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) workers, customers and shareholders at a time when the company faces growing unionization of its U.S. workforce.
Shares closed more than 3% lower. Analysts predicted the suspension to knock 2 to 3% off earnings in fiscal 2023.
Starbucks spent nearly $12 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2020 combined to buy back its own shares. In October it said it would spend $20 billion over three years on stock repurchases and dividends.
Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks locations have voted in recent months to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union.
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. locations have petitioned a federal labor board for union elections since August, when the union drive went public.
Starbucks announced last month that Schultz would take over as interim CEO, following the retirement of Kevin Johnson. Shares of the coffee chain shot up about 5% on March 16, the day of the announcement.
By suspending share buybacks, Schultz is signaling he wants to make bold moves and shift the company's cash flow to invest in growth and employees while trying to fend off unions, said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer of Tigress Financial Partners, which holds Starbucks stock in its clients' accounts.
""You have to take the opportunity to invest money where it will get the best return on multiple levels both as a direct investment and to show what the company's current focus is,"" Feinseth said. 
Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987. During his previous four decades as chief executive and chairman, it grew from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 markets worldwide, according to a news release.

Schultz wrote in the letter that he will travel in coming weeks to meet with employees.
""I am returning to the company to work with all of you to design that next Starbucks — an evolution of our company deep with purpose, where we each have agency and where we work together to create a positive impact in the world,"" he wrote.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said its first-quarter results could top a seven-year quarterly record, with operating profits from pumping oil and gas alone of up to $9.3 billion. 
A snapshot of the largest U.S. oil company's quarter ended March 31 showed operating profits from oil and gas, its biggest unit, could jump by as much as $2.7 billion over the prior quarter's $6.6 billion. 
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) does not hedge, or lock in oil sales, and results generally match changes in energy prices. Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed up oil by 45% last quarter over the final period of 2021, to an average of $114 per barrel, the highest in seven years.
The estimates suggest total earnings for the quarter of about $9.8 billion at the mid-point of Exxon's estimates, according to Scotiabank global equity research. 
Exxon shares, which have jumped 36% year to date, rose slightly on Monday to $83.16. Official results are expected to be released on April 29, according to a securities filing. 
The outlook implies adjusted earnings around $2.29 per share, Scotiabank analyst Paul Cheng said in a note. The total would guarantee Exxon its highest quarterly profit since at least 2014. 
The blockbuster oil and gas profits offer a preview of what lies ahead for other firms' oil earnings. Such results could strengthen calls by U.S. and European Union lawmakers for windfall profit taxes on energy companies.
RUSSIA WRITEDOWN? 
Final results could be dampened by impairments to Exxon's Russian operations. The company last month said it would phase out of Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The oil company has $4 billion in assets at risk to potential seizure and faces a 1% to 2% hit to production and revenue from the move.
""Depending on the terms of its exit from Sakhalin, the company may be required to impair its investment in the project up to the full book value,"" it said in a filing.

High oil and gas prices accelerated after Russia's invasion and sanctions were imposed on its oil, coal and LNG. Global oil prices hit a 14-year high in the first quarter and have since cooled as the U.S. announced a release of emergency stocks and China began a lockdown. 
Operating profits in refining could be up to $300 million higher than the $1.5 billion earned in its fourth quarter, while its chemicals business could decrease by as much as $300 million compared with the previous quarter's $1.3 billion profit.

The investment bank is at the center of an investigation into whether Wall Street banks told favored clients about pending sales, known as block trades, that they were hired to carry out quietly, the report said on Monday. 
Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.
Disruptive Technology alleges that Morgan Stanley leaked information ahead of the fund's sale of more than $300 million of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc's shares in February 2021, resulting in millions in damage, the report added. 

A spokesperson for FINRA declined to comment on the report, while Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Disruptive Technology could not be reached immediately for comment.
Reuters and other media outlets reported in February that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was probing whether financial executives broke the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares.

Veteran investor Botha will continue to lead the company's U.S. and Europe business as managing partner, Sequoia said. The Silicon Valley stalwart has been expanding in Europe recently and opened an office in London last year.
Sequoia's local managing partners will remain in charge of the firm's other regional divisions, Sequoia said, with Neil Shen set to continue to lead Sequoia's business in China. Shen has been a vocal supporter of investment in enterprise tech startups in China.
U.S.-China political issues have cooled some business between the countries.
But the Chinese arm of Sequoia, whose portfolio includes TikTok owner ByteDance and online fashion startup Shein, is seeking more than $8 billion across four new funds, according to a report published by The Information last month.
Botha succeeds Doug Leone, who will continue to represent Sequoia on the boards of portfolio companies and remain a general partner in its existing funds.
Botha, who spearheaded Sequoia's investments in Meta Platforms' Instagram, biotech firm 23andME and software firm  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB), joined Sequoia in 2003 and was appointed to his current role as steward in 2017.
Sequoia has established itself as one of the world's top venture capital firms since its founding by Don Valentine in 1972. 
Leone took over from Valentine as senior steward in 1997 alongside venture capitalist Michael Moritz. Moritz dropped his administrative duties in 2012, when Leone became the firm's sole leader.
""We are proud to be the only venture capital partnership to have successfully navigated multiple leadership transitions over five decades,"" Leone said in the firm's announcement on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TracFone Wireless agreed to a $13.4 million settlement to resolve false claims allegations in connection with the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) low-income subsidy program, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday. 
The department said TracFone, a  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) unit, violated the False Claims Act by signing up more than 175,000 ineligible customers in connection with the FCC's Lifeline Program, the Justice Department said in a statement.
The Justice Department said sales agents in Florida learned TracFone's computer software contained a glitch allowing ineligible persons to enroll in Lifeline. After TracFone eventually discovered the software glitch in August 2015, it repaid more than $10.9 million to Lifeline, an amount credited as part of the settlement.
Verizon spokesman Rich Young said Monday ""TracFone reported these activities to the government years ago and we're pleased to now bring this matter to a close."" He said Verizon ""is focused on bringing all of TracFone's customers, including those enrolled in Lifeline, best in class products and services.""
FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement the settlement should ""serve as a warning to others that we will do everything we can to ensure strict compliance with the rules of the road.
Under the settlement, TracFone agreed to enter a ""comprehensive, three-year compliance agreement.""
Verizon said in September 2020 it would buy pre-paid mobile phones provider TracFone, then a unit of Mexican telecom company  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), in a cash and stock deal worth up to $6.9 billion. The deal closed in late 2021 after Verizon agreed to conditions including agreeing to participate in Lifeline for at least seven years and offering existing TracFone Lifeline rate plans for at least three years.
TracFone is one of the largest providers of telecommunications services under the government subsidy program known as Lifeline with around 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states.
TracFone serves about 21 million customers. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. Lifeline in total provides about 5.8 million Americans with free or discounted broadband and voice services as of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan could lose about $1 billion on its Russia exposure, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Monday, detailing the extent of the bank's potential losses from the conflict in Ukraine for the first time.
In his keenly watched annual letter to shareholders, the chairman and chief executive of the biggest U.S. bank by assets also urged the United States to increase its military presence in Europe and reiterated a call for it to develop a plan to ensure energy security for itself and its allies.
Dimon did not provide a time frame for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s potential Russia losses but said the bank was concerned about the secondary impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on companies and countries. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation.""
Global banks have detailed their exposure to Russia in recent weeks but Dimon is the most high-profile world business leader yet to comment on the broader impact of the conflict. 
""America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. We should prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" he wrote. (For five key takeaways from Dimon's letter, click on)
Dimon may continue as chairman when he eventually relinquishes his role as chief executive, the bank said Monday.
The disclosure, in a report to shareholders ahead of JPMorgan's annual meeting in May, said the bank had found that most major shareholders want Dimon to remain chairman.
The board also said that it was inclined as a ""general policy"" to separate the jobs of chairman and chief executive after Dimon is gone. Many shareholders have a general preference to separate the posts, it said.
Dimon has made something of a joke of perpetually saying he will resign in five years. In 2019, he said the five-year clock had actually begun.
In his letter to shareholders, Dimon addressed the relationship between the United States and China and said the United States should revamp its supply chain to restrict its scope to suppliers within the United States or to only include ""completely friendly allies"". He urged the United States to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.
Commenting on the macroeconomic environment, Dimon said the number of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes ""could be significantly higher than the market expects."" He also detailed the bank's rising expenses, in part due to technology investments and acquisition costs.
The letter is Dimon's 17th as CEO https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2021/ar-ceo-letters.htm. While Dimon is not the only CEO of a top U.S. bank to write such letters, his have become must-reads among Wall Street's elite and policymakers for the view they provide into his political and economic ideas.
'FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET'
This year's letter comes as the Russia-Ukraine war and high inflation are hurting the economy, and as Dimon faces new skepticism from investors over expenses. 
Some question his plans to increase spending on the bank's information technology and campaigns to take market share in businesses and geographies where JPMorgan currently trails competitors, such as in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
JPMorgan decided earlier this year to hold its first investor day since the pandemic began to address doubts about its spending plans. The meeting will be held on May 23.
Dimon has spent more than a decade building what he calls the bank's ""fortress balance sheet,"" and he said it is now robust enough that JPMorgan could withstand losses of $10 billion or more and ""still be in very good shape."" 
While Dimon wrote that he is not worried about the bank's exposure to Russia, he said the war in Ukraine will slow the global economy and will impact geopolitics for decades.
""We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against Russia,"" he said.
On acquisitions, Dimon said that the bank will be reducing stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules ""and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our company.""

JPMorgan has been on a buying spree, spending nearly $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months. Dimon said that will increase ""incremental investment expenses"" by roughly $700 million this year. 
Investments in technology will add $2 billion to expenses this year, Dimon said.

Investing.com -- Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) closed 1.3% lower Monday after Citi analyst Ralph Giacobbe downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.
The analyst pointed to several reasons for the downgrade. 
""We are downgrading DGX to Neutral due primarily to concerns around the margin outlook in 2022 and 2023 on the heels of higher internal investments, heightened labor pressures, and potential for reimbursement cuts as the COVID PHE (Public Health Emergency) gradually rolls off along with concurrent volume declines,"" Giacobbe said in a note to clients.

(Reuters) -West Virginia's attorney general on Monday urged a judge to hold Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) liable for causing a ""tsunami"" of opioid addiction in the state.
The addiction crisis has affected the state's police forces, hospitals, foster care system and jails, with effects that will linger for more than a generation, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said during opening statements in Kanawha County Circuit Court.
""This epidemic has impacted virtually all of West Virginia,"" Morrisey said. ""Our lawsuit speaks for all West Virginians who have suffered due to the defendants' unlawful, callous and destructive conduct.""
West Virginia has accused the drug manufacturers of creating a ""public nuisance"" by deceiving prescribers about the risks of opioid painkillers and said their marketing efforts caused opioids to become a common treatment for chronic pain in West Virginia, leading to an increase in substance abuse and overdose deaths.
The companies have denied the allegations in their opening statements, which Reuters viewed via Courtroom View Network.
Teva's attorney, Harvey Bartle, said that the company's marketing of opioids did not lead to any ""medically unnecessary"" prescriptions in West Virginia.
The state has been hard hit by the epidemic, with a per capita opioid mortality rate over three times the national average in 2020, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
J&J and the three largest U.S. drug distributors - AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) - have reached nationwide settlements worth $26 billion to resolve state and local government opioid claims. West Virginia was one of five states that did not sign on to the J&J portion of that settlement. 
Drugmaker Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc, which was a co-defendant in the case, reached a $26 million settlement with West Virginia on March 30. 

More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies over the crisis. There have been a wave of recent settlements over companies' responsibility for the opioid epidemic. 
Last month, Rhode Island and Florida struck settlements to resolve opioid litigation on the eve of trials. Rhode Island reached a deal valued at $107 million with Teva and Allergan and Florida settled with Teva, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Allergan and Endo for a combined $878 million.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hasbro Inc on Monday added two directors to its board and said it will keep its Wizards of the Coast unit, rejecting calls from an activist investor to spin off the profitable unit and refresh the toy maker's board with its director nominees.
Elizabeth Hamren and Blake Jorgensen, executives with experience in gaming, technology, operations, and capital allocation joined the board as independent directors this month expanding the board's size to 13 members, the company said.
Hamren is chief operating officer at voice, video and text communication service Discord Inc and has experience working on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox products, while Jorgensen previously served as chief financial officer at video game company Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
Board chairman Rich Stoddart called Hamren and Jorgensen ""proven, experienced leaders"" who will add ""tremendous incremental value and critical thinking.""
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) shares were up slightly at $84.58 on Monday.
Its announcement comes one week after Hasbro turned down a settlement offer from Alta Fox Capital Management LLC to add one of its nominees to the board and pick a second member on its own. 
On March 27, Hasbro Chief Executive Chris Cocks told Alta Fox founder Connor Haley that the company was open to considering alternative settlement proposals from the hedge fund but was ""willing to nominate only the most qualified director candidates,"" according to a regulatory filing.
Alta Fox also pushed Hasbro to consider spinning off Wizards of the Coast to boost its lagging share price, something the company said on Monday it will not do.
A spinoff ""is unlikely to create value, is contrary to Hasbro's strategy, and would negatively impact the benefits Wizards realizes today from Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint on a consolidated basis,"" Stoddart wrote in a letter.
The unit, which publishes Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, saw its revenue grow 42% in 2021.
Cocks used to head the Wizards unit and wrote in a separate letter on Monday ""the fundamental game plan we used at Wizards will be the roadmap we follow for the rest of Hasbro.""
The company, valued at $11.7 billion, will focus on ""fewer, bigger strategic priorities and scale, driving sustainable, profitable growth across bets with billion-dollar plus revenue potential,"" he added.
Alta Fox, which owns a 2.5% stake in Hasbro, nominated five directors to the company's board earlier this year. The company said it interviewed the two nominees the hedge fund made available to be interviewed. 
The hedge fund earlier said it supported Cocks but that he should be surrounded by a ""meaningfully refreshed board."" 

Alta Fox on Monday called Hasbro's move ""defensive"" and ""reactionary"" and signaled it will press on with a board fight.
""The Board's desire to continue operating Hasbro like a family business is a flashing red light for change and an obvious indicator that shareholder-appointed directors are needed at the Company,"" it said.

Investing.com – Stocks jumped on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk’s move to become Twitter’s biggest shareholder lifted shares of the social media company along with the rest of tech.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares were up nearly 30%. Musk, who has been investigated by regulators for his own use of the platform, took a 9.2% stake and could take a more active role there.
But investors were also focused on events this week, especially the arrival of the minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. Already expectations are building that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May, especially after a jobs report that showed the lowest unemployment in decades.
Still, the Biden administration is battling inflation and high energy prices, probably not helped that the price of oil rose above $100 a barrel again on Monday.
President Joe Biden has a lot to accomplish this week before Congress leaves for a two-week Easter holiday, including the confirmation of his nominee to the Supreme Court, the confirmations of his nominees to the Fed (including Chair Jerome Powell for a second term), and the passage of funding for Covid-19 programs.
It is otherwise a light week for data and earnings, but first quarter reports will start rolling out in waves later this month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Services index
ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI data for March will be released Tuesday at 10:00 AM EST (1400GMT). Analysts are expecting increased momentum in March, with forecasts of 58.4. February's ISM non-manufacturing PMI was 56.5.
2. Crude inventories
The American Petroleum Institute reports U.S. crude oil inventory levels on Tuesday at 4:30 PM ET. The expectation is for a draw of 3.016 million barrels. Last week the industry group reported API Weekly crude oil stock fell 3.000 million barrels. The API report always comes before the next morning’s release of the government’s own assessment.
3. Fed speakers
There are three Fed speakers tomorrow, following the latest U.S. jobs data last week. Neel Kashkari, Lael Brainard, and John Williams are speaking at 10:00 AM ET, 10:05 AM ET, and 2:00 PM ET, respectively.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Two promising drugs for COVID-19 fail to deliver
Two drugs that looked like promising treatments for COVID-19 in preliminary studies - remdesivir for hospitalized patients and camostat for patients who are not seriously ill - failed to show a benefit in those groups in randomized controlled trials, researchers reported in two separate papers.
In five European countries, researchers studied 843 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 2020 and January 2021 and who needed oxygen or machines to help with breathing. Two week after patients had received either Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD)' antiviral remdesivir - sold as Veklury - plus standard of care or standard of care alone for up to 10 days, there was no difference between the groups in signs of improvement, investigators reported on Thursday.
In Japan between November 2020 and March 2021, researchers randomly assigned 155 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 to receive the pancreatitis drug camostat mesylate from Ono Pharmaceutical Co or a placebo for up to 14 days. Camostat blocks an enzyme that helps some versions of the coronavirus infect cells - including the variants circulating at the time of the study - but did not help patients get rid of the virus in their airways any faster than placebo, the Japanese researchers reported on Saturday. They said the results ""highlight... the necessity of conducting well-designed studies to confirm whether preclinical findings translate into meaningful clinical efficacy."" Both studies were posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
COVID-19 vaccines in first trimester of pregnancy appear safe
COVID-19 vaccination during the first trimester of pregnancy does not increase the risk for congenital defects in the fetus, preliminary data suggest.
Researchers at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago studied 1,149 women who received at least one dose of a vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer/BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) between 30 days before conception and 14 weeks into gestation, which is when the fetus is most vulnerable to developing birth defects due to medications taken by the mother. Compared to 2,007 pregnant women who either remained unvaccinated or were vaccinated later, women vaccinated shortly before or early in pregnancy were not at higher risk for having an abnormality in the fetus detected by their doctors on an ultrasound exam, according to a report published on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
The authors acknowledge that examining a fetus with ultrasonography is not as reliable as examining an infant, and because many of the women they studied are still pregnant, real proof of vaccination safety in the first trimester requires larger studies of newborns. 
SARS-CoV-2 infects eye cells in test tubes
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can infect the vision-processing cells of the eye and reproduce there, lab experiments suggest.
Researchers used human cells in test tubes to grow a miniaturized, simplified version of the retina - the nerve tissue at the back of the eye that receives images and sends them as electric signals to the brain. When the researchers exposed these ""organoids"" to SARS-CoV-2, the virus infected a variety of retinal nerve cells that perform different functions. Furthermore, the virus could make copies of itself in those cells, the researchers reported in the journal Stem Cell Reports. In the infected organoids, genes that increase levels of inflammatory proteins associated with retinal damage were more active, the researchers also found. They also found that younger retinal cells were more vulnerable to the virus, possibly because younger cells have more of the protein on their surfaces that the virus uses as a gateway for entry.

Antibodies that block those gateways and make it harder for the virus to infect cells appeared to protect the retinal organoids, further experiments showed. The findings suggest that the persistent syndrome known as long COVID may also include retinal problems, researchers said.

195,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 03:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -New York Governor Kathy Hochul will soon release a budget that likely will include a plan to make New York the first state to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in new construction, according to Food & Water Watch and other environmental groups.
Officials at the governor's office said Hochul was working with the legislature to finalize the budget, but could not say when they would reach an agreement.
In her State of the State address in January, Hochul committed to ""zero on-site greenhouse gas emissions for new construction no later than 2027.""
A decision by the state would follow similar gas bans in New York City in December and dozens of smaller U.S. cities in recent years as they seek to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy.
In the near-term, the new laws will do little to reduce New York's carbon emissions, as numerous older buildings will not be affected and new structures would use electricity generated by burning fossil fuels anyway.
Longer-term, however, carbon emissions should drop because the state's Climate Act of 2019 requires all power generation to come from clean sources by 2040, including 70% from renewable energy by 2030.
The gas industry has warned that giving up on gas would boost consumer costs because electric heat is much more expensive.

With the economy recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, New York's gas use rose to around 3.44 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2021 from about 3.39 bcfd in 2020 when lockdowns depressed demand. That compares with a record high of 3.63 bcfd in 2018, according to federal energy data going back to 1997.
Gas use by New York's residential and commercial consumers slid for a third year in a row in 2021 to around 1.97 bcfd, the lowest since 2016, while consumption increased for industrial customers to 0.24 bcfd and power generators to 1.23 bcfd.

The lender said that its aim was to provide ""more transparency"" and further clarity regarding its minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC), to better allocate the cost of the eligible debt issuances to the business units.
The change in the group's financial reporting will have a negative impact of 766 million euros ($841 million) on the country units' net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit and wholesale funding costs.
This will, however, be offset by transferring a positive contribution in the same amount in the corporate centre, the lender said.
Other financial costs, primarily the cost of funding the excess capital held by the business unit above of group's core tier-1 ratio had been reassigned accordingly to the units.
In addition, the corporate and investment banking branches of Santander in Europe and other business lines have been integrated into the Spain unit to reflect how the business will be managed and supervised.
Regulators try to ensure that banks' liability structures provide sufficient TLAC or funds and eligible liabilities to absorb losses and facilitate the recapitalisation of the bank in accordance with European Union regulations.

The European Banking Authority has developed TLAC and MREL reporting and disclosure requirements to guide banking institutions as they comply with their disclosure and reporting obligations, and to make that information available to authorities and investors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Valentino SpA said on Monday it has settled litigation with the landlord of its former American flagship on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, which the Italian fashion company abandoned because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a statement, Valentino said its amicable settlement with the landlord 693 Fifth Owner LLC calls for the 16-year lease, for space located two blocks south of Trump Tower, to be terminated.
Additional terms were not disclosed. Lawyers for the landlord did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Valentino had sought in June 2020 to end the lease nine years early, saying the pandemic made it impossible to run the store ""consistent with the luxury, prestigious, high-quality reputation"" of its neighborhood.
After a New York state trial judge dismissed that lawsuit, the landlord sued Valentino for $207.1 million, mainly to recover unpaid rent and to repair store damage.
Last month, a New York state appeals court agreed that the pandemic did not excuse Valentino from its lease obligations, ""even if its ability to provide a luxury experience was rendered more difficult, because the leased premises were not destroyed.""

The pandemic depressed sales for Manhattan retailers, as many office workers and tourists stayed home.
Average asking rents in the fourth quarter of 2021 fell 13.5% from a year earlier, though leasing activity rose 24.1% from the prior quarter, according to the commercial real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.

Investing.com – Nio ADRs (NYSE:NIO) traded 8% higher Monday after UBS analyst Paul Gong upgraded it to ‘buy’ with a target of $32, still 34% higher after the surge.
The analyst had a target of $46 for the ADRs with a ‘neutral’ rating, according to StreetInsider.
Nio began delivering its ET7 mid/large sedan late last month and should launch the ET5 medium sedan in September and the mid/large ES7 SUV in late 2022.
“These products offer stronger powertrains, a better digital experience and more advanced autonomous driving than its four-year-old platform,” Gong wrote in his note.
The analyst expects ET5 to become a major volume model, with more than 10,000 unit sales likely per month, as it has a similar powertrain and intelligence specifications as ET7 but is cheaper by RMB 100,000 ($15,723).
A recent survey by UBS showed that Nio’s brand recognition is on the up. Nio’s consumer mindshare is now better than BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, according to Gong.
Nio sold 9,985 vehicles in March, up about 38%. The company said it plans to unveil the NIO ES8, ES6, and EC6 SUVs in May."

Investing.com – Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock erased losses and traded flat on Monday as the market tried to interpret the company’s mixed set of numbers for its sales in March.
The manufacturer sold 159,328 vehicles in the U.S., a 26% decline from a year ago as most automakers continue to feel the pain of shortages of raw materials and semiconductors.
Uncertainty arising out of the Russia-Ukraine war and record-high oil prices are also weighing on consumer sentiment.
Ford is preparing to roll out an electric version of its F-150, which had nearly 200,000 non-binding reservations from potential buyers. The F-Series line is the top-selling vehicle in U.S. and the company’s most profitable product. The company said it has a high number of F-Series trucks in transit to dealers. It booked a record 50,000 orders for its F-Series in March.
“While the global semiconductor chip shortage continues to create challenges, we saw improvement in March sales, as in-transit inventory improved 74% over February,” Andrew Frick, vice president of sales, distribution and trucks, said in a statement.
Ford’s EV sales climbed 17% in March.

The number of A350s grounded by the airline in the dispute over exposed and damaged lightning protection has reached 23, bringing the value of compensation sought by the carrier to slightly over $1 billion, they said.
Neither company had any immediate comment.
The two sides have wrangled for more than a year over accelerated surface damage that the airline says raises questions over the safety of the planes, with Qatar's regulator grounding jets as the problem appears.
Airbus, backed by its own regulator, has denied any safety problems and responded to Qatar's refusal to take any more A350s until the problem is resolved by revoking deals for undelivered A350s, one by one, and axing a separate contract for A321neos.

Qatar will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend a temporary order freezing the decision to cancel the A321neo order pending a final hearing on the A350 case, expected later this year.
Bloomberg News reported earlier that Airbus planned to delay a planned increase in A350 production because of the combined impact of the Ukraine war and the Qatar dispute.

(Reuters) -When buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC was seeking lenders to finance its acquisition of business software company  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) Inc last month, it skipped banks and went directly to private equity lenders including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc.
Within eight days, Thoma Bravo secured a $2.6 billion loan based partly on annual recurring revenue, one of the largest of its kind, and announced the $10.7 billion buyout.
The Anaplan deal was the latest example of what capital market insiders see as the growing clout of private equity firms' lending arms in financing leveraged buyouts, particularly of technology companies.
Banks and junk bond investors have grown jittery about surging inflation and geopolitical tensions since Russia invaded Ukraine. This has allowed private equity firms to step in to finance deals involving tech companies whose businesses have grown with the rise of remote work and online commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Buyout firms, such as Blackstone, Apollo, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Inc, have diversified their business in the last few years beyond the acquisition of companies into becoming corporate lenders.
Loans the private equity firms offer are more expensive than bank debt, so they were generally used mostly by small companies that did not generate enough cash flow to win the support of banks.
Now, tech buyouts are prime targets for these leveraged loans because tech companies often have strong revenue growth but little cash flow as they spend on expansion plans. Private equity firms are not hindered by regulations that limit bank lending to companies that post little or no profit.
Also, banks have also grown more conservative about underwriting junk-rated debt in the current market turbulence. Private equity firms do not need to underwrite the debt because they hold on to it, either in private credit funds or listed vehicles called business development companies. Rising interest rates make these loans more lucrative for them.
""We are seeing sponsors dual-tracking debt processes for new deals. They are not only speaking with investment banks, but also with direct lenders,"" said Sonali Jindal, a debt finance partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.
Comprehensive data on non-bank loans are hard to come by, because many of these deals are not announced. Direct Lending Deals, a data provider, says there were 25 leveraged buyouts in 2021 financed with so-called unitranche debt of more than $1 billion from non-bank lenders, more than six times as many such deals, which numbered only four a year earlier.
Thoma Bravo financed 16 out of its 19 buyouts in 2021 by turning to private equity lenders, many of which were offered based on how much recurring revenue the companies generated rather than how much cash flow they had.
Erwin Mock, Thoma Bravo's head of capital markets, said non-bank lenders give it the option to add more debt to the companies it buys and often close on a deal quicker than the banks.
""The private debt market gives us the flexibility to do recurring revenue loan deals, which the syndicated market currently cannot provide that option,"" Mock said.
Some private equity firms are also providing loans that go beyond leveraged buyouts. For example, Apollo last month upsized its commitment on the biggest ever loan extended by a private equity firm; a $5.1 billion loan to SoftBank Group Corp, backed by technology assets in the Japanese conglomerate's Vision Fund 2.
NOT CONSTRAINED
Private equity firms provide the debt using money that institutions invest with them, rather than relying on a depositor base as commercial banks do. They say this insulates the wider financial system from their potential losses if some deals go sour.
""We are not constrained by anything other than the risk when we are making these private loans,"" said Brad Marshall, head of North America private credit at Blackstone, whereas banks are constrained by ""what the rating agencies are going to say, and how banks think about using their balance sheet.""
Some bankers say they are worried they are losing market share in the junk debt market. Others are more sanguine, pointing out that the private equity firms are providing loans that banks would not have been allowed to extend in the first place. They also say that many of these loans get refinanced with cheaper bank debt once the borrowing companies start building cash flow.

Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), said the direct lending deals are allowing some private equity firms to saddle companies with debt to a level that banks would not have allowed.
""While that may to a degree increase risk, they may view that as a positive,"" said Feldgoise.

Exxon’s announcement that first-quarter results may have reached almost $11 billion augurs booming profits across the oil industry as trade sanctions, shipping disruptions and surging demand strain supply lines. 
The windfall doesn’t come without risks, however. Political leaders are under pressure to alleviate sky-high energy prices and the specter of shortages, and some already have accused oil drillers of gouging and profiteering. 
U.S. President Joe Biden last week pleaded with the industry to reinvest profits in new wells to help plug the supply gap from shunned Russian crude. At the same time, he warned of punishing financial penalties for companies slow-walking projects involving federally owned oil prospects.   
Exxon said Monday that first-quarter results may have been as much as $2 billion higher than earnings during the final three months of 2021, when the company raked in $8.8 billion, according to a filing. 
Surging oil prices were the main driver, with natural gas and fatter refining margins also contributing. International crude futures touched a 14-year high of almost $140 a barrel during the quarter. 
Separately, Exxon formally approved the $10 billion Yellowtail development off the coast of Guyana after receiving government and regulatory approvals. The project is the fourth and largest in an area known as the Stabroek Block, and is expected to pump about 250,000 barrels a day starting in 2025.
Exxon also disclosed that exiting the Sakhalin-1 oil development in Russia’s Far East may trigger a writedown of as much as $4 billion.

(Reuters) -The two Southern tech entrepreneurs had the two qualities that Donald Trump’s Truth Social startup needed: tech-industry expertise and a politically conservative worldview aligned with the former president, a rare combination in the liberal-leaning industry centered in San Francisco.
Josh Adams and Billy Boozer - the company’s chiefs of technology and product development - joined the venture last year and quickly became central players in its bid to build a social-media empire, backed by Trump’s powerful brand, to counter what many conservatives deride as “cancel culture” censorship from the left.
Less than a year later, both have resigned their senior posts at a critical juncture for the company’s smartphone-app release plans, according to two sources familiar with the venture.
The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’s iPhone app on Feb. 20. Weeks later, many users remain on a waiting list, unable to access the platform. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) Chief Executive Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, said publicly that the company aimed to make the app fully operational within the United States by the end of March.
The company has an app for iPhones but no app for Android phones, which comprise more than 40% of the U.S. market, though the company has advertised seeking an engineer to build one.
Boozer declined to comment and Adams did not respond to a request. Representatives for TMTG and Trump did not respond to requests for comment.
This account is based on Reuters interviews with eight people with knowledge of Truth Social’s activities, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
Truth Social is part of a growing sector of tech firms catering to conservatives and marketing themselves as free-speech champions. The platform promised to give Trump unfettered communication with the American public more than a year after he was kicked off Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube for allegedly inciting or glorifying violence during the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol.
The exit of two executives critical to the app-launch efforts could imperil the company’s progress as it tries to prove it can compete with mainstream platforms such as Twitter, said two people familiar with the company. Like Twitter, Trump’s platform offers users the chance to connect and share their thoughts.
“If Josh has left… all bets are off,” one of those sources said of tech chief Adams, calling him the “brains” behind Truth Social’s technology.
Another source familiar with the venture said that Boozer also had a major leadership role as product chief, running management across technology infrastructure, design and development teams.
Reuters could not determine the specific circumstances behind the executives’ resignations, or whether they have been replaced or their duties reassigned. It also remains unclear whether Adams and Boozer still work on the venture in a different capacity after quitting their executive posts.
Their resignations came before their key roles in the closely watched company were even publicly known outside of Truth Social’s secretive culture.
Adams and Boozer worked at a level just below Wes Moss and Andy Litinsky, both former castmates on “The Apprentice,” Trump’s hit reality TV show, according to a source familiar with the venture.
Moss and Litinsky have been the “senior, day-to-day leadership” running the company since it started last summer, the source said. The two men had pitched Trump on the social-media venture in January of 2021, according to a person familiar with the company’s founding.
Reuters could not determine the specific job titles or responsibilities of Moss and Litinsky, neither of whom responded to requests for comment. TMTG has released little information about its executive leadership team outside of CEO Nunes, who joined in December.
Another open question is how TMTG is funding its current growth. The company is planning to go public through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC). The deal is under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is likely months away from being finalized. 
DWAC disclosed in a regulatory filing last December that the SEC was probing the deal. The SEC has not addressed the nature of the inquiry and did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
Investors have pledged $1 billion to TMTG but they won’t hand over that money until the DWAC deal closes.
DWAC shares fell 13% after market opening Monday on a day when Twitter saw its shares surge 25% after an investment by Telsa Chief Executive Elon Musk. 
Trump’s level of involvement with his namesake company and the Truth Social platform also remains unclear. The former president so far has written only one post - or “truth” - on the platform, writing on Feb. 14: “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!”
Downloads of the Truth Social app have declined precipitously, from 866,000 installations the week of its launch to 60,000 the week of March 14, according to estimates from data analytics firm Sensor Tower. The firm estimates the Truth Social app has been downloaded 1.2 million times in all, trailing far behind rival conservative apps Parler and Gettr at 11.3 million and 6.8 million installations, respectively.
TARGETING BIG TECH
When they joined the company last year, Adams and Boozer embraced the vision for a social-media company with an “anti-cancel culture” mission, according to one of the sources familiar with the venture. The executives believed deeply in creating an “open platform, where as long as you don’t say anything that is criminal,” the person said, “you can be entitled to your own opinion.”
Reuters could not determine the exact date the two executives joined the firm, but they were working on the Truth Social app by the fall, according to two sources familiar with the venture.
As the company sought engineers that had both the requisite skills and compatible politics, Adams and Boozer fit the bill, another person familiar with the company said. To gauge whether potential recruits were a good fit, hiring managers explored candidates’ political ideology, in at least one case by scanning their social media profiles and listening to their appearances on podcasts, that person said.
The company’s political bent limited its hiring pool. At least one candidate rebuffed a recruitment overture, saying he couldn’t stomach working for Trump, the person familiar with the company said. Others who rejected the company's outreach said they were concerned about job security and feared the company and its employees might be prime targets for hackers, according to two people with knowledge of the firm's recruiting efforts.
Adams joined Trump’s company after building a career as a software developer from his native Alabama. He co-founded Daring Bit Assembly, a product and software development consultancy whose clients have included the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and e-commerce startup Shipt, according to Daring Bit Assembly’s website. 
Adams is a “constitutionalist” who believes in strict interpretation of the authors’ original intent for the foundational U.S. document, said one of the people familiar with company operations. In May 2021, Adams filed a lawsuit in federal court in Alabama against the state’s governor, a Republican, and its health officer, alleging that the state’s mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic violated the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions. The case was dismissed in June 2021.
Boozer, also a political conservative who previously lived in Alabama, had collaborated frequently with Adams before joining Truth Social, according to the source. With Adams in place to steer the back-end infrastructure of the app, Boozer brought a strong command of the front-end technology that touches users, according to that source.
The pair kept a low profile despite holding high-ranking positions at the closely watched venture.

Neither Adams nor Boozer disclosed their work at Truth Social on their LinkedIn profiles, which list numerous other jobs and ventures from their past. The company did not publicly announce their hiring.
Adams’ and Boozer’s roles were listed in a November investor presentation as the TMTG technology team’s chief technology officer and chief product officer - but without their last names. When Truth Social launched, they posted frequently on the platform, but again presenting themselves to the public only as “Josh A.” and “Billy B.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan will take full control of the Kumtor gold mine (KGC), its biggest industrial enterprise, under an out-of-court settlement with Canada-based Centerra Gold after a series of legal disputes over the past year.
Kyrgyzstan will give up its 26% stake in Centerra, having seized KGC from the Canadian miner in May 2021. The seizure led to a spate of litigation before a decision to refer the matter to arbitration.
The central Asian country had accused Centerra of various transgressions including environmental damage and corruption.
Centerra denied all wrongdoing. 
""Through this agreement, we have been able to ensure a full and irrevocable handover of our greatest national treasure, the Kumtor gold mine, to Kyrgyzstan,"" President Sadyr Japarov said in a televised announcement.
As part of the agreement, state-owned gold miner Kyrgyzaltyn will own Kumtor and will retain the income it earned from the mine since it was seized. 
In exchange, Kyrgyzaltyn will give up its ownership of shares in Centerra, which will also make a cash payment totalling $86 million, partly to repay an outstanding loan to KGC and to preserve and protect the country's natural resources.
The shares will be cancelled. The deal means Centerra completely exits activities in Kyrgyzstan. 
Centerra and Kyrgyzstan, which have a long history of disputes over how to share profits from the 550,000-ounce a year mine, have also agreed to end all legal proceedings against each other with no admissions of liability.
""Throughout this dispute, we have maintained that this is not about nationalisation ... It was about the specific issues with the management of (the) Kumtor mine. We have always said that Kyrgyzstan is open for business,"" Japarov said.
Toronto-listed shares in Centerra, which lost 34% of their value in 2021, have rebounded by 29% so far this year on expectations that the dispute would be resolved outside international courts, and on rising gold prices.
The Kumtor mine is expected to produce at least $5 billion from the 160-200 tonnes (564,000-700,000 ounces) of gold expected to be mined in the next 10 years, the president said, citing experts. 
The agreement will allow Centerra to focus on its core operations, the company's president and chief executive Scott Perry said in a statement. Centerra owns assets in Canada and Turkey. 

The deal is subject to conditions including Centerra shareholder approvals and the abandonment of the various lawsuits.

218,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 11:05AM ET</span>"," Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) could report a record-high quarterly profit in Q1 from oil and gas prices of up to $9.3 billion, the company said on Monday.
During the quarter that ended on March 31, Exxon's operating profits from its oil and gas business could rise by $1.9-$2.7 billion over the previous quarter of $6.6 billion, according to the snapshot showing the company's Q1 earnings.
The war in Ukraine drove oil prices by as much as 25% in the previous quarter to an average of $114 per barrel, the highest mark in seven years.
Exxon does not hedge nor lock-in oil sales, which ultimately leads to its results matching energy price changes.
The snapshot of Exxon's profit indicates that other energy companies could see similar profits from oil prices, which could ultimately urge U.S. and European Union lawmakers to impose windfall taxes on oil and gas companies.
Still, the final quarterly profit results could be affected by Exxon's decision to phase out of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The move could result in a seizure of Exxon's $4 billion in assets and a 1-2% production and revenue blow.
Depending on the terms of its exit from Sakhalin, the company may be required to impair its investment in the project, it said in a filing.
Exxon's operating profit from its refining business could rise up by $300 million, while the company's chemicals unit could see a $300 million decline from the previous quarter.
Analysts expected Exxon to report earnings per share of $2.12 in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv, which represents a more than 200% year-over-year growth.
Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta said that the update suggests EPS will likely arrive in line with the estimate. Exxon is set to report official results on April 29, according to a securities filing.
""We revise our 1Q2022 EPS estimate from $2.31 to $2.21. We remain constructive on XOM heading into the quarter and view earnings as set to inflect further in 2Q-4Q as commodity prices continue to improve. We see 26% total return to XOM on our 12-month $101 price target,"" Mehta said in a client note.
Exxon stock is down 0.4% today.

The analyst added the stock ahead of its Q1 earnings release this month. 
In a note to clients, Kumar pointed to the recent run in the stock, which has seen it gain 8% in the last month, and supply chain issues, meaning there is less potential for upside to his forecasts. 
Edwards' shares are down 2.7% Monday and 7.67% for the year to date. 
The analyst does, however, have an Outperform rating on the shares and raised the price target to $126 from $122.
In contrast, on Friday, Citi added the stock to its Focus List. Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch added the stock to the list due to the fundamentals of the business remaining positive and the fall in its share price this year."

Investing.com -- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported its first-quarter delivery numbers on the weekend, and its shares are edging higher in early Monday trading.
At the time of writing, Tesla stock is up 1%.
The company produced over 305,000 vehicles in Q1 and delivered more than 310,000 vehicles. The company said this was despite supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.
However, the number missed Wall Street consensus estimates of around 315,000.
Following the data release, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he is ""firmly Overweight"" Tesla shares. The analyst said in a note that Street estimates likely didn't capture the full impact of the Covid-19 related lockdown in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the delivery number beat Piper's 294,000 expectation.
Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner said in his note that the delivery numbers were ""solid"" but missed his estimate of 320,000, which is likely due to the Shanghai lockdown. However, he added that Tesla is on track to achieving 1.5 million units in 2022. Commenting on the supply chain challenges, Rosner said the company ""weathers it considerably better than the rest of the autos industry.""
BofA analyst John Murphy maintained a Neutral rating and a $1,100 price target on Tesla shares following the delivery report, which beat his 294,567 estimate. The analyst wrote in a note that while Tesla has a first-mover advantage, it remains unclear whether it will be dominant in the longer term. However, the analyst believes the company's ""relatively high stock price is justified"" if it can keep funding its growth with ""almost no-cost capital driving capacity expansion.""",

Investing.com --  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock gained 5% Monday after the company struck a multi-year extension of its distribution agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
“Customers can continue to access the Prime Video and IMDb TV apps on their Roku devices,” Roku said in a release posted on its website.
Major apps such as Prime Video and YouTube being built into devices such as Roku televisions and streaming media players are a major selling point for the hardware.
The company had in early December struck a multi-year pact with YouTube, ending several months of discord between the two.
Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its channel store after the agreement for that app expired. YouTube, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, threatened to pull its main app from Roku, when the deal for the service was to end.
Roku and its subsidiaries together operate a streaming platform in two segments, Platform and Player. The company generates revenue from advertising, OS licensing, distribution fees, hardware and subscription sales.
Public fights over distribution agreements and splitting ad revenue have become common in the broadcast and streaming video fields.

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.
The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.
Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.
In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Gores Guggenheim Inc this year.
The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

""Today's partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint.""
Polestar has pushed global EV growth, reportedly tripling volumes in 2021. The company anticipates more than doubling volumes again this year. Polestar expects volumes to reach 290,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2025.
""Polestar is committed to accelerating the move to electric mobility with a fascinating and innovative product portfolio,"" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ""We are delighted that Hertz has chosen Polestar as a strategic partner on their road to electrification.

Polestar is not the first electric vehicles to catch the rental company's interest. On October 25,2021, Hertz placed an order for 100,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. Mark Fields, Hertz's interim chief executive officer at the time, said Tesla was the only company that could produce EVs at scale. This first step in the company's plan to electrify its fleet was followed up by the recent addition of the Tesla Model Y to the Hertz list of available fleet vehicles.
Hertz and Polestar did not share the financial terms of the planned rental-car purchase. The Tesla deal was reportedly worth $4.2 billion. The starting sticker price of the Polestar 2 sedan is $45,900, meaning the deal could generate almost $3 billion of revenue if Hertz pays at or close to that price.
Hertz's Tesla partnership fueled a more than 40% spike in the car renters' shares in late October.
Polestar previously announced its intention to list on Nasdaq New York in a proposed business combination with Gores Guggenheim, Inc. That deal is expected to close in 2Q 2022.

By 9:40 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 185 points, or 0.5% at 34,633 points. The S&P 500 was down less than 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%. 
The Nasdaq was supported by a surge in Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) stock price, after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk disclosed a stake of 9.2% in the social media company. Musk has criticized Twitter in the past for suppressing free speech, and while his initial stake-building was described as 'passive', analysts speculated that he will push new CEO Parag Agarwal to loosen its content moderation policy. Musk is an active user of Twitter himself, but was forced to pay $40 million to settle SEC charges that he used the social media to mislead investors in 2018. 
Twitter stock rose 23% to a four-month high, while Tesla stock fell 0.5% after the electric vehicle maker was forced to extend the shutdown of its Shanghai plant for a second week due to mass Covid-19 testing. Tesla reported a new record quarter for deliveries over the weekend despite what Musk called ""exceptional"" difficulties. 
Musk makes his move at a time when one aspiring challenger to Twitter is having difficulties.  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), the SPAC which merged with former President Donald Trump's new social media venture Truth Social, fell 8.9% after a report saying that two key executives had left the company. Truth Social, which aimed to give a platform to conservative voices, has struggled to gain traction, failing to meet self-imposed deadlines for the launch of an app for the Android operating system. The ex-president, meanwhile, appears reluctant to develop a presence on the network until it has proved itself viable, Reuters reported at the weekend. 
Elsewhere, fresh economic data reinforced impressions that consumer spending is reverting to its pre-pandemic pattern. Spending on durable goods excluding the defense sector fell by 2.6% in February, after a 2.7% fall in January. Data last week showed that spending on consumer services was buoyant, while the hospitality sector added more jobs than any other in March. 
Elsewhere, Chinese ADRs advanced broadly after the country published new draft rules at the weekend that would allow foreign regulators greater access to data previously kept off-limits. The news reduces the risk of the Securities and Exchanges Commission delisting the likes of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) or  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD).

(Reuters) - Ted Baker is open to selling itself at the right price after seeing a flurry of takeover interest, the British fashion retailer said on Monday in the wake of a robust rebound from the pandemic.
Ted Baker launched a formal sale process after private equity firm Sycamore improved its takeover proposal and another third party showed interest in bidding for the company, sending its shares surging as much as 11% to 142.6 pence.
Takeover interest in British companies, ranging from defence groups to supermarkets, is at its highest in years, as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Brexit have slashed valuations.
""The Board has decided to conduct an orderly process to establish whether there is a bidder prepared to offer a value that the Board considers attractive relative to the standalone prospects of Ted Baker as a listed company,"" it said in a statement https:// The company, which has 560 stores and concessions, is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under chief executive Rachel Osborne and has seen demand return from pandemic lows.  Last week, it rejected a second proposal from New York-based Sycamore that valued it at 253.8 million pounds ($332.86 million), saying it undervalued the group. Ted Baker said Sycamore had made a third proposal, but didn't disclose the terms in its announcement on Monday. It has not spoken with Sycamore as to whether the private equity firm wishes to participate in the sale, Ted Baker said.  Sycamore did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. The formal sale process, which the UK's takeover regulator has agreed to, allows talks with interested bidders to take place on a confidential basis.

The two were considered central figures in the former President’s attempts to offer an alternative to Twitter and other social media platforms that many conservatives accuse of being pro-Left and indulging in ‘cancel culture’ censorship.
The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’s iPhone app on February 20. A recent Bloomberg report said downloads of the app had declined 95% since its launch.
According to the report, which cited research from Apptopia, downloads are now at 8,000 per day from the initial 170,000, while daily active users over the last week were 513,000.
Much was expected from Truth Social given it marked Trump’s return to social media, while he stays banned by both Meta Platforms-owned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The fall in DWAC comes even as Twitter shares soared 26%.
The surge in Twitter shares followed disclosures that billionaire and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has built a 9.2% stake in the micro blogging site. Musk himself has earlier accused Twitter of not adhering to principles of free speech.

First, the company announced it has stopped manufacturing combustion engine vehicles as of March and will now focus on producing all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
""In the future, BYD will focus on pure electric and plug-in hybrids in the automobile sector,"" BYD said in a statement filed to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday.
China's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker will not entirely stop producing gasoline engines as it plans to use smaller variations of the engine in its plug-in hybrid vehicles.

More than 40% of insurers plan to increase their investments in private equity in the next 12 months to boost returns, according to the survey of 328 executives overseeing more than $13 trillion in insurance assets.
""Against a complex macroeconomic and geo-political environment, demand for yield remains high, and we expect to see insurers continue to build positions in private asset classes as well as inflation hedges,"" said Michael Siegel, Global Head of insurance asset management. 
Middle market corporate loans, infrastructure debt, real estate equity, infrastructure equity and United States investment grade private placements were other favored asset class for insurers seeking to increase investment returns, the survey said.
The survey found that insurers now see rising inflation and tighter monetary policy as the largest threats to their portfolios.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy by causing a surge in energy and food prices that spells more pain for consumers and businesses and major central banks have raised rates to tame inflation, even in the face of growth risks.
Globally, 92% of investors said they now consider environmental, social and governance factors throughout the investment process, nearly a three-fold increase from 2017.

European insurers represent the only group that plans to increase their green or impact bonds allocation as their top priority this year, the report said. 
The report also showed that 11% of American insurers said they are invested in or are considering investing in cryptocurrencies.

Investing.com -- Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock traded 3% lower in premarket Monday after the company suspended its share buyback program, soon after former long-time CEO Howard Shultz returned to the role, albeit on an interim basis.
The company had in October announced a three-year $20 billion share buyback and dividend program.
""Starting immediately, we are suspending our share repurchasing program,"" Schultz said in an open letter today.
""This decision will allow us to invest more into our people and our stores, the only way to create long-term value for all stakeholders.""
The company hopes to find a new CEO by fall.
Senator Bernie Sanders slammed the company after the announcement.
""If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends...it can afford a unionized workforce,"" Reuters quoted Sanders as saying.
The decision to drop the buyback plan comes amidst a series of challenges facing the company.
While the company now faces unions at several of its locations, it’s also facing surging costs on the business side. The coffee-brewer in February warned its annual earnings per share will fall 4%-6% compared to its previous estimate of no more than 4%. The cut in guidance followed after first quarter results fell short of estimates.
The company is raising its wages this year across the U.S. to $17 an hour, one among many retailers to be doing so in their struggle to retain staff."

MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is buying its biggest shareholder in a $40 billion deal, the country's biggest ever, creating a financial services titan to better tap rising demand for credit.
HDFC Bank's deal with housing finance firm HDFC Ltd, which owns about 21% of the lender, will build on its 68 million customers and expand its home loan portfolio significantly while also opening up the scope for larger loans.
It will also help HDFC Bank shrink the gap with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India while boosting competition in the home loan space as people step up purchases with pandemic woes receding.
The deal will be beneficial for both companies but particularly HDFC Ltd, said Asutosh Mishra, research analyst at Ashika Stock Broking.
""(HDFC Ltd) was competing with the likes of State Bank of India in a competitive home loan market, leading to pressure on margins due to disadvantages to its cost of funds,"" he said.
Following a 2018 crisis in the non-banking finance sector that shook India's financial system, the central bank issued guidelines in November allowing well-run large shadow lenders to be converted into banks.
HDFC Bank shares closed 10% higher on Monday, giving the firm a market value of 9.18 trillion rupees ($121.66 billion), while HDFC Ltd surged 9.3% to a valuation of 4.85 trillion rupees.
HDFC Ltd shareholders will receive 42 shares of the bank for 25 shares held, giving them ownership of 41% of HDFC Bank, which will become a full-fledged public company as the housing finance company's stake in the lender will be cancelled in the deal.
Foreign ownership will account for 65-67% of the merged company, giving foreign investors scope to buy up to a further 8%, something that had also helped lift the share price, said Siddharth Purohit, fund manager at InvesQ Investment Advisors.
""The value of HDFC Ltd is $60 billion. If you strip off the portion of their holding in us, it comes to $40 billion and that's the value of the deal,"" HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, who will head the combined company, told reporters at a press conference.
That would mark the largest banking sector M&A globally since April 2007, according to Refinitiv data.
BIGGER BALANCE SHEET
HDFC Bank is currently a largely retail-focused operation but the $237 billion balance sheet of the combined company will allow it to underwrite larger ticket loans, including those for infrastructure.
The merger, which is expected to complete in the second or third quarter of the financial year starting in April 2023, would expand HDFC Bank's loan book by 40% and the combined company's market value will rise to about $160 billion at current prices, Jefferies said in a note.
HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh said HDFC Bank has written to the central bank asking for additional time to meet certain regulatory requirements such as revised Cash Reserve Ratio and Statutory Liquidity Ratio norms following the merger.
The lender has also sought clarity on whether certain subsidiaries would have to be divested where there is an overlap in the businesses of the two companies. 

J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Citi were among financial advisers to HDFC Bank for the deal, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Kotak Securities and Jefferies were among advisers to HDFC Ltd.

Greensill's supply chain finance firm collapsed last year, leading to the failure of $10 billion in supply-chain finance funds run by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
Greensill administrators Grant Thornton declined to comment on Monday.
Credit Suisse said in a statement that the insurance policies were valid, and that it would also ""vigorously defend"" its position to preserve the rights of the supply chain finance funds and their investors. 
Supply chain finance aims to lower financing costs by allowing suppliers to receive early payment of their invoices.
Credit Suisse bought debt that was issued by Greensill and backed by loans the supply chain finance firm made to companies. 
To manage its risk, Greensill took out credit insurance with a subsidiary of Insurance Australia Group (IAG (LON:ICAG)). Tokio Marine took on the policies in 2019 when it bought the unit.
Tokio Marine carried out investigations in 2020 into Greensill-related policies written at its Australian subsidiary BCC Trade Credit, it said in a statement.
""While these investigations remain ongoing, Tokio Marine has found that since at least September 2018, matters material to the underwriting of the policies were fraudulently misrepresented to BCC by Greensill,"" Tokio Marine said. 
""There was also a fraudulent failure to disclose material matters to BCC prior to the purported inception of numerous policies, renewals and endorsements,"" the statement said.
Tokio Marine had told counterparties to the insurance on Monday that their policies were void and said it would ""vigorously defend"" any legal claims against it.
Credit Suisse is seeking compensation from insurance to restore assets to the investors in the supply chain finance funds.

It said earlier on Monday that litigation related to Greensill supply chain finance funds could take around five years and warned that some investors would not be able to recover their money.
The bank joined creditors of Greensill Capital by filing lawsuits in Australia seeking compensation from IAG, court filings showed last month.

AMD said the deal value does not include working capital and other adjustments.
Pensando, which was founded in 2017 by a group of four ex-Cisco Systems Inc engineers, counts Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud unit Azure as its customers.
The startup makes a fully programmable processor and a software platform, which helps enterprise clients and data center customers to function more like cloud computing data centers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services.
In cloud computing, customers can order as much computing power as needed in different parts of the world with a few mouse clicks. The software takes care of the mechanics of shuffling the data to the right physical machines.
The lucrative data center chip business is rife with competition, with AMD rivals  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp  Only last month, Nvidia had released a new chip to speed up artificial intelligence functions in data centers. 
The deal, which would enable AMD to add Pensando's platform to its line of processors and graphics chips, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Pensando's Chief Executive Officer Prem Jain and the entire team will join AMD's Data Center Solutions Group.

Investors were watching developments around what Russia calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24, as well as risks of new western sanctions against Moscow on top of unprecedented penalties already imposed.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that a new round of sanctions targeting Russia was needed.
""Developments around Ukraine after the weekend again increase the degree of confrontation with the western countries,"" Rosbank analysts said in a note.
At 1152 GMT, the rouble was 0.8% stronger against the dollar at 83.25, reversing earlier losses but still weaker than its strongest level since Feb. 23 of 80.3325 hit on Friday.
To the euro, the rouble was up 1.8% to trade at 91.33, moving further away from an all-time low of nearly 132.42 it reached in Moscow trade on March 10.
""Russia and Ukraine talks are set to continue this week. Despite a threat of fresh sanctions, we expect the rouble to remain stable and trade at around current levels amid capital control measures,"" Alfa Bank said in a note. 
In recent weeks, the rouble got a boost from capital controls as well as from President Vladimir Putin's demand that European consumers of Russian natural gas pay for it in roubles.
But Europe vowed to stay united against Moscow's demand, as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased.
The rouble was expected to stay within a range of 80-90 to the dollar in the next two weeks, Promsvyazbank analysts said in a note.
The market was also scrutinising Russia's ability to continue servicing its foreign debt. On Monday, Russia is due to pay $552 million on maturing 2022 Eurobond and $84 million in a coupon payout on 2042 Eurobond.
In the stock market, jittery trading continued, but nearly all blue chips were in the black after the market reopened last week following a near month-long hiatus.
The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 1.4% to 1,047.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 0.3% at 2,769.2 points after hitting its highest level since Feb. 22 of 2,835.46.

Finam brokerage said in a note it expected the MOEX index to keep on climbing towards a target of around 3,080 points.

Availability is expected to begin in Spring 2022 in Europe and late 2022 in North America and Australia.
For Hertz, the partnership is part of the company's ongoing commitment to lead in electrification, shared mobility and a digital-first customer experience. The partnership with Polestar builds on Hertz's announcement last October to offer its customers the largest EV rental fleet in North America and one of the largest in the world. In addition to making the fleet available to its business and leisure customers, Hertz is extending EVs to rideshare drivers as a way to further accelerate electrification.
""We are excited to partner with Polestar and look forward to introducing their premium EV products into our retail and rideshare fleets,"" said Stephen Scherr, Hertz CEO. ""Today's partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint.""
Polestar is one of the drivers of global EV growth, helping to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility as consumer interest in the environmental and convenience benefits of electrification increases. Polestar reported that it nearly tripled volumes in 2021 and anticipates more than doubling volumes again this year. Polestar expects volumes to reach 290,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2025. Polestar previously announced its intention to list on Nasdaq New York in a proposed business combination with Gores Guggenheim, Inc. (Nasdaq: GGPI, GGPIW, and GGPIU), which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.
""Polestar is committed to accelerating the move to electric mobility with a fascinating and innovative product portfolio,"" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ""We are delighted that Hertz has chosen Polestar as a strategic partner on their road to electrification. The partnership with a global pioneer like Hertz will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements. For many of them it may be the first time they have driven an EV, and it will be a Polestar.""
Hertz will initially order Polestar 2, an award-winning EV which established Polestar's position as a premium EV manufacturer with its first volume model. Polestar 2 brings avant-garde Scandinavian design and leading in-car technology. Polestar 2 includes the world's first infotainment system powered by Android Automotive OS with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) built-in for the premium EV segment, in a driver-oriented, dynamic driving package.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has warned that the combination of Russia's war in Ukraine and China's ongoing property crash could see the worst wave of corporate defaults since the global financial crisis.
A new report from the bank's analysts on Monday estimated the EM-wide default rate would now reach 8.5%, more than double the 3.9% they expected at the start of the year before the war in Ukraine.
The volume of riskier 'high-yield' EM corporate international market bonds now trading at distressed levels had jumped to $166 billion, the highest since 2009 when the global financial crisis raised the default rate to 10.5%. 
Eastern Europe is predicted to see a record 21.1% default rate due to what are expected to be 98.8% and 27.3% respective rates in Ukraine and Russia where firms are now in difficulty due to the war or the West's unprecedented sanctions.
Ukraine corporates have provided frequent updates to investors since the start of the invasion and all have painted a similar picture of their operations: exports are disrupted, revenue generation and collections are decimated. 
China property sector woes, meanwhile, saw Asia's default rate forecast lifted to 10% from 7%.
There are expected to be $32 billion worth of defaults by 29 struggling Chinese developers this year. That would be an eyewatering 31% default rate for the sector and when added to the $49 billion worth of defaults from 26 firms last year, would mean half of China's high yield property bonds will have defaulted.
""Together with a 30% default rate recorded last year, we could potentially see more than half of the sector being decimated,"" JPMorgan analysts said, explaining how ""surprises"" such as hidden debt and developers unexpectedly defaulting on their entire bond stocks had ""blindsided"" investors. 
""While the government has gradually loosened its housing policies, some weaker developers have already gone beyond their tipping point,"" they added.

Notably, however, excluding those idiosyncratic situations, the rest of the EM high yield corporate space is expected to see only a modest 1.1% default rate this year. 
Latin America's forecast remains sub-3% and the Middle East & Africa's sub-1%, which compares to 0.75% and 1.50% in the United States' and Europe's respective high yield markets.

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Monday, April 4th. Please refresh for updates."
245,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. has been called “Amazon Junior.” Those shoes are proving too big to fill.
Both companies are seen as bellwethers for the e-commerce sector and they are index heavyweights, too: Shopify is 3.1% of Canada’s benchmark stock index and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). is 3.7% of the S&P 500. 
Unfortunately for Shopify investors, that’s where the similarities end. 
Shopify provides the software and other services that allow small businesses to sell on their own websites, an increasingly competitive business that skeptics say is becoming commoditized. Amazon is not only a mammoth online retailer in its own right and offers a marketplace for smaller businesses, but it also operates a fabulously profitable cloud-computing business.
That helps explain why Shopify has been routed this year along with many other high-multiple software stocks -- falling 50%, erasing about $85 billion in market value. Amazon is down less than 2%.
“They are two different businesses,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer and founder of research firm New Constructs. “Even with the recent stock price decline, shares remain priced for Shopify to be bigger than Amazon. Shopify remains significantly overvalued.” Trainer has one of two sell ratings on it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Both stocks received a huge lift when the pandemic hit in 2020 and consumers turned en masse to online shopping. But Shopify has given back most of those gains as investors take a closer look at the fundamentals. 
The company’s growth, while still impressive, is slowing. In its last earnings report, Ottawa-based Shopify warned that sales growth will be lower in the first quarter of this year. For the year, analysts expect sales to increase 31%, down from 57% last year.  
Without a true cash-cow business like Amazon Web Services, Shopify’s profitability is modest and its valuation is sky high. The company’s enterprise value, which includes net debt, is more than 140 times estimated earnings, compared with less than 19 for Amazon. 
That’s not uncommon for a young company that’s growing, of course. But therein lies the problem for the stock: Software providers with rich valuations are one of the market’s most out-of-favor groups. It’s a combination of a retreat from high-valuation stocks because of rising interest rates, skittishness about companies that aren’t very profitable, and slowing growth rates after the pandemic pulled forward demand for some tech services.

Despite the brutal selloff, some Shopify bulls are undaunted. 
“If you can look past the next couple of years, you see that there is still good secular growth at an expensive price,” said Jordan Stuart, client portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). “A lot of portfolio managers are looking at large cap indexes, saying I have that exposure, what else do I want to own? I’ve got to own something different and Shopify is going to provide that opportunity.”

Is this 2000? Or 2006 or even 2019? Financial markets in the last two weeks have had analysts reaching for the history books to explain a vigorous stock market rally and rising short-dated government bond yields.
And while some of the analyses can get lost in the blizzard of impressive milestones notched up by commodities and bonds in the first quarter of 2022, one thing is clear: this has the classic indicators of a late cycle economic expansion.
A period when economic growth is strong but slowing and inflation is high forcing policymakers to squeeze the monetary spigots means only one thing: time to load up on quality names.
Despite the 11% rise in world stocks in the last two weeks, utilities and healthcare names have outperformed the wider index. Even in credit markets where a high yield bond market rally has dominated headlines, the top gainers are defensive telecoms and utility names, according to BofA. 
That trend shows no signs of slowing in the early days of April. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields hit their highest levels in three years at 2.4950%, pushing the dollar higher while an index of Asian stocks paused after recent gains.
A strong monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday and hawkish comments by U.S. policymakers has prompted traders to price in a 73% probability of a 50 basis points rate hike in May. The last time the Fed hiked rates by that quantum was in the tech-mania days of May 2000.

""We already have a very important growth plan ... everything that arrives will come on top (of current estimates)"", Profumo said when asked how a potential increase in military spending could change the group's estimates.
Speaking at the inauguration of the group's cyber security academy in Genoa, northern Italy, Profumo said the impact of a hike in defence spending would depend on what kind of defence programmes would get additional money.
Leonardo said in March its free cash flow would more than double this year compared with 2021.
Profumo said he expected NATO countries to ramp up military spending to reach 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) over time.
The fact that the European Union has a coordinated plan on how to spend money for defence is even more important than an expected increase in NATO members' spending, he added. 
Italy will only hit the NATO goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2028, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week, confirming it will miss an original target of 2024 after opposition from within his ruling coalition.
The government currently earmarks around 1.4% of economic output for military spending and would have had to increase its defence budget by 12 billion euros over the next two years to reach a goal established by members of the Atlantic alliance in 2014.
On Monday Leonardo presented its cyber security training centre for security professionals who work in the defence sector, in the public administrations, critical infrastructures and businesses. 
""The war (in Ukraine) has increased cyber threats and has also made them more evident,"" said Leonardo's head of the cyber security division Tommaso Profeta, speaking about Italy.

The government last month ordered public authorities to replace Russia-based Kaspersky Lab antivirus software to prevent any disruption of services due to the ongoing Ukrainian conflict.
""Leonardo is ready to integrate its cyber security services and products with the ones of international groups as a way to offer a guarantee to Italian institutions and businesses,"" Profeta said.

Twitter has an equity base of almost 799 million shares.
Musk is a prolific Twitter user, tweeting several times a day, using the platform to make announcements, talk about Bitcoin and other cryptos, take feedback on just about anything, and attend to complaints by customers of the electric vehicle maker.
His penchant to tweet and make stock-price-sensitive announcements have also landed him in the crosshairs of the regulators more than once.
He has more than 80.1 million followers on the microblogging site.
Lately, Musk has been critical of Twitter for failing to adhere to free speech.
In a March 25 tweet, he posted a poll and asked his voters to say ‘yes/no’ if they believed Twitter rigorously adheres to the principle of free speech?
At the same time, Musk and Twitter's billionaire co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey have shared some camaraderie on the platform while dismissing the so-called Web3, a term for a decentralized version of the internet that is still evolving.",

Musk acquired 73,486,938 shares of TWTR stock, which, according to Reuters ownership data, makes him the single largest shareholder of the social network.
A former No.1, The Vanguard Group, owns 70.38M shares according to the latest filing, followed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management with 64.72M shares.
By comparison, Twitter's current CEO Agrawal Parag owns just over 500k shares of the company's stock, while co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey's stake is less than 2%.

The proposed revision signals Beijing's latest effort to settle the audit dispute with the U.S. which could result in the delisting of 270 Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges in 2024.
As a result, shares of US-listed Chinese companies soared in pre-open Monday.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is up roughly 5%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are trading 8.5% and 5.7% higher, respectively.
The new proposal removes requirements that on-site inspection of offshore listings be carried out primarily by Chinese regulators. The move could significantly help in resolving the audit dispute after U.S. regulators demanded complete access to audit working papers of Chinese companies that are listed overseas.
The proposal is expected to support ""cross-border regulatory cooperation, including joint inspections, which will help safeguard the interest of global investors,"" said the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Chinese and U.S. regulators met several times, with both sides showing determination in resolving the dispute, the CSRC added.
The move primarily indicates China's desire to ensure its companies remain listed in the U.S., however, the U.S. regulators have dismissed the rumors of an imminent audit deal with China.
Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) named 11 U.S. listed Chinese companies that could be delisted, including Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Yum (NYSE:YUM), among others.
The revised confidentiality rules underscore that Chinese companies are responsible for information security in offshore listings, minimizing the chances of confidential information making way to auditors working papers, said the Chinese regulator.
The draft rules now include procedural requirements, which require Chinese companies to provide a written explanation when sharing sensitive information with intermediaries including underwriters and auditors. However, the CSRC expects these occasions to happen very rarely.
The commission also said the draft rules will provide clear guidelines to help companies protect state secrets and hence ensure orderly securities issuance and listings.

""Starting immediately, we are suspending our share repurchasing program,"" Schultz said in an open letter published on Monday.
""This decision will allow us to invest more into our people and our stores, the only way to create long-term value for all stakeholders.""
Schultz's return marks his third spell as Starbucks CEO as the world's largest coffeehouse chain continues the search for its permanent Chief Executive. The company said it will find a new CEO by the fall.
However, the past several months have been challenging for Starbucks after multiple stores unionized against the company for the first time ever since its founding in 1971.
The move comes just a few weeks after Starbucks brought back its share buyback program, saying it plans to return $20 billion to its shareholders over the following three fiscal years.
Some think the decision to suspend the program was made to support Starbucks management, while others, including Bernie Sanders, slammed the company after the announcement.
""If Starbucks can afford to spend $20 billion on stock buybacks and dividends ... it can afford a unionized workforce, said Sanders.
The unionization wave at Starbucks emerged in December 2021 in New York after two workers voted to unionize as Starbucks Workers United.
The union is yet to present official requirements to the company's management, though one of the workers said he hopes it will secure a $25 minimum wage for baristas, in addition to company-provided benefits such as mental health care plans.
The wave spread quickly after that and now more than 100 Starbucks locations across the U.S. have joined the union.
Starbucks stock is down 1% in pre-open Monday.

253,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:23AM ET</span>",,,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported Q1 electric vehicle deliveries of 310,048, up 68% from the year-ago period and slightly above the previous quarter. The number also beat Wall Street consensus estimates of 308,836, as per Refinitiv.
On the other hand, the production of electric vehicles (EVs) was down compared to the previous quarter due to supply chain issues and a halt at the company's plant in China.
The number of produced EVs from January to March was 305,407, slightly down from 305,840 in the earlier quarter.
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a tweet. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""
The report showed that Tesla has stayed resilient amid global supply chain issues and the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic, but also thanks to its new Shanghai plant. Still, the carmaker has been forced to suspend production at the Shanghai factory due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in China.
The company reported 295,324 sales of its Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility cars, in addition to 14,724 deliveries of Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch reflected positively on the delivery report. The analyst is bullish on Tesla shares.
Given its Shanghai facility under COVID-19 lockdown last week, costing the company as much as 2K vehicles per day, we expect most investors will give TSLA a pass on deliveries coming in a bit light for the quarter. We note deliveries continue to outpace production pointing to very strong demand, especially when considering the significant price increases TSLA has taken. We expect investors to be focused on ramp progress in Austin and Berlin, notably on 4680 battery yields, along with stability of gross margins and any updates on recurring revenue ramp for insurance and FSD when TSLA reports later this month, Rusch said in a client note.
On the other hand, JPMorgan ) analyst Ryan Brinkman raised the price target on Tesla to $335.00 per share from $325.00 to reflect raised Q1 EPS estimates. Brinkman raised the Q1 EPS forecast to $2.10, up from $1.94 but lower than the consensus of $2.25.
The new price target implies a downside of nearly 70%.
Brinkman expects Tesla to deliver 1.263 million (up from the prior forecast of 1.246) EV units in 2022, which is much lower than Tesla's own expectations of 1.446 million. The Visible Alpha consensus stands at 1.45 million.
We expect Tesla to be largely successful in passing along higher prices near-term, given its waitlist, with positive implications for revenue, neutral implications for profit dollars, and negative implications for profit margin, although the longer-term impact is less clear, Brinkman said.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney argues that Tesla executed well amidst ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.
We continue to believe the Austin and Berlin ramps will be a key factor to monitor for production, deliveries, and auto gross margins in 2022, especially given the introduction of new product/manufacturing technologies and ongoing supply-chain related challenges.
Delaney also lowered the 2022 deliveries estimate to 1.50 mn from 1.51 mn to reflect the Q1 results and additional shutdown days in Shanghai in Q2.
Tesla stock price is up 1.2% in pre-open Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union said on Monday it has widened access for U.S. exchanges and clearing houses to investors in the bloc, a move which contrasts with Brussels' intention to shut off clearing houses in London in 2025.
The EU's executive European Commission said a number of exchanges in the United States which trade derivatives and are supervised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can now be used by investors from the EU.
It also broadened EU market access for U.S. clearing houses, also known as central counterparties or CCPs, to allow EU investors to clear U.S. products like mortgage-backed securities.
""These decisions are in the interest of the EU - we want our capital markets to be better integrated with other international markets,"" EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness said in a statement.
""We look forward to continued good cooperation between the EU institutions and agencies and the US Securities and Exchange Commission,"" McGuinness said.
The bloc's securities watchdog ESMA will proceed with the technical work needed to implement the decisions.

McGuinness has said that clearing houses in Britain, which has left the EU, won't be allowed to continue serving customers in the bloc after June 2025 under the same ""equivalence"" system that she granted to U.S. clearers and exchanges on Monday.
Brussels has said it wants to end the bloc's heavy reliance on derivatives clearers in London.

The largest EV maker in the world was hoping to restart production as it expected a return of its employees to the factory from a lockdown enforced by Shanghai authorities to curb the spread of coronavirus cases.
But the company will not go ahead with the plan to resume production on Monday, citing no particular reason, as per Reuters.
Tesla first suspended production at the Shanghai plant on March 28 after the city's authorities imposed a two-stage lockdown in the area east of the Huangpu River.
The production halt was initially planned to last four days, but Tesla was forced to extend the suspension for Friday and Saturday as well after Shanghai extended restrictions in the area where the plant is located.
This is one of the longest production halts since the Shanghai factory was opened in late 2019. The plant, which manufactures vehicles for the China market and represents a key export hub for Tesla, produces 6,000 Model 3 and 10,000 Model Y cars per week.
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions and China zero-COVID policy,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a tweet on Saturday.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney believes the Shanghai production resumption will be a key factor for 2Q deliveries, given that the factory makes roughly 2K vehicles per day per CPCA data.

Shares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are up over 25% in pre-market Monday after Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA CEO Elon Musk disclosed a passive stake in the social media company.
The 13G filing, released this morning, shows Musk acquired 73,486,938 shares of Twitter. Elon Musk now has a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company, a platform that he often uses to communicate with more than 80 million of his followers.
Based on Friday's closing price of $39.31, the stake is worth nearly $2.9 billion.
Musk's actions come just a few days after Musk tweeted that he is considering creating a new social media platform.
Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?
In another Tweet, the Tesla CEO noted that free speech is essential to a functioning democracy and questioned if Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle.

""Our concession is linked to a sales ban until 2025,"" Stefan Schulte said in a news conference, adding that selling the stake would not help stop the war as it would mean giving the Russian state an asset worth a low three-digit million euro sum.
At the same time, the German group cannot influence what flights depart from the city, Schulte said in response to questions over concerns that military planes might take off from the civilian airport.
""We only hold a 25% stake in the airport operator, so we are not involved in airport operations ourselves. But we also have no way of influencing take-off and landing rights,"" Schulte said.

""This is an issue for the respective air traffic control, who is allowed to start, who is allowed to land,"" he added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely flat Monday, with investors talking a cautious stance ahead of the release of key minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting while monitoring developments in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 25 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.4%.
The main Wall Street indices posted healthy gains on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 140 points of 0.4% higher, while both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%.
The economic highlight of the new week will be Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, which will likely give investors an update on how officials view the monetary policy outlook following the central bank’s decision to lift interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point.
With inflation running at a four-decade high, and Friday’s official month jobs report showing continued strong growth in the labor market, the Fed is widely expected to hike by half a percentage point at its next meeting on May 4.
Expectations of hefty rate hikes by the Fed resulted in a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverting on Friday, with the 2-year U.S. Treasury note yielding more than the 10-year note, a phenomenon that has predicted recessions in the past.
Investors will also continue to keep an eye on the latest developments in Ukraine, after reports over the weekend pointed to evidence of atrocities committed by Russian troops against civilians in the town of Bucha, something Moscow has denied.
Finance ministers from the Eurozone are meeting to discuss fresh sanctions on Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron indicated earlier Monday that the bloc should extend measures to cover Russian oil and coal, although he left out natural gas as that would run into political difficulties in Germany, which depends heavily on Russian gas.
In the corporate sector, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is likely to be in the spotlight after CEO Jamie Dimon warned Monday that the bank could lose about $1 billion on its Russia exposure.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will also be in focus after a regulatory filing showed that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in the social media company.
Oil prices stabilized after last week’s weakness after a number of major consuming nations, led by the U.S., announced plans to release crude from their strategic reserves in an attempt to cool soaring prices.
The U.S. announced, late last week, plans to release one million barrels a day for six months, starting in May, while members of the International Energy Agency also agreed to release more oil.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $99.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $104.31. The two benchmarks both recorded weekly losses of around 13% last week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,929.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1005.

Workday specialises in cloud-based applications for finance and human resources, and the jobs will be across product development, engineering and data science, sales, and customer services.
The new jobs are in addition to the 1,700 already employed in Dublin, where it has had a presence since 2008. 
Ireland's economy is hugely reliant on multinational firms, which employ around one in nine workers in the country, particularly big technology and drugs companies attracted in part by its low corporate tax rate.
In December, the country's foreign direct investment agency IDA Ireland said the number of people employed by multinationals had hit an all-time high of 275,000 in 2021, up 10% on its pre-pandemic level.

The plans to construct a new headquarters near the grounds of Technological University Dublin makes Workday the latest technology company to establish a campus-style site in the city, after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google bought or leased large spaces in recent years.
""Today's announcement of 1,000 new jobs by Workday is a very significant endorsement of Ireland as a place to do business and in our reputation as a leading tech hub in Europe,"" Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said in a statement.

265,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 06:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called for ratcheting up sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine and said the Federal Reserve may ultimately raise interest rates more than the market expects.
The U.S. should increase sanctions “in whatever way national security experts recommend to maximize the right outcomes,” Dimon wrote Monday in his annual letter to shareholders. The war and the resulting sanctions “will slow the global economy -- and it could easily get worse.”
The geopolitical upheaval, unleashing an energy crisis that’s exacerbating already surging inflation, has put the central bank in a precarious spot. Rates will rise substantially, and the current tightening cycle “is in no way traditional,” Dimon said.
While the government and the Fed did the right thing by injecting massive liquidity into the financial system in its initial response to the pandemic, in hindsight the monetary support coupled with fiscal stimulus “was probably too much and lasted too long,” he said. 
“I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow,” Dimon wrote. “If the Fed gets it just right, we can have years of growth, and inflation will eventually start to recede. In any event, this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets.”
Challenges Abound
Dimon, 66, took over JPMorgan at the end of 2005 and has risen to become the nation’s most prominent and vocal banker, often serving as a spokesperson for the industry. His latest annual letter runs 44 pages, shorter than last year’s 65, and describes “challenges at every turn” -- a marked shift in tone from 2021, when he predicted an economic boom that could endure for years.
The U.S. needs to be prepared for a long war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes, Dimon said, adding that while JPMorgan’s direct exposure to Russia is limited, the firm could still lose about $1 billion over time. The biggest U.S. bank, with $3.74 trillion of assets at year-end, is also concerned about the secondary impacts of the sanctions and Russia’s response, he wrote.
Dimon called for a restructuring of trade and supply chains, where national security could be threatened. Higher energy prices highlight the “urgent global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably,” he wrote.
While long-term clean energy solutions are important, the U.S. should increase energy production and get more liquefied natural gas to Europe “immediately,” he said, noting that these objectives aren’t mutually exclusive.
Bond Payments
JPMorgan and its Wall Street peers have been on the front lines when it comes to enforcing sanctions, as the U.S. and its allies seek to inflict significant financial pain on Russia in response to its invasion. Russia’s continuing sovereign and corporate bond payments have thrust a rare spotlight on the back-office mechanisms that help process trillions of dollars of daily transactions.
“Managing this has been an enormous undertaking,” Dimon wrote. “It is completely different from navigating a financial crisis or a severe recession. This entails sanctioning individuals, including their ownership of assets and companies; reducing exposures across multiple products and services; analyzing and stopping billions of dollars of payments as directed by governments; and many other actions.”
Dimon said his firm is “following both the letter of the law and the spirit of all the American and allied sanctions.” Last month, JPMorgan and rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). faced criticism from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, after Bloomberg reported that the two banks had been purchasing beaten-down Russian corporate bonds.

The JPMorgan CEO devoted a section of his letter to the firm’s investments and acquisitions. “We hope a few examples will give you comfort in our decision-making process,” he told shareholders.
The bank faced investor pushback earlier this year after executives said they expect expenses to surge 8.6% in 2022. JPMorgan has spent almost $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months and expects most of them to produce positive returns “within a few years,” he wrote.
The economic relationship between the U.S. and China is “critical” to both sides, and trade between them will remain after trade partnerships have been altered, according to Dimon. 
China has a “huge interest in making this work,” he said, citing that nation’s $3.6 trillion trade relationship with the West in 2021 as compared to its $150 billion trade relationship with Russia in the same year. 
He also said the U.S. should rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“We need to look at trade as only one part of strategic economic partnerships -- and that’s exactly what TPP did,” he wrote. “There is a lot at stake, but there is no reason why serious, comprehensive, honest negotiations can’t lead to good outcomes.”

266,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 05:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent rebound in equity markets will prove short-lived, one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears said on Monday, advising investors to seek refuge in bonds as economic growth slows. 
“The bear market rally is over,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “That leaves us more constructive on bonds than stocks over the near term as growth concerns take center stage – hence our doubling down on a defensive bias.”
Wilson’s thesis is that the economy is heading for a sharp slowdown, due to a “payback in demand from last year’s fiscal stimulus, demand destruction from high prices, food and energy price spikes from the war that serve as a tax, and inventory builds that have now caught up to demand.” This less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop will become increasingly harder for investors to ignore, as it eats away at corporate profits. 
Despite concerns that the war raging in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions targeting one of the bedrocks of global commodity supply will exacerbate record inflationary pressures, U.S. and European equities rebounded last month, paring their quarterly losses. Wilson and his team had advised investors to sell the rally, arguing that it lacks legs.
The bearish view contrasts sharply with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s team, which has been persistently calling for more upside to equities, saying growth concerns are overblown.
“Geopolitics remains a wild card, but we do not see equities fundamental risk-reward to be as bearish as it is currently fashionable to portray,” JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. While Morgan Stanley’s Wilson doubled down on his recommendation for defensive stocks, Matejka and his colleagues said traditional defensives “should not have legs to a bounce beyond the geopolitical dislocation,” advising an underweight position. 
At the start of the year, Wilson had the lowest year-end target for the S&P 500 index out of all the equity strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. He had similarly bearish views in 2021, which he later acknowledged were “wrong,” amid a brisk rally that pushed the main U.S. benchmark to successive records.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland's Ryanair narrowed the range for its forecast annual loss on Monday as passenger numbers topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time ahead of the key Easter holiday period. 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it now expects a net loss between 350 million euros and 400 million euros ($386 million to $441 million) for the year to March 31, 2022. 
It had previously guided the market to a loss of between 250 million euros and 450 million euros with Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last week pointing to the middle of the range and telling Reuters the airline was well placed for the coming year depending on traffic recovery and fares.
Ryanair said it had flown 11.2 million people last month compared to just 0.5 million during lockdown a year ago and 10.9 million in March 2019, the first time it had carried more passengers in a given month than in the corresponding pre-pandemic period.
That included the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine which caused the cancellation of 2,000 flights and the ongoing suspension of activity in Ukraine, where it is one of the largest foreign operators.
While full-year traffic topped 97 million passengers, up from 27.5 million in the previous 12 months, it was still well below a pre-pandemic peak of 149 million.
Ahead of the what O'Leary has called the ""critical"" Easter holiday period, Ryanair's load factor - a measure of how well an airline is filling available seats - nudged up to 87% in March, in line with a forecast made by the CEO in January of almost 90% by April.
The airline also said it had increased its fuel hedging to 80% cover for 2023, with around 65% locked-in at $630 per metric tonne through jet swaps - a hedging tool - and 15% caps at $775.
Ryanair had previously hedged 80% of its needs for the first half of 2023 and 70% for the second half.
Almost 10% of its fuel requirements for the first half of its 2024 financial year are hedged at $760 per metric tonne, it added.
The expected annual loss would be an improvement on the 815 million euro ($989 million) after-tax loss recorded in 2021.

Low cost rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) said on Monday it cancelled some flights to and from Britain after a new COVID-19 surge left it short of staff.

Credit Suisse racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.73 billion) loss last year when it was hit by the implosion of investment fund Archegos and the collapse of $10 billion in SCFFs linked to insolvent British financier Greensill.
""It is expected that litigation will be necessary to enforce claims against individual debtors and the insurance companies, which may take around five years,"" the Swiss bank said on Monday in a document on its website answering questions from pension fund adviser Ethos.
It said its asset management had taken all necessary steps to collect the outstanding amounts since March 2021, but in some cases refinancing or sales of assets were not yet possible. 
""It can be assumed that investors in the Virtuoso Fund and the High Income Fund will suffer a loss,"" it said, adding the percentage of the potential loss could not be estimated at this stage.
Credit Suisse also gave details of a $140 million loan its investment banking granted to Greensill in November 2020 ahead of a possible private placement of shares in Greensill or an initial public offering that did not happen in the end.
It said the loan did not affect the SCFFs as it was granted by Credit Suisse's investment banking division. 
Shareholder representative Ethos Foundation had asked for more information about the Greensill affair as well as the so-called ""Suisse Secrets"" dirty money scandal in February that raised questions about accounts held at the bank between the 1940s and the 2010s.

Credit Suisse said it had not identified any new concerns related to the latter affair and its actions ""were in line with applicable processes and requirements at the relevant time"".

ExxonMobil said last month it would exit its Russian oil and gas operations, which it had valued at more than $4 billion, and halt new investment due to sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.
The decision would see Exxon pull out of managing large oil and gas production facilities on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, and put the fate of a proposed multi-billion dollar LNG facility there in doubt.
Exxon had planned to build the Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) (LNG) project with annual capacity of more than 6 million tonnes as part of Sakhalin-1 consortium led by Russian energy giant Rosneft.

Some European Union governments are now thinking of new sanctions on Moscow after Ukrainian and European officials accused Russian forces of atrocities in the town of Bucha, denied by Russia's defense ministry.
Germany's defense minister said on Sunday that the European Union must discuss banning imports of Russian gas, a step that would have severe economic ramifications on European growth given the reliance of a number of Eurozone countries, and Germany, in particular, on Moscow for energy supplies.
This talk has tended to overshadow a strong performance from equity markets in Asia, and Chinese technology stocks in Hong Kong, in particular, earlier Monday after Beijing announced plans to remove a key hurdle, preventing full U.S. access to audits of Chinese firms listed there.
These changes may reduce the risk of Chinese firms losing their Wall Street listings, the potential of which has weighed heavily on the sector.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Digicel Group said it is considering legal options after Papua New Guinea (PNG) imposed a tax of almost $100 million that the telco said could affect its planned A$2.1 billion ($1.57 billion) sale of the Pacific's biggest mobile network to Australia's Telstra (OTC:TLSYY).
Telstra Corp Ltd said last October it would buy the Pacific operations of Jamaica-headquartered Digicel in a deal largely funded by the Australian government and seen by observers as a way to block China's rising influence in the region. The operations include 2.5 million mobile phone subscribers across PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa and Nauru. 
Digicel's Irish founder, Denis O'Brien, met with PNG Prime Minister James Marape last week to try to resolve the matter, Digicel said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.
""In parallel with these discussions, Digicel is also considering its legal options in the event that this discriminatory tax is not removed,"" Digicel said.
Its statement said a ""new arbitrary, company-specific tax"" was introduced on March 25, which was ""perplexing not just for Digicel, but also for the Papua New Guinea economy given the reputational and credit rating implications of this sudden, bizarre and unprecedented tax"".
The act imposes a one-time tax liability on Digicel of 350 million kina ($96.43 million) with a further penalty of 50 million kina for non-payment, the statement said.
""This matter requires urgent resolution given its implications for the sale of Digicel's Pacific operations to Telstra but also given the knock-on consequences for all foreign direct investment exiting Papua New Guinea,"" Digicel said.
The statement said the prime minister in the meeting assured Digicel the tax would not proceed and that ""Digicel is now engaged in discussions with the Papua New Guinea Government and other relevant stakeholders.""
Marape's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Papua New Guinea treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey told parliament last month it would impose a ""fair tax"" on Digicel Pacific as part of national budget repair measures, in recognition of the company's high historic level of profitability. The tax was half the rate of an ongoing levy on the company proposed last year, he said.
An official in Ling-Stuckey's office told Reuters on Monday there had been no announced change in this position, although ""they have been deliberating over the past week on the tax"".
Telstra has not changed its business plan for the deal since the new tax was announced. A Telstra spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the PNG tax was a matter for the current owner of Digicel Pacific. In response to Reuters' questions it said it was still awaiting PNG regulatory approvals for the deal.
""The acquisition of Digicel Pacific by Telstra in partnership with the Australian government has not yet received all of its regulatory approvals and has not (been) completed yet,"" it said.
The ongoing levy on Digicel Pacific, flagged by the government last November, would be dropped if the sale to Telstra went ahead, Ling-Stuckey told parliament in March. Telstra had agreed to invest in infrastructure including 115 mobile towers in Papua New Guinea, and other taxes worth more annually, he said.
“Telstra is committed to investing to improve connectivity in the areas that Digicel Pacific operates in, including remote areas of PNG,"" Telstra said in a statement.

WASHINGTON, England (Reuters) - An electric car is a clean car, right? If only it were so simple.
From motor magnets with toxic histories to batteries made using copious fossil-fuel power, many challenges face carmakers seeking to purge dirtier materials from their supply chains to satisfy regulators and investors.
These obstacles represent opportunities for a growing group of companies in the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem that bet they can capitalise on that demand.
They include Advanced Electric Machines (AEM) in northern England, which is working with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) luxury brand Bentley and others in the auto industry to develop recyclable electric motors free of rare earth metals, which are often produced using polluting chemicals.
""Our customers need ways to ditch internal combustion engines that are cost-effective and sustainable without putting tons of this nasty rare earth stuff into their cars,"" CEO James Widmer said.
The increasing scrutiny of supply chains comes as the European Union, which announced draft laws last year to enforce net-zero emissions targets, considers charging for excess carbon on imports, as well as legislation requiring ethical sourcing and a recycling plan for EV batteries.
Globally, the prospect looms of national carbon taxes that could cost lagging automakers dearly, while investors and financiers increasingly favour companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.
""The focus on ESG has become more intense,"" said Moshiel Biton, CEO of Israeli battery technology company Addionics, which makes three-dimensional electrodes that Biton says are more efficient, making cleaner but less energy-dense battery chemistries commercially viable.
""But it's nothing compared to what's coming.""
Yet it remains to be seen how many of the companies looking to tap the market for cleaning up electric cars will succeed in a rapidly evolving EV technology arena; what's cutting edge today could be obsolete tomorrow.
Given fierce competition, any projects not advanced enough at the right time will risk missing their chance, according to MacMurray Whale, environmental sustainability strategist at Cormark Securities in Toronto.
""You won't be able to attract the investor interest because there's a lot of them and they're all trying to argue they're the best,"" he said.
'ROAD MAP TO NET ZERO'
The demand is real, though, from carmakers who face a daunting task to navigate the challenges of making everything from steel to aluminium using cleaner processes, to finding less environmentally damaging battery chemistries.
""We only source new business with suppliers with a road map to net zero,"" said Andy Palmer, an electric vehicle pioneer who is CEO of  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Mobility, a British-based EV maker owned by Indian commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland.
Switch buys credits to offset the carbon used to make metal components and factors in that cost when assessing new parts, he added.
Squeezing carbon out of the supply chain is a ""vital part"" of BMW's carbon-reduction strategy, sustainability vice president Thomas Becker said.
The German carmaker has negotiated with all its battery suppliers and many of its steel and aluminium suppliers that their materials are made using renewable energy, Becker told a conference in London in March.
The problem with EVs is they are so carbon intensive to make, they have to drive thousands of miles before they do less harm to the environment than a gas-guzzling saloon.
BMW has measured the CO2 footprint throughout its supply chain. If it took no action, its footprint per vehicle would be 18 tonnes of CO2 in 2030, versus 12 tonnes per vehicle in 2019, according to the carmaker. But its carbon reduction plans should cut that number to nine tonnes by 2030, it says.
The need for greener EVs has sent some carmakers back to the drawing board.
Pennsylvania-based engineering company Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), which develops modelling software for various industries, has seen surging demand from carmakers seeking to simulate cars and components with greener or lighter materials, such as aluminium instead of steel, said Pepi Maksimovic, director of application engineering.
""There's an intensification of the effort to address these issues in terms of ... bringing better cleaner, greener, meaner technology to the market faster, earlier,"" she added.
'CARBON TAX IS COMING'
Previous corporate sustainability efforts have often been derided as vague and as ""greenwashing"".
Costa Caldis, chief operating officer of supply chain tracing company SAFE, said carmakers were moving in the right direction, but not fast enough.
""Stakeholders are demanding supply chain visibility and not just statements.""
Douglas Johnson-Poensgen, CEO of Circulor, which maps supply chains for the likes of BMW and Volvo, said financing from investors was increasingly tied to ESG targets.
""Everybody recognises they need to know where they're sourcing things from and what they're inheriting from their supply chain.""
Makram Azar, CEO of London-based investment group Full Circle Capital, said companies in the auto sector that ""tick all the right ESG boxes"" should find raising capital easier.
""Big asset managers who have allocated huge sums of money to invest in ESG compliant companies have found there aren't enough of them,"" said Azar.
More carbon levies could help to change that.
Full Circle has invested in Britishvolt, a British startup that's building an EV battery plant that will run only using renewable energy.
Peter Rolton, Britishvolt's executive chairman, said national governments would need alternatives to fuel taxes that raise vast sums, and taxing carbon would help to squeeze it out of supply chains.
""Carbon taxation is an inevitable part of a 2050 net-zero vision,"" he added. ""You can see that one coming.""
MINING IN MADAGASCAR
AEM, based in Washington, a city with roots in northeast England's industrial history, has developed a recyclable motor for EVs using electrical steel and aluminium instead of copper and magnets, thus removing rare earth metals. CEO Widmer said AEM's motors would be cheaper than conventional ones and in carmakers' tests have been up to 15% more efficient.
As well as the environmental considerations, many carmakers and suppliers want to reduce reliance on China, which controls 90% of global rare earths metals supply.
China's dominance extends to graphite, crucial for anodes for EV batteries, which is typically produced using electricity from coal.
Canadian-listed mine developer NextSource plans to start commercial production of graphite in Madagascar from 2023 to capitalise on demand from companies looking to diversify supplies.
Executive vice president Brent Nykoliation said contracts with carmakers should be lucrative and long as they seek to lock in supplies tailor-made to their requirements.

""The conversation has changed dramatically in the last 12 months,"" Nykoliation said, referring to carmakers' engagement with mineral production.

The Hang Seng Tech Index climbed as much as 2.9% in early Monday trading, led by Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc., XPeng Inc. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., which all have shares also listed in the U.S.  
China is planning to modify a rule that restricts offshore-listed firms from sharing sensitive financial data with foreign regulators, Beijing said on Saturday. The changes may pave the way for U.S. authorities to gain full access to auditing reports of Chinese firms listed there, helping resolve a key bilateral dispute that had unnerved investors.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index of Chinese firms jumped on Friday as Bloomberg reported of China’s considerations. Financial markets in the mainland are closed due to a public holiday on Monday. 
“The modification will partially address concerns of delisting risks if the cross-border regulatory cooperation could go smoothly as laid out per the rule,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a report on Monday.

However, some analysts caution that more definitive action is needed from Chinese authorities to fully resolve the tension with U.S. regulators over delisting risks. They add that certain companies like state-owned enterprises and tech firms with more sensitive data may be barred from U.S. listings ultimately.
The Hang Seng Tech Index is down near 60% since its February 2021 peak, driven by Beijing’s regulatory crackdown and uncertainties over the fate of Chinese tech giants trading in the U.S. 
That’s even after the gauge has recovered more than 30% from a record low in mid-March after Beijing vowed to keep capital markets stable and make regulatory changes more predictable.  
“In order to negate investors’ fears totally on the aspect of ADR delisting, we need to see or have some form of concrete actions finalized from China rather than pipelines framework that are still in the midst of drafting,” said Kelvin Wong, analyst at CMC Markets.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning, but U.S. equity futures and Treasuries fell as the Fed could tighten its monetary policy further and Russia faces more sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.04% by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.23%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.44%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.85%.
Chinese markets were closed for a holiday, with a COVID-19 lockdown in the city of Shanghai continuing and a new subtype of the Omicron variant reportedly detected in the country.
However, Chinese technology shares could get a boost after the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Saturday removed a key hurdle preventing full U.S. access to audits.
In Europe, some European Union governments are mulling new sanctions on Russia following reports that its troops executed unarmed civilians in Ukrainian towns.
Investors are awaiting the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due on Wednesday. The minutes could provide important clues on the central bank’s asset tapering plans, as well as help calculate the probability of a half percentage-point interest rate increase in May.
“It would not be surprising to see yields rise further from here and it is very hard to know where they will land,” Evergreen Consultants founder and director Angela Ashton said in a note.
Markets are volatile and there is every chance they will overshoot.”
A stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday also bolstered the case for the Fed’s tighter monetary policy. Non-farm payrolls rose by 431,000, while the unemployment rate was 3.6%, in March. Separate data also showed that the Institute of Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for March was 57.1, while the manufacturing PMI was 58.8.
New York Fed President John Williams on Saturday said a “sequence of steps” could get interest rates back to more normal levels. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview published Sunday that rising inflation and a tight labor market strengthen the case for a half-point hike in May 2022.
Other Fed policymakers will speak throughout the week, starting with Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker follows on Wednesday, while St. Louis Fed’s James Bullard, Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans will speak at separate events on Thursday.
In Asia Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday, with the Reserve Bank of India handing down its own decision on Friday. China will also release its Caixin services PMI on Wednesday."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's southern Andhra Pradesh has cancelled bids made for two separate tenders by India's Adani Enterprises to supply imported coal as the prices quoted were too high, two state government officials told Reuters.
It is the first time in recent years that a major government tender for imported coal has been cancelled over high prices. Details on the cancellation have not been previously reported.
India has asked utilities to step up coal imports to address a domestic shortfall. However, expensive imports could add to the financial woes of state government-owned, debt-laden power distributors, which have overdue payments of nearly $15 billion to power generators.
Adani, India's largest coal trader, offered to supply last month 500,000 tonnes of South African coal at 40,000 rupees ($526.50) per tonne and another 750,000 tonnes at 17,480 rupees ($230.08) in January, the officials said.
Benchmark South African coal prices started rising in January to hit a monthly high of $176.50 per tonne in the wake of an export ban by Indonesia, extending the rise to a record $441.65 per tonne in March due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Both tenders were cancelled because the prices quoted were too high, the officials said. Adani was the only bidder for the 500,000 tonnes tender, while Agarwal Coal, which had also bid for the 750,000 tonnes tender, had quoted a higher price than Adani, they said.
Adani and Agarwal Coal did not immediately respond to emails and calls seeking comment on Sunday.
India has cut supplies to the non-power sector as it faced two of its worst power shortages in recent years in October and March, despite record production by state-run near-monopoly Coal India Ltd.
One of the officials, B Sreedhar, managing director at Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corp Ltd, said the current power shortage was not as bad as the one in October, but said the state was living a ""hand-to-mouth existence"". 
""We have not been able to build up stocks. Even though coal is available locally because of more mining, transportation is an issue,"" Sreedhar told Reuters.
Andhra Pradesh, which faced an electricity deficit of 7% during the last three days of March, floated a tender this week ""for urgent procurement"" of 100,000 tonnes of imported coal, the officials said. 
Indian state government-owned utilities could import at least 2.6 million tonnes in the coming months to address summer power demand, equalling total buying in the last 24 months, other state government officials said.
The western Maharashtra state has floated a tender to procure 2 million tonnes of coal, while southern Tamil Nadu state could float tenders to procure 480,000 tonnes, senior officials there said.

Federal government-run NTPC Ltd floated a tender last month to import 1.25 million tonnes of coal.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada on Monday will announce its support for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s multi-billion-dollar investment in two plants, including one that will produce electric commercial vehicles (EVs), a government source said. 
Both the federal government and Ontario's provincial government will invest in the two GM plants in Ingersoll and Oshawa, said the source, who provided no further details and was not authorized to speak on the record.
Scott Bell, GM's Vice President Global Chevrolet, Canada's federal Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Ontario Premier Doug Ford will make an announcement about ""an important investment in the future of Canada's automotive manufacturing sector"" at 11 a.m. EST (3 p.m. GMT) on Monday, according to a statement.
The announcement will take place at a GM vehicle test track in Oshawa, the company said. GM declined to comment further.
GM said early last year it would invest C$1 billion ($799 million) to convert its CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, to produce its BrightDrop EV600 commercial delivery vans.
Toward the end of last year, GM reopened its Oshawa plant - after it had been shuttered for two years - to produce the Chevrolet Silverado pickup.
Canada is trying to safeguard the future of its manufacturing heartland in Ontario as the world seeks to cut emissions by investing in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain.
Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, including GM. 
Last month GM and South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) Chemical said they would build a $400 million facility to produce battery materials in Canada as the carmaker ramps up plans to produce mainly electric vehicles (EVs) in the future. 

GM plans to have capacity to build 1 million electric vehicles in North America by the end of 2025.

Reuters reported earlier on Sunday that the U.S. automaker aimed to resume production on Monday, citing two sources, as it expected to see its first batch of workers released from a lockdown the city imposed to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases.
However, Monday production plans have now been cancelled, according to the notice, which did not elaborate on the reasons or say when the company expected activity to resume. 
Production at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Shanghai factory, which produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub, has been halted since March 28 after the government launched a two-stage lockdown that started in areas east of the city's Huangpu River where the plant is located. 
Tesla had originally hoped to only halt operations for four days, but cancelled production plans for Friday and Saturday after the authorities extended tight movement restrictions in the eastern half of the city. Virtually all of Shanghai is currently under lockdown. 
The current stoppage marks one of the longest suspensions since the factory started production in late 2019. Tesla manufactures 6,000 Model 3 and 10,000 Model Y cars per week at its Shanghai factory, one of the sources said.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber. 
The move comes as TIM boss Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to revamp Italy's biggest phone company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its service business.
The start of talks, announced by the company on Saturday, is yet another sign that TIM plans to chart a different course to a non-binding approach for all of its business made by U.S. fund KKR in November.
TIM kept KKR waiting for four months before agreeing in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock what the group calls its ""untapped value"".
A source familiar with the matter said KKR will say in a letter on Monday that it will not pursue a formal bid unless TIM grants it the due diligence the fund has been requesting for months, which has become more crucial as the market situation changes due to the Ukraine conflict. 
TIM, which asked KKR to say whether the terms of its 10.8 billion euro approach were still valid, has said the review can only be confirmatory in nature, meaning it would have to be preceded by a formal offer.
TIM's board is expected to discuss KKR's letter and a separate proposal from private equity firm CVC for a stake in its enterprise service business on April 7.

Rome has been keen to merge TIM's fixed assets with those of Open Fiber to avoid costly duplication of investment needed to upgrade the national network, but a deal has proven elusive due to antitrust issues.
TIM said it is aiming to agree with CDP by April 30 a memorandum of understanding to define the objectives, structure and main evaluation criteria for the integration project.

Open Fiber is 60% owned by CDP, which in turn also owns 10% of TIM. Under the tie-up plan, state-owned CDP would get control of the merged network, sources have said, which could ease antitrust issues as TIM would no longer hold a majority. 
Sources have said TIM might later agree a compromise with KKR by involving the fund in its plans for the Open Fiber tie-up. KKR already owns a 37.5% stake in TIM's last-mile network.

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 made a safe emergency landing in Denver at around 11:35 a.m. on Thursday ""after the crew declared an emergency due to a cracked windshield,"" the Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson said in a statement.
A Delta spokesperson said in a statement that there had been a ""maintenance issue mid-flight"" but did not elaborate.
""Out of an abundance of caution, the flight crew diverted into Denver and the plane landed routinely. Our team worked quickly to accommodate customers on a new plane, and we sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience to their travel plans,"" the Delta spokesperson said.
A person who said he was a passenger on the flight posted a photo of the windshield to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which showed the glass shattered into tiny fragments but still held in place.
There were 198 people on the plane, according to KUTV, which said the passengers changed planes in Denver and resumed their journey to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.
Passenger Rachel Wright told the TV station that someone came on the loudspeaker about 90 minutes into the flight to say the windshield had shattered and they would be landing in Denver in 10 minutes.
""I was sure I had misheard them, but I hadn't,"" Wright said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Friday it was assisting Chinese investigators with the download of the cockpit voice recorder in Washington from an China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet as it sent a team of investigators to China.
The U.S. safety board told Reuters it was helping the Civil Aviation Administration of China ""with the download of the cockpit voice recorder from China Eastern Flight 5735 in our lab in Washington.""
China's decision to send a key piece of evidence to Washington for assistance shows the urgency of the investigation at a time when two nations have been at odds at other issues.
The plane crashed into a mountainside in southern China on March 21 killing all 132 on board and was mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. Recovery crews on Sunday found the second black box - the flight data recorder - in the wreckage.
The cockpit voice recorder will likely provide investigators with details of communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board the Boeing plane.
Earlier Friday, the NTSB said a team of three investigators had left for China to assist in the crash probe. The NTSB said ""investigators will limit interactions with those outside of investigation similar to safety protocols at Beijing Olympics, which will allow them to begin work immediately without a quarantine.""
The team includes the U.S. accredited representative Sathya Silva, who is an NTSB senior aviation accident investigator. 
An NTSB spokesman said the U.S. team was traveling on a commercial flight. It was not clear if the team will travel to the crash site in China and for how the long team will be in China but it could be several weeks.
The NTSB also said a small team from Boeing is also traveling China to assist in the investigation. 
CAAC News, a publication under the Chinese aviation regulator, said on Saturday that the NTSB group of seven investigators and technical advisers had arrived in China.
Under an international agreement, the NTSB has the right to participate since the plane was designed and built in the United States.
On Thursday, Chinese state media said the cause of the crash must be determined as soon as possible, following a meeting of China's highest decision-making body helmed by President Xi Jinping.

Information about the crash must be released in an open, timely and transparent manner, state media said in a report on the meeting of the seven-person Standing Committee of the Communist Party's politburo, China's top leadership.
A nationwide safety inspection should also be launched to prevent as much as possible the occurrence of safety accidents, state media said. If accidents do happen due to negligence, not only will the personnel in charge be punished, the relevant top officials will also be investigated, state media said.

According to a document seen by Reuters and dated March 31, deputy prosecutor Lucas Furtado at the TCU said Pires's work as consultant for multinational oil companies ""strongly indicates the existence of a possible conflict of interest"" if he becomes Petrobras CEO.
Pires, the founder of consulting firm Centro Brasileiro de Infraestrutura (CBIE), was tapped this week to replace Joaquim Silva e Luna as head of Petrobras after President Jair Bolsonaro criticized the company's fuel price policy.
Energy industry analysts hailed the appointment, and Petrobras shares rose the following day. Pires is known as an advocate of privatizing Petrobras and has supported the company's policy of making domestic fuel prices reflect international price movements. 
But Furtado challenged the appointment.
""For over 20 years, he has been providing services to the main oil, gas and energy multinationals,"" the document said.

The appointment must still be approved by a shareholders meeting. The next one is scheduled for April 13.
Pires declined to comment on the TCU investigation.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Saturday reported record electric vehicle deliveries for the first quarter, largely meeting analysts' estimates, but production fell from the previous quarter as supply chain disruptions and a China plant suspension weighed. 
""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""
Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, and up 68% from a year earlier. Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308,836 cars, according to Refinitiv data.
Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles from January to March, down from 305,840 the previous quarter.
Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth.
But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease.
The deliveries were ""better than feared given supply chain issues,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a report. 
Tesla said it sold a total of 295,324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles, while it delivered 14,724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.
PRICE HIKE
Skyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars, but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales, analysts said. 
Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-raises-prices-some-china-made-vehicles-2022-03-15 after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-tesla-spacex-facing-significant-inflation-pressure-2022-03-14
""Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said, adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth.
Toyota and GM, Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier. 
Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year, as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year. 

Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide, Germany, in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin, Texas, were to begin in the near future.
The company's stock soared after Tesla this week revealed plans to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split. Tesla shares have risen about 3% so far this year, while GM and Ford shares have declined.

The draft rules, announced by China's securities watchdog, mark Beijing's latest attempt to resolve a long-running audit dispute with Washington that could lead to roughly 270 Chinese companies being forced to delist from U.S. exchanges in 2024.
Saturday's proposal scraps requirements that on-site inspection of overseas-listed Chinese companies be conducted mainly by Chinese regulators.
That could open the door to inspections by U.S. regulators, who demand complete access to such firms' audit working papers, which are stored in China. 
The changes will facilitate ""cross-border regulatory cooperation, including joint inspections, which will help safeguard interest of global investors,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement on its website.
China is stepping up efforts to ensure Chinese firms remain listed in New York. 
The commission said on Thursday that Chinese and U.S. regulators had held multiple rounds of meetings and both sides had a willingness to solve their audit dispute. 
But U.S. securities and audit regulators have pushed back on speculation of an imminent audit deal with China. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) identified 11 U.S.-traded Chinese companies, including Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Yum China, that face delisting risks. 
STATE SECRETS 
The draft rules make clear that Chinese companies are responsible for information security in overseas listings, reducing the chance that confidential information unnecessarily enters auditors' working papers, CSRC said.
""Procedural requirements"" are added to the rules, demanding Chinese companies provide written explanation when they provide ""sensitive information"" to intermediaries, such as underwriters and auditors, although such situations should be ""very rare"", based on experience, according to the watchdog.
CSRC said the rules will offer clear guidance on how to protect state secrets, leading to ""orderly"" securities issuance and listing activities by Chinese companies.
The current confidentiality rules, which were published in 2009 by the CSRC, the state secrets bureau and the archives bureau, are outdated, CSRC added.

Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures.
In mid-March, Vice Premier Liu He said talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators over offshore listing issues had made progress and both sides were working on specific cooperation plans.

Evergrande has resumed work at 734 developments in all of China as of March 27, including 424 projects recovering to normal construction levels, according to a post on Saturday on the official WeChat of the developer's Pearl River Delta business unit. The post did not give a figure for Evergrande's total number of developments.
Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer, with over $300 billion in liabilities. It is struggling to repay bondholders, banks, suppliers, and deliver homes to buyers, epitomising a bloated industry suffering from the Chinese government's deleveraging campaign.
Evergrande will ""continue to maintain the normal construction of the projects in order to deliver the buildings to the owners with guaranteed quality and quantity at all costs,"" according to the post.
Company Chairman Hui Ka Yan has pledged multiple times since 2021 that the company would resume construction work at full steam to ensure home deliveries.

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, will act as the company's top leader and head Huawei's board of directors for six months when it is her turn. The announcement did not specify when her term would begin.
The rotating chairmen are Eric Xu and Ken Hu. Meng is also deputy chairwoman and will remain CFO, according to the company's website. 
""The company is optimizing and refining its internal governance structure to make sure the company is built to last,"" a Huawei spokesperson said. ""The supervisory board is responsible for the company's survival, development and long-term prospects.""
Meng, whose English name is Sabrina, played a central role in the company's tussle with the United States, having been detained in Canada in 2018 over alleged attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.

The United States then imposed a series of trade restrictions on the company throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns. This impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses.
Meng was allowed to return to China in September after an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end a bank fraud case.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. stock market ends a rocky first quarter, investors are looking at what could support equities in the coming months - with high cash levels at companies one potential boost as executives deploy resources for share buybacks, dividends or deals.
The S&P 500 posted its first quarterly loss since the beginning of the pandemic, although it rebounded in March, reducing the benchmark index's year-to-date decline to about 5% from as much as 12.5% at the quarter's low point.
The outlook for stocks is still threatened by rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, as well as by spiking inflation and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine. The ability of companies to deploy cash could help soothe investors about some of that unease.
“While cash levels are off the highs from last year, they are still well above the pandemic levels and remain supportive for buybacks, dividends and M&A, which are all shareholder friendly activities,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.
Company plans to deploy their cash could become more clear in the coming weeks as they report first-quarter results, which are expected to show a 6.4% increase in S&P 500 company profits, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Cash levels have risen as companies were cautious spenders during the pandemic, while corporate cash flow margins have been expanding in the past decade, strategists said.
Since peaking at just over $2 trillion in early 2021, cash on S&P 500 company balance sheets has dipped to about $1.9 trillion, according to Truist. But that remains well above $1.5 trillion, where it stood at the end of 2019 before the pandemic. 
“Cash levels, whether it’s cash on balance sheets or even the ability of companies to tap capital markets if necessary, remain very robust,” said Patrick Palfrey, a senior equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
In a recent report titled ""The bull case for stocks,"" Credit Suisse strategists said they ""would expect both buybacks and dividends to increase over the next 12-24 months, a boost to EPS and share prices."" 
S&P 500 company share buybacks came in at $881.7 billion in 2021, a record amount and up nearly 70% from 2020, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The amount of announced buybacks this year has been tracking ahead of last year, according to TrimTabs, with $298.9 billion announced as of March 29, compared to $269.8 billion at that point a year ago.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) projects that corporations will be the largest source of equity demand in 2022. The bank this month raised its 2022 S&P 500 forecast for buybacks to $1 trillion.
""High cash balances and solid EPS growth will support robust corporate demand this year,"" Goldman said in a recent report.
Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, said he doubted buybacks would be ""big enough to either prevent a bear market or further fuel big gains in the stock market.""
""However, it’s a nice steady tailwind to share prices if in fact share buybacks continue to be on pace for a record,"" Arone said. ""It certainly helps, it’s a positive.”
U.S. President Joe Biden's 2023 budget plan, announced on Monday, took aim at buybacks, seeking to discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stocks in order to benefit executives.
U.S. mergers and acquisitions totaled $2.5 trillion last year, the largest full-year period since records began in 1980, according to Refinitiv Deals Intelligence.
So far U.S. M&A has slowed versus last year, with activity down 20% to $516.8 billion from the same period a year ago, according to Deals Intelligence. Investors will be eager to see whether companies pick up the pace.
When it comes to use of cash, “M&A and buybacks are more volatile and they both signal a certain element of corporate executive confidence,"" Arone said. ""Both are coming off record highs, so if that trend continues that should be a good sign for the markets.”
Some market watchers were wary of overstating the impact that large cash positions could have on the market. 
For example, concerns about economic growth were set off anew this week when a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted, which has historically been a reliable signal of a looming recession. Indeed, that signal could make companies more cautious about deploying cash, some have said.

While having more cash on hand could help more companies survive an economic slowdown, it might not significantly stem stock declines, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""More companies might make it through the next downturn but that doesn’t mean you couldn’t have a big pullback in stocks during the next downturn,"" Samana said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Government bond yields resumed their upward climb on Friday as a key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted once more on signs of persistent inflation, while falling oil prices ended the week with their sharpest weekly drop in two years.
U.S. data released on Friday showed employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, continuing a strong run of hiring that has left key aspects of the American labor market ""little different"" from where they were before the COVID-19 pandemic.
With U.S. economic growth so robust and inflation running at three times the Federal Reserve's 2% target, investors are widely expecting a drum roll of interest rate rises this year.
Treasury yields, which retreated earlier in the week as portfolio adjustments boosted demand for bonds, spiked again on Friday, causing a closely watched part of the yield curve to invert for the third time this week.
An inversion of the yield curve, when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated ones, is seen as a harbinger of a recession in the next one or two years.
""Today's solid growth of payrolls checked the box for the Fed in its drive toward fighting inflation,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income. ""Consequently, the Fed looks clearly undeterred in reaching at least policy neutrality and probably will do at least one and maybe two 50-basis-point rate hikes by the June ... meeting, which could even include an inter-meeting hike.""
Bets that aggressive monetary tightening could be in the cards did not drag equity markets lower on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Workers at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in New York City voted to form the first union at the second-largest U.S. private employer, a victory that adds to recent grassroots successes by labor activists pushing into new industries.
Employees at the online retailer's fulfillment center in the borough of Staten Island, known as JFK8, secured a majority by voting 2,654 to 2,131 in support of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), or about 55% in favor, according to a count released on Friday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
The vote represented a victory for U.S. organized labor and a milestone for labor advocates, who for years have considered Amazon's labor practices a threat to workers. Union organizer Christian Smalls, dressed all in Amazon Labor Union red, raised a hand in victory after the win, while ALU members popped champagne in celebration. 
""We're disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
The company added that it is evaluating options including filing objections based on what it called inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB. A spokesperson for the NLRB noted that it is an independent federal agency and said its actions have been consistent with its congressional mandate.
Shares of Amazon closed at $3,271.20, up less than 1% on the day.
Assuming the vote clears any objections and the union is certified by the NLRB as representing employees, union negotiators would still have to bargain with Amazon in order to deliver on expectations of better compensation and working conditions.
Geebah Sando, a package sorter who voted for the union after working more than two years at JFK8, said he was thrilled. 
""With the union together, we are united,"" Sando said, adding that the labor group could help workers advocate for better pay, break and vacation time.
Many doubted Smalls when he announced plans to unionize JFK8 last year, but he set up a tent outside the warehouse while supporters in the building touted how a union could demand higher wages, safer conditions and job security.
Amazon was founded in 1994 as a small virtual bookstore by now-billionaire Jeff Bezos. The company in mid-2021 said it had just under a million U.S. employees, and it now has a market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the No. 1 U.S. private employer, has nearly 1.6 million U.S. employees, and is not unionized.
Dan Cornfield, a labor expert and professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University, called the vote a ""momentous victory for working people who are doing homegrown union organizing."" Cornfield said he expects the win to accelerate the already rapidly growing labor activism across the U.S. retail sector.
""It's almost like a David and Goliath type of victory,"" Cornfield said. ""There's already a wave (of activism) occurring, and this will encourage more of that.""
'A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE'
U.S. President Joe Biden was glad to see Amazon workers' voices were heard, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Biden believes that ""every worker in every state should have a free and fair choice to join a union"" and that Amazon workers on Staten Island ""made their choice to organize a grassroots union, bargain for better jobs and a better life.""
Other recent labor drives are picking up momentum. Nine U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores have voted to organize, with more than 150 more seeking elections. 
At an Amazon facility in Alabama, by contrast, a majority of workers rejected unionization, though the outcome was not final.
The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result, the NLRB said. The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionizing.

Amazon workers responded to more in-person outreach by labor activists as the pandemic subsided. A second company warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote on whether to unionize starting on April 25.
The number of employees eligible to participate in the Staten Island vote was 8,325, the NLRB said.

(Reuters) -The COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortage, Black Lives Matter movement and other social and economic forces have contributed to an uptick in high-profile union organizing across the United States including a victory on Friday at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in New York City.
Among U.S. wage and salary workers last year, 10.3% were in a union - half of the 1983 percentage - and union membership in the private sector including Amazon and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) was just 6.1% last year. There were 149 union elections in January and February of this year, compared to 103 in the same two months last year. 
Here is a look at some notable recent union victories.
AMAZON
Workers at an Amazon.com facility in New York City's Staten Island on Friday voted in favor of forming a union, making it the online retailer's first U.S. facility to organize.
The victory by a new, independent union at the No. 2 U.S. private employer adds to recent successes by labor activists pushing into new industries. Not all labor drives are successful, including the preliminary result of a ballot count at Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama. 
STARBUCKS
Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks locations have voted in recent months to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. The cafes include five in Buffalo, New York; two in Mesa, Arizona; one each in Seattle and Knoxville, Tennessee; and a Starbucks Reserve Roastery in New York City.
At least 170 others had petitioned for elections as of Friday. Ballot counts are scheduled for more than a dozen other cafes in the next couple weeks.
Starbucks beat back the union in one Buffalo store.
NEW YORK TIMES
About 600 designers, software engineers, data analysts and other tech employees at the New York Times voted in March to join the NewsGuild of New York, which has won a number of other elections in the past two years.
The March results created the largest union of tech workers in the United States with bargaining rights. The NewsGuild also represents Reuters' U.S. journalists.
GOOGLE FIBER
Contractors for the high-speed internet provider Google Fiber, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, in Kansas City, Missouri voted last week to unionize. While only 10 workers are involved, it was the first group of Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) with bargaining rights.
AWU said it has 800 members since launching just over a year ago, but those members do not have the right to collectively bargain.
CANNABIS INDUSTRY
In June, the United Food and Commercial Workers reached agreements with cannabis lab Sonoma Lab Works and cannabis manufacturer CannaCraft Manufacturing to unionize their workers in California.
As the number of cannabis growers and dispensaries have grown, so too have union drives in the industry. UFCW said it is now the largest cannabis workers union in the United States with more than 10,000 members.

SILICON VALLEY
In 2020, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter's employees voted to join a union, the first big tech company to do so. Workers at location data startup Mapbox in August lost their bid to form a union.

(Reuters) - A vote by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers to organize their warehouse in New York surprised and inspired long-time labor backers, for whom a new reality is settling in: It can be done, though it won't be easy.
News on Friday of the first-ever U.S. union coming to the nation's second-largest private employer ricocheted among labor groups as they began to see a path ahead to enlist workers and end decades of contraction in their ranks.
Amazon now seems a more manageable target for them, though still a challenging one. Some 55% of votes cast at the Staten Island facility were for the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a new group headed by the online retailer's former employee Christian Smalls. 
The company said it may file objections, and if and when the ALU's victory is finalized, it still must win a contract.
That can be as hard as winning an election, said Gregory DeFreitas, a professor of labor economics at Hofstra University.
Amazon spent more than $4 million on labor consultants in 2021 to try to sway workers, according to a government filing. 
""Amazon just has sort of tremendous resources with which to fight unions and tremendous determination to do whatever is necessary in order to remain union-free,"" said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who studies anti-union actions.
Duplicating the success at Amazon could be difficult. Local knowledge and warehouse experience helped the ALU's leadership, who at times distanced their work from that of national labor groups.
""The leaders workers know and trust - that's what wins,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, who advised some unions on organizing Amazon. Flickinger said he expects union efforts to focus on more warehouses and Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores, adding that unions would need to replenish depleted bank accounts to organize.
The New York win builds on several recent ones at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops. It also helps create a view that the labor movement is changing. The ALU brought innovative organizing tactics to bear, building momentum through social media, said Joshua Freeman, a history professor at the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. 
The ALU raised money through a GoFundMe account. 
At the same time, traditional unions are reaching out to help ALU leader Smalls. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is offering ""whatever support we can,"" said its president, Mary Kay Henry.
'SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE'
The invigorated purpose was palpable among union leaders on Friday.
The Teamsters, a dogged opponent of Amazon for years that had yet to unionize one of its U.S. sites, is continuing to bring their fight ""on the shop floor, at the bargaining table and on the streets,"" General President Sean O'Brien said after the ALU's victory.
People shouted and jumped for joy at the national offices of the SEIU.
""This will spread like wildfire,"" Henry said in an interview. ""It's a huge source of inspiration to workers that are battling the five major corporations in the airline industry, the workers that are battling Starbucks.""
Though not yet final, a losing union vote at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama caused some to fret that the ALU's victory could happen only in a labor-friendly state like New York. Not so, said Logan, the labor professor.

The next battle will be in Staten Island this month at a second Amazon site, but some of the company's grocery workers are organizing in Seattle, as are employees or contractors elsewhere.
""All of a sudden, it doesn't seem so futile to try and form a union at Amazon anymore,"" said Logan, adding, ""If you can win at Amazon, you can win anywhere.""

The additions https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2022-07284.pdf to the Commerce Department's entity list follow several similar actions taken by the United States to weaken the Russian military since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Friday's action aims to ""degrade Russian and Belarusian defense, aerospace, maritime, and other strategic sectors in response to Russia's brutal assault on the sovereignty of Ukraine,"" the Commerce Department said.
The White House has argued the controls would help prevent technology and software reaching military sectors in Russia and Belarus. 
""These parties are being effectively cut off from the inputs necessary to sustain Putin's war,"" said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in a statement. 
The controls rely on a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a license from the United States before shipping to Russia.

The measures also instruct the Commerce Department to deny almost all of those license requests.
In total, the Commerce Department has added 260 entities to the entity list in response to the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation.""

(Reuters) - U.S. automakers on Friday reported a slump in first-quarter domestic sales, as the entire industry was slammed by chip shortages and disruptions to supply chains. 
 Toyota , which in 2021 upstaged GM as the top-selling automaker in the United States, outsold the company in the first quarter on increased demand for its Lexus hybrid and electric vehicles. 
South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors and Japan's Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp all posted a drop in overall U.S. quarterly auto sales. Hyundai said electrified vehicle retail sales surged 241% in the January-March period from a year earlier. 
""If gas prices remain high, that's going to continue to push consumers toward green technology,"" said Randy Parker, Hyundai's senior vice president for U.S. sales. 
""Skyrocketing gas prices were top of mind for consumers in March, but the lack of inventory is what ultimately depressed new vehicle sales in the first quarter,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. 
She said inventory issues will persist well into the rest of the year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine would add to supply chain challenges. 
Jack Hollis, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) North America, said he does not expect a major, long-term shift in the U.S. vehicle market – where about three-quarters of new vehicles sold are trucks and SUVs. 
Sales of some large SUVs and trucks held up. GM reported sales of its largest and most expensive SUVs, the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade, rose during the quarter from a year ago.
Detroit-based GM said quarterly sales fell 20.1% to 512,846 vehicles and its shares fell 1.8%. 
GM said improved semiconductor supplies helped production in the quarter, but it expects inventory to remain relatively low throughout the year due to high demand. Automakers are encouraged by the strong U.S. job market. 

The company's chief economist said in a statement that ""ordinarily, a U.S. economy this strong would translate into light-vehicle sales in the 17-million range.” 
U.S. new-vehicle sales in March finished at 1.25 million, with an annual sales rate of 13.33 million, according to Wards Intelligence.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank employees began an indefinite strike for a wage increase on Friday, threatening the stability of the wildly popular Pix instant payment system and the publication of data releases.
With Brazilian inflation reaching double digits, public sector strikes have become more common in recent months, disrupting the government's day-to-day operations and causing headaches for President Jair Bolsonaro as he seeks re-election in October.
The strike is taking place while central bank head Roberto Campos Neto is in Miami on a pre-scheduled vacation. 
Brazil's central bank employees voted on Monday for an indefinite strike starting on April 1, citing unanswered wage increase demands.
In a statement, Fabio Faiad, president of the workers' union SINAL, said he expected 60%-70% of workers to adhere to the strike.
The central bank said on Friday that its Focus Survey of economists will not be published on the expected date next week, nor will data on foreign exchange flows and Brazilian savings accounts. It did not say when publication will resume. 
In his statement on Friday, Faiad also bemoaned the timing of Campos Neto's vacation.
""Sadly, during such an important moment, the president of the central bank went on vacation to Miami, which does not help at all for us to find a solution to this crisis,"" Faiad said.
Campos Neto, who has been on vacation since Thursday, met virtually with workers' representatives on Tuesday, but Faiad said the meeting was ""a fiasco,"" with no proposals.
The central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The central bank's Pix payment system has been a huge success in Brazil, and has won international plaudits. The system is ​​free of charge for individuals and allows instant payments and transfers. 
Just 15 months after its launch, it has been used by 114 million individuals in Brazil - 67% of the adult population - moving 6.7 trillion reais ($1.36 trillion) and recently surpassing the level of credit and debit cards.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday to start a new quarter after the release of the much anticipated monthly official jobs report.
At 4:55 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all closing down more than 1.5%. 
The three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020, with the Dow and S&P 500 declining 4.6% and 4.9% and the Nasdaq dropping more than 9%, as a hawkish Federal Reserve and soaring consumer prices raised fears of a sharp economic slowdown.
The nonfarm payrolls release for March said employers added 431,000 jobs, less than expected, amid further signs of an improvement in the labor market, providing the Federal Reserve with more leeway to be more aggressive with its tightening cycle.
Analysts expected an increase of 490,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.7%, suggesting the central bank can continue attempting to combat inflation without the fear of hurting the economy too severely. 
In the corporate sector, the auto giants Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be in the spotlight after both companies decided to halt production at their Michigan factories.
Ford will suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage, while GM is halting production at its Lansing Grand River Assembly, where it makes the Cadillac CT4, the Cadillac CT5, and the Chevrolet Camaro.
Meme favorite stock GameStop (NYSE:GME) will also be in focus after the video game retailer announced plans late Thursday to implement a stock split.  
Oil prices stabilized after the previous session’s sharp losses on the news that the U.S. plans to release one million barrels a day for six months from its emergency reserves, starting in May. This would be the largest release ever from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 kicked off the second quarter with a win Friday, shrugging off a fresh warning from the bond market of a looming recession as softer job gains in March aren't expected to knock the Federal Reserve off its path to aggressively tightening monetary policy. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.34%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.40%, or 139 points, the Nasdaq added 0.29%, and the US Small Cap 2000 jumped 1%.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 431,000 in February, below consensus expectations for 490,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.6%.
The job gains for February were revised higher to 750,000 from 678,000, erasing concerns about the weakness seen in the prior month, and pointing to a labor market that is “showing strong momentum heading into Q2,” Jefferies said in a note.
Wage growth, which is expected to pick-up pace amid a tight labor market, was in-line with forecasts at 0.4%.
“With a solid jobs report and the Fed’s preferred inflation metric pushing to 6.4% as of March, there is little reason why the market should not expect a 50bps hike at the next May FOMC meeting,” Stifel said in a note.
As the bets of aggressive Fed action continue to be priced into markets, fears are growing that the Fed may slow growth by too much and tip the economy into recession.
The yield curve inverted again to deliver yet another warning sign that a recession could be on the horizon.  The yield on the 2-year Treasury bond (2.428%) jumped above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (2.360%).
Bank stocks struggled to cut losses as an inverting yield curve depresses their margins on lending, and limits growth.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) were the biggest decliners in the sector.   
Tech was once again in the crosshairs as semiconductor stocks struggle to catch a break on Wall Street. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell more than 3% after JPMorgan ditched the chipmaker from its Analyst Focus list.
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) erased gains to trade 1% lower after the video game retailer said it would seek shareholder backing at its next shareholder meeting to split its stock.
Stocks suffered their worst quarter in two years in first quarter, as a downbeat January and February offset gains in March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose modestly to kick off the second quarter on Friday, as the monthly jobs report indicated a strong labor market and is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to maintain its hawkish policy stance.
The Labor Department's employment report showed a rapid hiring pace by employers while wages continued to climb, although not enough to keep pace with inflation.
U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March, which was shy of the 490,000 estimate but still showed strong job gains. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, a new two-year low while average hourly earnings rose 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. 
Nonfarm payrolls https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanbdwmpa/nfpr.png
The report heightened expectations that the central bank is likely to become more aggressive in raising interest rates as it seeks to curb inflation as it unwinds its easy monetary policy.
""Job gains were broad, more people are going back to the office,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
""If other data between now and the next Fed meeting stay this rosy, the Fed will likely feel comfortable hiking by 50 basis points and announcing an aggressive rundown of its balance sheet.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139.92 points, or 0.4%, to 34,818.27, the S&P 500 gained 15.45 points, or 0.34%, to 4,545.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.98 points, or 0.29%, to 14,261.50.
The defensive real estate, utilities and consumer staples were the best performing sectors on the day, with each rising more than 1%. 
For the week, the Dow slipped 0.1%, the S&P edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.7%. 
Expectations for a 50-basis point interest rate hike at the central bank's May meeting stand at 73.3%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html. At its March meeting, the Fed raised rates by 25 basis 25 basis points, its first hike since 2018, and a host of central bank policymakers have indicated they are prepared for bigger rate hikes.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said on Friday he does not see a big risk in using ""some"" half-point rate hikes to bring borrowing costs to neutral sooner as long as the objective was not to raise rates much faster and push them higher.
Other data on Friday showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in March, although it remained firmly in expansion territory, as tight supply chains continued to put upward pressure on input prices.
In the wake of the payrolls report, U.S. Treasury yields jumped and a closely watched part of the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes, seen by many as a reliable indicator of a recession, inverted for the third time this week. 
The S&P 500 closed out the first quarter on Thursday with its biggest quarterly decline since the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. was reaching full swing on concerns about rising prices, fueled further by the war in Ukraine, and the Fed's response could slow economic growth.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company. 
The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.
The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer's radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France's OVHcloud and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft's cloud practices.
""The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,"" the questionnaire said.
Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft's licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.
They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft's operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.
Companies also were asked about the differences in license fees and commercial terms between the licensing deals with cloud service providers and another programme in which they package and indirectly resell Microsoft's cloud services together with their own.
Another focus was potential technical limitations on cloud storage services available on companies' cloud infrastructure.
""We're continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers,"" Microsoft said in an emailed statement.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager earlier this week said she has no concerns yet about cloud computing and cited the competition from Europe's Gaia-X initiative.

The Russia/Ukraine war, Covid lockdowns in China, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar are the macro factors the analyst pointed to. 
""It is too early, in our view, to lower our full year 2022 sales and EPS estimates, but we do think FactSet consensus sales and EPS, which are at the higher end of JNJ's 2022 financial guidance, first presented on 1/25/22, could come down,"" said Chen.
The analyst concluded that those same macro factors could impact other large pharma companies under its coverage. 
JNJ shares fell to $175.60 in the early part of Friday's session before clawing back the initial losses to trade 0.4% above Thursday's close."

LONDON (Reuters) -Europe vowed to stay united against Russia's demand that they pay for its gas in roubles, as the threat of an imminent supply halt eased on Friday.
European capitals have been bracing for a disruption to gas imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Some buyers and governments were working on ways to potentially pay for gas in roubles as Moscow in recent days has raised the spectre of cutting gas supply if its payment terms are not met.
With weeks left before bills are due, governments in Europe, which relies on Russia for more than a third of its gas, are talking to energy companies about Russia's demand. 
However, the European Commission said on Friday that those with contracts requiring payment in euros or dollars should stick to that.
""Agreed contracts must be respected. 97% of the relevant contracts explicitly stipulate payment in euros or dollars. Companies with such contracts should not accede to Russian demands,"" a European Commission spokesperson said.
""The EU will respond in a united manner to this latest attempt by Russia to circumvent our sanctions,"" the spokesperson said.
The Kremlin said on Friday it would not immediately turn off the taps to Europe as payments on deliveries due after April 1 come in the second half of this month and May. 
That message, and signs Europe would take a pragmatic approach, were a relief for markets. Gas prices, which had risen on fears of disruption, fell.
""If things remained like this, all in all not a lot would change,"" Italy's Ecology Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani told state broadcaster RAI.
On Thursday, Moscow decreed that foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open rouble accounts in state-run Gazprombank from Friday or else risk being cut off.
Analysts said the rouble payment plan, which cements Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s position at the heart of Russian gas trading, was more about shielding the oil and gas company from future sanctions than depriving Europe of fuel.
Gazprombank has been spared from the harsh sanctions imposed on other Russian banks so European gas buyers could open an account with it and let the lender buy roubles on their behalf. It would have to remain unsanctioned for trade to continue.
Although energy exports are Putin's most powerful lever against sweeping Western sanctions, his room for manoeuvre is also limited because Moscow does not have alternative markets for its gas, which is piped to Europe.
""If Putin turns off the gas, it might only be for a relatively short period of time. He needs our money and cannot reroute all the natural gas,"" one European gas trader said.
Germany meanwhile said it was examining Putin's decree. An economy ministry spokesperson said private contracts were valid and that the country, which depends on Russia for 40% of its gas needs, was paying in euros.
Berlin has already activated an emergency plan that could lead to gas rationing if supplies drop too low.
Gazprom said on Friday it was exiting its business in Germany, although it was not immediately clear how this would affect the supply of Russian gas into Europe's largest economy.
PRICE PRESSURE
Putin's decision to enforce rouble payments has boosted the Russian currency, which fell to historic lows at the start of the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". The rouble has since recovered much lost ground.
European buyers are still prepared to buy gas under existing contracts while they seek clarity on Putin's demand, while Gazprom said on Friday it had started to notify clients of a requested switch of end-payment currency to roubles.
Austria's OMV and Gazprom have had initial contact regarding paying for gas in roubles as demanded by Moscow, a spokesperson for OMV said on Friday, adding that the company is now waiting for written information.
Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), which has a take-or-pay contract with Gazprom running until 2030, said it had received a demand from Gazprom Export to pay for gas supplies in roubles.
""We have no intention of paying in roubles. We are in close dialogue with other energy companies and the authorities regarding a common European response to Gazprom Export,"" it said in a statement.
Poland's dominant gas company PGNiG said it had been formally notified by Gazprom about changes to payment terms for gas supplies.
German utilities Uniper, RWE and VNG all declined to comment. Italian energy group Edison, which has a contract with Gazprom for 1 bcm of gas per year which expires at the end of this year, also did not comment.
Italy's Eni said it had received a communication from Gazprom over switching its gas payment currency to roubles, and was analysing the matter.
European gas prices have climbed as a result of uncertainty over Putin's plan, with rises of 7%-10% since his order, coming close to previous peaks.

Relief that the taps would not be turned off any time soon prompted prices to turn negative. 
At 1715 GMT, the benchmark front-month contract for May delivery in the Dutch gas market was down 9.37 euros at 111. 45 euros per megawatt hour (MWh).

The announcement came in an unusual and harshly worded statement that sought to clarify a decision announced in March not to reappoint Friege for unspecified differing opinions over corporate management.
""Christian Friege's failure to recognize and implement the socially and internally important issue of women on the Board of Management and in other management functions is, in the opinion of Chairman Rolf Hollander, an inexcusable omission,"" Friday's statement said.
Friege did not promote diversity or the process of naming a woman to the board, ""but on the contrary massively obstructed it"", the statement said.
Friege did not respond to an email and a LinkedIn message seeking comment. 
A spokesperson for CEWE said the management board that Friege chairs does not make management board appointments, and that four women had been promoted to executive leadership positions in the past few years. 
In Friday's statement, the board of trustees described Friege's work at the German small-cap company as ""acceptable to good"" overall, but two-thirds of the members of the board of trustees were ""firmly convinced"" Friege didn't enjoy the trust for a reappointment.

Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares dipped Friday after JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee removed the companies from the firm's ""Analyst Focus List.""
On Friday, Apple shares fell 0.8%, while Qualcomm was the more significant loser, falling over 5%. 
Commenting on Apple, the analyst told investors in a note that moderation in consumer spending will temper expectations from the recent iPhone SE launch. The analyst added that gaming in China may weigh on Apple's services. 
The comments on Apple follow reports earlier this week that the company will cut production on the iPhone SE due to demand.
Regarding Qualcomm, the analyst said it will likely feel the impact of the weakness in the smartphone market, especially in low- to mid-end Android devices.
Chatterjee explained there has been ""a lot of noise around demand weakness across global tech, but we believe the macro weakness seeping through the sector will impact the consumer end-markets more materially.""
However, JPMorgan still has overweight ratings on the stocks due to ""better than peer group resilience to consumer weakness.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mattel Inc top-selling toys like Mega Bloks will now be made in Mexico, as the U.S. toymaker becomes the latest company to move its supply chain closer to home.
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) announced in mid-March it had spent around a billion pesos, or $50 million, to expand a plant in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, which is now the company's largest plant, overtaking other hubs in China, Vietnam and Malaysia. 
The plant in Monterrey, close to the U.S. border, sprawls across 200,000 square meters (2.25 million square feet), employing close to 3,500 workers.
""Being able to have product close to your consumer and not having to transport it from Asia, that's going to be more profitable and more competitive when you take costs into account,"" Mattel's Latin America managing director, Gabriel Galvan, told Reuters. 
The expansion was first pitched in 2020, Galvan said. Mattel closed two factories in Asia in 2019 and more recently shuttered a plant in Canada and another in Mexico ahead of expansion of the mega-factory.
""This consolidation and plant expansion was in line with the company's transformation/turnaround strategy and a manufacturing footprint consolidation we called 'Capital Light,'"" spokeswoman Catherine Frymark told Reuters in an email, saying that the strategy was four years in the making.
Galvan said Mattel's move was just the latest instance of how worries about over-extended supply global chains are generating fresh interest in ""nearshoring"" from industries like textiles and even automaking - already a mainstay of Mexican manufacturing. 
Mexico's finance minister told local media recently that the demand for industry parks in northern Mexico was booming.

Mattel plans to double its investment in the plant over the next five years, Nuevo Leon state said in a press release. 
""It's a big opportunity (for Mattel),"" Galvan said, due to the plant's proximity to the company's Dallas-Fort Worth distribution center, its second-largest in the United States. ""We can be there in 24 hours, so for us it's really convenient.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine, hoping to tap fresh sources of money to fund its defence efforts, is looking at ways to extend a domestic bond issuance programme to international capital markets, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.
Kyiv launched a programme selling hryvnia-denominated bonds to raise money for its fight against Russia - dubbed ""war bonds"" - in late February. The government said it aimed to raise around $1.36 billion through its domestic programme.
The source said Ukraine's government now hoped to launch an international fixed income instrument - which would be most likely be denominated in U.S. dollars - in the months to come.
""Ukraine has been encouraged by the support that it has been receiving not only from official creditors but from the broader Ukrainian diaspora and international regulatory authorities,"" the person told Reuters.
""The idea is to extend its current programme of domestic bonds to an international audience,"" the source said, adding the government was hoping to raise as much as possibly, maybe ""hundreds of millions of dollars.""
It was not clear whether the bonds would be aimed at a retail audience -- including the country's large diaspora -- or institutional investors, or both.
Ukraine's finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Diaspora bonds have been successfully tapped by several developing countries, with Israel for instance having used them to raise tens of billions of dollars since 1951.

Diaspora funds bailed India out from a 1991 balance of payments crisis, raising $4.2 billion in 1998 to offset international sanctions imposed after nuclear tests.
Ukraine has seen contributions flow in since the Russian invasion started -- in cash as well as cryptocurrencies -- much of it from its large diaspora.

Coke shares rose more than 3% on Friday, while Monster shares rose more than 2%.
Grandet argued that Moster's Chairman, and CEO, Rodney Sacks, and his business partner, CFO Hilton Schlosberg, should pass the baton to a new owner who can lead the business and the brand they created to another level.
""We think the time is now as we believe the value of the company will likely have limited upside just on fundamentals due to a more challenged U.S. market and multiple sources of margin pressure,"" explained the analyst. 
""We believe the best outcome for the company and the brand would be to be acquired by K.O., which already owns ~19% of it,"" he added. 
Grandet's bull thesis on both Coca-Cola and Monster is based on the view that Coca-Cola acquiring the energy drink company is ""more of an eventuality than an if."""

(Reuters) - Marine fuel sellers have stopped serving vessels flying the Russian flag at major European hubs including Spain and Malta in another blow to Moscow's exports, five industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Losing access to refuelling points in the Mediterranean Sea poses major logistical problems for Russian oil tankers going from Baltic ports to Asia and also creates safety concerns over potentially being stuck at sea with flammable cargoes, shipping sources say.
Russia is reeling from a wave of severe economic sanctions on its banks and oligarchs and foreign companies are cutting ties after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a special military operation. 
Multiple factors have prompted the halt in refuelling services, including what sources have described as ""self sanctioning"" where companies try to stay ahead of the next wave of measures by refusing to enter into contracts with Russian entities.
Payment problems due to banking restrictions have also added to complications with deals for marine fuel, which is typically priced and paid for in U.S. dollars.
One source said Russian-flagged ships couldn't secure marine fuel in Malta, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar or neighbouring Algeciras in Spain – all major bunkering, or refuelling, zones in the Mediterranean. 
""Several tankers had to take a longer journey in order to bunker in other countries after European ports refused to provide fuel,"" said another source who was familiar with one of the tanker's movements.
A government official in Malta said the country was not allowing any Russian-flagged ships to come to its ports. 
A transport ministry spokesperson with Spain's Merchant Marine said it was ""possible that certain providers are adopting these measures independently"".
A Gibraltar government spokesperson said port authorities would ""reject calling requests by all ships either owned or operated by anyone connected to the country, not even for bunkering, in accordance to UK rules"".
The spokesperson said that as in Britain, foreign ships with Russian cargoes would be not be affected.
'NOT DOING BUSINESS'
Russia's maritime sector is already grappling with the winding down of other services including ship certification by leading foreign providers - vital for accessing ports and securing insurance - shipping companies pulling out and ship engine makers suspending training on their equipment.
Shipping industry sources say given the complexities of the world's seaborne trade it was unclear how Russian companies would be able to operate with multiple services being withdrawn. 
Danish marine fuels supplier and ship owner Monjasa said it had suspended ""trading and supplies with Russian-flagged vessels, Russian registered companies and companies and individuals with ties or affiliation to Russian ownership"" with effect from Feb. 25, a day after Russia's invasion started.
Denmark's Bunker Holding said it had stopped all deliveries into Russian harbours since the start of March, adding that the group and subsidiaries including Dan-Bunkering had also ""ceased to enter into new obligations with Russian counterparties"".
""We are aware of the challenges this decision to stop trade with Russian counterparties imposes on clients and counterparties in the rest of the world, but with the terrible situation in Ukraine we need to act swiftly and decisively against Russia,"" Bunker Holding said in a statement.
Gibraltar bunker supplier Peninsula, which is active elsewhere in the Mediterranean and other locations, said in a LinkedIn post it was ""not doing business with Russian vessels, ports, companies – owned or majority owned - suppliers and financial institutions"". 

Earlier this month, Britain announced sanctions on Russia's biggest shipping company Sovcomflot.
While a ban on Russian vessels from EU ports is still under discussion, Russia's oil and products exporters have already faced problems concluding charters for ships and insurance, shipping sources say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration on Friday sharply boosted fuel economy standards for vehicles, reversing former President Donald Trump's rollback of U.S. regulations aimed at improving gas mileage and cutting tailpipe pollution.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it will boost fuel efficiency requirements by 8% for both the 2024 and 2025 model years and 10% in 2026. That was a slightly bigger increase than the proposal outlined in August.
The NHTSA rules are about the same as rules previously announced by the Environmental Protection Agency for a fleetwide real-world average of about 40 miles per gallon in 2026 compared with 32 mpg under the Trump rules. Some environmentalists along with electric vehicle makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian argued NHTSA should have adopted more aggressive requirements of 10% yearly requirements over the three-year period.
The new rules are expected to reduce consumer fuel costs by $192 billion for new vehicles sold by 2030. The administration is eager to make the case that regulations will prod automakers to build more efficient vehicles and save consumers money at a time of near record pump prices.
Automakers say they will need to spend tens of billions to comply with the rules. NHTSA estimates consumers could save $1,387 in fuel costs over the life of a vehicles but the rule will increase the average cost of a vehicle by almost that much.
The rule's total costs for automakers are pegged by NHTSA https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-04/Final-Rule-Preamble_CAFE-MY-2024-2026.pdf at more than $200 billion through 2029, will increase the average cost of a vehicle industry wide by $1,087, NHTSA said. The total cost for Detroit's Big Three automakers is estimated at more than $100 billion for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis.
The Trump administration in March 2020 rolled back fuel economy standards to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That was much less than the 5% annual increases required by his predecessor Barack Obama.
The EPA in December finalized its vehicle emissions requirements that are parallel to the NHTSA rules. The EPA said its rules will result in 3.1 billion tons of avoided CO2 emissions through 2050. Major automakers on Wednesday backed EPA's revisions over challenges brought by some states and some ethanol groups.
EPA and NHTSA plan to write and adopt another round of vehicle standards that will cover 2027 and beyond that analysts believe will be so aggressive that automakers must build electric vehicles to meet them.
John Bozzella, president of the trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said ""increased regulatory requirements for automakers will require supportive policies, as well as regulatory alignment with the EPA to ensure that standards can be attained.""
Legislation has stalled in Congress that would boost EV rebates to up to $12,500 per vehicle and provide generous tax incentives for automaker EV production and business purchases of EVs.

Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said NHTSA's ""rules only require automakers to reduce gas guzzling slightly more than they agreed to cut nine years ago.""
NHTSA on Sunday said it reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond. The decision was a victory for Tesla that could cost other automakers like Stellantis hundreds of millions of dollars or more.

LONDON (Reuters) -UPS said on Friday it was trying out a four-wheeled ""eQuad"" electric cargo bike for deliveries in densely packed urban areas, where bikes have better and easier access, to complement its push into electric vehicles. 
The package-delivery giant is trialing around 100 of the electric bikes, designed and built by British firm Fernhay, in seven European markets and will also launch trials in the United States and some Asian markets, Luke Wake, UPS vice president of fleet maintenance and engineering, told Reuters. 
UPS said it would also use four-wheeled electric bikes from other manufacturers for the trials, but did not disclose names.
As well as making public commitments to cut their carbon footprints, package-delivery companies are seeking new ways to cut the cost of last-mile deliveries given soaring e-commerce orders.
UPS' eQuad has an electric-assisted top speed of around 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) - if you pedal hard you can go faster - and can haul up to 200 kilograms (441 lb) of packages. Its electric battery has a range of around 40 miles (64 km), which Wake said would be more than adequate for urban routes.
The vehicle is only 36 inches (91 cm) wide, so can legally use bike lanes and enter pedestrian zones that UPS' vans and trucks cannot access. Under normal circumstances, drivers would have to get out of their vehicles, load packages on carts and haul them to customers.
UPS' Wake said the Atlanta-based company sees an opportunity to scale up the use of the bikes in megacities and complement its range of vans and trucks.
""There are more and more opportunities for zero-emission solutions like this that can alleviate inner-city congestion,"" Wake said while demonstrating the eQuad at a UPS package facility in London. ""It can also help our operations be more efficient at the same time.""

Rivals FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) unit DHL are also experimenting with electric cargo bikes as part of their own zero-emission vehicle plans.
UPS is working with electric van makers like UK startups Arrival and Tevva, plus U.S. truck maker Xos.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe and Russia will both lose heavily if President Vladimir Putin follows through on his threat to cut gas supplies to countries he judges ""unfriendly"" unless they pay in roubles.
Even at the height of the Cold War, Moscow never cut gas to Europe, but on Thursday, Putin signed a decree ordering foreign buyers to pay in roubles instead of euros from April 1 or face going without Russian supplies.
European capitals rejected the ultimatum and on Friday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would not affect settlements until later this month.
Although the threat of shortages comes after the peak demand European winter season, Europe still has much to lose when its businesses and households are already reeling from record energy prices, while Moscow could be cutting off one of its main sources of revenue.
Russia exported around 155 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe last year, providing more than a third of its gas supply. 
Without it, Europe would have to buy more gas on the spot market where prices are already around 500% higher than last year.
Germany and Austria, both heavily reliant on Russian gas, have activated emergency plans, which include rationing if necessary, and other European countries have plans in place.
""Buyers' unwillingness to abide by (Putin's) order risks suspending supplies. Both buyers and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) will face losses as a result,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, analyst at Moscow-based brokerage Locko-Invest.
DASH FOR GAS
European countries will have to compete with Asia to attract additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar or the United States, and even among themselves for alternative pipeline supplies from places such as Norway and Algeria.
U.S. LNG exporters have already emerged as big winners of Europe's supply crisis, while Norway has also benefitted.
Greece said on Friday it could avoid gas supply problems if Russian flows are halted provided sufficient gas is available on the world market.
Last week, the United States said it will work to supply 15 bcm of LNG to the European Union this year but this would not fully replace what Russia sends to Europe via pipelines.
Apart from trying to get more in an already stretched global gas market, several European countries have also said they will have to use more coal, potentially extend the life of nuclear plants and increase renewables output.
""A disruption of Russian natural gas flows towards Europe remains a tail risk. Europe has more options for alternative supplies, and with demand seasonally low for the coming months, has no risk of running out of supplies this year,"" said Norbert Rücker at Swiss private bank Julius Baer.
But that risk would increase towards the winter months when gas demand usually rises.
Gas in European storage might be enough for spring and summer without demand curtailment, but Europe will risk entering next winter with only around 10% of gas in store by the end of October without some energy conservation measures, said Kateryna Filippenko, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
To attract more LNG from elsewhere, European wholesale gas prices would need to remain higher than the Asian benchmark LNG price. Rocketing gas prices are already hurting consumers and industries and governments have spent billions of euros on measures to try and shield them.
""We have to be aware that the companies who have signed long-term contracts with Gazprom do receive gas at significantly lower prices than we have to pay in the LNG market. So there will be impact on our energy prices,"" EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told EU lawmakers last month.
SELF SABOTAGE? 
Russia faces the loss of an important revenue stream for its domestic finances.
In the first nine months of 2021, the latest data available from Russian gas producer Gazprom show its revenue from sales to Europe, Turkey and China was 2.5 trillion roubles ($31 billion) from exporting 176 bcm of gas between January and September.
""For Russia, a decision to restrict supply would be like shooting itself in the foot,"" said analysts at SEB Research.
If the payment mechanism is designed to shore up the rouble, that could also be short-lived. Prior to the invasion, the Russian central bank required 80% of foreign currency from gas to be converted into roubles. Now it would all have to be switched into the Russian currency.
""The move will cut Russia off from a vital source of foreign exchange (FX) at a time when sanctions have already massively restricted the Russian Central Bank's access to its FX reserves,"" said analysts at Fitch Solutions.
European buyers have repeatedly said the move constitutes a breach of contract. Gazprom risks being involved in arbitration suits where it could be forced to pay large fines in the future. 
Another question is what Russia can do with the gas it usually supplies to Europe. The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, said last week that Moscow could redirect supplies to Asian markets among others.
However, there is no pipeline that allows Russia to send the gas supplied to Europe to Asia. A pipeline from Russia to China sends gas from other fields that do not supply Europe and there is no interconnector to re-route those flows.
Asian markets might also be reluctant to buy more.
""You make yourself impossible as a gas supplier to other countries. How likely is it, for example, that China or India would choose to rely on Russian gas if Russia so clearly shows that it does not hesitate to use the gas as a weapon,"" said SEB Research analysts. 
Instead, Russia might be forced to pump the gas into domestic storage sites that can hold around 72 bcm. Gazprom-owned storage sites in Europe could hold another 9 bcm.
Gazprom expects domestic gas demand to increase to 260 bcm by 2026 from 238 bcm in 2020 and has plans to expand storage.

But in the short term, if European gas were re-directed to existing storage, it would be full in three to four months and some gas production could then be shut down, damaging long-term growth, analysts said.

A team of analysts at Citi, led by Ronit Ghose, believes that companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) are attacking a $8-$13 billion total addressable market (TAM).
In a near 200 pages report on Metaverse, Ghose sees this space combining the physical and digital worlds in an immersive manner, with many use cases, including gaming, commerce, art, media, advertising, smart manufacturing, health care, virtual communities, and social collaboration (including for enterprise and education).
The number of potential users ranges from 1 to 5 billion, according to Citi, depending on which type of definition is used (narrow vs broad).
Ghose believes that Metaverse will most likely be based around smartphones with a small portion of all users using virtual reality (VR) devices.
For Metaverse to be adopted widely, the world will need much better internet speeds and higher access to 5G technology. Citi expects only a quarter of the global population to have access to 5G by 2025.
The lags, packet drops, and network unreliability witnessed in today's world makes the current state of the infrastructure unsuitable for building an envisioned Metaverse experience, it is said in the report.
Analysts also see different types of metaverses being developed e.g. US/International vs China, tech vs business, centralized vs decentralized, etc.
Among those sectors and companies that are likely to benefit the most from Metaverse, Ghose mentions consumer hardware manufacturers that will act as portals and potential gatekeepers.
Citi also sees a big role for cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).
""Money in the Metaverse could exist in different forms, i.e., in-game tokens, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and cryptocurrencies. Current payment rails are usually domestic for real time and expensive cross-border payments making them an imperfect fit for a borderless global Metaverse ecosystem. We expect decentralized finance (DeFi) and existing traditional financial systems to coexist.""

As part of deal, the Spanish bank agreed to pay 1.99 billion euros ($2.20 billion) for 100% of the shares of Tree Inversiones Inmobiliarias, which owns 659 branches and three individual buildings.
BBVA estimated the deal would hit its capital by 7 basis points and have a negative net impact of 200 million euros once the transaction is completed, which is expected at the end of the second quarter. 

The lender said the impact would be more than offset by the cumulative savings expected when this transaction is executed.

Analyst Yuqian Ding told investors in a research note that XPeng has built all of its autonomous driving software in-house and from scratch, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is something no other domestic EV firms have done.
He added that XPeng's latest autonomous driving system is one of the best in China and enables autonomous driving on highways. 
As a result, Ding anticipates XPeng's ""leading and differentiated smart driving experience to boost its brand equity and sales,"" with the company's solid product cycle helping to support ""rapid"" growth. 
XPeng shares jumped 9% premarket and currently trade 3.6% higher in the regular session after it reported deliveries for March. So far, in 2022, the stock is down 43.3%.",

The exchange, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, suspended nickel trading on March 8 after prices spiked by more than 50% in a matter of hours to hit $100,000 a tonne. 
A spate of technical glitches after trading resumed on March 16 left traders fuming and volumes thinner than usual.
The average daily volume of combined LME nickel futures and options slumped to 64,952 lots in March compared to 90,685 a month earlier and 88,342 in January, data showed.

The surge in prices that triggered the halt was blamed on short-covering by one of the world's top producers, China's Tsingshan Holding Group.
The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., will hold an independent review into the nickel crisis, a top executive said on Tuesday.

Investing.com – Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock traded 4% higher Friday after Citi analyst George Choi upgraded it to ‘buy’ with a target of $96.50, citing multiple reasons for his optimism.
The new target, $1.50 less than Choi’s previous one, is around 16% higher than the stock’s current level of $83.
According to StreetInsider, the analyst likes Wynn “for its 'increasing dedication to Premium Mass in Macau'."" Choi called the valuations “undemanding” at around 8.6 times EV/EBITDA multiple as per estimates for financial year 2023.
The brokerage also pointed to increasing clarity over regulations and licenses in Macau as reasons behind the bullish outlook, according to CNBC.
Earlier this month, authorities on the island decided to extend the licenses by six months, giving more time to a highly anticipated rebidding process in the world's biggest casino hub.
Authorities will start the rebidding process once the city's legislature has passed a revised law, Reuters quoted Hong Kong’s Economy and Finance Secretary Lei Wai Nong as saying.
Macau’s six operators including Wynn have to reapply to maintain operations in the former Portuguese colony.
Macau lies off Hong Kong and is part of China. Local authorities have earlier called for tighter supervision of casino operators and higher local ownership in gaming companies operating in the region.
China has been clamping down on high-stakes betting in Macau which takes place in convertible Hong Kong dollars. It is alleged the gambling trades enable illicit outflow of currency and money-laundering efforts.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) said on Friday it was quitting its business in Germany at a moment of crisis in the vital energy ties between the two countries in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The gas giant gave no details or explanation of its decision to terminate its participation in Gazprom Germania GMBH and all of its assets, which include subsidiaries in Britain, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.
Gazprom has been in the sights of European Union regulators for months over allegations, which it denied, that it was holding back gas that could have been released to lower soaring prices. Sources said this week that its offices in Germany had been raided by EU antitrust authorities.
""I think this means Gazprom is drawing a curtain on being an active participant in the European gas market. Essentially it is going home because it no longer feels welcome,"" said Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
""I think Gazprom understands it is going to face a hostile political and regulatory environment in Europe and therefore wants to consolidate and conduct all of its business in one place – St Petersburg, most likely with the political support of the Russian government.""
Yafimava said she did not expect any impact on Russian gas deliveries under long-term contracts. A market source in Germany with knowledge of the Russian gas business agreed with that assessment.
He said the main impact would be on gas storage as Astora, a subsidiary of Gazprom Germania, has facilities totalling 6 billion cubic metres of capacity in Germany and Austria.
It was unclear whether the German government would want to step in and mandate someone to run these, in order to achieve desired filling levels, and whether that could trigger legal opposition by Gazprom, the source said. Astora did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The move further complicates energy ties between Russia and Germany, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to impose rouble pricing for gas on buyers from what Moscow considers unfriendly countries.
Berlin rejects the change, as existing contracts are set in euros, and its economy minister said on Thursday it would not be ""blackmailed by Putin"".
Germany depends on Russian gas for about 40% of its needs but has joined Western sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine, including by halting the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany.

German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday that the German economy ministry was considering expropriating the Gazprom and Rosneft units in the country amid concerns about the security of energy supplies.
The Kremlin said on Friday that any such move would be a violation of international law.

(Reuters) -European shares rose on Friday as a rally in commodity-linked and bank stocks helped outweigh worries about economic growth and inflation, with Europe remaining on alert for a disruption to gas imports from Russia.
A Russian threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe unless buyers paid with roubles from Friday was averted for now, with Moscow saying it would not halt supplies until new payments are due later in April.
Worries about the fallout from the war, compounded by likely central bank tightening to control surging inflation, saw the pan-European STOXX 600 index mark its first quarterly loss in two years last quarter. 
The index on Friday rose 0.5% higher. Banks gained 1.2% on the day with Spanish lender Santander (MC:SAN) firming 2.6% after reiterating its 2022 profitability target.
""Markets have been range-bound for the last few weeks, and received a boost today after Putin only followed through on his rouble threats in theory, ending a week of concern for investors that Europe could see lower gas flows,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Miners and oil stocks led gains on the day and leaped 18% and 14% respectively last quarter amid surging commodity prices due to the Ukraine war.
In Ukraine, Ukrainian forces were moving into territory abandoned by withdrawing Russian troops in the north as peace talks resumed on Friday. But in the southeast, which Russia now says is the focus of its operation, the Red Cross said it had been barred from bringing aid to the besieged city of Mariupol.
""Ultimately, we're in a wait-and-see phase as we await developments in negotiations, clarity from central banks and the upcoming earnings season,"" Erlam said.
Adding to nervousness, data showed euro zone inflation surged to 7.5% in March, hitting another record high months before it is set to peak.
""It seems increasingly likely that the ECB will accelerate its plans to tighten - we now think it will begin raising rates as soon as July and the deposit rate will reach around 1.5% by end-2023,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.
Markets are pricing in 60 basis points of rate hikes by the end of 2022.
Technology stocks were among the worst performers last quarter on inflation worries, down 17%, and slipped another 0.3% on Friday. 

In France, volatility could also stem from presidential elections due this month, though analysts do not expect much of an impact as President Emmanuel Macron is widely expected to be re-elected. 
Among individual stocks, French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) fell 9.5% on narrowing its full-year organic revenue growth forecast.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Toronto-based Brazil Potash Corp has laid out for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro this week its plans to reduce his country's dependence on fertilizer imports disrupted by the Ukraine war by opening a potash mine in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The company's owner, investment banker Stan Bharti, met with Bolsonaro on Monday to discuss the $2.5 billion project that has been held up since 2017 due to a suspended environmental permit pending consultations with the indigenous Mura people.
Bolsonaro told Bharti his government was committed to ""unlocking"" fertilizer projects such as the potash mine that are strategic for Brazil, said former Senator Cidinho Santos, who attended the meeting, in an Instagram post on Wednesday.
The decision to allow the mine at Autazes, 75 miles (120 kms) southeast of the state capital Manaus, is not entirely up to Bolsonaro. The project depends on a ruling by Federal Judge Jaiza Fraxe, who is monitoring talks with the Mura people to make sure they have a fair say.
As potash prices tripled last year and war has threatened supplies from Russia and Eastern Europe, pressure to open the potash mine has grown from Brazil's farm sector, which relies on imports for 85% of its fertilizer, needed to raise crop yields.
Brazil, the world's largest producer of soybeans, depends on potash imports from China, Canada and Morocco, but mostly Russia and Belarus for nearly half of the supplies in the country. Those exports have been crimped severely by sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Potassio do Brasil, a subsidiary of Brazil Potash, which is wholly-owned by Bharti's Forbes & Manhattan bank, said it would take three years to get the mine operating, with an output of 2.44 million tonnes per year once permits are obtained.
""As soon as the environmental license is restored, we will apply to Amazon environmental protection agency IPAAM for an installation license and start work,"" Chief Executive Adriano Espeschit said in an emailed statement. ""We hope to be producing in Autazes at the start of 2026."" 
Espeschit said the company recognizes the Mura's right to be consulted under the International Labor Organization (ILO) convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples, and meetings have begun after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Judge Fraxe's office did not reply to a request for comment on the meetings. Claudio Mura, head of a local indigenous council, declined to speak by phone on how talks were going.
Prosecutor Fernando Soave, who first called for the license suspension in 2016 because the Mura had not been consulted, said there was no agreement at a meeting with the tribe on Tuesday to decide which controversial points to include in talks.
""The pre-consultation meetings have not yet started,"" Soave told Reuters.
His office said exploratory drilling for potash deposits by the company began in the region in 2009 without consulting the Mura people, who claim the area as ancestral lands, though their claim has not been recognized by the Brazilian government.

Brazil Potash said the entrance to the planned mine will not be on indigenous land, which the Mura dispute, and that the environmental impact of mining potash deposits 800 meters (2,625 ft) below ground will be negligible.
The prosecutor's office has warned of the project's significant social and cultural impact on the Mura people. Consultations are expected to take time as they involve 44 Mura villages.

Kering confirmed the outlines of the settlement, without giving the cost, saying it would have no impact on the group's results in 2022 or on its recurring tax rate in future years.
""In the spring of 2019, given the rapid changes in its business environment, its strong international growth and some uncertainties of Italian legislation, Bottega Veneta proactively made contact with the Italian Revenue Agency to discuss its tax position"", Kering said in a statement adding this agreement was ""the result of those discussions"". 
Earlier on Friday the Milan prosecutor referred in a press release to a tax investigation led by Milan tax police into a Swiss company, part of an international luxury goods group, which allegedly operated in Italy to produce and distribute an Italian brand, without specifically naming the company. 
Revenue at the Italian leather goods house were booked through Kering's Swiss-based subsidiary Luxury Goods International and Italian prosecutors and tax authorities argued that the tax should therefore have been paid in Italy, not Switzerland, the sources said.
Luxury Goods International paid 186.8 million euros to settle the tax case, covering the fiscal years 2012 to 2019.
Separately, Milan prosecutors' criminal investigation for tax evasion is still ongoing, the sources said. 
Three years ago, Kering reached an agreement with the Italian tax authorities, paying a record 1.25 billion euros to settle a similar dispute centred on its fashion brand Gucci.
Milan prosecutors in the past have probed U.S. tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.

In previous cases, once the agreement between the companies and the Italian tax agency was signed, prosecutors closed the criminal investigation with either a dismissal or a settlement.

MADRID (Reuters) - The daughter of  Inditex  (MC:ITX)'s billionaire founder takes the helm of his Zara fashion empire on Friday with a more hands-on role than originally expected by outsiders, though a much lower salary than her veteran predecessor.
Marta Ortega, Amancio Ortega's youngest child, will not only be non-executive chairperson, as announced in November, but will also manage the firm's communication strategy and its internal audit body, the company said in an annual report on remuneration of directors sent to Spain's stock market regulator last month.
The 38-year-old will also remain involved in managing fashion merchandise at Zara, the business that generates 70% of Inditex's revenues, the company said. 
    In return, Marta Ortega will receive an annual salary of one million euros ($1.1 million), the document showed - 100,000 euros for overseeing the board and 900,000 euros for her work as non-executive president.
Along with new CEO Oscar Garcia, Marta Ortega replaces veteran executive president Pablo Isla, who oversaw an eight-fold increase in Inditex's share price that saw its market value surge to almost 93 billion euros at its highest point. 
He leaves with a golden handshake and a promise not to work for a competitor for two years. Inditex paid Isla 12.4 million euros in his last year with the company, more than double what he received in 2020 as the executive president, the company report shows, adding that 9.9 million euros was paid in cash. 
    Inditex said it determined Marta Ortega's salary based on ""her knowledge of the retail business in the fashion sector and of the Inditex Group.""
Though her role is not directly comparable to Isla's, Marta Ortega will still have an extensive overview of the company.
""Even if Ortega will not be in charge of the day-to-day finances, she will be at the forefront of the evaluation units that allow her to make sure things are going well,"" said Santiago Alvarez de Mon, a professor of leadership at the IESE business school in Madrid.
The transition comes as the world's largest fast fashion retailer by sales, having largely weathered the COVID pandemic, faces the challenge of losing revenues from Russia, where it has mothballed operations following the invasion of Ukraine, and surging inflation that will likely force it to raise prices. 
Zara, and other group chains such as Stradivarius and Pull&Bear, must also deal with the rapid rise of Shein, the world's largest online-only fashion company selling cheap clothes to primarily younger customers.
In a letter to staff on her first day, Marta Ortega said she was fully committed to leading the company. ""I ask for your support and patience while I continue to learn from everyone every day,"" she added.
    JITTERS
News of Isla's departure, and his replacement by Marta Ortega and Oscar Garcia, initially sparked market jitters.
But investors were reassured a team of managers, who have been with the company for anything between 18 and 42 years, will support the new leaders. 
The transition is also being closely monitored by Ortega senior, who owns 59.2% of Inditex shares, sources familiar with the process said. 
Guido Stein, a Spanish author and professor on companies leadership at IESE, said it was reasonable Marta Ortega would be paid less than Isla. 
    ""She is just starting out in that position and her family receives much more from the company's profits,"" he said. 
Ortega senior, who retired in 2011 but remains on the board in return for an annual payment of 100,000 euros, was paid an annual salary of 600,000 euros when he headed the company and always worked alongside an executive partner.
The 86-year-old will receive 1.7 billion euros in dividends this year, sources familiar with the process said. 
    Isla told journalists at his last press conference in March that he had ""maximum confidence in the future of the company"" under the new leadership team. 
Royal Bank of Canada and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts told Reuters they did not expect much strategy change as an Ortega returns to the top of the company. 

    ""As a family member who has been closely involved with the business over the last few years, Marta Ortega will be significantly more involved than most non-executive chairpersons would be,"" Deutsche Bank's Adam Courcharne said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange suspended deliveries of some Russian produced metals into its approved warehouses in Britain on Friday, although there is none stored in them at present.
The exchange, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said in a statement that there was significant risk that someone receiving such metal from British warehouses would be hit with very high additional costs.

Aluminium produced by Rusal and copper produced by Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) and JSC Uralelektromed could only be delivered into approved LME warehouses in Britain if it had been exported from Russia before March 25, the LME said. Rusal and Nornickel declined to comment.  The LME said its suspension also included lead and aluminium alloy made by Rusal and three other producers. ""Neither Nornickel nor Rusal send any of their metal to UK warehouses,"" an industry source said. 
Britain has two approved locations for LME warehouses, in Hull and Liverpool, but they have very little metal. None of the four metals being suspended are currently being stored in British LME warehouses, LME data shows. LME facilities in Liverpool, however, have 1,416 tonnes of nickel. Nickel is not suspended and is not on the British list for additional duties, even though Russia's Norilsk Nickel is one of the world's biggest producers.

Russia has restricted access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms' flagships Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram since sending thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, as the country's long-simmering dispute with Big Tech escalates into a battle to control information flows. 
The digital exodus provoked by Western sanctions, and a clampdown by Russian media regulators, has opened the door to domestic players, with VK, which runs the country's most popular social media site VKontakte, leading the charge. On Thursday it published a step-by-step guide for businesses looking to migrate away from other platforms.
For years considered Russia's answer to Facebook, VKontakte has more than 50 million daily active users on average and reaches 80% of Russia's online monthly audience, the company said.
That dwarfs Facebook's 7.5 million users in Russia as of last year, according to estimates from researcher Insider Intelligence. 
More than 585,000 new business owners created their own communities on the platform in March, VKontakte said, from hair salons to clothes shops. 
VKontakte has set new records for user activity since Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, with an 11% jump in content volumes on its platform from Feb. 24 to March 24, according to monitor Brand Analytics.
The volume of Russian-language content published on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram dropped 5%, 16% and 30% respectively in that period, the monitor said. 
Vkontakte, which makes money through adverts, commission from app developers and user payments for subscriptions and one-off payments, contributed a little over a fifth of the company's 125.8 billion roubles ($1.5 billion) in revenue last year.
VK's other business lines include email provider mail.ru, gaming unit MY.Games and education technology assets. 
""The domestic market for interactive services now has a great chance to show its potential to its audience,"" Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications, told the Telesputnik media outlet in late March. ""Russian users don't just have an alternative, they have a choice.""
GAZPROM INFLUENCE
While there is no direct policy on replacing foreign social media, the government has promised income tax breaks and preferential loans for IT companies and employees can get their military service deferred. Politicians are also encouraging users to switch to domestic providers.
The government may also be playing an indirect role in the country's tech future through a complicated series of investments that involve Gazprom and its media division. 
A shareholder and management shake-up late last year saw Gazprom Media acquire a decent chunk of VK's voting rights in December, adding to a burgeoning media empire controlled by the state energy giant.
Its investments may soon pay off after a stumble. Trading of VK's London-listed shares was suspended in early March after they plunged to almost zero as Western investors abandoned Russian assets.
When trading in VK's depositary receipts resumed in Moscow on Wednesday after a more than month-long suspension, they leapt 72% in one session from record lows, which analysts linked to reduced foreign competition.
In late 2020, Gazprom Media acquired RuTube, a video-hosting platform that bears a striking resemblance to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, and whose weekly user numbers jumped 5.5 times in early March, TASS cited the company as saying. 
Those numbers could surge higher as YouTube is under pressure from Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor, and may soon suffer the same fate as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Despite being restricted, those sites can sometimes still be accessed using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), demand for which has skyrocketed in Russia. YouTube remains freely accessible. 
But critics say RuTube has a long way to go to rival Google's video product. 
RuTube's number of unique monthly users was 17.7 million at the end of December, Gazprom Media's Deputy CEO Alexander Moiseev said in February. That compares to YouTube's 89.5 million in Russia in January 2022, according to Mediascope. 
And while RuTube's video player works well, it lacks the algorithmic recommendations that have made YouTube so popular, Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department at digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, told Reuters.
""These services are no match for the quality and speed of services, above all American services, that users have become accustomed to,"" Darbinyan said. 
VKontakte said all its products underwent ""rigorous testing"" before release, and that it had launched 230 product updates to improve the user experience in the past year.
RuTube did not respond to a request for comment. 
NEWER FACES
Other domestic alternatives to popular foreign services have launched more recently. Gazprom Media unveiled Yappy in November, a rival to video-sharing platform TikTok, which has suspended live-streaming and new video uploads in Russia. 
Since its launch, around 3.2 million users in Russia have installed Yappy, compared to more than 10 million for TikTok, according to estimates up to March 27 from tracker Sensor Tower. 
Rossgram, an imitation of Instagram in name, design and colour scheme, was set to launch this week, but its founders only succeeded in publishing a video of a prototype hours after the scheduled launch time. 
Different developers said they were launching a black and white, melancholy alternative to the U.S. photo sharing platform, called 'Grustnogram', or 'Sadgram' in English. Others are building a Google Play store alternative.
Another service that Gorelkin and other government figures have promoted in recent weeks is messaging app Telegram, seemingly recovering from its chequered past with the Russian state, which tried unsuccessfully to block it in 2018.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov was also the brains behind VKontakte, but fled Russia in 2014 after allies of the Kremlin gained control of the platform. 
Telegram says its more than 500 million global users generate over 500 billion views in one-to-many channels every month. It allows sponsored messages of related content in public channels. Already hugely popular in Russia, the platform would benefit from any outflow of users from WhatsApp.

Used by around 67 million people in Russia last year, according to Insider Intelligence estimates, WhatsApp remains available for now.

(Reuters) - Companies raced to bond markets last month, undeterred by the Ukraine war as they tried to lock in relatively cheap borrowing, though the March rush did not prevent first-quarter sales in the euro market from slumping to a four-year low.
Bond markets globally endured immense volatility in the January-March quarter, stoked by hawkish turns from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, as well as Russia's Feb. 23 invasion of Ukraine. That, coupled with lower funding needs, pushed bond issuance lower across all debt categories, with Refinitiv data showing it as the slowest first quarter in three years.
In the euro area, where debt markets froze for longer following the invasion, fundraising by investment-grade companies amounted to 93.6 billion euros, the worst first quarter since 2018, according to Refinitiv. 
But March turned out to be the busiest month since September 2020 for euro investment-grade sales with some 43.5 billion euros raised. 
The U.S. market enjoyed its highest monthly volume on record at any time except during the pandemic liquidity crunch in early 2020, with $130.6 billion of sales in March. First-quarter sales however dropped to a three-year low.

""None of the syndicates expected it to go quite as well, said Helene Jolly, head of EMEA investment-grade corporate syndicate at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), citing volatility, some bond outflows and inflationary pressures.
The March issuance pickup came as credit markets stabilised and risk premia, the additional yield companies pay on top of government bonds, have slipped below levels seen at the start of the invasion. 
Still, borrowing costs in the euro area have tripled for investment-grade companies this year, with the average yield on BofA's index at 1.50%. 
For issuers, ""it's that dynamic of saying: yes (borrowing costs) are higher... but on a historical basis it still looks good and anyone who has come this year has looked smart pretty much immediately in terms of what rates have done,"" Jolly said.
Some companies have been bringing forward their near-term funding plans, she added. 
For a related graphic on Euro IG corporate debt sales, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3J0ll67
But for companies with sub-investment grade credit ratings, the backdrop remains challenging. The euro area saw virtually no ""junk"" debt sales last month, while just $10.6 billion was raised by U.S. junk names.
Issuance slumped 70% compared to first-quarter 2021 in both markets, to the slowest since 2016 in the U.S. and 2019 in the euro area.
A positive sign for the European market waiting to reopen came in recent weeks as two companies carrying split ratings -investment-grade and high yield - managed to place bonds. 
However, a third such company, shopping center owner IGD, postponed a deal after it received less demand than the amount it originally sought to raise, according to a lead manager. 
Daniel Rudnicki Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), head of EMEA leveraged finance at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said based on client discussions, he expects the European high yield market to restart around Easter. 

""If the current market conditions don't worsen, we're going to go through a period of slow issuance that will show gradual progress."" 
Rudnicki Schlumberger said he expects most of the issuance to come from mergers and acquisitions financing, as the rise in borrowing costs and hefty issuance during the pandemic makes refinancing deals less likely.

Investing.com –  Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) stock traded 4% lower Friday after Stifel downgraded it to ‘hold’ with a target of $15.
Analyst Scott Devitt earlier had a ‘buy’ on the stock with a target of $19, according to StreetInsider. The stock fell to a low of $12 in the session so far.
Devitt said the company faces numerous growth challenges that may limit share price appreciation relative to other e-commerce ideas even as he acknowledged its positive attributes: asset-light model, 20%+ margin potential, and a highly engaged user base.
According to the analyst, Apple’s privacy changes have dampened the effectiveness of the company’s marketing investments, resulting in slower user growth and higher marketing costs while Poshmark’s international expansion is yet to materialize.
Initial market launches have fallen short of the management’s expectations as well as the assumptions underpinning Stifel’s model, the analyst wrote.
With no clear catalysts and a modest growth outlook, Devitt said they favored other names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).
Poshmark reported its fourth-quarter numbers on March 22.
Net revenue grew 22% to top $84 million. Gross merchandise value, the value of all goods and services on an online platform, grew 27% to touch nearly $491 million.

Several major Russian companies have listings abroad, which has always been a matter of prestige for them. But since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, Western bourses have halted trading of Russian securities.
Holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies that are traded abroad can convert them into shares on the Russian market, Reshetnikov said.
""When shares here (in Russia) are much more expensive, there is no sense in trading them there. That is why our Russian shares, Russian companies will be obliged to return here unless another government decision is made,"" Reshetnikov said.
U.S.-based bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has already offered clients who hold Russian equities on foreign bourses an option to withdraw from them and receive them in Moscow for a fee, according to a letter sent by the bank and seen by Reuters.
The offer, which is effective from March 30, covered depositary receipts in more than a dozen major Russian firms, including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), VTB and Novatek, according to the letter.
BNY said in the letter it would facilitate the swap only if holders attested they would remain the owners of the securities when they are transferred to Russia.
BNY Mellon declined to comment on the swap offer, which was first reported by the Financial Times on Thursday. 
The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in the depositary receipts -- which represent shares in a foreign company -- of Russian companies in early March after prices crashed to record lows.
In London, depositary receipts in Russia's largest lender Sberbank fell to almost zero days after Russian sent thousands of its troops to Ukraine.
In Moscow, Sberbank shares in Moscow rose 16% to 152 roubles ($1.85) per piece in the past seven trading days after Moscow Exchange gradually resumed trading following a nearly month-long hiatus.

The central bank said last month Russian stock exchanges will keep listings of securities of foreign companies with Russian roots even if they delist from foreign bourses.

The removal from the brokerage's ""Analyst Focus List"" comes as analysts warn that fresh coronavirus lockdowns in China and rising cost of goods due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand in 2022.
Analyst Samik Chatterjee said a moderation in consumer spending would temper higher expectation from the recent iPhone SE launch, while a slowdown in gaming in China could weigh on Apple's services.
Apple is already planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
Qualcomm, meanwhile, will likely bear the brunt of weakness in the smartphone market for low- to mid-end Android handsets, Chatterjee said.
""There has been understandably a lot of noise around demand weakness across global tech, but we believe the macro weakness seeping through the sector will impact the consumer end-markets more materially,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan has dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co of using misleading labeling to exaggerate the amount of strawberries in its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts.
In a Thursday night decision, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter said reasonable shoppers would not expect strawberries to be the main ingredient in a ""pre-packaged, processed sugary treat called Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts.""
The judge said Kellogg's labeling described Pop-Tarts' flavor instead of the source of that flavor, and shoppers like plaintiff Kelvin Brown of Bronx, New York, could check the ingredient list to resolve any confusion.
Carter also rejected the idea that Pop-Tarts buyers missed out on the health benefits of strawberries.
""A reasonable consumer is unlikely to purchase a toaster pastry coated in frosting exclusively for the nutritional value of strawberries in its fruit filling,"" he wrote.
A lawyer for Brown had no immediate comment on Friday. Kellogg and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last month, a federal judge in Chicago dismissed a similar lawsuit over unfrosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts, saying Kellogg did not guarantee how many strawberries it would use.
The Battle Creek, Michigan-based company is also being sued over its Whole Grain Frosted Strawberry and Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts.
Lawsuits over false labeling are common, and many are unsuccessful.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan dismissed a lawsuit accusing  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) of deceiving purchasers of ""Stoned Wheat Thins"" into thinking the snack cracker contained stone-ground whole wheat flour.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's vow to cut customers off from its gas unless they start paying in roubles is more of a 'bluff' to ward off further sanctions than a genuine threat to stop supplying energy, according to European officials and analysts.
Gas was flowing to Europe normally on Friday, and some experts reckon the new arrangement may be broadly the same as the old process of paying, with only a slight boost for the embattled Russian currency. 
Below is an outline of why, for now at least, Putin's gas ultimatum is considered bluster.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Europe is heavily reliant on Russia for its energy needs, with around 40% of its gas coming from the country. So if Moscow turned off the taps it could trigger immediate shortages, factory closures and crippling energy costs.
Gas contracts are priced in euros or dollars but Putin said they should be paid in roubles.
Western countries called Putin's demand ""blackmail"" and refused. Now it seems they won't have to change much, although they may switch how they pay for their gas in order to put money more directly into Russia's pocket.
Under the decree signed by Putin, foreign gas buyers must open accounts in state-controlled Gazprombank from Friday and pay direct - rather than, say, a German buyer using a local bank to transfer the money. 
Gazprombank would then use that money to buy roubles, propping up the currency, a role typically done by the Russian central bank, which has been hobbled by the freezing of hundreds of billions of its reserves in response to war.
Putin's rouble demand baffled many European officials and experts and much remains unclear, making a final assessment difficult.
There will be a time lag before we know whether the new payment arrangement is workable because gas bills are paid weeks after delivery. That means any dispute - or gas cut -is some time off, if it happens at all.
There was no sign on Friday of immediate interruptions. Flows remained steady through two of the three main pipelines bringing Russian gas into Europe - Nord Stream 1 across the Baltic Sea, and into Slovakia over Ukraine.
Flows through the other main route, the Yamal-Europe pipeline over Belarus, had reversed direction, now bringing gas from Germany to Poland, but this is not uncommon.
IS IT A 'STORM IN A TEACUP?'
For now, it seems so. European officials and experts believe it is chiefly aimed at shielding Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) from future sanctions - if Gazprombank collects the money, Europe could not sanction it without cutting gas.
An Italian minister said that if Russia's decree to pay for gas in roubles stays as it is ""all in all, not a lot would change"".
""It amounts to a warning from Putin not to tighten financial sanctions further,"" said Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, a think tank.
It wouldn't be much of a boost for the rouble either. Prior to the invasion, the Russian central bank required most of the foreign currency from gas to be converted into roubles. Now all of it would have to be switched into the Russian currency.
""What sounded grandiose has turned into a storm in a teacup. By making it the main recipient of money for gas, it puts an extra shield against sanctions around Gazprombank,"" said Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
One European official said he believed Putin had demanded the switch to rouble payment to test who would go along with it. But noone did. 
""After the pushback, he is trying to find a system where he could claim that he had won, while in fact something close to the status quo is continuing,"" the official said.
WILL THE LIGHTS GO OUT?
Energy exports are Putin's most powerful lever as Russia tries to fight back against what it calls an ""economic war"". European officials and analysts are reluctant to say his threats to switch off supplies are truly empty.
Doing so would hurt Russia's Gazprom, as it would struggle to offload all European-bound gas to alternative buyers, said Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at the Moscow-based brokerage Locko-Invest.

Experts believe it is nonetheless symbolically important and it has rattled faith in Russia's reliability in Germany, which this week had to take the exceptional step of warning of potential rationing ahead.
One European Union official said that while he considered the threatened cutoff without payment in roubles to be a 'bluff' the full implications of Putin's demands were unclear and that a tougher stance could emerge in the coming days.

At the moment, Fisker doesn't plan to raise prices for the Ocean in 2022 or 2023 but it cant guarantee that will be the case going forward given inflation.
Citi analyst Itay Michaeli reiterated a Buy rating following an encouraging update.
""After catching up with management (CFO/IR), we noted the following: (a) Ocean demand strength appears broad-based; (b) Planned 2023 production range intact; (c) Company is less focused on optimizing vehicle gross margin during the 2023 ramp, and is increasingly focused on incremental opportunities within installed-base economics.

The buyback was planned before April 11, the company said in a statement, adding it hoped ""to provide more information about the evolution of our shareholder structure in the coming days"".
Business daily Les Echos and other French media reported that French shipping group CMA CGM was set to acquire Gefco.
CMA CGM declined to comment.
Gefco, which did not explain how it would finance the buyout, said running its business had become ""extremely difficult due to our shareholding structure"".
Western industrial players are seeking to cut their ties with partners in Russia, which has become increasingly isolated after invading neighbour Ukraine at the end of February. 
The British government, in its latest round of sanctions on March 24, cited state-owned RZD, along with some defence companies and the Wagner Group, known for employing mercenaries, for aiding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Gefco said the British sanctions, as well as EU and U.S. restrictions, should not impact Gefco as an independent company registered in France.
Founded in 1949, Gefco employs 11,500 staff in 47 countries and sells transport services to Stellantis, Ford,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Skoda and Toyota, as well as Nestle and Electrolux.
Until 2012, it was fully owned by France's PSA group, which last year merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis. 
Facing pressure to cut costs, PSA in 2012 sold a 75% stake in Gefco to RZD for 800 million euros ($884.00 million). 
Sources told Reuters last year RZD and Stellantis had put Gefco up for sale in a deal expected to be worth more than 2 billion euros. Neither owner commented.
Les Echos, citing sources, said the potential deal with CMA CGM would value Gefco at 450 million-500 million euros.

CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container shipping lines, has invested heavily in non-maritime logistics in recent years through a series of acquisitions.

MADRID (Reuters) -The chairman of Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) on Friday called for the European Union to define what kind of lending is considered consistent with a net zero energy policy, to help hasten moves to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas.
The EU, which was already targeting a shift towards green energy from fossil fuels, has said since Russia invaded Ukraine in February that it will cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year and end the use of Russian gas by 2027.
""Among other initiatives, financial institutions must be able to finance the energy transition, and to this end, the authorities must define as soon as possible what lending is deemed consistent with our net zero goals,"" Ana Botin told a shareholders meeting.
Botin said that though Santander's direct exposure to Russia was negligible at 80 million euros ($88.4 million), it expected some indirect impact from the Ukraine conflict stemming from higher inflation and lower economic growth. 
She said the bank's internal assessment assumed ""no further escalation and the war contained within Ukraine"".
Botin underlined the need to change global energy policies and accelerate investments in renewables, ""so we can help people to go green and businesses to make the necessary transition"".
She said that process would be ""more challenging"" for emerging economies, for small and mid-sized companies and vulnerable groups, and therefore asked for incentives.
In Spain, companies and families, especially SMEs and the most vulnerable would need protecting from the impact of the war, which has sent energy prices soaring. The Spanish government approved a 16 billion euro package on Tuesday to help companies and households.
Botin said European funds could be used to help support confidence and private investment, a key driver of growth and jobs.
On Thursday, the ECB said euro zone banks' direct exposure to Russia was relatively minor but sanctions could still reverberate through the financial system through volatility in energy and commodity prices.
Botin assured shareholders that the bank had taken necessary steps to comply with financial restrictions and EU, UK and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia, ""and will continue to observe these requisites as the situation develops"".
Santander's Chief Executive Officer, Jose Antonio Alvarez, said the bank was strengthening controls against potential operational threats, including cybersecurity and money laundering.
Spanish banks in general rank among the less exposed to Russian credit, with Spain's central bank estimating their credit risk at just above 700 million euros.

Alvarez said Santander expected the war to have an uneven impact on the group's regions, with Europe the most affected area. The impact in South America would be neutral or positive, he said, as raw material there would be exported at higher prices resulting in a currency appreciation.

(Reuters) -Sanofi plans to list its drug ingredients subsidiary EUROAPI on May 6, saying the business is set to grow and improve its profitability as a separate business. 
Having received approval from the French markets regulator, the listing on the Euronext Paris exchange is set to take place shortly after a May 3  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) shareholder vote on the listing, the French pharmaceutical giant said on Friday.
Sanofi shareholders will receive one EUROAPI share for 23 shares held in the parent company.
The company confirmed plans to conserve a 30% stake in the business after the listing while France will buy a 12% stake through public-sector bank EPIC Bpifrance for up to 150 million euros ($166 million). 
The flotation plan for the group with its Europe-based production network comes as the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's attack on Ukraine have heightened concerns in the EU over the region's dependency on critical pharma ingredient imports.
""You can read also through the participation of BPIFrance the interest in terms of regional sovereignty and development. It’s not just the interest of France. It is the interest of the whole of Europe,"" Sanofi finance chief Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in an analyst call.
L'Oreal, Sanofi's largest shareholder with a more than 9% stake, agreed to a one-year lock-up period after the listing, Sanofi added.
EUROAPI makes active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for medicines and draws on six production sites in Italy, Germany, Britain, France and Hungary.
Sanofi, which last year accounted for half EUROAPI's revenue, said in January that it expects the business to become the world's second-biggest API player with about 1 billion euros in revenue forecast for this year.
Sanofi CFO de Chatillon said that EUROAPI's estimated core profit margin this year of at least 14%, well below the 21% for EUROAPI's closest rival Siegfried AG of Switzerland, was a case in point why Sanofi was not the best owner.
""When you see the peer performance there is a margin for improvement that we truly believe is going to be delivered,"" said de Chatillon.
The new company's CEO said Karl Rotthier said, as an independent group, EUROAPI would win over more of Sanofi rivals as customers, expand in high-margin drug development services and advisory and cut more costs.

The bulk of EUROAPI's share capital, 58%, will be distributed to Sanofi shareholders through a dividend in kind, in addition to a previously proposed 3.33 euros per share cash payout.

GUANTA/CARACAS (Reuters) - On the outskirts of the eastern Venezuelan port town of Guanta, hundreds of trucks line up everyday to unload tons of scrap metal, part of the government's attempt to turn waste into a source of foreign currency. 
The gathering and sale of scrap has been booming due to the financial needs of President Nicolas Maduro's administration, crippled by low oil production as a result of years of under-investment in the industry and obstacles to selling its most lucrative export due to U.S. sanctions.
""Venezuela is going to get lighter, because they're removing all the scrap,"" said Douglas Lugo, a truck driver on the outskirts of Guanta who used to work in the oil industry before he started to transport scrap material. His truck was weighed down with iron waste such as sheet metal, car parts and pieces of rusty doors. 
Under pressure from Washington's sanctions, Maduro's government has been exploring a range of revenue options. Although scrap was sold abroad in very low quantities previously, private companies stepped up efforts to export it starting in mid-2020.
In 2021, Maduro designated scrap as ""strategic"", clearing the way for any surplus to be exported, saying it was necessary to ""turn it into foreign currency ... to take advantage of every last resource that is out there"".
During eight years of economic chaos in Venezuela, state controls have increasingly slowed industries such as manufacturing and construction, while mismanagement and underinvestment have hurt the OPEC member's oil sector. 
State-owned and private companies saddled with outdated plants, equipment and machinery have found it increasingly tempting to sell them as scrap. While the state is behind some such activities, workers and others have also stolen equipment to sell at a profit, prosecutors say.
State-owned oil company PDVSA and other state companies have been among the sellers as new projects have stalled and machinery has aged, some 15 sources, including business people from various sectors, carriers, workers and government officials, told Reuters. 
The dismantling of equipment and its trade has not been confirmed by the authorities. The communication and production ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
Still, port records show that Venezuelan scrap is being exported to countries such as Turkey, India and Taiwan.
Although state-owned Corporation Ezequiel Zamora manages much of the scrap at Venezuela's ports, it has signed contracts or ""partnerships"" with private companies to export it, thus circumventing U.S. sanctions barring Venezuelan state companies from trading abroad, according to a document and two sources. 
The companies pay Zamora in foreign currency, in cash, then arrange to export the material, two sources interviewed told Reuters. Zamora did not respond to a request for comment. 
About 25 companies have been officially authorized to transport and sell scrap metal, according to another document seen by Reuters. 
For all of 2021, 45,500 tons of iron, steel and copper scrap worth US$55 million was exported from two of the country's main ports, according to figures from Import Genius, a consulting firm that gathers customs records, more than double the volume the previous year.
There are no numbers on the other ports. Bolipuertos, which manages the ports, did not respond to requests for comment.
Scrap metal sales ""have increased considerably during the months when the COVID-19 pandemic was most severe, when state revenues were low,"" local firm Ecoanalítica said in a report in February.
On the international market, depending on the type of material, the scrap which the local private companies buy for between US$80 and US$120 per ton can be sold for US$300 and US$700, two sources and two carriers told Reuters.
In northern Monagas, an oil zone in the east of the Andean nation, tanks and pipes are being dismantled, said a source in the oil sector and two workers who witnessed how these materials are cut up in warehouses. 
""Nothing is being restored today, everything is for sale,"" a source said on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. 
Equipment is being dismantled in other oil areas like Zulia and Anzoátegui, another industry source said. Neither source specified who within PDVSA is ordering such moves. 
But with the scrap metal trade booming, some such sales constitute outright theft, according to reports from the police and the public prosecutor's office.
Truckers who once worked for oil or coal companies told Reuters they have been increasingly drawn to haul scrap given that they can easily earn 10 times Venezuela's monthly minimum wage of $30.

""Everyone is working with scrap metal. Before you didn't see that (...),"" said Antonio Astudillo, who used to transport food from Brazil to various Venezuelan states, and since December has been working in the transport of scrap metal to Guanta. 
""You can make money to survive.""

365,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble touched a more than five-week high in early Moscow trade on Friday before settling in the 83-84 range to the dollar, and Russian stocks climbed, with investors eyeing events in Ukraine and an ongoing gas payments saga.
By 1319 GMT, the rouble was 0.2% weaker against the dollar at 83.37, earlier clipping 80.3325, its strongest mark since Feb. 23. It had gained 0.2% to trade at 92.31 versus the euro.
On the interbank market, the rouble was as strong as 75 against the dollar earlier this week and was hovering near 81 on Wednesday. The rouble was at 83.1 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform.
European governments and companies were working on Friday on a common approach to President Vladimir Putin's demand that they pay for Russian gas in roubles as the threat of an imminent halt in supplies eased.
Putin's move has boosted the rouble in the past two weeks.
The currency's lightning-fast recovery to levels last reached in the days before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine is partly down to a genuine improvement in Russia's finances, but also due to being artificially inflated by capital controls.
Other factors that have been working in the rouble's favour include a just-expired quarterly tax period that forces foreign companies to convert dollars and euros, and the finance ministry's offer to buy back FX bonds for Russian holders, said Konstantin Svyatny chief portfolio manager at Aton Brokerage. 
""Taking all this into account, it is likely that we have already seen some kind of local minimum for the (dollar rate against the) rouble,"" he said. 
EASING RESTRICTIONS
Russia's central bank said it was softening restrictions on foreign fund transfers for individuals for six months, permitting limited monthly transfers in foreign currency that may ease the strain on Russians who regularly send funds to relatives abroad.
The bank said the measures would not apply to people from countries that have supported sanctions against Moscow.
""This step looks like a signal that if the rouble strengthens further, we can expect further measures to reduce currency control restrictions,"" said Promsvyazbank analysts in a note. 
Russian stock indexes hit their highest since Feb. 22 before paring some gains.
The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 2.3% at 1,042.8 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 2.3% higher at 2,759.1 points. 

Shares in energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) were up around 3.7%. 
Russian companies whose depositary receipts are traded abroad will be obliged to return to Russia, unless other solutions arise, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on Friday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Carmakers in India reported a sharp rise in annual sales for the fiscal year 2022 on Friday, but warned of future risks from global supply chain disruptions.
Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest carmaker, said sales rose 13% in the fiscal year ended March 31 to 1.65 million units, growing for the first time in two years. But the company warned that ""the supply situation of electronic components continues to be unpredictable"".
This might have ""some impact"" on the production volume in the current fiscal year, Maruti said in a statement. Maruti, which sells one in every two cars in India, is majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp.
Automakers globally have been forced to make sharp production cuts over the past year as supply chain disruptions and booming demand for consumer electronics have led to an acute shortage of semiconductors. This has resulted in long wait times for car buyers. 
Now, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to worsen the problem as both countries supply raw materials used to manufacture semiconductors, Indian ratings agency ICRA said.
""The impact of the crisis in the form of higher fuel and commodity prices also poses a risk to (automobile) demand prospects, in case it materialises into a long drawn out war,"" ICRA said.

 Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), which is also India's largest electric carmaker, reported its highest ever annual sales of passenger vehicles, up 67% to 370,372 units from a year ago. Its electric car sales grew nearly four times to 19,000, the company said in a statement, despite ""two waves of Covid, semi-conductor crisis and steep increase in commodity prices"".
""Going forward, semi-conductor situation remains uncertain. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation closely,"" said Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility.

Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 11% Friday after the company said it plans to seek shareholder approval for a stock split.
Some traders are betting that the stock split will boost the value of GameStop shares by attracting more meme-stock aficionados.
The gaming retailer will request at its upcoming annual meeting that shareholders approve a proposal to increase the number of Class A shares to 1 billion from 300 million, according to a filing. The move comes amidst a revival in interest among retail investors for so-called 'meme stocks' after a lull of a few months.
A stock split makes the shares more accessible to individual investors by lowering the price, without affecting the company's valuation.
The company said the split will “provide flexibility for future corporate needs.” It’s unclear when GameStop will release its definitive proxy statement. The company hasn’t announced when and where it will hold its annual meeting, though last year’s meeting took place in June.
Earlier this week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) disclosed its plans for its second split in less than two years which sent its market cap soaring by more than $80 billion in a single session.
GameStop is the original meme stock that the retail traders took fancy to during the pandemic as thousands of them, closeted at home during lockdowns, coordinated trades over social platforms like Reddit. It almost seemed like a battle between Reddit followers ‘WallStreetBets’ on one hand and the big institutional guys on the other. The stock rose 4,000% in 2021."

""Over the course of the last month, there has been understandably a lot of noise around demand weakness across global tech, but we believe the macro weakness seeping through the sector will impact the Consumer end-markets more materially followed by a moderation in Business/Commercial spending if macro headwinds were to persist longer than can be dismissed as simply temporary.

Businesses with great exposure to the consumer sector are likely to suffer more in the first half of this year, with the rest of the coverage to follow the same path later this year.
""We expect to see Telecom and Cloud spending to be the most resilient to the macro situation on a near- to medium-term basis, with Enterprise customer spending more susceptible to the macro,"" Chatterjee concluded.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, supported by a jobs report that showed the labor market still in rude health despite concerns about inflation and prospective higher interest rates. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 101 points, or 0.3% at 34,780 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, in a positive start to the second quarter. The first quarter of the year had been the worst for stocks since the start of the pandemic two years ago. 
Earlier, the Labor Department said the economy added another 431,000 jobs in the month through mid-March, and while that was a slowdown from last month and less than generally expected, the miss was more than compensated by an aggregate upward revision of 95,000 to the data from the previous two months. The jobless rate fell to 3.8%, its lowest since 2019, while measures of underemployment and labor force participation also picked up. The latter signaled that higher wages - which grew at 5.6% on the year through March, are tempting people back into the workforce, after they had left it during the age of lockdowns. 
The market gave up some of its gains after the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI for March pointed to ongoing severe price pressures. The prices paid subindex rose to 87.1 from 75.6, hitting its highest since July last year when global supply chains were at their most stressed. 
The mood was improved by a Bloomberg report, citing anonymous sources, saying that Chinese authorities were willing to allow most of the Chinese companies with ADRs listed in the U.S. to provide all the information sought by U.S. regulators to defend those listings.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 6.7%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs rose 8.9% and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs rose 8.0%.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock also rose 5.8% after seeking approval for a stock split, a move that typically makes stocks more attractive to small-scale investors. Fellow meme stock BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), meanwhile, fell 12% after its disappointing quarterly report, in which its cybersecurity business failed to hit the ambitious targets set for it by the retail investor crowd.
Financial stocks, however, came under pressure again as expectations for higher short-term interest rates - which were reinforced by both the labor market and the ISM data - pushed up short-term bond yields, compressing the lending margins that provide commercial lenders with their main source of income. The so-called spread between two-year and 10-year bond yields has vanished to nothing, having been as wide as 127 basis points less than six months ago. Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock fell 1.7% to its lowest since November 2020, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 1.0% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 1.2%.

We continue to believe DELL remains inexpensive compared to its peers, but we see increasing fundamental headwinds hindering this value unlock, Hall said in a client note.
The analyst sees fundamental risks for Dell with the PC demand already moderating for low-end consumers while the high-end is also expected to inflect this year.
These demand trends could be exacerbated on the negative side by increasing pressure on the consumer economy, driven by inflation. We also expect PC ASPs to soften as supply/demand equilibrium improves and discounting comes back. On the ISG front, we see Dell's situation as more mixed with our proprietary EAI/ESI indices pointing towards a slowdown in IT spending even as the company's mid-range storage is starting to ramp well.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sales of new electrified vehicles in France overtook petrol-powered equivalents for the first time in the first quarter, a major milestone for lower-emission vehicles amid high prices at petrol pumps and government subsidies for electrified models.
Overall, French new car sales fell in the first quarter and recorded their tenth straight month of declines with an almost 20% drop in March, as the auto industry struggles to with supply chain issues including a global shortage of semiconductor chips.
Sales of fully electric and hybrid models accounted for nearly 40% of new car sales, versus 38.3% for conventional petrol models, according to industry data provided by the Plateforme automobile (PFA).
A spokesperson for the PFA said due to uncertainty over the war in Ukraine and shortages of some components, it was not possible to provide a forecast for French new car sales in 2022. 
Adding in diesel model sales' market share of 16.5% in the first quarter, pure combustion engine models are still in the majority. 
But this is a sea change in auto sales, as electrified vehicles were a niche market just three years ago. 
Encouraged by subsidies, looming bans on fossil-fuel models and high petrol prices, electrified models have become mainstream in a very short space of time.
The top-selling electric car in France in March was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s mass-market Model 3, followed by the Dacia Spring from  Renault  (PA:RENA) and the Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) 208 from Stellantis.

French car sales were down 17.3% in the first quarter. 
In 2020, the French car market fell off a cliff due to the coronavirus pandemic, but then rose slightly in 2021.

With cash and bonds offering negative real yields, investors are still inclined to buy the dips in global equities, despite deteriorating fundamentals. Citi economists expect US real yields to go positive in 2023, which may prove more challenging.

(Reuters) - Russian steelmaker Evraz, whose biggest shareholder is sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich, on Friday scrapped plans to separate its coal assets, citing sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. 
The London-listed company said the sanctions made it ""technically impossible"" to execute the demerger it proposed early last year to concentrate on its core steel business.
The move comes after Evraz indefinitely suspended the demerger of the Russia-based assets, consolidated under Raspadskaya (RASP), last month as it sought more clarity on sanctions against Abramovich. 
Evraz has said Abramovich, who has a 28.64% stake in the company and owns English soccer club Chelsea, does not have effective control of Evraz, adding it believes the company is neither designated nor sanctioned.
Evraz, whose shares had lost more than 60% in value since the sanctions began when they were suspended from trading on March 10, has been thrown into turmoil by the sanctions - with only its CEO remaining on the board after a director exodus, and last month a bond payment was blocked.
The West has imposed broad economic and political sanctions on Russia, Russian firms, and prominent or wealthy Russians since Moscow launched what it calls ""a special military operation,"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich on March 10, freezing his assets and preventing him from travelling to the country.

Evraz said on Friday RASP would remain part of the company.
In March, index provider FTSE Russell said it would remove four Russia-focussed companies, including Evraz, from all FTSE's indexes, after many brokers refused to trade their shares.

Investing.com – BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock traded 5.5% lower in premarket Friday as key businesses struggled in the fourth quarter and revenue fell by 12%.
Cybersecurity business, its biggest, was flat due to increased competition. Revenue in the segment, facing competition from much bigger rivals like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), was $122 million.
The sluggishness in the automobile industry, brought upon by shortage of parts and semiconductors, continues to weigh on the company. Demand for its QNX software has been under stress as automakers have curtailed production due to shortage of semiconductors and other parts.
The company had, in September, warned that a drop in automobile production will continue to adversely affect its numbers over the next two quarters.
The IoT unit partly helped offset the setbacks. IoT revenue was $52 million on higher margins.
The company's net income for the quarter ended February 28 came in at $144 million compared to a net loss of $315 million a year ago.
Revenue in the quarter was $185 million, compared to $210 million last time.

The findings underscore the difficulty in preventing community infections as the Word Health Organization (WHO) warns of a rise in cases.
The research project, run by Open Orphan with Imperial College, London, showed that among the 18 participants that caught COVID-19, the severity of symptoms, or whether they developed symptoms at all, had nothing to do with the viral load in their airways.
The viral load, or tendency to shed the virus, was measured by two methods known as focus-forming assay (FFA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
""There was no correlation between the amount of viral shedding by qPCR or FFA and symptom score,"" the researchers said in paper published by scientific journal Nature Medicine.
The Imperial trial exposed 36 healthy young adults without a history of infection or vaccination to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of the virus and monitored them in a quarantined setting.

Since two volunteers were found to have had antibodies against the virus after all, they were excluded from the analysis. Slightly more than half of them contracted the virus.
No serious adverse events occurred, and the human challenge study model was shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy young adults, the research team had said earlier this year.

“This is the perfect environment for the TSX and the commodities sectors,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. “And it also doesn’t seem like it’s going to end any time soon. Some of these companies that have weathered the bad commodity environment are coming out on the other side and are really going to become incredibly profitable.” 
Investors have another reason to be bullish. Average earnings per share are expected to grow 33% this year for Canadian firms, compared with 20% for U.S. companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Energy producers are expected to drive the profit boom, with analysts forecasting that average EPS will soar 68%.
That’s making Canadian stocks look cheap: Companies on the S&P/TSX are trading below their five-year average valuation, at 13.9 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months. Companies on the S&P 500 are flying higher than their average at 19.4 times earnings.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s heavy tech stocks weighting pushed the index to its worst quarter since the pandemic shut down global economies.
“We’ve had a rotation into value,” said Ian de Verteuil, head of portfolio strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “And at any metric, the TSX looks cheaper than the S&P 500.”
While a decline in commodity prices could affect investor sentiment, what’s more important is how companies allocate their capital. 
“A decline in commodity prices would affect sentiment, but it’s not as if the TSX is pricing in $100 crude,” de Verteuil said. “These companies can make a lot of money at $80 per barrel. The thing that we will need to see -- and this is the most debatable part of it -- is whether the C-suites of these companies have found religion” on capital spending. During past commodity booms, Canadian energy companies used their cash flow to increase production. This time, there are signs they’re sticking with dividends and share buybacks, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Which market has it right? 
With the first quarter of 2022 over, the U.S. stock and bond markets appear to be conveying drastically different assessments of the growth outlook, leaving investors to decide which view will prevail. 
The S&P 500 has come roaring back from a near-13% decline and finished the quarter off 4.9% after a rebound that has defied worries over tighter monetary policy and geopolitical instability stemming from the war in Ukraine. Many stock investors have even shrugged off a brief inversion of a closely watched section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve – a phenomenon that has predicted past recessions. 
Bond investors appear far more pessimistic on the economy, with the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA index on track for its worst start to the year ever on worries that the Fed will cause recession by aggressively tightening monetary policy in its bid to fight surging inflation. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury are up 81 basis points this quarter and stand near their highest level since May 2019. 
Illustrating the countervailing forces in markets, the CBOE Volatility Index - viewed as a gauge of fear in equity markets - stands not far from its lows of the year, with investors pinning the reversal in stocks on everything from quarter-end rebalancing to buying from retail investors. At the same time, the ICE BofAML MOVE index, which tracks Treasury yield volatility, remains elevated. 
""Rates markets are very consistent in telling a story where the Fed is going to do some damage to the economy, (while) risk markets have not really done a good job of pricing any significant damage to the growth outlook,"" said Edward Al Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle. ""One of these stories is wrong."" 
One source of contention among investors has been the yield curve, where rates for two-year Treasuries briefly rose above those for 10-year Treasuries earlier this week. 
Such an inversion is concerning because it has preceded six of the seven recessions since 1978, according to data from Truist Advisory Services. Some investors, however, have given a broad range of reasons why the signal’s predictive power may not apply this time, including the potentially distortive effects of the Fed’s massive COVID-19 stimulus on rates markets. 
In any case, recessions have followed past inversions with an average lag of 16 months, and the S&P 500 has averaged an 11% gain in the 12 months following inversions, Truist's data showed. 
Overall, the S&P 500 has lost an average of 8.8% during the four recessions since 1990, according to CFRA data. 
""We would take this (equity) rally as a sort of a gift,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. “If you weren't able to reduce your exposure to some of the speculative areas of the market before the correction, now is your time.” 
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, cautioned investors against over-interpreting the exuberance in stocks or the gloom in the bond market. Still, the firm has scaled back its outlook for global earnings growth and now sees a more modest upside for stocks with a year-end target of 4,700 on the S&P 500. The index closed at 4,530.41 on Thursday.
Others have pointed out that the gap between yields on the 3-month and 10-year Treasuries – another closely followed measure – is positive by approximately 180 basis points. 
That’s a sign there is still room for the Fed to shift gears before the market starts to price in a recession, said Gary Cloud, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. 
Though policymakers have said they could raise rates by as much as 50 basis points in a single meeting if warranted and investors are pricing in some 200 basis points of tightening this year, ""the Fed doesn't want to tighten so much that it causes a recession,"" Cloud said. [L2N2VW1SG]
Others, however, are skeptical the Fed will be able to engineer a soft landing. 

Tim Murray, a capital markets strategist in the multi-asset division at T. Rowe Price, is moving into commodities and defensive sectors of the stock market while increasing allocations to longer-duration Treasuries, assets he believes will thrive during a downturn. 
""Once the Fed starts hiking, there's a good chance that we will have a recession in the relatively near future,"" Murray said. ""I get a sense that investors are not worried enough about this.""

The plan comes as shares of GameStop and other so-called ""meme"" stocks including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings are seeing renewed interest from retail investors, who are piling into riskier assets emboldened by hopes of a resolution in Russia's conflict with Ukraine.
Shares of GameStop, which have nearly doubled in value in the past two weeks, rose another 15% to $192 on bets that a stock split, which makes shares of a company more affordable, would boost the value of the retailer by attracting more retail traders.
Stock splits are becoming more common as companies look to manage ""their stock price in what is considered an investor-friendly range"", said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently announced upcoming share splits.
""Are splits the new buyback? Probably not, but highlights an additional tool to push stock prices higher despite financial theory saying otherwise,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.
Silverblatt signaled there could be more stock splits in the offing, noting that there were still eight stocks in the S&P 500 priced over $1,000 and 15 between $500 and $1,000.

Shares of most of the companies that have either announced or split their stock so far were trading over $500 before the split.
Shares of AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond Inc, another retail darling, gained nearly 3% and 5%, respectively, in trading before the opening bell on Friday.

The widely tracked U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019 as the Fed signalled a willingness to go hard and fast on tightening to curb inflation.
The 10-year yields falling beneath 2-year rates is widely seen as a harbinger of economic recession.
As investor caution crept in, U.S. equity funds faced outflows worth worth $1.58 billion during the week, compared with inflows of $13.89 billion in the previous week.
U.S. investors offloaded value funds worth $5.63 billion in their biggest weekly net selling since mid-Oct., while growth funds also faced withdrawals of $557 million.

Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of Chinese companies were up across the board in premarket trading Friday after reports that the country may grant U.S. regulators full access to audit reports of its firms listed on American exchanges.
Chinese authorities had so far been reluctant to allow the access. Had that stand continued, many of those companies risked getting delisted from American exchanges.
The root of the case is in a 2020 U.S. law that mandates public companies to grant American authorities access to audit work papers. Firms face delisting in case of non-compliance for three straight years.
According to reports, Securities and Exchange Commission had prepared a list of companies that were refusing to provide access. This included Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and its video arm iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) (up 9% and 13%, respectively, in premarket), Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) (5%),  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) (6%),  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) (7%), ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) (5%) and  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU) (12%).
The news had a positive impact on shares of other Chinese firms also, given the fears of their peers being delisted had weighed on them as well.
ADRs of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) were both up 6%.  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and Didi (NYSE:DIDI) also surged, rising 13% and 15%, respectively.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial investors including KKR and EQT (NYSE:EQT) are considering offers for a stake in listed German laboratory supplier Stratec, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. 
According to a report by Bloomberg, Permira and CVC are also interested in a 40.55% stake held by company founder Hermann Leistner and his family.
Considerations are at an early stage, but a deal could trigger a takeover bid to all shareholders. It is not yet clear whether the offers are individual or potentially joint bids.
JP Morgan is advising Stratec, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
KKR, EQT, Permira, Stratec and JP Morgan declined to comment. CVC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Stratec shares listed in Germany’s small-cap SDAX index rose more than 17% on Friday morning, driven by the takeover speculation. 
The company is valued at 1.23 billion euros ($1.36 billion) on the stock exchange.
The biomedical technology firm benefited from demand for laboratory products during the coronavirus pandemic. 
It employs about 1,400 people and produces machinery to automate in-vitro testing in laboratories, including for for coronavirus. 
Its earnings for the first nine months of 2021 rose 61% to 58 million euros.

Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of Chinese EV-makers traded sharply higher in premarket Friday after all of them reported robust sales in March.
Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) was the biggest gainer with its stock up 9%. Sales in March more than tripled from a year ago to 15,414 units. Monthly delivery of the P7 smart sports sedan exceeded 9,000 in March for the first time, reaching 9,183 units, the company said.

The analyst believes Tesla is experiencing very strong demand for its products with indicators showing shipments had been tracking up modestly qoq and ahead of the Street.
However, the shutdown of the Shanghai plant for several days presents an incremental downside risk to Delaney's 315k delivery estimate. While the Street consensus is 309k, Delaney says Tesla could report numbers that end up being in line to modestly above the Street.
We estimate based on CPCA data that daily production from the Shanghai Gigafactory has recently been ~2K vehicles per day, although part of the production in the last week of the quarter would likely be for deliveries in 2Q. In addition, disruptions to Tesla's supply chain in China from lockdowns could also weigh on production. For example, Tesla supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) has also halted some production in Shanghai, Delaney said in a client note.
A team of analysts at Goldman Sachs, led by Delaney, also analyzed Tesla app downloads, which were up low single digits qoq and up significantly yoy, albeit with some geographic dispersion.
Delaney also previewed Tesla's Q1 earnings report with his full-year projection for 2022 sitting at 1.51 million deliveries - above the Street at 1.455 million - and the full-year EPS estimate of $11.20, again higher than the FactSet consensus at $10.86.
The analyst expects a more muted Q1 for EPS given rising input prices and factory start-up costs. Delaney also expects margins to go further up as a result of the raised prices and new factories.
We believe Tesla's ability to pass on higher pricing and navigate the supply chain will position it well this year, the analyst concluded.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong stock exchange suspended from trade on Friday the shares of Chinese developers such as Sunac China, Shimao Group and Kaisa Group, and about 30 other firms for a delay in declaring annual results.
Hong Kong-listed firms usually have three months after the end of the financial year to publish results, though regulators in 2020 allowed trade to continue if companies whose audits were affected by pandemic curbs issued preliminary results without agreement with auditors, or published management accounts.
""The exchange is committed to maintaining a fair, orderly and continuous market,"" the exchange operator, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), said in a statement.
It would monitor developments to ensure suspensions were as short as reasonably possible, it added.
Of the 32 firms suspended for missing the March 31 deadline, 14 had audits affected by pandemic curbs, the exchange said. That compared with 57 suspended in the corresponding period last year, when two were related to COVID-19. 
Late on Thursday, Shimao Group said its shares would be suspended from Friday as it was unable to publish unaudited 2021 results in time, because of the outbreak.
The pandemic had led to the lockdown of an office building at the firm's Shanghai headquarters and quarantine of some staff, with the date for curbs to be lifted still uncertain, Shimao added. 
On Monday, Sunac China had said trading in its shares would be halted for missing the HKEX deadline.
On Tuesday, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd, a unit of embattled developer China Evergrande Group, flagged a suspension for the same reason.
The firm would work with its auditor to publish results in about three months and seek to resume trading as soon as possible, it added. 

Other companies facing trading suspensions over the delay included Aoyuan Healthy Life Group, Fantasia Holdings and Kaisa Group.
In Shanghai, more Chinese companies are halting domestic listing plans, as the coronvirus outbreak hampers due diligence and information-gathering.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - When Silicon Valley chipmaker Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) learned that one of its chips was found in a Russian surveillance drone recovered in 2016, it set out to investigate how that came to be.
The chip, which costs less than $2, was shipped in 2009 to a distributor in Asia, which sold it to another broker in Asia, which later went out of business. 
“We couldn’t trace it any further,”  Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Chief Operations Officer Chris Koopmans said in a recent interview. 
Years later, it reappeared in the drone recovered in Lithuania. Marvell’s experience is one of a myriad of examples of how chipmakers lack ability to track where many of their lower-end products end up, executives and experts said. That could stymie the enforcement of new U.S. sanctions designed to halt the export of U.S. technology into Russia. 
While higher-end sophisticated chips that can build supercomputers are sold directly to companies, lower-cost commodity ones that might just control the power often go through several resellers before they end up in a gadget. 
The global chip industry is expected to ship 578 billion chips this year, 64% of them “commodity” chips, said TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson. 
While Russia accounted for less than 0.1% of global chip purchases before the sanctions, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, new Western sanctions underscore the threat in human terms.
“All those drones we've seen were not armed,” said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at the European Union- and Germany-funded Conflict Armament Research group, which found the chips in the drones. 
“Some of these drones that we have documented, like the Forpost, are now used in their armed version in the current conflict” in Ukraine, he said.
The report that prompted Marvell’s tracking work published late last year by the Conflict Armament Research also found chips in Russian drones from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI),  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and STMicroelectronics. 
Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics did not reply to Reuters for comment; NXP and Analog Devices said they comply with sanctions; Intel said it’s against its products being used for human rights violations; and Samsung (KS:005930) said it does not make chips for military purposes.
Military weapons such as drones, guided missiles, helicopters, fighter jets, vehicles and electronic warfare equipment all need chips and experts say they often use older chips that are well tested out. Now, under new U.S. sanctions even some of the most basic chips cannot be shipped to prohibited Russian entities. 
For the most sensitive chips, controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. company selling them can be held responsible if the chip ends up with an entity on the U.S. banned list, said Daniel Fisher-Owens, a specialist on chips and export control and at law firm Berliner Corcoran & Rowe.
    ‘LIKE THE DRUG BUSINESS’
    Figuring out where chips go is like tracking the flow of narcotics, experts say.
“It’s like the drug business,” said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There's cutouts. There's middlemen. There's money laundering … There's a black market distribution network.” 
The point of the Russian sanctions, Lewis said, isn’t to track every chip, but to disrupt their supply chain, which the intelligence community has been working on.
Finding a solution could take creative technical approaches.
""Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it,” and allows it to work, Eric Schmidt, the former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) chairman, told Reuters in a recent interview, discussing high-end processors.
Marvell says it has a growing number of products supporting fingerprinting and tracing, and is working with industry partners and customers to advance this area. The Global Semiconductor Alliance has proposed its members work on building a “Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security” https://www.gsaglobal.org/iot/ties to tag and trace chips, said Tom Katsioulas, technology executive at the industry group.
That may be a lot harder to do for a $2 chip, without making it prohibitively expensive. The answer could be a matter of manufacturing process, regulation and, perhaps, will.

“Ironically, the technology to do this, all of the things that we've got in there, the blockchain, the IDs in the device, this has all been done before for other applications,” said Michael Ford an executive at Aegis Software who is working with the industry standards group IPC for better supply chain security. “All that is needed is that catalyst to make it happen.”

(Reuters) -French catering and food services company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) lowered its annual revenue growth outlook on Friday citing the pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and the closure of COVID-19 testing centres it ran in the United Kingdom. 
The world's second-largest food catering services group behind Britain's Compass said it expected organic revenue growth to come in around the bottom of its previous forecast range of 15% to 18% for its 2022 financial year to Aug. 31.
Sodexo also said it had terminated its investments in Russia following the war in Ukraine and that contracts won last year and which should have started in the second half of 2022 would not materialise. 
The loss of revenue from the terminated contracts is estimated at 40 million euros ($44 million), Sodexo said.
Sodexo shares had slumped 8.5% to 67.56 euros by 0936 GMT. 
""Our business in Russia is small, but it was growing fast,"" Chief Financial Officer Marc Rolland told analysts on a call.
Sodexo, whose Russian activities represent less than 1% of its revenue, said last week it was ""closely monitoring the situation and examining various options"".
 Compass Group  (LON:CPG) said last week it had completed the disposal of its operations in Russia, after announcing earlier in March its decision to leave the Russian market permanently and to move away from all known Russian suppliers.
NEGOTIATIONS WITH FOOD SUPPLIERS
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, once known as the breadbasket of Europe, is also sending food and energy prices to record highs, clouding the outlook for the global economy as consumer finances come under pressure.
""We are very, very vigilant because the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine is causing a certain volatility in certain commodities, so it's something we are watching like a hawk,"" Rolland said in a call with reporters. 
Sodexo says it was negotiating and changing suppliers to deal with rising food prices.
""We are negotiating. We are changing suppliers,"" he said. ""The relationship with suppliers is built over a long period of time. It's not just we buy the cheapest now available on the market."" 
However, the company said it remained confident it could manage inflationary pressure on margins, with its business model allowing price rises to be passed on to clients progressively.
Sodexo also said contracts to operate COVID-19 testing centres in UK had ended on March 31, much earlier than expected. 

It posted half-year underlying operating profit of 538 million euros, ahead of analyst expectations for 530 million euros, and said it has seen a pick-up since the end of February.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) on Friday said it was on track to meet its 2022 profitability target and maintained its mid-term goals thanks to solid performance in the Americas and a recovery in Europe.
The lender reiterated its target of more than 13% for underlying return on tangible equity (ROTE) up from 12.73% in 2021 despite soaring energy prices felt predominantly in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Santander for 2022 also maintained its target of around 12% core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio, kept its dividend pay-out target at 40% and its cost-income ratio, a measure of efficiency, at 45% versus 46.2% at end-December.
Santander's diversification, especially in Latin America, has helped the bank cope with tough conditions for lenders in Europe since the financial crisis.
Its underlying profit in North America more than doubled in to a record 3.05 billion euros boosted by a more than a threefold increase in the United States, while in South America it rose by 24% to 3.33 billion euros. 
The two regions accounted for around 60% of the group's underlying profit in 2021, while Europe represented 28%. 
""In the first quarter of 2022, the commercial activity has remained strong with revenues in line with the last quarter and new lending returning to prepandemic levels, increasing by an estimated 8% year on year,"" Santander Chairman Ana Botin said in a statement ahead of the bank's general shareholders meeting.
Shares in Santander were up 2% to 3.16 euros at 0717 GMT, outpacing Spain's leading blue-chip index Ibex-35 which was up 0.4%.
Santander helped by lower loan loss provisions booked a net profit of 2.28 billion in the October to December quarter, up 4.6% from the third quarter. 
It reported a net profit of 8.12 billion euros in 2021 after losing 8.77 billion euros in 2020.
Santander does not have a presence in Russia or Ukraine, limiting its direct exposure to 80 million euros, though the conflict could have an indirect impact, especially through high energy prices for some of its customers.
Santander said that Botin would reassure shareholders that in the medium term, the bank aimed to achieve an underlying return on tangible equity and cost-to-income ratio of around 15% and 40%, respectively, and maintain a capital ratio of 12%.
The bank's shareholders on Friday are expected to approve a final cash dividend of 5.15 euro cents per share, on top of an already paid 4.85 euro cents per share.

With a shares buyback of 841 million euros and an additional buyback of 865 million euros being implemented, the capital distributed against 2021 results would be 3.4 billion euros.
Shareholders will also be asked to approve a reduction of the group's outstanding share capital of up to 10% by cancelling shares it may acquire, including under potential repurchase programmes in the future.

Investing.com – Sodexo (PA:EXHO) stock plummeted 9% in Paris trading Friday after the company said revenue growth in the ongoing year will be around the bottom of its previously forecast range of 15-18%.
The company blamed the coronavirus pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and closure of COVID-19 testing centers in the U.K. for its moderation.
Chief Executive Sophie Bellon said, “several mobilizations in Russia will not happen” due to the war. The conflict has also sent food prices soaring, creating another challenge for Sodexo.
""Inflation is a subject on which we work a lot. We are very, very vigilant because the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine is causing certain volatility in certain commodities, so it's something we are watching like a hawk,"" Reuters quoted Group Chief Financial Officer Marc Rolland as saying.

“We are confident that we can manage the year end inflationary pressure on margins. Currencies should give us a nice tailwind...” Rolland said in a statement.
For the first half ended February 28, the group clocked revenue of 10.26 billion euros ($11.35 billion), more than 19% higher. Underlying operating profit was 538 million euros.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects took major steps toward launching this week as Russia's threats to cut energy supplies to Europe drives up demand and prices for the super-chilled fuel. 
Developers  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) and New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) Inc advanced agreements on separate projects, one of which could be producing LNG within 12 months. These plants typically requires long-term contracts for about 85% of output to kick off, and take years to complete.
But growing demand among customers, especially in Europe, was behind New Fortress Energy's decision to invest its own money to build a 2.8 million tonne per annum (MTPA) plant off the coast of Louisiana.
“There was already a significant supply demand imbalance for natural gas in the world,"" said Wes Edens, chief executive of New Fortress Energy. ""With the urgency for Europe to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, it is vitally important to fast track LNG production in the United States.” 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding foreign buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles from Friday or else have their supplies cut, a move European capitals rejected and which Germany said amounted to ""blackmail"".
Last week, the Biden administration said the U.S. will aim to supply European buyers this year with an additional 15 billion cubic meters (bcm) of LNG, and 50 bcm by 2030 to replace Russian gas imports as the West seeks to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
RISKS DIMINISHING
Last year, about a dozen LNG developers said they aimed to reach final investment decisions on their projects. But only Sempra's Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal in Baja California, Mexico, started construction in the last two years. 
Sempra on Thursday reached a preliminary agreement to supply France's TotalEnergies with gas from a second, Mexican project, Vista Pacifico LNG. TotalEnergies would acquire a 16.6% stake and take about one-third of the 4 MTPA plant's export production, under the deal.

LNG price forecasts are strong enough that the risks are worth taking if a plant can begin operation in the next couple of years, said Alex Munton, an LNG analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. 
""We continue to see a tremendous amount of interest in our LNG development projects,"" said Paty Ortega Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sempra.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Traders are pointing to a massive quarterly options trade on Thursday they said was from a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fund as one reason why the stock market took a nosedive late in the day, as options flows linked to the trade exacerbated market weakness.
The S&P 500 Index fell 1.2% in the last hour of trading on Thursday, marking the largest hourly drop for the index in more than three weeks. It finished the day down 1.56%, with some attributing part of the weakness to the large options trade that went down earlier in the day.
""I think that trade exacerbated volatility,"" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, noting that this was out of the ordinary since the quarterly hedging activity typically does not move markets much.
The way the trade is structured means when the market starts to fall, options dealers - typically big financial institutions who facilitate trading but seek to remain market neutral - would have been forced to sell an increasing number of stock futures, thereby aggravating the selloff, SpotGamma's Kochuba said.
Markets have had a rollercoaster quarter due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, volatile commodities prices and the U.S. Federal Reserve starting to hike interest rates. It was unclear what caused the initial late-afternoon market weakness on Thursday that triggered the cascade of stock futures selling.
The trade, which took place shortly before 11:00 am, was a large collar options trade, involving the sale of about 44,000 June calls and the purchase of an identical number of June put spreads, that would pay up if the S&P 500 were to decline more than 5% from its current level. A collar is an options hedging strategy involving a combination of puts and calls.
The trade also involved the sale of about 24,800 calls linked to the 4,300 level on the S&P 500, set to expire at the end of Thursday's session, as a way to guard against any sharp moves in the market during the trading session.
Traders pointed to the $19 billion JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund as being behind the moves. The fund, which holds a basket of S&P 500 stocks along with options on the benchmark index and resets hedges once a quarter. As the fund is so large, traders know and anticipate its patterns.
Kochuba said that based on past trading patterns and details of investment strategies laid out in the fund's prospectus, the trade was initiated by the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Equity Armor Investments, also said the trades had the hallmark of the JPMorgan fund's hedging program. 
Asked about the trades, Kristen Chambers, a spokesperson for JP Morgan Asset Management, confirmed that the fund has a scheduled quarterly hedging program but did not confirm the exact details of the trade.
Systematic traders, often hedge funds, take a rules-based approach in their investments and are often driven by fixed quarterly schedules rather than strong investment themes.
As such, other investors don't try to glean signals from their choices of options strike prices and expiration dates, as they would with a trade by a discretionary investor.

""This is a systematic trade that we see at the end of every quarter,"" Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, said.
Thursday's trade, worth about $20 billion in notional terms - based on the index level - replaces a similar position opened at the end of last quarter, according to Trade Alert data.

The transaction, which was announced in November, allows the Italian bank to complete its exit from Turkey's third-biggest lender, UniCredit said without disclosing financial terms of the deal.
The closing of the transaction is expected to improve UniCredit's CET1 capital ratio by mid to high single-digit percentage points in the second quarter of 2022, the bank said.
UniCredit had said in November that it expected its best-quality capital to gain a low to mid single-digit uplift, adding that it would receive 300 million euros ($332 million) from the sale.
Koc Holding and UniCredit agreed in 2019 to unwind the joint venture through which they jointly controlled Yapi with a near 82% overall stake. 

The move handed UniCredit a direct 31.9% stake, of which 12% was sold in February 2020.

Investing.com – Stocks of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) traded 1% and 0.6% higher, respectively, in Friday’s premarket, shrugging off decisions by the companies to halt production at their Michigan factories.
Ford will suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage.
GM is canceling production at its Lansing Grand River Assembly. The company said the production halt is not related to chips. It provided no other specifics. The plant makes Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5, and Chevrolet Camaro, GM said.
Chips shortage had forced Ford to halt output at its Kansas City Assembly Plant last month, forcing the company to warn vehicle volumes in the current quarter will decline.
According to a previous GM communication, Monday onward, the company will halt production for two weeks at its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana due to a shortage of semiconductor chips. The unit makes the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickup trucks, according to Reuters.
Shortage of parts, particularly semiconductor chips, has been the bane of most automakers for more than a year as capacities have competed to meet demand from end-users like makers of mobiles, laptops, cars, cameras, washing machines, among other gadgets.
The pandemic-induced lockdowns have played havoc with production schedules at factories in Asia, mostly China, Vietnam, and South East Asia. Shortage of labor and congested ports have all added to delays in deliveries."

Responses to the survey, conducted with 167 companies operating throughout China including 76 in manufacturing, found 82% of manufacturers reported slowed or reduced production due to a lack of employees, inability to obtain supplies, or government-ordered lockdowns.
More than half, or 54%, have cut 2022 revenue projections following the outbreak, though 38% said it was too early to estimate the impact. 
Some manufacturers in Shanghai, particularly in the automotive industry, have resorted to operating with a ""closed-loop"", wherein employees remain confined to the premises in order to keep production lines running, while outside suppliers are sealed off. [L2N2VW0U0[
Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that the such arrangements are acceptable for a few days but ""not sustainable"" long term.
""Even if your employees are within the factory bubble, your trucks have to come and go sending inputs and outputs, but that's not possible,"" said Zheng.
""I hope this is only a temporary, drastic measure to stop the spread.""
Shanghai has been battling its largest outbreak for nearly a month and this week most of the city of 26 million people was put under lockdown as cases continued to surge. 
Authorities have implemented the lockdown in two phases, first targeting the eastern part of the city, followed by the west.
AmCham said that only half of the respondents were satisfied with China's pandemic efforts, and 77% had expressed dissatisfaction with the length of quarantines. 

A growing number of local companies have also disclosed how the Shanghai lockdown is weighing on them, ranging from suspended operations and stagnant sales, to drying liquidity and delayed financial disclosures. Shanghai-based power transmission equipment maker Sieyuan Electric Co said the pandemic has disrupted operations, logistics and raw material supplies, impacting its first quarter and full-year performance. 
East Money Information Co said it was highly uncertain if its annual shareholder meeting can be held at its Shanghai headquarters on April 8, and is suggesting shareholders participate online. Shanghai Shizhong Intelligent Parking Corp said the lockdown has forced it to halt parking services, directly hitting performance.

European equities are trying to rebound Friday after the region’s stock markets suffered their biggest quarterly loss since the start of 2020, with the Russian-Ukrainian war and the associated surge in commodity prices raising concerns of a recession.
Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday, but previous talks have achieved very little and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Thursday of ""battles ahead"" in Donbas and the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow would continue supplying gas to Europe, easing fears that he would order a halt of supplies unless Western governments paid in rubles, something they have refused to do.
Russia supplies about a third of Europe's gas, so the removal of this would likely result in a full-blown energy crisis.

""We will hopefully be able to communicate our intention to enter into Formula One then,"" one of the sources said, with the second adding there was a ""good chance"" of a positive decision.
Volkswagen declined to comment. The news was first reported by Business Insider.
There has long been talk of Audi and Porsche forming partnerships with existing Formula One teams, their most likely method of entry into the highest class of international racing.
Audi and McLaren denied reports last year that a partnership between the two brands had already been formed.
Audi will offer around 500 million euros ($556.30 million) for McLaren, one source said, while Porsche intends to establish a long-term partnership with racing team Red Bull starting in several years' time.
Volkswagen has not previously been involved in Formula One but has worked with Red Bull, notably in the world rally championship.
McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown told Reuters the Formula One team was ""definitely not for sale"" and not looking for further equity partners.
McLaren use Mercedes engines but that could change when the sport introduces a new power unit in 2026. 
Brown said there had been some ""very preliminary"" conversations with VW in the past but nothing agreed.
""If they decide (to come in) then there's a conversation to be had but at this point we don't want to have any conversations until we know someone is committed to the sport,"" he added. 
A source told Reuters in November that Volkswagen's ultimate decision will rest on whether Formula One follows through on its plans to switch to synthetic fuels by 2026 and on McLaren's progress regarding electrification of its vehicles.
Volkswagen has invested the most of any global carmaker by far in electric vehicle production and batteries in an attempt to clean up its image from the Dieselgate emissions scandal and remain in line with governmental carbon reduction targets.
The decision comes as Volkswagen grapples with uncertainty over the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on its finances, which will also be discussed at next Thursday's meeting. 

Russia calls its actions a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it says are dangerous nationalists.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers at a warehouse in New York City's Staten Island have so far voted 57% in favor of unionizing with a final tally due on Friday, a potential landmark victory for organized labor at the second-largest U.S. private employer.
But that win contrasted with 53% of Amazon workers in Alabama rejecting unionization, in a still-not final outcome. 
The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result, said the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which is overseeing the election. The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionizing.
If final results show either location voted for a union, it would be a historic first for the retailing giant in the United States and a milestone for labor advocates, who for years have considered Amazon's labor practices a threat to workers.
In fierce campaigns, Amazon has warned about unions in notices in bathroom stalls and held mandatory meetings telling workers that labor groups could force them to strike. It has raised pay and offered bigger signing bonuses in a labor shortage, appealing to staff who have worried organizing means perpetual strife.
At the same time, union drives have picked up momentum. Nine U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores have voted to organize, with more than 150 more seeking elections. Amazon workers responded to more in-person outreach by labor activists as the pandemic subsided, and a second company warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote on whether to unionize starting on April 25.
With nearly 2,700 ballots counted from workers at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, about 57% of votes were in favor of a union, according to a Reuters tally of the count overseen by the NLRB and streamed over Zoom. The count will resume on Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT).
Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee spearheading the New York union effort, said, ""To get to this point, it's already history."" His group is called the Amazon Labor Union.
A union win in New York ""would be a triumph for unconventional organizing campaigns,"" said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. Smalls' group made great use of social media during the campaign and diverged from a typical labor playbook, he said.
'CONTINUE TO FIGHT' 
For Bessemer, Alabama, the tally of roughly 1,900 valid ballots concluded on Thursday, but the outcome is far from certain. The NLRB said it will hold a hearing in the next few weeks to determine if any of the 416 challenged ballots should be opened and counted.
Eli Morrison, a 42-year-old Amazon worker who lives in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said he voted against unionizing and was pleased to see the union trailing. He said he appreciates the flexibility Amazon gives him to pick up extra shifts, a benefit he fears he would lose if workers unionized.
""I come in, I bust ass every day, I get stuff done,"" said Morrison, who previously held a union job at a grocery store. ""I wouldn’t get to do that if there was a union. It would be whoever’s been there the longest and whoever’s been there longest doesn’t mean that they’ve done the best.""
Jennifer Bates, an early backer of the Alabama union campaign, said, ""The election is not over until every ballot is counted that’s eligible, and we'll continue to fight.""
The labor group organizing the effort plans to file objections to Amazon's conduct around the election as well, said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).
Objections previously filed by the RWDSU led to a determination by the NLRB that Amazon had improperly interfered in the original contest in Bessemer, prompting the board to set aside the results and call for this year's re-run.
Amazon did not immediately comment on the RWDSU's plans to object or on the vote counts Thursday. The company has said it wants its employees' voices to be heard and that it is focused on continuing to make Amazon a great place to work.

Regarding communications with Amazon staff during the contests, the company has said it was important for workers to know what a union would mean for their day-to-day employment.
A simple majority of votes cast is needed to win. Neither the New York union nor labor board has said how many ballots were received in Staten Island.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's COVID-19 curbs are disrupting the supply of fertiliser to the country's northeastern bread basket just a month away from spring planting, threatening this year's corn and soybean crops if not resolved soon.
Farmers typically have fertiliser prepared in early April before applying to fields later in the month during planting. But China's worst outbreak of COVID since the pandemic began two years ago have triggered strict controls on movement of people and goods, sharply slowing deliveries.
Fertiliser producers, dealers, analysts and associations said rules requiring truck drivers to take COVID tests every 24 hours, a need to obtain special passes to deliver goods and factory suspensions due to local COVID cases are all contributing to tight supplies. 
""Production of nitrogen fertiliser and fertiliser preparation for spring planting has been greatly affected,"" the China Nitrogen Fertilizer Industry Association said this week.
Jilin, China's second-largest corn-growing province, is among the hardest hit after the local government banned movement of people across the provincial border, and within, from Mar. 14 as COVID cases hit thousands daily.
""Fertiliser supply here couldn't be tighter,"" said a Jilin-based dealer surnamed Yan, who is short more than 2,000 tonnes of the critical crop nutrient for his customers.
The bottleneck comes on top of record fertiliser prices, driven up by strong global demand, high energy costs and sanctions on major producers Russia and Belarus.
Despite efforts by Beijing to cool prices, China's wholesale fertiliser index (CFCI) is 40% higher than a year ago.
That had discouraged many dealers from building stocks in recent months, catching them short in their busiest sales period.
Yao, a dealer in Liaoning, said he's short about a third of his needs.
The transport curbs are especially problematic for the northeast, which does not have enough local fertiliser production and relies on deliveries from other provinces.
The northeast's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces and Inner Mongolia region produce more than 40% of China's corn and half its soybeans. 
Prices of cornand soybeans are hovering at record highs. 
Top fertiliser producer Sinofert Holdings still had about 80,000-100,000 tonnes of product waiting to be shipped, executive director Ma Yue told reporters on an earnings call last week, even after getting about 1,000 ""green passes"" for trucks.
The special passes to deliver critical goods take time to process and must be renewed daily. It has also become increasingly difficult to find drivers willing to work under the restrictions, dealers said. 

The challenges come even as Beijing repeatedly calls for all-out efforts to guarantee successful harvests amid global food security concerns.
Fertiliser had reached 68.8% of Jilin's farming households by Wednesday, despite the challenges, government paper the Jilin Daily reported, adding that the supply of farm materials was ""orderly and stable"".

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a cautious manner Friday, with investors monitoring fresh negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, the spat between Moscow and European nations over the payment of Russian gas, and key Eurozone inflation data. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.
The new month has started with European stock markets on the back foot after they suffered their biggest quarterly loss since the start of 2020, as the Russian-Ukrainian war and the associated surge in commodity prices prompted concerns of a new recession in the region.
Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday, but previous talks have achieved very little and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Thursday of ""battles ahead"" in Donbas and the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday that foreign buyers of Russian gas must pay in rubles or contracts would be halted, trying to hit back against sweeping Western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine.
Western governments have rejected the move, stating the existing contracts are set in euros or dollars but Russia supplies about a third of Europe's gas, so the removal of this would likely result in a full-blown energy crisis. 
The European economic data slate includes manufacturing PMI numbers for Germany, the region’s manufacturing hub, following on from the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index in China falling to 48.1, the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020.
Most eyes, however, will be on the Eurozone consumer price release for March, which is expected to show another sharp rise to 6.6% on the year, and then the U.S. March jobs data later in the session.
Oil prices weakened Friday, heading for the biggest weekly loss in two years after the Biden administration ordered a massive release of crude from strategic reserves to combat soaring rampant prices.
The U.S. plans to release one million barrels a day for six months, starting in May, which would be the largest release ever from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
International Energy Agency member countries are set to meet later Friday to discuss joining in, following on from the 60 million barrels they delivered at the start of March.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $99.01 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.1% to $103.56. The two benchmarks were each headed for a weekly loss of around 13%.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,937.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1059."

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia deal volume tumbled in the first quarter and dealmakers do not expect a near-term rebound as the Russia-Ukraine war, higher interest rates and economic uncertainty hurt business sentiment.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and equity capital market activity declined sharply in the region over January-March, according to Refinitiv data, with Chinese stocks among the biggest losers in Asia.
M&A involving companies in Asia Pacific and Japan fell to $233 billion in the quarter, down 25% from a year earlier and nearly halving from the final quarter of 2021, the data shows.
This follows record high global M&A deals in 2021 amid easy availability of cheap financing and sky-high valuations as U.S. stocks saw their best three-year run in more than two decades. 
""Deal flow in M&A is fundamentally driven by the confidence boards have around the outlook for businesses and the macro developments in the world,"" said Rohit Chatterji, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s co-head of M&A, Asia-Pacific.
The Russia-Ukraine crisis, soaring commodity prices, inflation as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty over the rate hike path adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve are stalling deals, analysts and bankers said.
""The buyers are saying 'let's revisit whether the pricing we had in mind is still valid in markets like these' and the sellers are like 'do we really want to sell unless we get the prices we want,'"" said Chatterji.
Australia's Macquarie Asset Management and British Columbia Investment Management Corp's deal to buy a 60% stake in  National Grid  (LON:NG)'s British gas transmission and metering business for an enterprise value of about $12.7 billion was the biggest transaction involving Asia Pacific firms this year.
And Sweden-based buyout fund EQT (NYSE:EQT)'s move to snap up Baring Private Equity Asia in a deal worth $7.5 billion was the second-biggest deal, the data showed.
""The longer deals stay dislocated, the more financial sponsors may get the opportunity to come into deals,"" Chatterji said.
Dealmakers said stability in equity markets would be a prerequisite for a revival in deals but they expect little improvement in the short term.
HONG KONG IPOS NOSEDIVE
Equity capital market activity in Asia, including Japan, fell 54% to $56.5 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, and slumped 64% from the final quarter of 2021, Refinitiv data showed.
Initial public offering activity fell 35% on the year, with Hong Kong suffering the biggest drop - from a value of $11.05 billion in the first quarter of 2021 to just $837 million.
The city slid from being the world's No.2 IPO market behind the Nasdaq to eighth this quarter from a year earlier.
South Korea's $11 billion listing of battery maker LG Energy Solution in January made Seoul the world's top listing venue in the first quarter.
Some bankers said China could see an improvement.
""A lot of the world economies still depend on China. If it is in a relatively non-tightening mode versus the U.S., which is in a 5 to 7 times rate hike cycle, this is where we think it could be beneficial for China,"" said Selina Cheung, UBS's co-head of equity capital markets for Asia.

""I would think that if relative monetary easing impacts how corporate earnings do in the first half, we should see good data start to come out in August. If and when that happens, I think there's a shot at the market reopening and investors having renewed confidence,"" she said.
Investors are also watching the effect of rising COVID cases in China as Shanghai, its most populous city and home to some 26 million people, entered the third day of a lockdown on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Investors sent Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shares sharply higher on Friday as they bet the Japanese conglomerate could become the target of a bidding war after Bain Capital sounded out shareholders about a possible buyout.
The stock jumped 6.7% in morning Tokyo trade on expectations that global private equity firms could be lining up to take the embattled company private.
Its top shareholder, Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, said in a filing on Thursday that it had agreed to sell its 9.9% stake to Bain if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer.
Bain has sounded out multiple other Toshiba shareholders about teaming up as it prepares to make a buyout offer, sources told Reuters. Effissimo is the only shareholder to publicly pledge to tender its stocks to Bain.
Other global private equity firms are also interested in taking Toshiba private, different sources said. The agreement between Bain and Effissimo would not deter them from making buyout offers, they said.
The drama over the fate of 146-year-old Toshiba follows its November announcement that it planned to split into three companies in an attempt to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of financial and governance scandals. 
During a five-month review leading to that plan, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers. It cited various reasons including possible conflicts with Japan's national security law and potential opposition from antitrust regulators. 
One global private equity firm sounded out Toshiba management about a potential buyout in January, saying that it could make a proposal if the company is interested, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks were private.
Japanese industry minister Koichi Hagiuda said on Friday Toshiba owns national security technologies such as nuclear power and semiconductors and that it is important to ensure such businesses are kept and grow.
""We'll closely monitor the situation from this perspective,"" Hagiuda told a regular news conference.

Toshiba said in a statement on Friday that it had not engaged in any discussions with Bain or Effissimo on their agreement.
Bain said late on Thursday that nothing had been decided about a tender offer and that there were many issues that needed to be resolved to launch a bid to take Toshiba private.

That part of the yield curve inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019. It inverted again late in U.S. trade on Thursday. 
An inversion of the two-year, 10-year part of the curve is viewed by many as a signal a recession is likely to follow in one to two years.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks mixed on Friday morning, attempting to turn a new leaf after their worst quarter since the COVID-19 bear market. Investors continue to weigh the risks from tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy and the war in Ukraine.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.34% by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.41%. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for March was 48.1, with National Bureau of Statistics data from the day before showing that the manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.76%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.43%, with data showing the Tankan Large Manufacturers Index at 14, and the Tankan Large Non-Manufacturers Index at 9, for the first quarter of 2022.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.55%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.16%, with March’s Australian Industry Group manufacturing index at 55.7 and the manufacturing PMI at 57.7.
China’s worst COVID-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic prompted the city of Shanghai to extend a lockdown and a retreat in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks is also dampening sentiment.
The U.S.' plan to release around a million barrels a day from the strategic petroleum reserve is also keeping oil prices down. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has disrupted commodity supplies, ramping up prices for fuel and food. Russia will aim to keep supplying gas to European customers even as it demands they shift to payment in Russian rubles.
Ukraine and Russia will resume peace talks on Friday. The Russian government is also staying on top of its debt obligations so far, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. processing a nearly $447 million payment for dollar debt due in 2030 on Thursday. The next payment deadline is April 4.
U.S. Treasuries fell, with the curve between two-year and 10-year yields remaining close to inverting. Combined with the Fed’s hawkish approach, concerns about an economic downturn are increasing.
Investors are still weighing the impact of the war in Ukraine, Russia's isolation, and the Fed’s tighter monetary policy on market volatility and further losses for stocks and bonds within the year. Raw materials are the only key asset class that has recorded major gains in 2022 to date.
Downgraded growth outlooks in the U.S., Europe, and China are “something to watch very carefully,” Columbia Threadneedle Investments head of multi-asset strategy Anwiti Bahuguna told Bloomberg. “There are very few places to hide these days in the multi-asset space,” though commodities are a good spot because of inflation and geopolitics, she added.
Thursday’s U.S. data also showed that February’s personal consumption expenditures price index grew 6.4% year-on-year, the most since 1982, and grew 0.6% month-on-month. The latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day."

420,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 09:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Trading in at least 33 Hong Kong-listed stocks was halted on Friday after a number of firms missed a deadline to report annual results, adding uncertainty to a market grappling with a bleak economic outlook and regulatory headwinds.
Embattled Chinese developers, including Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd., were among the stocks to be suspended from Friday. China Aoyuan Group Ltd. said publishing unaudited results at this stage could “potentially be misleading to the shareholders and potential investors.” This year’s number compares with more than 50 for 2021 and at least nine for 2020.
The barrage of trading halts comes at a bad time for the city’s equity market. China’s repeated vows to stabilize markets have failed to restore investors’ confidence, keeping the Hang Seng Index down 6% this year. Regulatory risks still hang heavy and lockdowns in China are weighing on the earnings outlook. 
This earnings season had been expected to be the worst in a decade for Chinese developers beset by a credit crunch, and failure for the firms to come clean on time - as well as a slew of auditor resignations - will only worsen sentiment. Uncertainties over financial transparency may also bring further credit rating downgrades. 
“It is an open secret that auditors adopt very strict requirements for Chinese developers’ audit work this year due to the sector’s liquidity issues and default problems,” said Raymond Cheng, head of China/Hong Kong research at CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd. Still, the earnings delays “could hurt improving market sentiment from supportive policy.” 
Trading suspensions in Hong Kong can take place due to various reasons. In terms of earnings, a company’s shares will be halted if it doesn’t release audited results three months after the fiscal year ends, according to exchange rules. However, due to Covid-related delays, firms have been allowed to submit unaudited figures by March 31 and file the audited version by April 30 to avoid suspension. 
At least 138 firms had previously said they would postpone the release of their audited 2021 results past the March 31 deadline. The exchange had 2,570 listed companies as of end-March.  
Credit Downgrades 
Audit problems were a “key driver” for recent downgrades of Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Ronshine China Holdings Ltd., Fitch Ratings Inc. said this week.   
Potential credit rating cuts following the earnings delays are likely to trigger requests for early debt payments, and “add to their default risks,” said Dean Xiao, flow credit high yield desk analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd.
A prolonged trading halt increases the risk of wild stock moves upon resumption. Among last year’s cases, China Huarong Asset Management Co., which was halted for nine months, sank 50% when trading resumed. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. surged 82% after a seven-month halt.  
Companies could also be booted from MSCI Inc.’s stock indexes within three trading days if their suspensions last for more than 50 consecutive days, according to the index compiler. Such a decision could impact hundreds of billion dollars of passive funds that track related MSCI benchmarks. Huarong was removed from the gauges in June last year.

421,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 09:10PM ET</span>",,,"(Reuters) - Online gaming platform Roblox Corp said on Thursday Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store offers privacy and safety benefits to its users, supporting the iPhone-maker's bid to beat an appeal by Epic Games in a key U.S. antitrust case. 
Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's fees and payment rules for app makers were anti-competitive. It appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
""Apple's process for review and approval of apps available on the App Store enhances safety and security, and provides those apps greater legitimacy in the eyes of users,"" Roblox said in a legal filing on Thursday. 
Roblox had played a prominent role in the original trial last year. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing key revelations from the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games, in which the ""Fortnite"" maker had argued that Apple had given a free pass to Roblox, whose app lets people pick from a selection of games to play.
An Apple senior director described Roblox's offering as ""experiences"". Soon after, Roblox changed descriptions on its website to ""experiences"" from ""games"" and called itself a metaverse company. 

Apple has said its rules promote several benefits for consumers, including increased security and privacy. Two former Central Intelligence Agency directors and 21 other former U.S. national security officials advanced that argument in Apple's support on Thursday. 
The appeal hearing is expected next year.

(Reuters) -Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Thursday signed into law a minimum pay standard for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers, making Washington the first U.S. state to implement earnings standards for ride-hail companies.
Drivers across the Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) state will earn a minimum of $1.17 per mile and 34 cents per minute with a minimum pay of $3.00 per trip.
Under the new law, drivers will also have access to paid sick time, family medical leave and long-term care programs, and be eligible for workers' compensation, a U.S. government-mandated program that provides benefits to workers who become injured or ill on the job. Drivers will also be able to appeal should they be removed from the apps. 
In Seattle, which passed its own ride-hail pay standard in September 2020, drivers will continue to earn minimum rates of $1.38 per mile and 59 cents per minute at a minimum of $5.17 per trip. 
The law, which has been supported by Uber and Lyft, takes away local regulatory power, banning cities and counties from implementing additional requirements for companies. 
The law also states that ride-hail drivers are not employees, a contentious issue between some labor groups and gig economy companies including Uber and Lyft. The gig companies, whose workers operate as independent contractors, oppose any reclassification while some labor groups argue drivers should be employees with access to greater benefits.
""This new law decisively gives drivers what they want - to stay independent while gaining historic new benefits and protections,"" Uber's head of public policy in the Western U.S., Ramona Prieto, said in a statement. She said Uber hoped the law could be replicated in other cities, states and countries.
""Drivers achieved this win because labor organizations, legislators, and app-based companies listened to them, and then worked together to drive a historic bill that works for them,"" Lyft's head of government relations, Jen Hensley, said in a statement.

The new Washington law was supported by the Teamsters union Local 117, which was also behind the push for the Seattle pay standard.
Before this law, in the United States only Seattle and New York City had implemented minimum pay standards for ride-hail drivers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stocks dropped on Thursday with U.S. shares sinking over 1.5%, as concerns about a recession and the Russian-Ukranian war spurred selling, while oil prices plunged over $6 as Washington launched a record release from its emergency oil reserves.
The declines pushed U.S. and European stocks into their biggest quarterly loss since the start of 2020, when the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic sent the global economy into a tailspin.
Quarter-end portfolio rebalancing boosted demand for bonds and held down yields, though a closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve hovered near inversion, after inverting briefly on Tuesday. Many view an inverted yield curve, in which short-term Treasuries yield more than longer-term debt, as a harbinger of a recession. [US/]
""An inverted Treasury yield curve is one signal that future U.S. equity returns will be disappointing,"" said Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research.
""Can we escape the fate of low or negative returns in 2022 if 10-year Treasury yields drop below two-years? Possibly, but not if geopolitical risks and their effect on oil prices continue or grow.""
A spurt of selling late in the day drove the S&P 500 down 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also skidded 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Europe's STOXX 600 had closed down 0.94%.
Thursday's stock market gloom was emblematic of how tough March has been for equities. Even after a rally in the past week when investors celebrated signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, the S&P 500 is still down 5% in the first three months, its worst quarterly performance in 2 years.
Europe's STOXX 600 fared worse, losing 6.5% in the first quarter, also its biggest quarterly drop since the start of 2020.
The MSCI World Equity index, which dropped 1.3% on Thursday, also had its worst quarter in two years, tumbling 5.7%.
""Risk assets remain vulnerable,"" analysts at Australia's ANZ Bank said. ""As the U.S. earnings season gets under way from around 11 April, many analysts are expecting a wave of earnings downgrades.""
GROWTH CONCERNS 
After a relief rally earlier in the week, optimism about a settlement between Russia and Ukraine has petered out as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said no quick resolution is expected and the country is preparing for new Russian attacks.
In Europe, inflation data showed record-high price rises in France in March and a 7% year-on-year rise in Italy, following elevated readings from Germany and Spain a day earlier.
Surging price pressures in many major economies have sealed expectations that central banks will raise interest rates. Investors worry that aggressive tightening in the United States and other countries will bring on recessions.
While European government bond yields were down on the day, the German 10-year yield was set for its biggest monthly rise since 2009.
In keeping with the recent surge in yields, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen by the most in a year this quarter, despite retreating to 2.343% on Thursday.
Oil prices nursed deep losses following news that the United States is releasing up to 180 million barrels from its strategic petroleum reserve, part of a move to lower fuel prices.
U.S. crude fell 5.4% to $107.29 per barrel and Brent was at $100.74, down 6.6% on the day.
Oil prices had surged since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and the United States and allies responded with hefty sanctions on Russia, the second-largest exporter of crude.
The euro was down 0.82% at $1.1066, having been boosted earlier in the week by hopes for peace in Ukraine.
The dollar was little changed against the yen, at 121.675. The yen has stabilised after Monday when it fell to its lowest since 2015 on news the Bank of Japan will buy an unlimited amount of 10-year government bonds for four days this week to keep yields low. 
Rising U.S. yields have lifted Japanese yields even though inflation in Japan is below the central bank's target. 

Gold rose 0.2% to $1,937.45 an ounce, notching its biggest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2020.
In keeping with softer investor risk appetites, Bitcoin fell 2.8% to $45,771.20.

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) will each halt production next week at a Michigan plant due to parts shortages, the two companies said separately on Thursday.
No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford said it would suspend production at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant next week, where it builds the Mustang, due to the global semiconductor shortage. 
GM said that because of a temporary part shortage it would cancel production next week at Lansing Grand River assembly, where it builds the Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5 and Chevrolet Camaro. GM said the production halt was not related to chips but provided no other specifics.
The auto industry is grappling with a global chip shortage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing companies to cut production, although high car prices have partially offset the financial impact.
Ford warned last month that the chip shortage would lead to a decline in vehicle volumes in the current quarter. Last month, Ford halted production at its Kansas city assembly plant that makes F-150 pickup vehicles for a week due to the chip shortage.

Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said that production at its other North American plants will continue as normal.
GM last week said it would halt production for two weeks at an assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that builds the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickup trucks, beginning April 4, over the semiconductor chip shortage.

The move comes after retail investor interest in so-called 'meme stocks' flared up in the last two weeks, leading to a doubling in GameStop's share price to $166.58. A stock split makes shares more affordable for individual investors by lowering the price, without affecting the company's valuation.
Some investors are betting that the stock split will boost the value of GameStop by attracting more meme-stock enthusiasts. The firm's shares jumped 19% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company announced the move. 
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have recently announced upcoming share splits. 
On Monday, Tesla Inc's market capitalisation jumped by more than $80 billion after the electric car maker said it would seek investor approval to once again increase the number of its shares to enable a future stock split, without saying when that split might occur.
This month's stock market recovery, driven by hopes of a resolution in Russia's conflict with Ukraine, has boosted the investors' risk appetite, making conditions for meme-stock rallies more favorable.
Meme stocks are heavily shorted shares that are snapped up by retail investors on social media platforms such as Reddit with the aim of squeezing out hedge funds betting against them. The trend took Wall Street by storm in January 2021 and slowly fizzled over the course of the year.
GameStop plans to increase its number of outstanding Class A common shares to 1 billion from 300 million, it said in a filing. The company will also ask shareholders to vote on a incentive plan ""to support future compensatory equity issuances"", it added. (https:// The date and location of the company's annual shareholders meeting have not yet been announced. Billionaire Ryan Cohen, who is the chairman of GameStop's board, disclosed earlier this month that his investment company purchased 100,000 shares of the game retailer. The purchase took Cohen's total ownership of GameStop to 11.9%. Cohen's effort to turn GameStop around after he joined the company last year by investing in its stores and e-commerce business and bringing in new talent have yet to produce major results.  
The company earlier this month reported a net loss of $147.5 million for the three months ending January, the first holiday-season loss in its history. The retailer has been trying to win back gamers who now turn to online streaming or other outlets. GameStop's cash balance may erode ""relatively quickly"" unless the company becomes profitable soon, Wedbush analysts warned earlier this month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oreo cookie maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) said its plant in Trostyanets, a town in eastern Ukraine, has suffered ""significant damage"" because of military action due to the war.
The company added that to the best of its knowledge, no employees were injured in the attack. The Oreo plant - one of at least two Mondelez factories in Ukraine, according to Mondelez employees - was closed as soon as the war began, Mondelez said in an emailed statement. Russia invaded Ukraine over a month ago in what it calls a ""special operation"". 
The United States assessed this week that Ukrainian forces have taken back Trostyanets from Russia.
Mondelez, which makes Milka chocolate and other locally-branded biscuits in Europe, said telecommunications outages in the Trostyanets area have made it challenging to reach all of its employees. The company is also working with Ukrainian authorities to resupply water and power to the area and is donating wheat and sugar to local non-governmental organizations.
It is too soon to tell what the next steps will be for the plant, Mondelez said.

Facing pressure to leave Russia in March, the Chicago-based snack manufacturer said it would scale back ""non-essential activities"" there while helping maintain food supply. CEO Dirk Van de Put condemned the aggression and called for an end to the war in a memo on the company's website.
The company has faced criticism for continuing to operate in Russia.

U.S.-listed shares of the Canadian security-software provider and former mobile phone-maker dropped 5% in extended trading.
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has been losing ground to larger competitors like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) for cybersecurity solutions, while sales are further stressed by a slowdown in automotive production due to components shortage. 
Chief Executive Officer John Chen on a conference call said the slowdown in automobile sector, a major customer segment for its Internet of Things (IoT) unit, is expected to persist.
""Although they (automobile makers) expected the situation to largely improve as the year progresses."" 
During the reported quarter, performance in cybersecurity was partially offset by higher sales and margin improvements in the IoT unit, which helped nudge BlackBerry's bottomline into the green territory.
The company's net income for the quarter ended Feb. 28 stood at $144 million. It posted a net loss of $315 million a year ago.

Excluding items, the company earned earned 1 cent per share, compared with analysts' estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share.
Revenue fell to $185 million from $210 million a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting $186.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The high cost of insulin to treat diabetes would be drastically reduced under legislation the U.S. House of Representatives passed on Thursday, in a rare example of drug price reform gaining traction in Congress.
By a vote of 232-193, with few Republicans supporting the measure, the House approved the bill that would cap patients' out-of-pocket costs at $35 a month for their insulin.
Currently, monthly supplies of the life-sustaining medicine average around $375 and can go as high as $1,000, causing some people to skip needed doses.
""No one should have to ration their insulin to help reduce costs and risk their health and in some cases actually cost them their lives,"" said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, who chairs a committee that oversees health policy, during House debate.
The legislation would still have to be considered by the Senate, which is crafting a much broader bill.
The Democratic-led effort, if successful, could have far wider ramifications for lowering prescription drug costs - a goal supported by Americans in the run-up to the Nov. 8 congressional elections, according to public opinion polls.
""It is for us a step in the direction of the secretary (of Health and Human Services) being able to negotiate drug prices beyond insulin,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday.
Three companies,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), have long dominated the U.S. insulin market. The trio own some 90% of the market for insulin, which was invented in the 1920s but continues to rise in cost to consumers.
More than 34 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most have type 2, which typically does not require insulin to control blood sugar but can. Nearly 1.9 million Americans with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day. 

Medicare, the U.S. government health insurance program for those age 65 and older and the disabled, could have saved more than $16.7 billion from 2011 to 2017 on insulin purchases had it been allowed to negotiate discounts with drug companies, according to a congressional report released last December.
Republican Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers dismissed the legislation as a ""government drug-pricing scheme; part of a socialized medicine approach that would lead to fewer cures"" while raising health insurance premiums.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a long-running antitrust lawsuit accusing 10 of the world's largest banks of pursuing two interrelated conspiracies to suppress competition in the now $23.2 trillion market for U.S. Treasury securities.
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said the 18 plaintiffs — including pension and retirement funds, banks and companies that traded in Treasuries — failed to address shortcomings he found one year ago when dismissing an earlier version of their proposed class action.
The defendants include Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), NatWest Group and UBS, as well as trading platform operator Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW).
Traders accused the banks of colluding from 2007 to 2015 to use chat rooms to swap confidential customer orders and coordinate strategies in a so-called ""auction conspiracy.""
They also accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley of having since 2013 exploited their market power by boycotting electronic trading platforms that offered ""anonymous"" trading and better prices.
But in a 74-page decision, Gardephe said newly introduced evidence of chat excerpts, statistical analyses of the banks' trading, and alleged pressure to boycott disfavored platforms was not enough to establish illegal collusion.
Unlike a year ago, the judge said he will not let the plaintiffs amend their complaint again.
""There is no reason to believe that further amendment would be productive,"" Gardephe wrote.
Dan Brockett, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email: ""We are reviewing the opinion and will look at and consider all options on behalf of the class.""
The litigation began in July 2015, following news reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing whether banks had manipulated Treasury markets.

Earlier probes into manipulation of foreign currencies and the now-abandoned Libor interest rate benchmark resulted in billions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties for banks worldwide.
The case is In re: Treasuries Securities Auction Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-md-02673.

The department, however, did not drop charges against five other defendants. Judge Philip Brimmer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado ordered Jonathan Kanter, the head of the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division, to appear before him and explain why the case should be retried.
The government dropped charges against Timothy Mulrenin, who worked at Tyson foods at the time; William Kantola, who was in sales at Koch Foods Inc, Jimmie Little, a former salesman at Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), Gary Brian Roberts, who was at Tyson as a sales executive at the time, and Rickie Blake, who was at George's Inc.
This was done ""in an effort to streamline the case and conserve the resources of the court, the parties, and the public,"" the department said in a court filing. 
The remaining five defendants are two former Pilgrim's Pride chief executives and one salesman, as well as two Claxton Poultry Farms executives.
The court documents allege industry executives conspired to fix chicken prices from 2012 through 2019.

Tyson in 2020 said it was cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation under a corporate leniency program that could protect the company from criminal prosecution. 
Also in 2020, U.S. poultry company Pilgrim's Pride Corp agreed to pay a $110.5 million fine after striking a plea deal with the Justice Department over price-fixing charges on chicken products. Pilgrim's Pride is mostly owned by Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY)..

The rouble ended 1.6% stronger against the dollar at 83.20, its strongest close since Feb. 25, and gained 1.8% to close at 92.50 versus the euro.
The currency lost nearly 40% of its value from the 2021 close as global curbs and sanctions kicked in in retaliation of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine late last month.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed down on Thursday, with investors digesting a sharp drop in oil prices and studying the release of key inflation and employment data on the last trading day of the month and quarter.
At 4:40 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 550 points, or 1.6%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.5%.
The main Wall Street indices weakened Wednesday, weighed by dashed hopes of a major breakthrough in Ukraine/Russia peace talks, with both the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad-based S&P 500 ending four-day winning streaks.
March has been a positive month for the major averages, however, as far as the year to date is concerned, the Dow and S&P 500 are both down and had their worst quarter in two years.
Oil prices slumped Thursday following reports that the U.S. will conduct a massive release of crude from emergency reserves in order to tackle the sharp rise in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Biden administration announced the total release from the country’s strategic petroleum reserve of as much as 180 million barrels over the course of several months.
This news has overshadowed a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which stuck to an existing deal of increasing oil production by around 400,000 barrels per day through May.
By 4:42 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.5% lower at $100 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 5.6% to $105. 
Thursday also saw the release of weekly jobless claims following on from Wednesday’s strong private jobs data, and ahead of Friday’s official report on employment for March. Last week, 202,000 people filed initial claims, slightly higher than the 197,000 expected.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,936/oz.

Investing.com – Stocks continued their slide on Thursday even as oil prices dropped after President Joe Biden announced the release of 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Biden is battling prices of gasoline at the pump, knowing American voters are feeing the pinch of rising prices for fuel and household goods. 
On Friday, the government releases the much-anticipated jobs report for March, which should show signs of an improvement in the labor market even as core inflation released on Thursday showed prices rose across the economy.
Even with lower oil prices, there’s no guarantee gasoline prices will come down at the pump in any meaningful way. OPEC and its allies have decided to stick with their gradual production goals at least through May.
Still, investors may be happy to put the first quarter in the rear view mirror. Stocks notched the worst quarter since 2020, as tech and other big companies dropped on rising inflation. Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine added a dose of uncertainty.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobs, jobs jobs
It is the start of April tomorrow, and nonfarm payrolls for March are to be released at 8:30 AM EST. Analysts are expecting a figure of 490,000,  below the previous 654,000, but revisions will also be in focus.
2. Unemployment rate
Alongside NFP is the U.S. unemployment rate for March, which is forecast to come in at 3.7%, slightly below the 3.8% reported in February, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. Producer index

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped to close out the first quarter on Thursday with its biggest quarterly decline in two years as concerns persisted about the continuing conflict in Ukraine and its inflationary effect on prices and the Federal Reserve's response. 
While optimism about a possible peace deal between Ukraine and Russia helped lift stocks earlier in the week, hopes quickly evaporated and Russia's President Vladimir Putin threatened on Thursday to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in rubles as Ukraine prepared for more attacks.
The United States imposed new Russia-related sanctions, and U.S. President Joe Biden launched the largest release ever from the country's emergency oil reserve and challenged oil companies to drill more in a bid to lower gasoline prices that have soared during the war in Ukraine.
Stock prices have been sensitive to any signs of progress toward a peace pact between Russia and Ukraine. Already-high U.S. inflation has intensified with surging commodity prices such as oil and metals since the war began.
As prices increase, the Fed becomes increasingly likely to become more aggressive in raising interest rates to combat inflation, potentially curbing economic growth. 
Data on Thursday showed consumer prices barely rose in February as pricing pressures intensified, while personal consumption expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rose by 0.4%, in line with expectations.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Thursday, wrapping up its worst quarter in two years as investors digested further data pointing to red-hot inflation and President Biden's plan to release a record amount of emergency oil supplies to curb rising energy prices.
The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.6%, or 550 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.5%. The three major averages were down about 5.2%, 4.8%, and 10%, respectively, for the quarter.
Biden said the U.S. planned to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves over several months to stem the rise in energy prices. In total, up to 180 million barrels are set to be released over six months, which if realized would be largest “release from the stockpile since it was created in 1975,” Stifel said in a note.
Oil prices fell more than 6% and were further pressured by a decision from OPEC and allies including Russia to stick with plans to add 430,000 barrels per day from May, shrugging off calls from world leaders to ramp-up production.
The latest economic data point to further evidence of the impact of energy and other commodity prices that have pushed inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target.  
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 5.4% in the 12 months through March, the fastest gain since April 1983.
In the wake of red-hot inflation, Wall Street experts see the Fed following up its 25-basis-point rate hike with more aggressive hikes later this year.
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are forecasting the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points in May and June.
The bets on aggressive rate hikes ahead have many worried about the Fed causing a recession. Bond markets have been quick to price in the risk of recession. Early this week, the 10-2 Treasury yield curve briefly inverted following weeks of flattening.
Bank stocks, which led the weakness on Thursday, remain on course to post a loss for the quarter as flattening in the yield curve dents net interest margin, limiting banks’ profit from lending.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT),  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were the biggest decliners on the day down more than 4%.
Tech, meanwhile, was also in the red on the final day of the first quarter, as investors appeared to take profits.
Chip stocks were under pressure following a 8% rout in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after Barclays downgraded the chipmaker to underweight from equal-weight cut its price target on the stock to $115 from $148, citing “cyclical risks across several end markets.”
In earnings news, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) fell 6% as concerns about slowing growth ahead overshadowed quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines. 
The worst quarter in two years for stocks comes a day ahead of monthly nonfarm payrolls data expected to show the economy created 490,000 jobs in April. "

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) and state lender CDP are expected to start formal negotiations over a potential merger of TIM's network assets with those of state backed Open Fiber, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The negotiations would come as TIM boss Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to revamp Italy's biggest phone company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its service business.
The sources said CDP and TIM are expected to ink a confidentiality agreement (NDA) in the early days of April.
TIM and CDP declined to comment. 
While discussions with KKR over the U.S. fund's takeover approach for TIM are ongoing, TIM and CDP's plans to sign off on an NDA would mark a further step in an alternative direction to the bid.
A person familiar with the U.S. fund's thinking on Wednesday said KKR was pessimistic about the prospects of its bid, which it has said it would only pursue with the backing of TIM and the Rome government. KKR declined to comment.
A top government adviser last week said Rome's goal remained that of creating a single broadband network in Italy. This can be achieved by merging TIM's fixed assets with those of Open Fiber, which is 60% owned by CDP.
CDP also owns 10% of TIM and would retain control of any combined network as it oversee other key infrastructure in the country.
CDP has said the tie-up would avoid costly duplication of investment needed to upgrade the national network for Italian households and businesses.
Hindered by antitrust issues, a TIM-Open Fiber deal has proved elusive so far.
PRICE GAP 
KKR, which has already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in TIM's last-mile fixed-line network last year, submitted an indicative bid to buy the group in November.
While a merger of Open Fiber was not part of KKR's plans for TIM, the fund wants to discuss with the company the antitrust implications of a such a deal and how it can create value for the FiberCop business in which KKR is already an investor.
TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has billed KKR's proposal as too low even though it was pitched at 0.505 euros. TIM shares traded at 0.33 euros on Thursday.
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group's ""untapped value"".
Sources have said TIM asked KKR to clarify by Monday whether the price of 10.8 billion euros for the equity was confirmed. TIM and KKR are at odds over a due diligence analysis KKR wants to perform before making a formal offer, while TIM has said it can only have confirmatory nature, meaning it would have preceded by a formal offer. 

""The problems here go well beyond disagreements over the due diligence, there is little appetite on TIM's part and Rome's to work on KKR's takeover project,"" a source familiar with the negotiations said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.
The lawsuit had been brought in Manhattan by digital token investors who had bought nine tokens - EOS, QSP, KNC, TRX, FUN, ICX, OMG, LEND and ELF - through Binance's online exchange starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.
In a 327-page complaint, the investors claimed that Binance ""wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions"" and failed to warn them about the ""significant risks"" of buying the tokens, and sought to recoup what they paid.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, however, said the investors sued too late, having waited more than one year after their purchases.
He also said domestic securities laws did not apply because Binance was not a domestic exchange, even if it used Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) computer servers and Ethereum blockchain computers in the United States.
""Plaintiffs must allege more than stating that plaintiffs bought tokens while located in the U.S. and that title passed in whole or in part over servers located in California that host Binance's website,"" Carter wrote.
Kyle Roche, a lawyer for the investors at Roche Freedman, declined to comment. Binance and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The investors claimed the statute of limitations began running exactly one year before their April 2020 lawsuit, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released a ""framework"" characterizing their tokens as securities. 

Binance has an opaque corporate structure, with a holding company registered in the Cayman Islands. Founder and Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao said in October that Binance planned to establish ""a few headquarters"" around the world.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut some losses Thursday, but remained on track for a first quarter loss, as investors digested further data pointing to red-hot inflation just as President Biden announced the U.S. planned to release a record amount of emergency oil supplies to curb rising energy prices.

LONDON (Reuters) -A proposed multi-billion pound claim brought by thousands of asset managers, pension funds and financial institutions against major banks over alleged foreign exchange (forex) rigging has been blocked by a London court.
London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which had been considering the case against JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), UBS and NatWest since last July, ruled on Thursday the case was not suitable to proceed as a U.S.-style, opt-out class action.
The European Commission paved the way for the proposed lawsuit by fining banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) in 2019 over two forex cartels, dubbed ""Essex Express"" and ""Three Way Banana Split"", between 2007 and 2013. 
Michael O'Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog The Pensions Regulator, and Phillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at the Competition Markets Authority, had been vying to lead a class action on behalf of financial claimants.
O'Higgins said his team was reviewing its options.
""This decision is extremely disappointing, because this claim is exactly the sort of claim that opt-out proceedings were introduced to facilitate in order to provide access to justice to all entities affected by the illegal behaviour of cartelists,"" he said.
""We are reviewing our options to decide how to move forward in a way that best serves the class that we seek to represent.""

A representative for JPMorgan welcomed the news, saying the tribunal had ""acknowledged the clear weaknesses in the applicants' cases"". Others were not immediately available for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) is preparing to let shoppers use food stamps to pay for online orders, following in the footsteps of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com, in a move that could help the nation's seventh-largest retailer gain market share among lower-income shoppers.
Roughly 21.7 million U.S. households use food stamps, which are mostly restricted payments to cold food items, non-alcoholic beverages and seeds and plants.
Target disclosed to Reuters last week that it will begin to accept payment online with food stamps, tentatively starting in late April, through a service offered by Shipt, its delivery arm. A Target spokesman said Thursday that it hadn't ""shared any official launch date"" for the service, which also will include drive-up and pick-up orders.
Offering food-stamp payment for online orders could help Target fill a long-time gap in its e-commerce strategy and reach households that might otherwise purchase groceries at so-called ""dollar store"" chains, or at Walmart Inc. 
Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) already accept purchases with food stamps on their websites since 2019 as part of a program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which distributes food stamps. Grocery delivery service Instacart also offers the option.
Still, even though Target has lost the early mover advantage, investors and industry watchers were positive on the move. Accepting food-stamp payments online could build customer loyalty and help it sell other products, said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds over $30 million in Target shares. 
""Target is kind of taking the long view, saying you can use your food stamps now,"" he said. ""But maybe at some point you won't depend on food stamps and you'll remember that Target was there for your various shopping needs.""
""I wouldn't call it a game-changer, but I think it is important,"" Klink added. 
Grocery is a big part of Target's operations. In 2020, it accounted for 20% of its overall sales of $92.4 billion, putting it in competition with the 10 largest U.S. grocers, including Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Albertsons. The company this month said it was looking to expand grocery sales, especially through private label.
On March 1, Richard Gomez, Target's chief food and beverage officer, told investors Target is ""going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries.""
Target's house brand, Good & Gather, now offers nearly 2,500 food and beverage products. Target, for example, sells a 12-ounce can of Good & Gather evaporated milk for $0.99 on its website, compared to Nestle's Carnation condensed milk for $1.69.
""Target will put a leading national brand like Nestle on a display, but put the Target (private-label) item right next to it, to get the consumer to cross over,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm, adding that the move was ""transformative.""
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in October began providing about 42.8 million people with an additional $20 billion in food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than 3.2 million food-stamp households shopped online in January, doubling from a year before. To buy groceries online, food-stamp recipients generally must have an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card, similar to a debit card. However card holders can't use the benefits to pay for non-food items.
For Target, one question is whether food-stamp recipients will be willing to pay delivery fees. Shipt, which Target acquired in 2017, charges $7 per delivery but offers free same-day delivery to subscribers who pay $99 per year. 
Instacart, which handles deliveries for BJ's Wholesale Club, Food Lion, Publix and Ahold Delhaize USA, among others, is waiving its $3.99 delivery fees for food stamp purchases made online until March 31.
Amazon has since offered additional discounts of up to 15%on select meat, produce, toiletries and paper products purchased at Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods by food stamp recipients using EBT cards. 
EBT cards can not be used to pay for Amazon Prime subscription membership, tips or items sold by third-party sellers; however, Amazon offers membership discounts of $6.99 per month for customers who are on government programs including SNAP (food stamps) and Medicaid. An Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month, or $139 per year. 
Lower-income households are seeing their purchasing power erode as meat and bread prices, and heating and gas costs, rise. The price of groceries purchased online in the United States rose 7.6% on average in February, compared to a year earlier, according to the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index. 

The $50 billion or more that Americans spend annually on groceries purchased with food stamps represents just 5% of the $1 trillion spent on food-at-home yearly, said Bill Kirk, consumer analyst at MKM Partners. 
Still, Target's new payment option underscores its ambition to boost market share in the area of groceries, a category where strong growth in volume sales is hard to come by and where inflation is particularly acute.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are gathering in Geneva this week for their first big industry event in three years, tackling the impact of sanctions on rich Russians arising from the war in Ukraine.
Russia was only the 17th largest market for Swiss watch exports last year, but how to manage business and client relations during such a sensitive time was high on the priority list, Reuters' conversations with executives at Watches & Wonders showed.
Sanctions against Russia and a ban on exports of luxury goods mean brands can no longer ship timepieces to Russia and all the big labels have closed directly operated stores.
Neither Richemont nor Ulysse Nardin, recently sold to its management by  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and traditionally strong in Russia, wanted to comment on reports Russian authorities had seized millions of dollars worth of watches at rival brand Audemars Piguet's Russian subsidiary and what that could mean for their own business there. Audemars Piguet did not return requests for comment.
Ulysse Nardin's Patrick Pruniaux said the brand still had about 20 sales outlets, but was now much less dependent on Russia than in the past.
Russians account for around 2% to 3% of global luxury spending, or around 7 billion euros ($7.75 billion), dwarfed by the U.S. and China, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, senior partner and head of fashion and luxury at consultancy Bain. 
“These are loyal customers that buy every year and that I think have strong relationships with some of these brands on a personal level,” she noted.
Russian retailers were unable to attend the trade show, according to Thierry Stern, the head of independently owned Patek Philippe, which works with big Russian luxury retailer Mercury Group.
DIAMONDS AND DUBAI
Stern said he did not expect the sanctions to hit the brand's access to diamonds because it had stock for at least a year and there was sufficient supply elsewhere. ""If this lasts long, maybe prices will rise a bit,"" he said.
Richemont said it had stopped buying Russian diamonds, but was confident it could source them elsewhere.
Oris, another independently owned brand, said it put plans to expand in Russia with a new retail partner on hold. ""But we shouldn't forget there's also people there, families whose existence is at risk,"" co-CEO Rolf Studer told Reuters on Thursday, saying many brands had long-standing relationships with Russian partners.
Edouard Meylan of independent H.Moser said his brand had received demands from Russians - just before sanctions hit - who wanted to quickly spend their money on watches before it got seized by Swiss authorities. ""We refused, of course,"" he said.
Oris's Studer confirmed this was not uncommon, recalling similar demands from Germans before the end of Swiss banking secrecy a few years ago. Richemont finance chief Burkhart Grund told Reuters the company was very vigilant its products were not used for money laundering or to circumvent sanctions.
Several executives said they were seeing booming demand in Dubai as the United Arab Emirates as well as Turkey see money flowing in from wealthy Russians seeking a financial haven.

Last week, USPS said it had placed an initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 next-generation delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp. It said at least 10,019 of those will be electric vehicles (EVs), double its initial planned EV purchases, but some lawmakers feel that is not enough.
House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney said USPS ""should be leading the way, not falling behind private companies that are already moving ahead to save money and curb climate change by electrifying their fleets.""
Previously, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had committed to buying at least 10% EVs as part of a multibillion-dollar plan to retire 30-year-old delivery vehicles.
The hearing will include USPS Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb and Victoria Stephen, executive director of the USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle program.
Congress has considered awarding USPS $5.9 billion to boost EV purchases and charging infrastructure.
USPS in February rejected a bid by the White House and Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its plans to buy mostly gasoline-powered vehicles and hold a new public hearing on the environmental ramifications of the vehicle purchases. 
In February 2021, the USPS announced an initial $482 million contract for Oshkosh and said it could order up to 165,000 vehicles over 10 years in a deal that could be worth $6 billion or more.
USPS estimates its total costs for buying and operating 75,000 new delivery vehicles over 20 years including fueling and maintenance at $9.3 billion for gasoline-powered vehicles and $11.6 billion for electric models.

In 2019, USPS operated 217,000 vehicles that traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles and spent about $706.2 million in maintenance costs for it fleet of 140,000 older delivery vehicles.
USPS said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""

Investing.com – Stock of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger-owner PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) lost 6.6% Thursday after several brokerages cut their price targets, according to StreetInsider.
Evercore’s $85 was the lowest set by any of the at least six brokerages who trimmed their targets. The brokerage earlier had a target of $120 for the stock. It maintained its underperform rating. Goldman Sachs, which also maintained its buy rating cut its target to $121 from $140 earlier.
The raft of price cuts followed the company’s fourth-quarter numbers that were disclosed Wednesday.
Fourth-quarter revenue increased 16% to $2.43 billion and the company said the pandemic continued to pressure the performance of its stores but not as much. Some stores in Europe and China were temporarily shut while some other operated on reduced hours.
The sales of Heritage Brands business, including IZOD, Van Heusen, Arrow and Geoffrey Beene brands, to Authentic Brands also weighed on the revenue.
Adjusted profit per share was $2.84 compared to a loss in the same period a year ago.
Revenue in 2022 is projected to increase 2% to 3%, impacted by the sales of the Heritage business and the closure of its stores in Russia and Belarus. Wholesale shipments to Ukraine have also reduced, the company said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly C. Greenberger said the economic forces remain volatile and “All in, if the European situation proves more dynamic than currently contemplated, and/or if consumers are less receptive to ongoing price increases, PVH could observe an unexpected departure in earnings results relative to plan”.
Greenberger now sees the stock at $89, down from the prior $122.
UBS analyst Jay Sole was an exception, reiterating a buy with a price target of $156, lower by $12.

For soybeans, the USDA projected plantings at 90.955 million acres, up 4% from last year and above most analyst expectations.
The USDA also reported U.S. March 1 wheat stocks at 1.025 billion bushels, the smallest since 2008, corn stocks at 7.850 billion bushels and soybean stocks at 1.931 billion bushels.

* History of estimates for USDA stocks data

COMMENTS:
* Terry Reilly, senior analyst, Futures International:
""We're pretty much going to need every acre that USDA reported this year in order to meet demand ... The biggest surprise was the corn acres coming in 2.5 million below trade expectations. That could reflect the shortage of supply of fertilizer and also fertilizer prices trading at a record.""
* Brian Basting, analyst with Advance Trading:
""The bean acres number is a record, and we'll see if that is realized. When we saw the (fertilizer) price really skyrocket starting last fall, producers were looking for alternatives. They were looking at the attractive oilseed price, too.""
* Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities:
""The corn number led the charge. Acres were not good enough, and the stocks number was also less than the trade thought. ... It boils down to the fertilizer costs ... But as the market jumps today, these (corn) acres can come back pretty fast.""
* Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading:
""(USDA's corn plantings forecast) tells me that farmers don't like to pay for record fertilizer prices. They are either scaling back their fertilizer use, or they have done a bit of switching (of corn acres to soybean acres). They're just not going to pay these prices.""
* Charlie Sernatinger, analyst with ED&F Man Capital:
""Wow. Corn (futures are) off to the races on the acreage numbers, as well as the spring wheat; new-crop beans (futures) under pressure, but I suspect that even the beans will be bought up off these numbers. Total corn and bean acres were 180.5 million, matching the high from 2020. Bean stocks were bearish as well, adding to the early selling.""
* Craig Turner, senior ag broker at Daniels Trading:
""There should have been a bigger (market) reaction to these numbers. These should have been limit-up, limit-down numbers. ... They say a rising tide lifts all boats, and a rally in corn and wheat could be helping beans in this case.""

* Bob Utterback, president of Utterback Marketing:
""Remember the movie 'The Exorcist', where the girl's head is spinning around and spitting out pea soup? That's what the bears are doing right now. Most of my farmer customers are planning to shift a little of their acreage to beans. It doesn't take a lot from all of these producers making a small shift, to add up an extra million acres.""

(Reuters) -Automakers racing to develop battery-powered, software-driven vehicles to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are confronting a new challenge: what technology to build themselves, and what to keep buying from suppliers.
Becoming more vertically integrated by doing more manufacturing in-house represents a major shift for most global automakers, who have relied for decades on suppliers to produce critical parts and software, and manage sprawling manufacturing networks in low-wage countries.
But some established automakers are embracing drastic changes to their longstanding build-or-buy calculations. One factor is the success of Tesla's electric vehicles, which rely on proprietary technology the company develops and manufactures itself. Another is the financial damage done by supply-chain breakdowns during the pandemic.
""The most important thing is we vertically integrate. Henry Ford ... was right,"" Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's CEO, Jim Farley, said at a conference in earlier this month. Farley's reference was to company founder Henry Ford's Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan, which in the early 20th Century took in iron ore and other raw materials at one end, and churned Model Ts off the assembly line at the other.
Farley said the company had to move away from its early EV strategy of buying components off the shelf. Now, he said, Ford aims to control the supply chains ""all the way back to the mines"" that produce battery materials.
Graphic on share of in-house EV motor production: https://tmsnrt.rs/36KpTAj
Rivals including Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Mercedes-Benz AG are pursuing similar strategies. Mercedes last year acquired British high-performance electric motor manufacturer YASA, and has retooled a factory near Berlin to produce motors based on YASA technology. The German luxury car maker in March opened a new factory in Alabama to build battery packs for U.S.-made electric vehicles, and said it will partner with Japanese battery maker Envision AESC to build battery cells in the United States.
""We are going deep into sourcing,"" Mercedes-Benz Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius told reporters during a briefing in Alabama.
WINNING STRATEGY
The investments by automakers in mines, motors and batteries are a departure from decades of handing control over development and production to suppliers, who could produce steering controls, semiconductors and electronic components at greater scale and lower cost for multiple vehicle manufacturers.
In the new world of electric vehicles, however, investors have decided that Tesla's approach of buying raw materials directly, building its own batteries and engineering its own software is the winning strategy. Tesla's market capitalization has soared back above $1 trillion in recent weeks, outweighing that of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), GM and Ford combined. 
""Major players have realized electric vehicles are the future, but they have yet to widely recognize that they have to up their game in terms of motors, transmissions, battery technologies, inverters and electric powertrains,"" Peter Rawlinson, CEO of EV startup Lucid Group Inc, said in an interview with Reuters. Rawlinson previously was vice president of vehicle engineering at Tesla.
Between the 1970s and the 2010s, the share of automaker-owned intellectual property in their vehicles decreased from 90% to 50%, according to Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.
That meant many automakers lacked the in-house engineering expertise to develop their own electric vehicle platforms, powertrains and battery packs when EV pioneer Tesla showed its vertically integrated cars were a hit with consumers.
""We're designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to the traditional supply base and [execute] like I call it, catalog engineering,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a 2020 earnings call.
Tesla's approach is costly and the company has raised vehicle prices repeatedly in the last few years. Despite promising to deliver a model that could start at about $25,000, Musk earlier this year said ""we're not currently working on the $25,000 car. At some point, we will. But we have enough on our plate right now.""
TECHNOLOGY RACE 
There is also a gap between what automakers say about their vertical integration strategies, and what happens as engineers try to meet deadlines to deliver new vehicles, supplier industry executives said.
""There's a lot of narrative about in-sourcing and vertically integrating, especially in areas like software,"" Kevin Clark, chief executive of auto supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc, told analysts in February. ""Virtually all the OEMs that we are doing business with are struggling with software development.""
Graphic on expected in-house EV motor production: https://tmsnrt.rs/3DAh0FC
Xavier Mosquet, a senior adviser at Boston Consulting Group, said many manufacturers still prefer to buy EV technology to avoid the cost and complexity of manufacturing in-house.
""There are a number of automakers who in a way want to continue buying and manage the final integration,"" Mosquet said, adding that it would take several years to determine which approach is successful.
Many automakers are also hesitant to completely in-source EV manufacturing at a time when EV purchases still make up only a fraction of total vehicle demand.
Today, only Tesla, EV startup Lucid Group Inc and Chinese BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd are completely making their electric motors in-house, according to IHS Markit, followed by Hyundai Motor Co and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.
Other carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz Group, Ford and Porsche, are using electric motors by suppliers for their current EV models.

""The electric powertrain cannot be bought off the shelf at a world-class standard, it is not a commodity,"" Rawlinson said. ""This is a technology race and the market doesn't see it yet.""
Mercedes said it plans to make electric motors, battery packs and electronics in-house starting in 2024. The company is also working to reduce costs by securing raw materials directly from miners, Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer told Reuters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The boss of Irish budget carrier Ryanair raised the stakes in a feud with Boeing (NYSE:BA) over jet prices by saying he could do without a long-stalled deal to buy the 737 MAX 10 - even as Boeing appeared to woo his arch-rival easyJet (LON:EZJ).
The latest salvo in a dispute between Europe's largest low-cost airline group and Boeing, the exclusive supplier of its main fleet, came as airline chiefs met for the first time in two years to review a pandemic recovery clouded by war in Ukraine.
Ryanair last year walked away from negotiations with Boeing for 200 of its largest type of single-aisle jet, the 737 MAX 10, accusing the planemaker of being ""delusional"" about prices. 
On Thursday, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary noted no signs of a breakthrough but said he would meet Boeing in April.
""We have to wait for Boeing to be in a kind of headspace for talking about MAX 10s. At the moment, they're dealing with a backlog of deliveries, 777 issues, design delays or certification delays on the MAX 10. They have a whole heap of problems,"" O'Leary told Reuters.
""There are many times in my life that I missed the market, there's always that possibility. But you know, even if we have, we're very content where we are; we have 210 aircraft deliveries to take over the next five years,"" he said in an interview. 
Boeing officials had no immediate comment. 
The U.S. company has said in response to previous criticism from Ryanair that it is committed to supporting its partner but will ""continue to be disciplined"" in commercial decisions.
O'Leary, hoping to benefit from bargain prices as Boeing claws its way back from a recent safety crisis, urged Boeing to fight harder for customers after what he described as a series of market losses to single-aisle leader Airbus.
""Boeing need to begin to fight back and win back market share from Airbus,"" he said in an interview.
SHIFTING ALLIANCES
But in an unusual twist, Boeing wasted no time in holding a semi-public pow-wow with Ryanair's rival easyJet, a key Airbus customer, just yards away at the A4E airlines conference.
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren was seen huddling with a group of Boeing executives including Senior Vice-President of Commercial Sales & Marketing Ihssane Mounir, the U.S. company's sales boss.
Mounir declined to comment on the half-hour discussion, held in the corner of a quiet public space on conference sidelines.
""As you would expect, we informally speak with others in the industry at industry events,"" an easyJet spokeswoman said.
An Airbus spokesman said, ""We have full trust in our partner easyJet and we never comment on our customers' private agendas.""
It is not uncommon for airlines and manufacturers to chat informally at such gatherings, but the meeting between senior officials cutting across industry alliances caused a buzz.
""Yes, everyone noticed that,"" a European delegate said.
Airbus has long been the exclusive supplier for easyJet, while Ryanair is a die-hard Boeing customer apart from a sub-fleet of leased Airbus jets inherited through acquisition.
The airline industry, hungry for new deals after pandemic losses, has seen a series of defections in recent months.

Boeing lost medium-haul contests to Airbus at Dutch KLM https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-dominant-share-air-france-klm-jet-purchase-sources-2021-12-16 and Australia's Qantas https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-wins-order-renew-qantas-fleet-sources-2021-12-15 but scored an unexpected victory by poaching U.S. budget carrier Allegiant Air, which had previously relied on used Airbus jets.
Such ""flips"" are rare due to the cost of retraining pilots, but reflect fierce competition for new business as the aerospace industry seeks to recover from its worst-ever recession.

LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Thursday requiring foreign buyers to pay roubles for Russian gas from April 1 or see their contracts halted, a move described as ""blackmail"" by European states.
WHAT IS BEHIND THE CHANGE?
The move is in retaliaton against Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. 
Moscow, which says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, describes the Western measures as an economic war.
Getting Western countries to pay in roubles would blunt the impact of their curbs on Russia's foreign reserves and boost the rouble.
So far this year, Europe has spent 200 million to 800 million euros ($880 million) a day on Russian gas, converting that into roubles would be a huge boost for it.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Europe is heavily reliant on Russia for its energy needs, with around 40% of its gas coming from the country. If Moscow decides to turn off the taps it could trigger supply shortages, factory closures and crippling energy costs across the region.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has already activiated an emergency plan which could mean power rationing if gas supplies get too low.
Dutch gas prices, the European benchmark, have already hit record highs this year on supply concerns, stoking inflation in the region and raising the risk of recession.[G/EU]
WILL FOREIGN BUYERS SWITCH TO ROUBLES?
So far, it looks unlikely, Western countries have said payment in roubles would breach contracts that can take months or more to renegotiate.
IF THEY DO SWITCH, HOW WOULD IT WORK?
Putin's order makes Gazprombank the intermediary in the gas trade. 
A foreign buyer is now obliged to transfer foreign currency to one special, so called ""K"", account at the lender. Gazprombank would then buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer roubles to another special ""K"" account, the order said.
Britain put Gazprombank on its list of banned entities earlier this month. It was not included in the EU's order excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
It's unclear. Russia would have to physically halt gas flows to the European Union to force the issue.
In the meantime, the European Union may up the ante by putting curbs on Russian energy exports.

The European Commission is readying new sanctions against the Kremlin, EU sources told Reuters on Wednesday, with the magnitude of the new measures depending on Moscow's stance on gas payments in roubles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of users and customers should account for those assets as a liability on their balance sheet and disclose the related risks to investors, the securities regulator said on Thursday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance would apply to a range of listed entities, including crypto exchanges and traditional firms such as retail brokers and banks that are increasingly providing cryptocurrency services and holding digital assets on behalf of a range of clients.
While there is a well-established standard under accounting rules for safeguarding traditional assets on behalf of clients, there is no explicit standard for safeguarding crypto assets and companies diverge in their treatment of these arrangements.
In its guidance, the SEC said there are ""significant"" technological, legal and regulatory risks associated with safeguarding crypto-assets and as a result they should be reflected as a liability on companies' balance sheets.
""The technological mechanisms supporting how crypto-assets are issued, held, or transferred, as well as legal uncertainties regarding holding crypto-assets for others, create significant increased risks...including an increased risk of financial loss,"" the SEC wrote. 
Companies should also disclose ""the nature and amount"" of crypto assets they are responsible for holding, with separate disclosures for each significant crypto-asset, and any vulnerabilities resulting from concentration in such activities. 
The underlying crypto assets should be accounted for at fair value, the SEC said. 

Cryptocurrency platforms and wallets continue suffer major breaches, with hackers just this week stealing $615 million worth of cryptocurrency from blockchain project Ronin. 
In addition, U.S. regulators remain undecided on how to treat cryptocurrencies, with regulators still discussing new rules for how banks should handle digital assets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's top shareholder said it had agreed to sell its stake to Bain Capital if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer, potentially forcing the embattled conglomerate to revive talks for a private equity buyout.
The agreement between Bain and Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, which owns about 9.9% of Toshiba, comes as shareholders last week voted down the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to split its devices unit.
Effissimo said in a regulatory filing on Thursday it had signed a confirmation letter dated March 24 that it would tender to a bid that allows Bain to own at least two-thirds of Toshiba and that clears regulatory approval.
It also said the agreement would be invalidated if a potential bid by Bain was set to fall through, leaving open the possibility for Effissimo to tender its stocks to someone else who makes a superior offer.
""This basically means it's going to kick off a competitive auction process,"" a Toshiba shareholder told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The Nikkei business daily reported that Bain is planning to team up with Japanese investment funds in making a buyout offer.
Bain said in a statement nothing had been decided about a takeover bid for Toshiba, adding there were many issues that needed to be resolved to launch a bid to take Toshiba private.
""We believe we need to have careful and sincere dialogues with Toshiba management, the Japanese government, financial institutions and other stakeholders,"" it said.
INTEREST FROM OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS
Three sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters that other global private equity firms are also interested in taking Toshiba private.
One of them sounded out Toshiba management about a potential buyout in January, saying that it could make a proposal if the company is interested, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks were private.
Toshiba said in a statement it was not involved in the confirmation letter between Effissimo and Bain, as well as in its contents.
It also said the company accepts the opinion of the shareholders expressed at last week's meeting and will aim to build trust with shareholders and reconsider its strategic options to enhance value. 
A spokesperson for Effissimo, when asked about the filing, said the fund planned to announce its stance at the appropriate time.
During a five-month strategic review through November, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers.

Sources said the private equity firms Toshiba held talks with included Bain, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Blackstone (NYSE:BX). At least one private equity firm told Toshiba that a deal to take it private could be done at 6,000 yen a share or more.
Bain owns Kioxia Holdings Corp, the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba has a 40% stake in the chipmaker.

ETFs and similar products together held 3,570 tonnes of gold worth $210 billion at the end of 2021, according to the World Gold Council, which tracks the sector.
As part of a report on ethical gold investments, Reuters asked the ten largest ETF operators - all based in Europe or North America - what gold they own.
All the funds only hold gold bars made by refiners accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), a standard-setting industry body. 
Six, with 955 tonnes of gold between them, said they prioritised bars made since 2012, when the LBMA introduced rules aimed at stopping the use of gold linked to crime or violence.
Before that date, LBMA rules focused only on the purity, weight and size of gold bars.
Three of the six ETF issuers that focus on newer bars said they aimed to hold bars made after 2019, when the LBMA rules had become tougher. These three held 378 tonnes of gold at the end of 2021. 
Four of the top 10 fund operators, with 2,188 tonnes of gold between them, said they were comfortable holding bars made before and after 2012.

The WGC said in its role as an industry body it was working to implement higher ethical standards for miners, refiners and traders. 
It said the LBMA considers old gold bars eligible to trade, and that excluding them would have no meaningful ethical impact while impairing the liquidity needed for ETFs to do what investors want, which is to effectively track the gold price.
""It's about improving liquidity, keeping standards high and getting higher, and making sure that people understand that the full pool of gold bars is acceptable,"" said Joe Cavatoni, head of the Americas, Global Sales and ETFs at the WGC.

LONDON (Reuters) - Want to invest in ethical gold? It's harder than it looks. 
A push by investment funds to avoid bullion from unethical sources by buying newly made bars is limited in its impact because many still contain old gold whose provenance is unknown, bankers and refiners say.
That means very few investment funds know the origin of their product and its environmental and humanitarian record, denting ambitions to tap into the booming market for sustainable investments.
The world's biggest gold-backed funds have increasingly focused on holding bars made since 2012, when the standard-setting London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) brought in rules to ensure metal in the $15 trillion a year wholesale market was not linked to crime or violence.
But given how often older bars are melted and recycled, many made after that date still contain gold whose history is unverifiable, bankers and refiners told Reuters.
It is not clear how much old gold is in new bars, but more than half the metal processed by mainstream refineries is recycled, LBMA data show. 
""It is an illusion to believe that if you re-refine, you get 'newly born' gold that is ethically acceptable,"" said Patrick Schein, a refiner and board member at the Alliance for Responsible Mining. ""It resembles greenwashing."" 
Schein said it was fine for funds to hold recycled gold if it was alongside newly dug metal from industrial and artisanal mines, but that they should be transparent. ""When it is not possible to trace origin, just say so,"" he said.
Gold is not a natural draw for ESG investors, given the large environmental cost of digging it out of the ground, but the metal is a valuable financial asset and mines are large employers in developing nations. 
Recycled gold has less environmental impact than mined metal, but because its origin is often unknown there is a risk it may have passed through criminal or violent hands. 
While investors are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics when deciding where to invest, the gold industry, like many sectors, does not have mandatory rules around ESG compliance.
LBMA Chief Executive Ruth Crowell, while acknowledging that old gold ends up in new bars, said the focus on newer bars showed funds are taking ESG seriously.
""It's definitely a positive step,"" she said. She predicts greater transparency and more ambitious sourcing commitments in the future. 
'IT'S THE SAME GOLD'
One of the most popular ways to invest in gold is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and similar products which issue shares backed by bullion. 
Of the ten largest, six, which at the end of last year held 955 tonnes of gold worth around $55 billion, told Reuters they prioritised bars made since 2012. Three of these favoured bars made since 2019, when rules had become tougher.
Several funds use their post-2012 or post-2019 pledges in their marketing materials, though none of the largest explicitly pitch themselves as ""ethical"" or ""green"". 
The LBMA's Crowell said seeking post-2012 bars was meaningful because standards tightened so sharply. Post-2019 pledges appeared more of a ""marketing play"", she said, as changes that year were less significant.
Bankers said rising demand for newer gold bars in Europe had led to more made before 2012 being sent to Asia, where fewer buyers have ESG requirements.
As gold travels east, refineries typically recast the large bars traded in the West into smaller ones favoured in Asia, industry sources said. Some of these return to Europe and the United States and are remade again into bars which, because they are new, funds would accept, the sources said.
""It's the same gold,"" said an executive at a large gold-trading bank. 
The four top-ten funds comfortable with pre-2012 bars include the two biggest, the World Gold Council's SPDR funds, which held 1,050 tonnes of gold at the end of last year, and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares funds, which had 769 tonnes.
The World Gold Council, founded by mining companies to promote the use of gold, said it supported higher ethical standards but that old bars should not be excluded as this has no meaningful ethical impact and would impair market liquidity, which is essential for large funds to operate. 
Blackrock said LBMA rules allowed for use of old bars. ""Our ETPs are classified as responsibly sourced by the LBMA based on its industry standards,"" a spokesperson said. 
TRACEABLE GOLD
Funds do have the option to pay more to avoid wholesale bars and get gold with a guaranteed origin. This could be from mines or recycled metal if the fund prioritises low environmental impact over traceability. 
But the vast majority of ETFs don't hold specific-origin gold. Some said this was because only the wholesale market, with its huge pool of interchangeable gold bars, can cope with the size and frequency of their transactions. Others said their investors did not want to pay a premium.
Some small funds are holding gold whose origin they know.
Swiss banking group Raiffeisen and Swiss wealth managers de Pury Pictet Turrettini each last year launched gold funds committed to traceable metal from large and artisanal mines.
When this is unavailable, they get bars from the wholesale market but seek to later swap them for known-origin ones, they said. 
Making known-origin gold requires refiners to use more complex processes and segregated production lines. Many do produce some gold this way, chiefly for the jewellery market, and although it is more costly, much more could be supplied, refiners said. 

The Raiffeisen and Pictet funds, whose management charges are broadly in line with the 10 largest ETFs, are still small, each containing less than 2 tonnes of gold. 
But bigger funds will follow their lead, said Melchior de Muralt at de Pury Pictet Turrettini. ""More and more ETFs will hold traceable gold, even if only 10% or 20%, to accommodate ESG-driven clients,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Royal Bank of Canada became the latest Canadian lender to expand overseas with a 1.6 billion pound ($2.1 billion) all-cash offer for U.K.-based wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF) on Thursday. 
The bid, representing a 62% premium to Wednesday's closing price, sent the target's shares surging 61%.
The UK is a key growth market, and the combination would make RBC Wealth Management the No.3 wealth manager in Britain and Ireland, Canada's biggest bank said.
RBC is offering Brewin shareholders 515 pence per share, compared with Wednesday's closing price of 318 pence, valuing the firm at 2.8% of its 55 billion pounds in assets under management (AUM) as of Feb. 28.
Brewin's shares hit a record high of 511 pence at 1445 GMT, doubling from their lowest in more than a year reached earlier this month. Royal Bank shares slipped 0.1%, compared with a 0.4% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark.
Brewin Dolphin directors have unanimously backed the deal, which is expected to complete at the end of the third quarter, RBC said.
The premium ""demonstrates the attractiveness of the UK wealth market, with long-term, stable income streams and the potential for growth and higher operating margins"", Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. 
It is higher than the 2.4% of AUM that rival Bank of Nova Scotia paid for Jarislowsky Fraser and the 2.2% that Toronto-Dominion Bank paid for Greystone Capital Management, both in 2018, said Kingwest & Co Portfolio Manager Anthony Visano. 
But demand for such businesses has also increased recently, with banks and asset managers snapping up wealth management firms and direct investing platforms, using economies of scale to cut costs. 
RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay had said on its latest earnings call in February the bank was in ""active dialogues"" related to its search for commercial and wealth businesses in the United States and Europe.
Its wealth management unit accounted for about 28% of total revenues in its first fiscal quarter, although the bulk of that came from Canada and the United States.
Canada's Big Six banks, which hold about 90% market share at home, have been expanding outside their home markets. RBC's bid follows deals by TD to acquire First-Horizon Corp and Bank of Montreal's purchase of Bank of the West, both in the United States. 

Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) last year bought wealth management platform Embark, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) bought Nutmeg for 700 million pounds.

President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will soon require ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for fuel in roubles, raising alarm about a possible gas supply crunch in Europe.
Putin has ordered the Russian central bank and Gazprom to prepare the payment scheme by March 31 amid Western sanctions against Russia for its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Countries in the European Union, where Gazprom accounts for about 40% of gas supplies, have stated their refusal to pay for Russian gas in roubles.

Kommersant said Gazprom had declined to discuss the issue with the newspaper. Gazprom did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Germany, Russia's largest gas client, will continue to pay in euros or dollars, a government spokesman said on Wednesday, adding that Putin had told the German chancellor that nothing would change for European partners, despite his plan for rouble payments.

(Reuters) - Circle Internet Financial has selected Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp as primary custodian for its reserves of USD Coin, a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is directly pegged to the U.S. dollar, the crypto operator said on Thursday.
The new partnership will help link the traditional capital market with the market for digital assets, Circle said in a news release. 
As cryptocurrencies rise in popularity -- surpassing $3 trillion in value in November, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko -- the banking system is slowly warming to the idea of working more closely with digital currency companies. 
“We are at a point in the evolution of our industry where the digitization of assets is presenting new and exciting opportunities to a broad range of market participants,” Roman Regelman, BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer of asset servicing and head of digital, said in the release. 
Circle is the principal operator of USD Coin (USDC), which has a nearly $52.4 billion market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. 
The Boston-based company in February said it was valued at $9 billion under new deal terms with Concord Acquisition Corp, a blank-check firm. Blank-check firms, or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), are shell companies that raise funds through a listing to acquire a private company and take it public. 
Last summer, Grayscale, the world’s largest digital currency manager, chose BNY Mellon to run accounting and administration of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 

BNY Mellon also announced last year that it would hold, transfer and issue bitcoin for its asset management clients, in one of the first announcements of its kind by a major Wall Street bank. 
In January, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Emily Portney said in an interview that U.S. regulators should provide more clarity on the rules of the road for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets amid confusion over what activities are allowed.

An Omicron-led surge in COVID-19 cases during the second quarter had boosted demand for vaccines and testing at Walgreens. But testing has slowed since January, Walgreens executives said, adding it remains a steady source of business as travel resumes.
Despite the rise of the highly transmissible Omicron sub-variant BA.2, health experts in the United States believe a new wave of infections appears unlikely as overall cases are declining from January's record highs.
Walgreens expects low-single digit growth in profit for 2022, implying it would earn between $1.69 and $1.79 per share in the second half of the year versus consensus estimates of $1.97, according to Evercore ISI. 
The company said its cautious forecast was due to increasing investments in its Walgreens Health unit, which it created earlier in fiscal year 2022. 
""These new investments, paired with tough sales and profit comparisons from last year's COVID-19 activities, could keep sales and profit growth muted for a while, assuming no pandemic resurgence,"" said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan.
Walgreens has forecast 30 million vaccinations this year at its sites. In the second quarter ended Feb. 28, it administered about 11.8 million doses of vaccine and sold 6.6 million tests. 
Total sales rose 3% to $33.77 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $33.40 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.59 per share, compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.40. 

Walgreens said the strategic review of its UK-based Boots business, which began in January this year, was progressing well and it would pursue outcomes that potentially maximize value.
Shares of the Dow component fell 6.9% to $44.17 in early trading.

Investing.com -- Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) tumbled 7% at the open on Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"" and reduced its price target to $60 from $66. 
Erik Woodring, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, told investors in a research note that ""cracks are emerging"" in the PC outlook. 
He added that there is an ""increasing risk of negative hardware budget revisions, hardware earnings revisions peaking, and the potential for further multiple compression, which historically has resulted in IT hardware underperformance.""
""We believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after 2 years of above-trend growth,” explained the analyst.

The company updated the financial model that is now based on the strong company revenue growth prospects.
BofA analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith raised the price target to $424.00 per share, up from the prior $411.00. The analyst believes investors are now likely to focus on operating margins going forward.
""We emphasize SEDG's model (and our largely unchanged estimates) suggesting +60% top line growth in 2022 from 34% in 2021 with legs into 2023 as storage will be yet to hit a run rate fully burdened for Sella 2 capacity until then. But with growth beyond the legacy high margin resi segment (suggested at 40% GM) gross margins on a consolidated basis will fall, framing a clear bifurcation from SEDG's legacy peer Enphase. We acknowledge that some investors may struggle with this comp in particular but point to ~20% EBITDA margins in the outer years as sustainable alongside elevated growth aspirations (vs 13% in Q4),"" Dumoulin-Smith said in a client note.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee raised the price target to $439.00 per share (from $431.00) on the Buy-rated SEDG shares (on Conviction List) as strong growth is driven by robust solar demand and entry into new markets.
""Following SEDG's 2022 analyst day, we come away incrementally bullish on near-to-medium term demand trends and see growth momentum likely to persist long-term as SEDG expands its portfolio to large-scale solar applications as well as battery storage, in addition to others. To that end, SEDG provided updates to its long term financial targets, with annual revenue growth targets above expectations and with more specificity on product level gross margin targets. We believe the company's disclosure of >5.5GW of commercial shipments and backlog for 2022 is a particularly positive sign of robust growth this year, while lower gross margin owing to mix would appear to be offset by increased operating leverage with the net result being higher EPS power vs. our prior views despite more muted unit margins,"" Lee said.SEDG stock is up 1% today.

Investing.com –  Amylyx Pharmaceuticals  (NASDAQ:AMLX) stock plunged more than 21% Thursday after an FDA panel voted against recommending the approval of an experimental drug for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
ALS is a relentlessly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by motor neuron death in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neuron loss in ALS leads to deteriorating muscle function, the inability to move and speak, respiratory paralysis, and eventually death.
The AMX0035 is a proprietary oral fixed-dose combination of two small molecules.
The panel said study data failed to prove that the drug was effective in fighting the disease. The phase-2 trial comprised 137 participants.
The recommendations by the panel are non-binding and the final decision regarding approval of a pending new drug application is likely to be made by the FDA by June 29.
Amylyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company working on developing a novel therapeutic for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday as economic data pointed to a dip in consumer spending, under the influence of rising inflation. 
Meanwhile, reports of continued intense hostilities in Ukraine also further eroded hopes for a quick end to the fighting there and the associated sanctions on Russia. Russia's President Vladimir Putin said he had signed a decree earlier ordering that  'unfriendly' countries pay for Russian gas in roubles, a measure that puts it on a collision course with buyers in Europe such as Germany and Italy who have refused to do so.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 108 points, or 0.3% at 35,121 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite underperformed, sliding 0.5%, as a downgrade on market darling Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) prompted fresh caution with regard to the valuation of technology stocks that have recovered strongly in the last two weeks. AMD stock fell 5.7% as Barclays analysts cut their recommendation to 'equal weight' from 'overweight'.
Earlier, data showed that consumer spending dipped by 0.4% in inflation-adjusted terms in February, as the price index for personal consumer expenditures - widely seen as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - rose another 0.6%.
The figures also showed consumer spending patterns reverting to normal as the pandemic loosens its grip on economic life. Spending on services such as accommodation and restaurants rose, while spending on cars and consumer durables fell. 
Even so, data from the labor market gave little indication of a slowdown, ahead of Friday's monthly employment report. Initial jobless claims rose by a little more than expected to 202,000 but continuing claims fell to 1.307 million, their lowest in 60 years.
Energy stocks were among the outperformers in early trade, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries approved another 432,000 barrel-a-day increase in production from May 1, which will - at least notionally - complete the return of the bloc's production to pre-Covid levels. The world's largest exporters had taken 10 million barrels a day of output offline in 2020 as global demand cratered in the early stages of the pandemic. 
That news came just ahead of an announcement by U.S. President Joe Biden that the U.S. will release up to a million barrels of oil a day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next six months in an effort to tame rampant gasoline prices. 
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 0.8% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 2.9%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain have warned the government that a plan to ban all Russians from holding more than 50,000 pounds ($65,430) in their accounts is illegal and unworkable, five sources said.
When Russia invaded Ukraine the government said that ""all Russians"" would be banned from holding large deposits at UK banks, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was part of a strategy aimed at isolating Moscow.
There are currently more than 70,000 Russian-born nationals living in Britain, government estimates show, and London has long been one of the top destinations for Russian money in Europe, with many elite families settling in the capital.
The banking industry sources told Reuters they feared the British proposals on Russian deposits would break equality laws, which forbid discrimination on the basis of nationality, in the latest challenge to rolling out sanctions against Moscow.
""What they are proposing is illegal, there's no question about it,"" said one bank executive, who has held talks with the government on the plans. ""This feels like a rushed announcement where the consequences haven't been thought through.""
A British government spokesperson declined to comment.
Britain is implementing what the government has called the biggest-ever raft of sanctions against Russia, including asset freezes and travel bans on hundreds of individuals and entities it has accused of propping up President Vladimir Putin. 
But some of those measures, such as the blanket ban on wealthy Russian savers, are still at the drawing board, fuelling doubts over the effectiveness of the UK's attempts to pressure Moscow and loosen connections to Russia that have led some to nickname its capital ""Londongrad"".
The bank deposit plan is the only measure that targets all Russians in Britain, not just those being directly sanctioned.
The banking sources said they have asked for reassurances that they will not be sued if they enforce the curbs, seen as one of the most far-reaching sanctions tabled since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, the sources said. 
Such reassurances, however, may not be possible without a change in the law and more than a month after the caps were proposed there have been no announcements about how they will work, including whether dual nationals would be hit or how multiple deposits across many banks would be handled. 
'NO LONGER WELCOME'
While the government has vowed to crack down on illicit Russian wealth, an increasing number of Russians who have not been sanctioned are concerned they will be swept up too.
One Russian national, who has worked in London for 16 years and is not the target of sanctions, said he would consider leaving if the plans were implemented.
""If this happens then the message is very clear that we are no longer welcome,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
European Union regulators have also told some banks in the bloc to scrutinise transactions by all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents, to ensure that they are not used to circumvent Western sanctions.
Russia says it launched a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine, while Western countries say that Moscow's aim was to swiftly topple the government in Kyiv.
One of the banking sources, who also asked not to be named, said talks were ongoing, but government officials had so far failed to provide any details on how to implement the bans. 
He said he was worried the restrictions could put his bank in breach of laws such as the Human Rights Act, which could lead to lawsuits and the possibility of compensation payouts. 
Bankers said they are willing to play their part in tackling oligarchs sympathetic to Putin but want the government to identify those people first.
All of the bank sources who spoke to Reuters said the plan would require significant updates to technology, account opening processes and may be too complex to implement.
Although customers are required to disclose residency when opening an account, this does not usually include providing data on nationality, one said. 

This means banks would need to ask all customers holding in excess of 50,000 pounds to supply details of their nationality in order to identify Russian customers. 
""We are obviously willing to work with the government to target oligarchs aligned with Putin,"" the source said. ""But we have reservations about how effective this would be in tackling those actors, whilst hurting the interests of innocent parties.""

Investing.com – Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock traded 3.5% weaker in premarket Thursday after the U.S. securities regulator added its name to the list of companies that face the risk of being delisted.
The root of the case is in a 2020 U.S. law that mandates public companies to grant American authorities access to audit work papers. Firms face desilting in case of non-compliance for three straight years. Beijing has so far refused to permit U.S. officials to review their auditors’ work.
“Baidu has been actively exploring possible solutions. Baidu will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the United States, and strive to maintain its listing status on both Nasdaq and the HKEx,” the company said in a release.
Regulators in Beijing argue that their national security law prohibits them from turning over audit papers to U.S. regulators while the critics argue that Chinese firm get to enjoy access to cheap American capital without really following all the rules that other companies are subjected to.
Before this, there were five Chinese companies that were on the SEC list: BeiGene (NASDAQ:BGNE), Yum China (NYSE:YUMC),  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB), ACM Research Shanghai (NASDAQ:ACMR), and HUTCHMED (NASDAQ:HCM).
The SEC also added  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU), Nocera, CASI Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CASI) and Baidu’s video arm iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) to its provisional list for possible delisting.

The Calvin Klein brand generated sales of $991.6 million in the period, also above the consensus projection of $948 million. Calvin Klein International revenue totaled $616.6 million, missing the analyst consensus of $622.9 million.
Tommy Hilfiger reported total revenue of $1.3 billion. Comparable sales at Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger rose by 27% and 18%, respectively. PVH reported a Q4 gross margin of 58.3%, compared with the analyst estimates of 57.6%.
Moving forward, the company expects Q1 EPS in the range of $1.55 to $1.6 and expects a relatively flat revenue growth. PVH also expects the effective tax rate in Q1 to be in the range of 29% to 30%. For the full-fiscal 2023, PVH expects EPS of roughly $9 and revenue growth in the range of 2% to 3%.
""As we look ahead, we are confident in the strength and momentum in our business and our ability to drive strong underlying top and bottom line growth by leaning in to what is within our control, despite the significantly increased macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility over the last few months, including the war in Ukraine, the impact of the global pandemic, and the inflationary pressures we see across our regions,"" said Stefan Larsson, CEO of PVH.
Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly C Greenberger downgraded PVH shares to Equal Weight from Overweight. A new price target is $89.00 per share, down from the prior $122.00.
The analyst expects to see range-bound trading amid a lack of near-term catalysts. Moreover, the EPS risk is heightened as 2H-weighted guide hinges on acceleration through the year.
The guidance is notably back-half weighted, which adds risk to full-year earnings, as it requires accurate forecasting into the future while the backdrop and economic forces remain volatile. All in, if the European situation proves more dynamic than currently contemplated, and/or if consumers are less receptive to ongoing price increases, PVH could observe an unexpected departure in earnings results relative to plan, Greenberger wrote in a memo.
Opposite of Greengerger, UBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated a Buy rating and his bullish stance on PVH with a new price target of $156.00 per share, down from $168.00.
""We think PVH has the brand strength and balance sheet to drive earnings growth over the long term, despite multiple macro headwinds. We forecast the company delivering a +DD% EPS CAGR post FY22. New CEO Stefan Larsson has only just begun executing his plan to improve PVH's profitability and we think there are major margin unlocks that will play out over the next few years,"" Sole wrote in the report.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company PetroRio SA is close to agreeing on terms to purchase the Albacora Leste field from state-run oil company Petrobras, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, though talks around the neighboring Albacora field are proving more complex.
Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, has been in bilateral talks with PetroRio to sell off the two fields since November. It could be one of the last major divestments before a pivotal October presidential election. It would also be transformational for Rio de Janeiro-based PetroRio.
Both PetroRio and Petrobras declined to comment on the matter.
The Albacora field produced 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), according to documents released by Petrobras when the company launched the sale process in 2020. Albacora Leste produced 34,000 boepd at that time.
PetroRio produced roughly 31,600 boepd in 2021, according to the company, so a deal for one or both fields could roughly double or triple its output. Petrobras has publicly said it had received offers for the fields totaling more than $4 billion.
The two sides could agree on the terms for Albacora Leste as early as April, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential sale process.
However, talks for neighboring Albacora have been complicated by new information provided by Petrobras in December indicating the field holds more resources than previously estimated, the sources said.
Among the solutions proposed for Albacora are additional earnouts - provisions requiring future payments from PetroRio depending on the financial performance of the field - as well as a limited increase in the face value, said the sources. 

One of the sources, who is directly involved in the negotiations, said the two parties had discussed a face value increase in the range of 10% to 15%, although the two sides had not reached an agreement and any number was subject to ongoing modifications.
A potential agreement on Albacora may come after Albacora Leste. However, PetroRio remains strongly interested in both fields, said the same source.

(Reuters) - Ascent Resources LLC, one of the largest privately held U.S. natural gas producers, is preparing an initial public offering (IPO) it hopes will give it a market valuation of around $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Depending on timing, it would be the first major stock market listing of a U.S. shale operator since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February drove a spike in gas prices.
The ensuing stock market volatility that prevented many companies from launching an IPO is now subsiding and energy prices remain elevated, making it a favorable environment for Ascent to consider pursuing a listing.
The two private equity firms that own Ascent - the Energy & Minerals Group and First Reserve Corp - are working with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc to prepare for an IPO of Ascent, the sources said.
Bloomberg News reported last week that Ascent had held talks with  Gulfport Energy  (OTC:GPORQ) Corp, another U.S. natural gas exploration and production company, about a possible tie-up. The Reuters sources said discussions have happened sporadically since the end of 2021 and have consistently broken down as the sides were too far apart on valuation expectations.
Ascent may register its IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as early as April and could be ready for its stock market debut in New York in the second half of 2022, the sources added.
The sources cautioned that timing, valuation and whether the IPO takes place at all were subject to market conditions, and spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.
Ascent, Barclays, Citigroup, EMG, First Reserve and Gulfport all declined comment.

By listing Ascent on the stock market, the buyout firms would retain the option of finding a buyer for the company down the line. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, for example, clinched a $615 million deal last August to sell natural gas producer Vine Energy to Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK), only five months after the investment firm had listed Vine in New York.
Ascent produces gas from approximately 337,000 net acres in Ohio's Utica shale formation, according to its website. The company was founded in 2013 by EMG and First Reserve and late oilman Aubrey McClendon, who stepped away from Ascent a year later. It had $2.6 billion of debt at the end of 2021.

The world's second-biggest fashion retailer swung to a pretax profit of 282 million crowns ($30.5 million) in its first quarter from a 1.4 billion loss a year earlier when nearly half of its stores were closed by the pandemic.
As well as missing the average analyst forecast for a 1.0 billion crown profit, the result was also far below the 2.5 billion crowns reached in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2020, sending H&M's shares down 10% by 1130 GMT.
""Sales and profits for the quarter were impacted by the negative effects of the pandemic in many of the group's major markets,"" H&M said in a statement, citing supply chain disruptions and delays, and a new wave of COVID-19 in some markets. 
Increased technology and supply chain related investments also weighed. 
""Looking at inflation it's primarily raw material and transportation costs that affect us and we see, as do many others, that we need to adjust our prices,"" CEO Helena Helmersson told Reuters. ""We'll raise different product types in different countries depending on competition and demand.""
The plan was for price hikes to be smaller than rivals', and not affect basic clothing ranges, she said in an interview. 
First-quarter sales were up 18% year-on-year in local currencies, H&M reported earlier, but still down from two years ago.
Sales growth in the March 1-28 period slowed substantially from the first quarter, to 6% in local currencies. 
Excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, where H&M has temporarily closed stores, the March increase was 11%. Russia last year accounted for 4% of group sales. 
""There is a continued uncertainty concerning developments and the company is monitoring and evaluating the situation continuously,"" H&M said on the Ukraine crisis. 
H&M said its collections had been well received in the first quarter, leading to a higher share of full-price sales than a year earlier, as well as in March. Helmersson said that in countries where spring had arrived, colourful clothes in particular were in demand. 

Biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, has weathered pandemic and global supply chain disruptions better than H&M. It grew sales 33% year-on-year, and 21% from the same period in 2019, in the six weeks from Feb. 1.

""We hope to be able to save around two-thirds of what would normally be possible,"" a spokesperson said on Thursday, referring to the Ukrainian crops harvest. ""We definitely don't expect a total failure.""
The Chinese-owned group, which aims to raise around $10 billion from an initial public offering, sells both crop protection products and seeds. 
It said it was now selling these at the price of cost in Ukraine to ensure as high a harvest as possible.
""We are on the brink of a global food crisis,"" CEO Erik Fyrwald said in a post LinkedIn, referring to the destruction of infrastructure, disruptions of transport and land and water contamination which he said were making it impossible for farmers to work.
Outside of conflict, the current growing season was also being affected by unprecedented floods, droughts and high levels of pest infestation, he said.
Ukraine is a major global agriculture producer and exporter, and Russia's invasion of the country is expected to sharply reduce the 2022 harvest, with Agriculture Minister Roman Leshchenko telling Reuters its spring crop sowing area may more than halve this year.
Syngenta employs around 730 people in Ukraine and about 800 in Russia. It said it has no plans to withdraw from Russia. Crop production is not subject to various sanctions imposed on Moscow.
On a revenue basis, it said Ukraine and Russia each accounted for less than 2% of group sales.
Across the group, it said fourth quarter sales increased by 17% to $7.2 billion as it benefited from farmers investing in seeds and sprays to boost production.
It said it had increased revenue generated from its training centres in China, where it added 167 new sites in 2021 to take its total to 492.
The sites train farmers in the latest agricultural techniques as well as supply equipment, seeds and pesticides.
Syngenta said it had continued to manage its supply chain in the face of procurement and other problems.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 4% to $1.1 billion during the fourth quarter. 
Syngenta, which competes with Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), was bought by state-owned ChemChina for $43 billion in 2017, and is currently looking into a flotation.

An internal review had in February identified certain inaccurate statements and the company cut the base salaries of its Chief Executive Carsten Breitfield and founder Jia Yueting, asking them to report to newly appointed Executive Chairperson Susan Swenson.
The review by a special committee formed in November, however, rejected claims made by a short-seller that called the startup ""a new EV scam in town"", saying they were not supported by the evidence reviewed.
The startup said on Thursday it would miss the deadline for filing its 2021 annual report due to delays caused by the internal investigation. It had previously delayed the filing of its quarterly report in November. 

Several EV firms that went public via acquisition by special-purpose acquisition companies have faced regulatory scrutiny due to issues with accounting and claims they made.
Separately, Faraday Future said it expects operating loss to increase to about $186 million in the quarter-ended Sept. 30, from about $18 million a year earlier, mainly due to higher expense related to a production rampup at its Hanford, California facility.

Information about the March 21 crash, which killed all 132 people onboard, must be released in an open, timely and transparent manner, state media said in a report on the meeting of the seven-person Standing Committee of the Communist Party's politburo, China's top leadership.
A nationwide safety inspection should also be launched to prevent as much as possible the occurrence of safety accidents, state media said. If accidents do happen due to negligence, not only will the personnel in charge be punished, the relevant top officials will also be investigated, state media said. 
Earlier on Thursday, an aviation official said China has completed the main search and rescue work at the mountainside in southern China where the crash of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 happened, and a preliminary report is expected within 30 days of the disaster.
A final report into the crash will be completed and made public after the investigation is concluded, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) safety head Zhu Tao told reporters.
Citing the Standing Committee meeting, state media said all relevant parties investigating the crash are to gather experts to comprehensively analyse the aircraft's flight data and other evidence, and find out the cause and nature of the crash ""as soon as possible"". 
Under international rules, a 30-day report must be lodged with the U.N. aviation agency ICAO but it does not need to be public. A final report is due within a year of the crash, though sometimes it can take longer.
Zhu said authorities have done preliminary analyses of the crash, such as predicting the possible trajectory, position and impact force of the airplane when it hit the ground and reading data from air traffic control radar systems. 
CAAC investigators are also working to decode the data from both the black boxes, he added. 

Investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are set to travel to China to support the CAAC's investigation into mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years.
Over 40,000 pieces of aircraft wreckage and debris have been found and a majority of the pieces have been transported to a hangar, Zhu said.

The service, which aims to deliver grocery orders within 15 minutes using darkstores - dedicated warehouses that cater only to online clients - also operates in Israel and under a different brand in its primary market of Russia.
""Yango Deli is gradually suspending its ultra-fast grocery delivery operations in Paris,"" a Yango Deli spokesperson said. ""This was a pilot project with a small number of darkstores, and it has underperformed our internal targets.""

""The ultrafast delivery market in London is highly competitive and we see a considerable amount of interest in our business there, including from peers,"" the spokesperson said, adding that they couldn't give further details. 
A source familiar with the matter said discussions about closing the Paris operation, which launched last summer, have been underway since early February, with the decision focused on performance.
In London, where the service began in autumn last year, the source said Yango Deli was looking at several scenarios, one of which is a possible sale, for preserving what the team has achieved. 
The company operates five dark stores in London, with around 2,500 SKUs (stock keeping units). Customer retention is as high as 40%, which Yango Deli said is around 1.5 higher than the market average, according to its own estimates. 
The London unit is operated locally by Deli International Limited, a UK company.

Former Deputy CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan quit after the European Union imposed individual sanctions on him, something Yandex said it had been shocked and surprised to learn. 

The EU has criticised Yandex for warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine of unreliable information on the internet.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund managers maintained a cautious stance in March, increasing recommended bond holdings and cash reserves and suggesting reduced equities exposure, a Reuters poll found. 
The March 21-31 survey captured this defensive strategy many fund managers adopted after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out. The February survey was taken partly before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion but had still hinted at caution.
Recommended equity allocations were lowered to an average of 48.5% of the model global portfolio of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan, the lowest since end-2020. It was at 49.5% in February.
Equity markets have suffered from speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike interest rates more aggressively than previously thought. 
But the S&P 500 has staged a quick rebound, up 11% since March 8, its biggest 15-day percentage gain since June 2020 when the market was recovering from a steep sell-off near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the last month, asset managers increased their cash buffer to 4.5%, from 4.2%, the highest since November 2020.
""Our view is markets are close to pricing in our central scenario, where the Federal Reserve continues on its policy tightening cycle and in turn reduces inflation without causing a significant growth slowdown,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at abrdn.
""However, we view risks as skewed to the downside, with risks of a global recession within the next two years as 20%-30%.""
The spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year Treasuries flashed signs of a recession on Tuesday when it briefly inverted before turning positive again.
This inversion, when sustained, has previously been an accurate predictor of recession.

Not all fund managers were as cautious, especially given the increase in inflation to multi-year highs in nearly every major economy. 
""In an inflationary environment, equities are the only large and liquid asset class accessible to all that can generate significant real returns,"" said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co.

On how this may affect Tesla, Jonas writes:
""So where does Tesla fit in? Were not going to tell you that Tesla is a car company. Or a tech company. It's both. But it's also an energy company. And what we're seeing emerge over the course of this year is Tesla as a renewable energy on-shore infrastructure company. We believe Tesla's role in constructing the EV supply chain (upstream) and EV infrastructure (downstream) will become increasingly evident to the investment community over the next few weeks/months,"" Jonas said in a client note.
The analyst also reflected on the recent EV car sales numbers for February. Global sales rose 113% YoY with Tesla's market share at around 20%. This compares to a 12% market share last month and a 16% share YTD.
Currently, EV-Volumes suggests that Tesla has sold approx ~130k units through Feb with the last month of the quarter always the biggest push and contribution to units for the company in the Q. Below are forecasts that we've compiled from various sources. Note: last year Tesla delivered 184,877 units in 1Q so these forecasts imply around 72-78% YoY growth, Jonas added.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded 0.3% higher in Thursday’s premarket, shrugging off the company’s decision to delay the resumption of production at its Shanghai plant.
Production of Model 3 and Model Y cars at the company’s factory in Pudong district, east of the city's Huangpu River, was suspended Monday after the city’s authorities launched a two-stage lockdown to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases. The production was expected to resume Friday.
While the lockdown is set to be lifted Friday, a Reuters report said the company had yet to secure permits from the Shanghai government for its trucks to deliver assembled electric cars outside of Pudong to western parts of the city.
Shanghai is set to lock down areas west of the river from the early hours of Friday morning, the report said.
Shortage of workers could also be behind the company’s decision to put off the production, it said.",

LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP is preparing to battle a resurrected 5 billion pound ($6.6 billion) lawsuit in London's Court of Appeal next week, launched by around 200,000 Brazilians over a devastating dam failure in 2015.
The claim, one of the largest in English legal history, seeks to hold BHP to account for the disaster in English courts, emulating lawsuits brought in London against miner Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) and oil giant Shell (LON:RDSa) by villagers over alleged pollution in Zambia and oil spills in the Niger delta respectively. 
The Vedanta case has since settled.
The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, ranks as Brazil's worst environmental disaster. 
Nineteen were killed and villages obliterated as a torrent of more than 40 million cubic metres of mining waste swept into the Doce river and Atlantic Ocean over 650 km (400 miles) away.
Tom Goodhead, a managing partner at law firm PGMBM, which is bringing the claim on behalf of individuals - including indigenous people - businesses, churches, organisations and municipalities, told Reuters the team was ""very confident"".
About 120,000 claimants had been to walk-in centres in Brazil to update their details in recent months, he said, and another potential 100,000 new clients wanted to join.
BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value, has labelled the case pointless and wasteful, saying it duplicates proceedings in Brazil and the work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the company and its Brazilian partners to manage reparations and repairs.
The company says it is fully committed to ""doing the right thing"" and has paid nearly 9 billion reais ($1.89 billion) in compensation and direct financial aid to over 360,000 people and will have spent roughly 30 billion reais on reparation and compensation programmes by year-end.
Claimant lawyers argue that most clients have not brought proceedings in Brazil or sought compensation that excludes them from English proceedings and that Brazilian litigation is so lengthy it cannot provide full redress in a realistic timeframe.
But Goodhead conceded the case had been a rollercoaster.
It was blocked by the English High Court in 2020 and, one year later, by the Court of Appeal, which initially agreed it would be ""irredeemably unmanageable"".
But after a last-ditch oral hearing, Court of Appeal judges last July made a rare U-turn, stating the case had a ""real prospect of success"".
The five-day hearing, which begins on Monday, will help establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judgment is expected to be reserved - and the case could be appealed to the Supreme Court. 
Further trials will determine liability and quantify damages in the absence of any settlement.

Investing.com – Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stock traded 1.6% lower in premarket Thursday after the drug store chain posted disappointing second quarter revenue.
While overall sales rose 3% to almost $34 billion, decline in sales at its AllianceRx Walgreens business hurt the pharmacy retailer. Pharmacy sales fell 3.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by as much as 9.1 percentage points due to the AllianceRx Walgreens business.
The company completed the consolidation of AllianceRx Walgreens on December 31, it said in a release.
Overall sales benefited from an Omicron-led demand for COVID-19 vaccination and testing. A fresh spike in cases in January helped it administer about 11.8 million vaccines and 6.6 million tests in the second quarter.
U.S. retail comparable sales grew almost 15% and was the highest in over 20 years. Digital sales in its largest market were up 38%, boosted by same-day pick-up orders.
Adjusted net profit was about 26% higher at $1.4 billion in the second quarter ended February 28.
The company said the strategic review of the Boots business is progressing. It plans to sell the U.K.’s largest drugstore chain and, according to reports, has offers from Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners.
The company is maintaining its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of low-single-digit growth.

Oppenheimer lists 7 reasons why stocks are trading higher in recent days.
Still, the strategist sees little near-term upside for equities given that GS year-end price target for the S&P 500 is 4700.
While equities should provide a hedge against inflation over the medium term, and should outperform bonds, there remain risks to the downside and more volatility, particularly related to growth risks, Oppenheimer wrote in a client note.
He continues to see a fat & flat market where returns are lower than in the post-financial crisis era. Goldman Sachs assigns a 25-30% risk of recession in the US over the next year.
In the short term, Q2 macro data and the upcoming earning season will be particularly important data points for investors... Under a recession scenario, the S&P 500 could fall to 3,600, or 22% below today's level. Client conversations reveal a notable lack of conviction or enthusiasm for US equities at current valuation levels (P/E of 21x our 2022 EPS forecast of $221) given the slowing economy and rising rate environment.

SHANGHAI/Hong Kong (Reuters) - China's securities regulator said on Thursday both China and the United States have a willingness to solve their audit disputes, and the outcome depends on the wisdom of both parties.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said whether Chinese companies listed in the United States are delisted in the future depends on the progress and results of the audit and regulatory cooperation between the two countries.
This came as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday added five companies, including iQIYI Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), into the latest batch of stocks facing delisting risks from the United States.
Baidu and its streaming affiliate iQIYI said on Thursday they have been actively exploring possible solutions, and they will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations in both China and the United States.
The CSRC chairman Yi Huiman and his counterpart, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, have held three virtual meetings since last August to discuss a resolution for the legacy issues in coordinated audit of companies, said a statement issued on CSRC's website. 
China has also held multiple rounds of frank, professional and productive meetings with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the statement said. 
The process is smooth in general and will continue. Both sides are willing to solve the disagreements and problems. ""But the outcome will depend on wisdom and the original will of both sides,"" it said.
The statement came after Gensler pushed back speculation of an imminent deal to be reached between the two sides that would avoid any trading suspension of around 200 Chinese companies listed in the United States.
Gensler said U.S. law gives him little room for compromise, during an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, and said the result of the negotiations is ""up to the Chinese authorities"".
The long-running Sino-U.S. audit stand-off has put hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in Chinese companies at stake.
Washington is demanding complete access to the audit papers for U.S.-listed Chinese companies but Beijing bars foreign inspection of local accounting firms’ work. 
In December, the U.S. SEC finalised rules to delist Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), and said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without naming them.
By Thursday, 11 U.S. listed Chinese companies had been identified by the U.S. regulator as carrying risks under the HFCAA.

""The U.S. side has made a case that it is treating everybody equally with its Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. And it is becoming increasingly clear that China is unlikely to ask for an exception,"" said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co.

To further frame the conservatism in terms of new vs. expansion business, FY2023 ARR guidance excluding headwinds would imply $0 ARR contribution from new customers and DBNRR declining from 145% to ~134% ""despite maintaining a best-in-class range vs. 153% exiting FY2020. We reiterate our thesis that the market opportunity in terms of global automatable wages is both sizable and largely untapped, we believe that UiPath, with the only purpose-built, end-to-end hyperautomation platform, is leading the paradigm shift toward the fully-automated enterprise,"" Winslow said in a client note.
Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin sees many moving parts in the PATH story after EPS.
PATH posted a broadly solid 4Q beating Street, but FY23 outlook disappoints. ""While we understand this is not a story that needed added complexity, the sharp initial stock reaction (-14% AH) is overdone, in our view, when taking into account a host of uncontrollable impacts (Russia/FX) and an otherwise broadly positive pipeline and competitive positioning views,"" Bergin said in a memo to clients.

Investing.com – Shares of energy companies were in the red in Thursday’s trade amid reports that the U.S. plans a release of up to 180 million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the largest in the near-50-year history of the SPR.
Integrated energy majors, as well as standalone explorers and refiners, were all trading lower in Europe and in premarket in the U.S.
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) fell the most, both down 3%, followed by  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), all of whom fell 2.5% each.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) were both down 1.5% while ADRs of BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (NYSE:SHEL) traded 1.6% and 1.3% weaker, respectively.
The latest amount of U.S. oil release being considered is equivalent to about two days of global demand and will mark the third time the world’s biggest energy consumer has tapped its strategic reserves in the past six months.
While it is not clear if other friendly countries will join the U.S. in this exercise, the news sent the oil prices crashing.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for May delivery fell 6% while Brent Brent Oil Futures June futures traded 5.2% weaker.
Crude oil prices scaled 14-year highs earlier this month amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Those prices are hurting many European economies, many of which now face decades-high inflation.
Russia is among the top 3 oil producers and accounts for about 14% of the world's total supply, according to Reuters.
Sanctions and reluctance to purchase Russian oil could remove about 3 million barrels per day of Russian oil from the market, starting in April, the IEA has said. Russia exports 4 million bpd to 5 million bpd.
The outcome of Friday’s meeting of OPEC+ will be eyed to see if the oil cartel pays heed to U.S.’ request for a quicker increase in output."

TURIN (Reuters) -A Stellantis van plant in Russia will have to close shortly as it is running out of parts, the company's chief executive Carlos Tavares said on Thursday.
The world's fourth largest carmaker has previously said it had suspended all exports and imports of vehicles with Russia, where it operates a van-making plant in the city of Kaluga, in partnership with Mitsubishi. 
Production in Kaluga remains for the local market at the moment, following last month's Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking at a news conference, Tavares did not say whether the company was considering a writedown of the value of Kaluga or feared it could be seized by Moscow if operations halted.
Stellantis earlier this month presented its first business plan, just over a year after it was formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA.
Tavares said the group's focus was on executing the plan and it was not looking at major M&A deals.
""We always look at what is in the market, but don't need M&A, this is very clear,"" he said.
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Addressing a supply crisis that has hurt the car industry, Tavares said Stellantis expected to be able to source computer chips from Europe and the United States within 3-4 years.
""We will have to find another way to adapt the supply chain, we have several initiatives to create local sourcing of semiconductors,"" added Tavares, the head of a company whose brands include Jeep, Maserati, Citroen and Opel. 
Tavares said the technology underpinning the shift to electric mobility was not yet finalised, making it hard for automakers to plan and secure future supplies of raw materials.

""We're moving down the supply chain, we have sealed a deal to secure lithium for instance, but we need to do more,"" he said. ""What the ending point is for the chemistry of battery cells is not yet clear. When technology is rather definitive, we'll be able to lock raw material supply through investments, deals, M&A.""
Tavares said carmakers needed to cut the costs of electric vehicles over the next 4-5 years and called on governments to help with the effort.

(Reuters) - As governments prepare to live with COVID-19, some are questioning how much to rely on drugmakers to adapt vaccines to ward off future virus variants amid signs of tension between companies and regulators over the best approach, according to several sources familiar with the matter.
Some vaccine experts say government agencies should fund and help develop a new generation of COVID shots, and seek innovation from smaller developers, as they did to identify current vaccines.
""We have established a research infrastructure that could do this relatively reasonably rapidly if we primed the pump and created the same kind of plan for second-generation vaccines as we did for the first-generation vaccines,"" Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist who is overseeing U.S. government-backed COVID vaccine trials, told Reuters.
BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), who developed the western world's most widely used COVID vaccine, recently clashed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) over the best strategy for developing a new vaccine against the Omicron variant, and whatever may follow, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
An EMA spokesperson said the agency, along with other regulators, are encouraging companies to explore vaccines that target multiple variants.
In January, BioNTech and Pfizer began testing a vaccine designed to target Omicron alone, believing the best approach is to tackle one major new variant at a time.
They had said a modified vaccine may not be necessary even after emergence of the highly-mutated Omicron late last year led to a record surge in infections.
EMA regulators pressed the drugmakers to give equal priority to a vaccine targeting multiple variants, figuring that would offer broader protection against future mutations, the sources said. One of the sources said EMA would not signal whether the current vaccine trials will be enough to warrant approval even if the companies demonstrate safety and immune response. 
On Wednesday, BioNTech said the companies would broaden their trial to test a shot targeting Omicron and the original version of the coronavirus.
BioNTech said it decided to test a combination shot to scientifically validate decisions on the best vaccine strategy for the near future.
A BioNTech spokesperson declined to comment on the company's discussions with EMA. A Pfizer spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which has also enjoyed great success with its COVID vaccine, is testing a shot that targets Omicron and the original coronavirus, aiming to have it ready in the fall. 
""We believe this may lead to the best breadth in protection,"" top Moderna scientist Jacqueline Miller said at a company event this month.
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is also working with German biotech CureVac on a vaccine that targets multiple coronavirus variants.
'WE NEED TO DO BETTER'
European and U.S. public health officials are pushing for better tools to fight COVID. Current vaccines are very effective against severe disease and death, but no longer against transmission, and immunity levels tend to wane within months.
Some health officials question whether companies that have reaped tens of billions of dollars from first-generation COVID shots and stand to earn billions more from repeated boosters are willing to spend the money to find vaccines offering much broader and longer-lasting protection, which could take years.
Pfizer and BioNTech say their decisions are led by scientific findings.
Any new and innovative approach may come from smaller companies that will need funding for early development work, said Corey, from Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.
""We need to do better, and we need to fund that,"" Corey said, adding that a new generation of COVID vaccines could be supported by about $2 billion in funding. The European Union made a massive bet on future Pfizer/ BioNTech shots in a deal worth up to 35 billion euros ($39.04 billion). That agreement requires the drugmakers to revise their shots to deal with new variants.
EU member states have also expressed interest in shots targeting multiple variants. ""The message they've sent to the companies is 'give us more options,'"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said. The international Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which helped fund early research into some existing vaccines, has $200 million available for next-generation vaccine research. It has awarded small grants to manufacturers including the UK's DIOSynVax and MigVax of Israel.
Among the major Western COVID vaccine makers, Pfizer and BioNTech appear furthest along in redesigning their shot.
In late January, they launched a clinical trial testing immune responses to a vaccine targeting Omicron in unvaccinated people, and as a booster in those fully vaccinated. Results are expected in April.
BioNTech has argued that laboratory analyses by other researchers showed that exposure to Omicron in previously vaccinated people leads to a broad immune response against major prior coronavirus variants, the sources said.

Lab tests of a BioNTech/Pfizer shot targeting the earlier Alpha and Delta variants yielded an immune response inferior to what would be expected from a single-variant vaccine, they added.
A combination vaccine could raise other difficulties, including exacerbating temporary side effects seen with current shots, GSK said. Cutting the dose to avoid that could jeopardize efficacy, but GSK said it was working on that.

Investing.com – H & M (ST:HMb) stock plunged 10% in Stockholm trading Thursday after the fashion retailer reported earnings that were way off expectations for the first quarter.
At one point, the stock traded at a two-year low. The results were weighed down by multiple headwinds including the Russia-Ukraine war, China lockdowns and investments in technology and the supply chain.
In the quarter through February, while the group swung to a pretax profit of 282 million crowns ($30 million) from a loss of 1.39 billion a year earlier, it was well short of the 1.05 billion crown profit analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast.
“Sales and profits for the quarter were impacted by the negative effects of the pandemic in many of the group's major markets,"" H&M said in a statement, citing supply chain disruptions and delays, and a new wave of Covid-19 in some markets.
The retailer has paused sales in Russia, its sixth-biggest market, accounting for about 4% of total revenue. H&M had 227 stores closed as of Wednesday, most of them in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Excluding those three countries, revenue rose 11% in March, the news wire said.
The company has also faced the brunt of Covid-related lockdowns in China, one of its biggest markets. China follows a zero-Covid policy and the strict rules there are hurting retailers badly. Some of the retailers have also suffered due to a rising sentiment against foreign labels in the world’s second largest economy.
In the quarter, sales rose 23% year-on-year to 49.16 billion Swedish crowns, but were still down 11% compared to the same period two years ago.
H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), said sales during March 1-28, were up just 6% in local currencies.

BERLIN (Reuters) - As Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) kicks off production at its new German plant this month, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is weeks away from finalising plans for a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) electric vehicle (EV) factory that it hopes will bring it up to speed with its U.S. rival.
Tesla says it can already churn out a Model Y in 10 hours at its new Giga Berlin-Brandenburg factory in Gruenheide near the German capital, whereas it can take Volkswagen three times as long to make its ID.3 electric car.
The German auto giant now aims to slash production times with its ""Trinity"" EV plant, which should be up and running in 2026, by using techniques such as large die casting and cutting the number of components in its cars by several hundred.
""Our goal is clear: we want to set the standard with our production,"" Volkswagen brand production chief Christian Vollmer told Reuters in an interview. ""If we can get to 10 hours, we have achieved something big.""
The carmaker has been improving productivity at a rate of about 5% a year but must take bigger leaps to keep its upper hand in the European market, Vollmer said, without providing a new percentage target.
Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest carmaker behind Japan's Toyota with a stable of brands from Skoda, Seat and VW to Audi, Porsche and Bentley has a 25% share of the European EV market, ahead of Tesla on 13%. 
But the pressure on German carmakers to both master and ramp up EV production has been intensified by Tesla's presence in the country and Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess has warned Germans must speed up to avoid getting beaten on their own turf.
'IGNITED THE DRIVE'
Volkswagen's goals align with a wider trend in the industry of simplifying product ranges and streamlining production as carmakers scramble to find the cash to fund the electric transition - and keep up with rivals like Tesla that don't have to juggle making EVs as well as cars with combustion engines.
""Tesla really ignited the drive for reducing part counts and making simpler products,"" Evan Horetsky, a partner at McKinsey who was formerly in charge of engineering at Tesla's new Brandenburg plant, said. ""Legacy manufacturers have a more difficult time because they have to maintain current orders.""
A Tesla spokesperson said one of the reasons it can produce its Model Y vehicles in Germany within a 10-hour time frame is because it is uses two giant casting presses, or giga-presses, applying 6,000 tonnes of pressure to make the rear of the car.
Its Gruenheide press shop can produce 17 components in under six minutes. With six more giga-presses on the way, Tesla will soon be making the front of the car with the giga-press too.
""That's why we're so fast,"" the spokesperson said.
The giga-casting technique that VW plans to adopt was popularised by Tesla as an alternative to the more labour-intensive method of assembling multiple stamped metal panels with crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash.
German luxury carmaker BMW has rejected large castings in the past on the grounds that the higher costs of repair outweigh the lower manufacturing costs. 
But advocates say automated driving technology will reduce the frequency of accidents: ""Tesla is designing a vehicle that most likely won't be in a severe crash,"" Cory Steuben, president of manufacturing consulting firm Munro & Associates, said.
'HUMAN-ROBOT COOPERATION'
While VW can produce certain models such as the Tiguan or Polo in 18 and 14 hours in Germany and Spain respectively, its electric ID.3 - made in a factory juggling six models from three Volkswagen brands - still takes 30 hours to put together.
At the Trinity plant, multiple work steps will be condensed into one through automation, shrinking the size of the body shop and reducing the number of jobs requiring uncomfortable physical labour, Vollmer said, dubbing it an expansion of ""human-robot cooperation"".
Volkswagen does not plan to have giga-presses at the new plant in Wolfsburg and will instead use the equipment at its factory in Kassel about 160 km (100 miles) away and transport the products by train.
U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicts that Tesla's Gruenheide factory will produce about 54,000 cars in 2022, 280,000 in 2023 and then 500,000 by 2025. 
Volkswagen, which delivered some 452,000 battery-electric vehicles globally last year, has not yet set an output target for Trinity, which will use its Scalable Systems Platform. 
It aims to build 40 million vehicles worldwide on the new platform - which combines multiple internal combustion engine and electric platforms into one – with half of its global output all-electric by 2030.
Tesla, which produced 936,000 cars last year, has said it aims to put 20 million on the road a year by the end of the decade, or roughly double the current annual production of Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker now.
Still, Tesla can expect numerous challenges as it expands in Germany, from securing more water supplies to environmental groups angry about light pollution and congestion near the plant to unions worried about a management-heavy works council and wages being driven down by workers coming in from elsewhere. 

""Starting production is nice, but volume production is the hard part,"" Musk told a cheering audience at a festival at the plant site in October 2021. ""It will take longer to reach volume production than it took to build the factory.""

521,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 05:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The rebound in equities may not have much further to go, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UBS Global Wealth Management warned on Thursday, as markets in Europe and the U.S. are set to end their first month in the green for this year.
“To be clear, we see little upside now in the shorter term,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS GWM, concurred, saying “our base case now is for only modest upside for stocks.” 
Both Goldman and UBS GWM have a year-end target of 4,700 index points for the S&P 500, less than 2% higher from current levels for the U.S. benchmark. They also both see the gauge dropping by around 22% to 3,600 index points in a downside scenario. 
While developed markets have recouped the losses seen after Russia invaded Ukraine, they are still below their January records. The lackluster performance follows a strong rally on the back of a post-pandemic economic rebound that saw major indexes climb to successive highs. 
UBS GWM said its cautious view “partly reflects risks to corporate profits,” while Goldman’s team said “client conversations reveal a notable lack of conviction or enthusiasm for U.S. equities at current valuation levels,” citing a “slowing economy and rising rate environment.” 
Generali Investments echoed the pessimism: “We see little value in chasing the March equity market rebound at this level of valuation,” the firm said in its quarterly outlook. “The sharp fall in equity volatility relative to bond volatility is not sustainable.”
Still, while the rally may be running out of steam, both Goldman and UBS GWM see opportunities for investors, with the latter recommending a focus on energy, food, data, and climate -- areas which are set to benefit from a renewed focus on security and stability in the aftermath of the war.
For Goldman’s team, instead of playing specific styles such as growth versus value stocks, investors must look for individual companies “that can innovate, disrupt, enable and adapt” and focus on margins.

LONDON (Reuters) - A new global standard setter for company sustainability reporting set out its first draft guidelines on Thursday, entering a crowded field as trillions of dollars pour into investments marketed as ""green.""
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published two draft standards for public consultation until July 29 ahead of formal adoption by the end of the year.
The move is backed by world leaders, top investors and regulators, who want a more rigorous international approach to corporate sustainability disclosures which replaces a patchwork of standards. There are also growing calls to combat the risk of greenwashing, or exaggerated sustainability claims by companies.
The ISSB has proposed two new standards, which countries will decide whether to make mandatory.
The first sets out general sustainability related financial disclosures.
The second details specific climate-related disclosure requirements covering ""Scope 1-3,"" meaning data on the company's direct emissions, indirect emissions from purchased energy, and indirect emissions from a company's value chain, such as raw material suppliers.
Critics have argued the ISSB is being less ambitious the European Union, whose rules also require disclosures on a company's own impact on the environment, known as double materiality.
ISSB Vice Chair Sue Lloyd said the ISSB standards seek to meet the needs of investors who want to know the impact of sustainability factors on a company's enterprise value, meaning the value of its shares and net debt.
The ISSB draft standards ultimately capture the impact of a company on the environment given that polluting results in fines and potential customer boycotts which affect profitability, Lloyd said.
""When a company is doing things to people, the planet, the environment which are having impacts, much of that will affect its enterprise value,"" Lloyd said.
The ISSB can work in tandem with the EU norms, she said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also proposed disclosure rules for listed companies which are very similar to the draft ISSB standards, Lloyd said.
""We will be working with the SEC and the EU to try to bring our proposals even closer together,"" Lloyd said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.
Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and imposed billions of euros in fines.
The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks' manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.
The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said.
""I'm announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,"" Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.
""It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly 'fit for the digital age',"" she said. 

Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.
Such procedural changes would relate to requests for information sent to companies, dawn raids, oral hearings where companies seek to defend their cases and the 10% cap on fines levied for breach of rules or non-compliance.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday at the end of a turbulent month, with investors carefully watching developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict as well as volatile energy prices. 
By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%.
The lack of a substantial breakthrough in talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war triggered by the Russian invasion in late February resulted in weakness in Europe Wednesday.
The tone has since improved, with Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia saying Thursday that officials from Russia and Ukraine are set to resume talks via video conference on Friday.
He added that the hope was to have enough agreed on paper in another week to be able to move toward a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 
European stocks have suffered a very difficult quarter, with the DAX down over 8% year-to-date and both the CAC 40 and the broad-based Stoxx 600 nearly 6% lower, as the war in Ukraine put upward pressure on commodity prices, increasing stagflation fears.
Some of those concerns lessened Thursday, after oil prices slumped following reports that the U.S. is considering a massive release of crude from emergency reserves over several months in order to tackle prices which have climbed above $100 a barrel in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Biden administration could make the announcement later Thursday, the reports said, with the total release from the country’s strategic petroleum reserve potentially as much as 180 million barrels.
The International Energy Agency has also called an emergency ministerial meeting for Friday, amid speculation the Paris-based organization will attempt to coordinate a global release by other countries.
This news has overshadowed a meeting, scheduled for later in the session, of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which is expected to stick to an existing deal of increasing oil production by around 400,000 barrels per day through May.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.4% lower at $103.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3.5% to $107.53. 
Back in Europe, fourth quarter U.K. gross domestic product rose by 1.3% on the quarter, up 6.6% on the year, more than expected, while German retail sales rose 0.3% on the month in February. 
French consumer prices rose 4.5% from a year ago in March, the most since the data series began in 1997. This sets the scene for Friday’s Eurozone CPI release, which is expected to soar to 6.6%, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to act.

Whether you are a macro-guru or an astute stock picker, this is a quarter that most investors would like to forget. 
Most consensus trades coming into 2022 including long value stocks, yield curve steepeners and buying euros have been crushed. Not only world stocks have witnessed the most gut-wrenching volatility in years, the first three months of the year has fuelled the strongest commodities rally since World War I and the fastest rise in global interest rates in decades. 
But as the dust settles on the first quarter, stock markets are slowly finding their feet. U.S. stocks are back to within 5% of the all-time high struck on January 4.
A global stock index will end the quarter down around 4%, its worst performance since the pandemic crash two years ago but well above the 14% year-to-date drop only two weeks ago. 
Bond and currencies have fared worse. A Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) U.S. Treasuries index is on track for its worst quarterly performance in 25 years while the Japanese yen has declined a whopping 6% in the last three months, a speed of decline only rivaled by the British pound after the Brexit referendum vote. Volatility has soared across asset classes.
But taking the 30,000 feet view above the quarterly market performance, some longer term trends are emerging. Russia's invasion of Ukraine means global supply chains will remain under pressure for the forseeable future and global policymakers will struggle to control rampant inflation without choking growth.
For now, markets are taking the optimistic view. U.S. and European stock futures are higher and oil prices lower on signs the Biden administration is considering a massive release of crude oil from U.S. reserves to combat inflation.
However, a slide in Chinese stocks as output data reflect the damage of renewed lockdowns in technology and factory hubs weighed on Asian markets. Treasuries added to price gains, while a portion of the curve has pulled out of a brief inversion that raised concerns about an impending recession.

(Reuters) - The value of global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity took a 29% hit in the first quarter of 2022 as market volatility fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed the brakes on last year's breakneck pace of dealmaking.
Overall deal volumes fell to $1.01 trillion from $1.43 trillion in the first quarter of 2021, according to Dealogic data, dragged down by a similar 29% drop in crossborder transactions, as geopolitical tensions forced large companies across borders to take a pause and postpone their pursuit of large strategic buyouts.
""The rising cost of energy, the dislocation of supply chains and higher inflation are key factors impacting both corporate and private equity clients today,"" said Dwayne Lysaght, co-head of EMEA M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
North America accounted for more than half of first quarter deal activity, even though volumes fell 28%, while Asia Pacific activity dropped 33% to $184.2 billion.
European volumes were down 25% to $227.67 billion.
Dealmakers said first quarter activity suffered from sky-high comparisons to last year's record-breaking volumes which were hard to replicate.
""While execution has become a bit harder due to the increased volatility and macro concerns, that hasn't stopped new activity,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Major deals during the quarter included Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $75 billion and European telecom firms Orange and MasMovil combination of their Spanish businesses through a 19.6 billion euros ($21.87 billion) joint venture.
Dealmakers said stock market volatility made it tougher for the world's largest companies to use the might of their market capitalization to buy up smaller rivals.
""In this moment of dislocation, the volatility has greatly affected the use of stock,"" said Cary Kochman, co-head of global M&A at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). ""This is not a frenzied market any longer.""
But for all its challenges the overall environment for buyouts remains robust.
""We're taking a glass half-full approach - while we're seeing volumes down, it still has a pace that looks very similar to 2016 through 2019,"" said Kevin Brunner, co-head of global M&A at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The number of transactions worth more than $10 billion was up to 13 from 12 in the same quarter of last year, signaling that companies and private equity firms did not shy away from pursuing larger deals, despite the broader market turmoil.
With debt still relatively cheap compared to historical levels, private equity buyouts remained at healthy levels, accounting for $204.47 billion of total volumes.
""You're going to see private equity M&A continue to make up a larger portion of the M&A activity overall as the dry powder to deploy remains at record levels,"" said Jim Langston, co-head of U.S. M&A at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.
Direct lenders stepped in aggressively during the first quarter to help finance large leverage buyouts as some traditional lenders shied away from assuming higher leverage risk due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
""There is a lot of focus on public-to-private transactions but as we learnt in the last 24 months this type of deals pose a higher execution risk and not all of them will go through. However, while more expensive, the financing to take companies off the public markets is still available,"" said Simona Maellare, global co-head of UBS' Alternative Capital Group.
HEALTHCARE SLUMP
Dealmaking in the technology sector continued to lead the way, even though overall volumes were lower compared to last year.
Real estate was one of the few sectors where dealmaking jumped significantly, with volumes up 47%, as employees across the world returned to working from offices, thus making commercial property more appealing to buyers.
Healthcare activity, which typically accounts for a big share of deals, slumped by more than half, as large pharma companies adopted a more cautious strategic approach due to the market volatility caused by the geopolitical tensions.
While a number of blue-chip companies rushed to exit Russia and shied away from using their cash piles for large buyouts, activist investors stepped up the pressure on boards to pursue sale processes or break-ups to unlock more value for investors at a time when public market valuations are at lower levels.
""Companies across many industries believe that their business model needs to change dramatically in the foreseeable future, mostly because of the impact of technology but also for several other sector-specific reasons,"" said Pier Luigi Colizzi,  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' head of investment banking for continental Europe and co-head of EMEA M&A.
Going forward dealmakers said boards will remain cautious when pursuing large transformational deals and will need to factor in their companies' exposure to gas and commodities prices.
They expect deal activity to pick up again once geopolitical tensions are resolved, although deals are likely to be smaller in size.

""This is just a moment where I predict that you won't see an outbreak of $75 billion plus transactions,"" said Citi's Kochman.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers face potential multi-billion dollar claims for cyber attacks related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite policy wording designed to get them off the hook for war, industry sources say.
Following the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine and Western sanctions against Moscow, the U.S. government said last week it had seen ""preparatory"" Russian hacking activity aimed at numerous U.S. companies, though it said it had ""no certainty"" such an attack would occur.
Western financial regulators have already warned banks of the risks of cyber attacks though none have been confirmed so far. 
European and U.S. insurers, already facing mounting losses in the past year, have been driving up premiums due to the increased coverage cost and prevalence of so-called ransomware attacks.
If Russia carries out a large cyber attack which spills over into several countries, it could lead to claims totalling $20 billion or more, similar to insurance claims from a large U.S. hurricane, the industry sources said on condition of anonymity.
This comes as insurers also face losses related to the conflict in other business sectors such as aviation, which is seen as particularly exposed to the impact of what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine.
Lloyd's of London, one of the world's biggest players in cyber and other commercial insurance policies, said last week that it faced ""major"" claims from the invasion.. 
Cyber insurance - whose market ratings agency Fitch says totalled over $2.7 billion in 2020 in the United States alone - covers a business for the repair of hacked networks, business interruption losses and also cyber ransom payments. 
Such policies do not cover war, or attacks by so-called ""state-sponsored actors"". 
It is often hard, however, to identify the perpetrator of a cyber attack.
""Defining what is state-sponsored is quite challenging,"" Lloyd's of London chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters last week. ""These policies get tested by new events and we need to work through the wording...and make sure our customers understand where they are covered and where they aren't.""
AMBIGUITIES
Even if insurers can prove a cyber attack was a result of the conflict in Ukraine, war exclusions may not be enough to protect them.
Cyber insurers have become more aware of ambiguities in their insurance in recent years, but some are slower to adapt than others.
Policy wordings vary from insurer to insurer, and are open to interpretation, said Marcos Alvarez, head of insurance at ratings agency DBRS Morningstar. 
This is expected to lead to disagreements between insurers and policyholders about whether or not there is coverage, similar to business interruption insurance cases which have gone to court across the world since the outbreak of COVID-19.
A particular grey area is over cyber terror attacks, which are generally covered by insurance.
Terror is typically more narrowly defined than war, but Westlaw, a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) company, said in a note last week that ""cyber terrorism"" is sometimes defined ""quite broadly to include any attack against a computer system with the 'intent to cause harm' in furtherance of 'social, ideological, religious, economic or political objectives'"".
Policyholders could end up being covered ""quite expansively"" by cyber or cyber terrorism policies, said Yosha DeLong, global head of cyber at insurer Mosaic.
""Any time there's ambiguous wording on a policy, it's to the client's advantage, not the insurer's.""
There is also a risk from ""silent cyber"", in which businesses have other policies which do not specifically exclude cyber attacks, and may look to claim on those.
A New Jersey court ruled in January in favour of Merck & Co over a $1.4 billion insurance claim for the 2017 NotPetya cyber attack, which the White House blamed on Russia.
To reduce their overall risk, some cyber insurers are considering broad exclusions for Russia and Ukraine, said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Schnur, U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader at broker Marsh.
CHANGING TACTICS
Military losses could lead to a different approach by Russia, including cyber attacks, analysts at Eurasia said.
Some Russian units suffering heavy losses had been forced to return home and to neighbouring Belarus, British military intelligence said this week, after Russia promised to scale down military operations around Kyiv.
Cyber attacks have taken place on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, government services, banks and telecoms, analytics firm CyberCube said in a report earlier this month.
Russian government institutions and businesses are also being targeted by cyber attackers, CyberCube said, adding that some attacks have spilled over into Belarus, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.
The invasion is also adding to pressure on cyber insurance premiums, with rates rising sharply due to ransomeware attacks where hackers encrypt victims' data and demand a ransom to release it.
Cyber security firm Coveware likened the 90%-plus profit margin from ransomware attacks last year to the gains Colombian cocaine cartels made in 1992.
Cyber insurance rates rose by 130% in the United States and by 92% in Britain in the fourth quarter, according to Marsh.
Industry sources see similar rate rises this year.
Rate rises already vary wildly, one consultant said, giving an example of a small business in Britain which had seen its annual cyber insurance premium leap to 450,000 pounds ($590,940.00) from 80,000 pounds.

""Everyone's prices have gone up, now they will go up even more,"" the consultant said. ""Ukraine and Russia are just putting more stress on premiums and availability.”

Vanke reported a net profit of 22.5 billion yuan ($3.54 billion) in 2021, down from 41.5 billion yuan in the year-ago period, dented by lower gross profit margins in the development business, a drop in investment income and the provision for asset impairment losses.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Thursday at the end of a turbulent month, with investors carefully watching developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict as well as volatile energy prices. 
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
European stock markets largely closed lower Wednesday on disappointment of the lack of a substantial breakthrough in talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war triggered by the Russian invasion in late February.
Ukrainian forces are now preparing for new attacks in the east of the country as Moscow builds up its troops there after suffering setbacks near the capital Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.
Additionally, the United States is looking to up the economic pressure on Moscow, by expanding sanctions on Russia in the coming days, White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said late Wednesday.
European stocks have suffered a very difficult quarter, with the DAX down over 8% year to date and both the CAC 40 and the broad-based Stoxx 600 down nearly 6%, as the war in Ukraine put upward pressure on commodity prices, increasing stagflation fears.

536,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder and Moscow's threats to cut Europe's gas supply seems to be upping the ante further.
Would a default really make any difference at this stage though, and what would it entail? 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COUNTRY DEFAULTS? 
If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default.
Such an event would have been unthinkable before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", and subsequent sanctions that have frozen hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its reserves.
Russia is already locked out of the international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, but a default would mean it couldn't regain access until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.
Defaults in other countries such as Argentina have seen aggressive creditors go after physical assets such as a navy vessel and the country's presidential aircraft. Russia's state-owned energy giants own some of Europe's key gas infrastructure so it would raise plenty of questions.
It could also create a host of headaches if countries or companies that would normally trade with Russia have self-imposed rules that prohibit transacting with an entity in default.
If sanctions are removed at some point in the future Russia's reputation in financial markets would still be tarnished. That would depress Russia's credit ratings and push up the borrowing rates paid by the Russian government and companies. 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?
By continuing to make its debt payments this month, Russia so far has swerved its first default of any kind since a 1998 financial crisis, and its first on the international market debt since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution when the new government refused to recognise Tsar-era borrowings. 
This week Moscow has upped the stakes by offering to make a $2 billion bond payment due next week - its biggest of the year - in roubles rather than the intended dollars.
As long as Russia doesn't force anyone who doesn't want roubles to take them, it wouldn't usually count as a default, but it is walking a tightrope. That the main rating agencies have had to withdraw their Russia ratings, and therefore won't call a default whatever happens, complicates things.
THE NEXT TEST
Another $447 million international bond payment is due on Thursday, but even if Russia remains willing to pay complications are about to stack up.
Western sanctions ban transactions with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund, although the temporary general license 9A https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_gl9a.pdf issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on March 2 makes an exception for the purposes of ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity.""
That license expires on May 25, however, after which Russia will have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.
Analysts say after next Monday's $2 billion payment, the next crucial test will come on May 27 - the first payment due after the current OFAC licence expires.
Russia could be forced to make the payment in roubles, and into bank accounts in Russia, which the finance ministry has said would be its fallback option.

That would constitute a default, however, as the legal terms of that bond state it must be paid back in dollars.
Russia has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -GoTo Group, Indonesia's biggest tech firm, said it plans to raise $1.1 billion in an initial public offering (IPO), pricing the deal in the top half of its indicative range and making it one of Asia's biggest IPOs so far this year.
GoTo, formed last year by the merger of ride-hailing-to-payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia, surprised some investors and analysts when it launched its IPO process earlier this month, braving turbulence in global equity markets.
""We are pleased with the investor response, which has remained resilient, despite global macro and market volatility,"" Andre Soelistyo, GoTo Group's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.
GoTo's offering attracted strong institutional demand in the book-building process despite a weak investor appetite for tech stocks that has battered shares of the company's Southeast Asian peers, such as Sea Ltd and Grab Holdings.
GoTo is backed by the likes of SoftBank Group Corp,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.
It priced its IPO at 338 rupiah per share, representing a projected market value of about $28 billion, which would make it the country's fourth most valuable listed company.
Reuters reported last week that GoTo had received enough investor orders for its IPO to raise at least $1.1 billion, within its targeted price band. [L2N2VS03I]
The firm had set an indicative price range of 316 rupiah to 346 rupiah per share.

It is selling 46.7 billion Series A shares, comprising newly issued and treasury shares, thereby raising 15.8 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion) in total. The IPO will be open from April 1-7 and the listing will take place on April 11 with the stock code GOTO.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Freshly emboldened retail investors have continued piling into risky assets, supporting a bounce that has buoyed everything from so-called meme stocks to cryptocurrencies despite economic worries and geopolitical uncertainty. 
Weeks-long rallies in some of the market's most speculative names have far outpaced a broader rebound in the S&P 500, despite a selloff on Wednesday that saw the benchmark index shed 0.6% and declines in many of the more comparatively risky assets that have rallied in recent weeks.
Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), two companies most closely identified with the meme stock mania that drove astronomical stock price moves in 2021, have nearly doubled in price over the last two weeks after worries over tighter monetary policy and the war in Ukraine slammed stocks earlier this year.
Other moves include a 26% rally in Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation, an ETF replete with high growth names, a 19% jump in cryptocurrency bitcoin and a 36% rise in electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The S&P 500 is on track to finish the quarter with a 3.4% loss, after swooning as much as 12.5% earlier in the year.
While the rebound has been pinned on everything from quarter-end rebalancing to relief that the Federal Reserve is finally training its sights on inflation, retail investors have definitely played a significant part, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasting in a recent note that households will continue to deploy some of their $15 trillion in cash holdings into the equity market.
Retail traders' net purchases of stocks and ETFs totaled $5 billion this past week, compared with a 1-year average of $3.4 billion, JP Morgan strategist Peng Cheng said in a note on Wednesday.
""Retail is seeing that speculative trading still works and is still trying to catch the high-flyers of the day,"" said Dan Pipitone, chief executive of retail brokerage TradeZero.
For AMC, Gamestop and other stocks popular with individual investors, call options, typically employed to express a bullish view on stock prices, have drawn strong activity in recent weeks.
For example, there are 1.8 AMC call options open for every open put contract on the stock, about the most upbeat this number has been since May 2021, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.

AMC was one of the most bought speculative stocks in the last couple of days, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said in a report Wednesday, noting that in the past strong flows into AMC have heralded a broader rally in other less well-known names.
""The average retail investor portfolio has now clawed back a good portion of the (year-on-year) losses, offering some fresh buffer to punt on meme stocks,"" Vanda’s analysts wrote.
RJ Assaly, head of business development at artificial-intelligence-driven market screening platform Toggle, said his models – based on an analysis of AMC's past trading patterns - had predicted the stock rising as high as $30, a level it touched Tuesday. 
Past instances of such bullish signals, in December 2020 and May 2021, saw the stock overshoot its predicted price by $15 to $30 dollars, he said.
Of course, the volatility associated with meme stocks and many other recent market leaders can be a two-edged sword, particularly for investors who bought them when speculative fervor ran high. GameStop and AMC are still down 52% and 59% from their closing highs from last year, respectively. Bitcoin is off 30% while ARK is down 56%.
So far, that hasn’t stopped some individual investors from betting these speculative names will continue to rise.

Retail traders have been paring buying in the large cap names that were more popular earlier in the year and shifting into more speculative stocks as ""younger and more aggressive investors"" try to recoup year-to-date losses, Vanda’s analysts said.
""This investor base is now purchasing mainly speculative meme stocks, call options, and cryptocurrencies,"" they wrote.

Japan-based Kioxia Holdings Corp — a key supplier of flash memory chips to Apple — had reported a contamination last month at two of its manufacturing facilities, which the company said will result in reduced production. 
Apple is now testing sample NAND flash memory chips by Chinese semiconductor company Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, the report said, adding that the iPhone maker has been discussing the tie-up for months.
Yangtze declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment on the report.

Earlier this month, another key Apple supplier Foxconn had to suspend its Shenzhen operations due to a spike in COVID-19 cases. 
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has also disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning. U.S. counterparts and oil both dropped sharply over a potential massive release of U.S. strategic oil.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.17% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.6%. The manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 49.5, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4, in March 2022. The Caixin manufacturing PMI is due on Friday, and the People’s Bank of China vowed to boost confidence and provide more effective support to the economy.
Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler also tamped down speculation that a deal to keep about 200 Chinese stocks from losing their U.S. listings is in the works.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.79%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.13%, while South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.51%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.35%.
Reports that the U.S. is preparing a plan to release roughly a million barrels of oil a day from its strategic petroleum reserve halted a rebound in oil. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) will also meet later in the day.
Global stocks are set for their worst quarter in two years as the war in Ukraine puts upward pressure on commodity prices, forcing central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy.
“I don’t think it’s quite the bear market, but I would say, what is the upside of equities from here, I don’t think it’s that much,” Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah told Bloomberg.
“But the downside risks are so great. Not only is, of course, the geopolitical crisis going on. But then you have the Fed hikes.”
Markets now expect the Fed to hike interest rates by a half point at its May meeting. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said she favors a “steady, deliberate” series of hikes, while Fed Richmond Bank President Thomas Barkin said he is open to hiking rates by a half-point at the next meeting, depending on how strong the U.S. economy is then.
New York Fed President John Williams will speak later in the day and the U.S. releases its latest jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, a day later.
Across the Atlantic, European short-dated notes led a selloff, with investors betting that higher-than-expected inflation will force the European Central Bank to hike interest rates.
There were also no breakthroughs in talks between Ukraine and Russia to end a war triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Russia is also regrouping forces in a bid to take over Ukraine’s Donbas region.
Russia has backed off its demand that natural gas purchases be made in rubles, according to Germany, and a payment mechanism is currently under discussion."

(Reuters) -Labor board officials expect to start counting votes by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse workers in New York City and Alabama on Thursday afternoon in separate contests that will decide if Amazon sees a U.S. workplace unionize for the first time.
In Bessemer, Alabama, Amazon employees voted in a repeat election after they rebuffed joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) by a more than 2-to-1 margin last year. After finding that Amazon had interfered around that vote, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) called for a re-run. 
Turnout in Alabama decreased from last year, the RWDSU said on Wednesday. About 39% of the 6,143 workers designated to receive mail ballots voted in the new election, down from over 50% in 2021.
In New York City's Staten Island borough workers on Wednesday still had several hours left to vote, and turnout was not yet clear.
The counts for both Bessemer and Staten Island are tentatively scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday, though that could change, an NLRB spokesperson said. Counting could last multiple days.
Low turnout may bode well for Amazon's union backers, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.
""Supporters are more likely to be solid union votes,"" he said, adding, however, that it was tough to generalize. ""Even a close election is going to be in some ways a sort of a morale booster and moral victory for the RWDSU.""
Amazon referred comment on the vote count and turnout to the NLRB.

According to the RWDSU, parties in the Bessemer election have challenged hundreds of ballots as ineligible for counting, based, for instance, on voters' employment dates, job classification or other issues.
Those challenges will be addressed after the remaining ballots are counted and could alter the outcome in the event of a close election.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith wrote to Ukraine's leader this month with a clear message: despite Kyiv's calls for it to sever all ties with Russia, the U.S. software behemoth would continue doing business in the country with non-sanctioned clients, including schools and hospitals.
""Depriving these institutions of software updates and services could put at risk the health and safety of innocent civilians, including children and the elderly,"" Smith said in the previously unreported March 14 letter, seen by Reuters.
Smith told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Microsoft was ""mindful of the moral responsibility"" to protect civilians. However, he said the company was discussing with U.S., British and EU governments whether ""to halt any ongoing services and support"" in Russia and would move ""in lockstep with their sanctions and other economic goals."" 
Asked about the exchange, spokespeople for both Microsoft and Ukraine said a constructive dialogue was underway about actions to support the country.
The decision by some leading Western business technology makers - including Microsoft, German software multinational SAP SE (DE:SAPG) and U.S. giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp - to maintain operations or staff in Russia despite Ukraine's appeals have angered their workers in several countries.
Small groups of employees at Microsoft, SAP and  IBM  have called for management to withdraw fully from Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, according to comments seen by Reuters on internal discussion forums and interviews with 18 workers familiar with the companies, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The employees – echoing Ukrainian officials – have urged the companies to go beyond ending new sales and dropping sanctioned clients in order to increase economic pressure on Moscow. They want their companies to suspend every deal in Russia, including for software clients may use to track sales, supply chains and workforces.
Asked about the internal criticism, IBM said it has ceased working with Russian companies anywhere in the world - though it has stopped short of layoffs or suspending support of foreign businesses in Russia. 
SAP told Reuters it was complying with government actions and even going beyond them, and it would ""welcome new sanctions currently under discussion.""
SAP responded to Ukraine's requests to cut all ties in Russia with a previously undisclosed letter this month to President Zelenskiy – reviewed in part by Reuters – saying that it was supporting essential Russian services, including ""hospitals, civilian infrastructure and food supply chains.""
The three companies have not ruled out further pullback. But for now, their employees in Russia are getting paid and accessing workplace tools, colleagues said. Local phone numbers are active for all three, Reuters found. 
Questioned about the demands on Western tech businesses from their own workers and the Ukrainian government to quit Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said that ""some companies are leaving, others are staying. New ones will come in their place.""
The spokesperson noted that companies had legal obligations to employees that must be fulfilled, such as paying wages.
Russian prosecutors have warned some Western businesses that their staff could face arrests if production of essential goods was stopped, according to media reports. The Wall Street Journal named IBM among those warned. 
The Kremlin spokesperson denied the reports about pressure on companies from prosecutors: ""The part about arrests is a lie."" 
UKRAINIAN LOBBYING 
Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, one of the leading campaigners for a digital blockade, said Russia was already feeling the impact as some technology companies exit, such as developers of digital payment and web development tools. But he is pushing for a complete departure.
""We will keep trying until those companies have made the decision to leave Russia,"" he said.
Fedorov's team told Reuters last week that a ""huge number"" of Russian organizations have contracts for SAP's software, including major banking and energy companies. Reuters could not independently confirm SAP's customers in Russia, and SAP said it was in full compliance with sanctions.
Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media did not answer requests for comment on the impact of departures by Western technology companies, nor the extent of SAP's footprint in the country.
Mirroring the Ukrainian government's message, SAP's five salespeople for Ukraine told regional managers on a call March 18 that the company must end support for remaining Russian clients, according to a person familiar with the discussion. 
Fedorov said on Friday in a tweet, citing a conversation with SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein, that the company would ""gradually stop supporting"" products in Russia. A day earlier, SAP had said it was shutting its Russian cloud business, which two sources described as a small operation.
In a March 23 letter sent to customers in Russia, reviewed by Reuters, SAP asked cloud clients to advise whether their data in the Russian cloud should be deleted, handed back to them or moved outside the country.
SAP confirmed the content of the letter, and said that Fedorov and Klein spoke. It declined to comment further.
At IBM, hundreds of workers criticized the company's response to Russia's invasion, three people with knowledge of internal messages said.
CEO Arvind Krishna on a March 2 call with employees had taken no sides on the war, one of the sources said. In a now-public message to workers the previous day, IBM had referred to what it described as the ""deteriorating situation involving Ukraine and Russia.""
One comment on an internal discussion forum, seen by Reuters, called on the CEO to read a book on IBM's work during the Holocaust describing how https://ibmandtheholocaust.com the company designed punch-card machines that Nazi Germany used to track Jewish people: ""Think carefully and do the right thing - pull IBM and IBMer's in Russia out of Russia,"" the employee wrote.
IBM declined to comment on the remark.
Responding to the outcry, Krishna announced in a March 3 post a suspension of sales in Russia and condemned ""the Russian war in Ukraine."" On March 7, he went further, saying that IBM had suspended ""all business"" in Russia – without elaborating.
An IBM spokesperson told Reuters March 24 that the business suspension meant the company is no longer providing ""goods, parts, software, services, consulting and technology"" anywhere in the world to Russian clients.
Several Microsoft workers on internal chat tools have also demanded the company exit Russia altogether, with some even telling senior management they would quit otherwise, an employee said. Microsoft declined to comment.
DOUBTS
Some workers told Reuters they have not joined the calls for full exits due to doubts over harming civilians and how strong an impact the companies' withdrawal from Russia would have.
For instance, the United States on Feb. 24 sanctioned Russian Railways, a state-owned company operating passenger and freight trains. IBM that day placed the company on its “Denied Parties List” and stopped tech support, according to an IBM letter to Ukrainian minister Fedorov dated March 5, seen by Reuters.
Denied parties cannot access official replacement discs, adapters and memory for mainframes that a former IBM salesperson said need swapping every two years.
But a person familiar with operations at Russian Railways said it can run for years without aid. 

Russian Railways did not respond to requests for comment. IBM declined to comment.
SAP also told Reuters that because some clients have its software installed on their machines they can keep using it regardless of the company's decision not to provide support.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. and European equities rally wavered on Wednesday as investors reviewed economic and geopolitical risks, while oil prices jumped more than $2 on the prospect of more Russian sanctions.
The breather in stocks followed three to four straight days of gains that more than erased losses sustained when Russia invaded Ukraine five weeks ago, and came as bond investors wondered whether the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy tightening could harm the world's biggest economy over the longer term.
A key part of the U.S. yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday in what is widely viewed as a harbinger of a recession, although it has since reverted.
""We see further equity upside medium-term given a robust growth picture, low bar for first-quarter earnings, and narrowing credit spreads,"" analysts at JP Morgan's Global Markets Strategy said.
""We see too much negativity around the Fed since the start of Fed tightening cycles proved positive for equities historically, and policy is easing in Japan and China.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.19%, the S&P 500 fell 0.63%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.2%. 
Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 lost 0.4%, while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, eased 0.32%.
The widely tracked yield curve showing the difference between two- and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields bounced back to 4 basis points on Wednesday. It had briefly inverted to minus 0.03 of a basis point on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019. [US/] 
Longer-dated yields falling below shorter ones indicate a lack of faith in future growth. A drop in 10-year yields below 2-year rates signals a recession.
Sebastien Galy, a senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said fixed income and equity markets are diverging in their outlooks and the split bears watching.
""Equity markets are overly optimistic and the fixed income markets are probably being overly pessimistic."" 
An inverted Treasury curve has in recent decades been followed by a recession within two years, including the 2020 downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Benchmark indexes in Frankfurt and Paris lost 1.5% and 0.74% respectively, while London shares bucked the trend and jumped 0.55%.

A day after rising above 0% for the first time since 2014, Germany's two-year bond yield was up 6 basis points at 0.01% - keeping the previous day's highs in sight.
Shares rallied in Asia overnight after Ukraine proposed on Tuesday that it adopt neutral status, a sign of progress in face-to-face peace talks. 
On the ground, attacks continued and Ukraine reacted with scepticism to Russia's promise in negotiations to scale down military operations around Kyiv. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 1.36% to its highest level in nearly a month, with most Asian stock markets in positive territory.
JAPAN IN FOCUS 
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.3415%, after rising to 2.557% on Monday, its highest level since April 2019, as traders geared up for quick-fire U.S. interest rate hikes.
Rising U.S. yields have also lifted government bond yields in Japan, where inflation is running below target and where the central bank wants yields to stay low.
The Bank of Japan increased efforts to defend its key yield cap on Wednesday, offering to ramp up buying of government bonds across the curve, including unscheduled emergency market operations. 
The widening gap between U.S. and Japanese yields has caused the yen to weaken sharply, but it pared losses on Wednesday. 
The Japanese currency rose 0.9% to 121.81 per dollar from Monday's low of 124.3, amid concerns Japanese authorities might step in to bolster the yen. [FRX/] 
Elsewhere in currency markets, the euro rose 0.6% to $1.1156, its highest in four weeks, supported by the Russia-Ukraine peace talks.
In commodities, oil prices jumped more than $2 on supply tightness and the growing prospect of new Western sanctions against Russia even as Moscow and Kyiv held peace talks.

Brent crude futures were up $2.28, or 2.1%, at $112.51, while U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $107.3 per barrel. [O/R]

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said Grubhub, Uber Eats and Postmates must face an antitrust lawsuit by diners who accused them of driving up menu prices by exploiting their dominance in meal deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said it was reasonable to infer that requiring restaurants to accept ""no-price competition clauses"" left them with ""no choice but to raise prices"" regardless of where diners ordered meals.
    He also said diners plausibly alleged that Grubhub and Uber Eats' more restrictive clauses discouraged restaurants from using other platforms, despite their need to generate enough sales to stay afloat and offset low profit margins.
""Defendants' motion to dismiss is denied in its entirety,"" Kaplan wrote.
Diners claimed that the no-price competition clauses barred restaurants from charging lower prices for dining in or ordering takeout, while Grubhub and Uber Eats also forbade restaurants from charging less to customers who ordered on rival platforms.
They said the harm from inflated meal prices was compounded by ""supracompetitive"" 5% to 10% delivery fees charged to diners and 30% commission rates often charged to restaurants.
The proposed class action sought triple and other damages for dine-in and delivery customers in the United States since April 2016.
Grubhub, owned by Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway.com, said it was disappointed with the decision and will continue defending its dining-related services.
Uber Eats and Postmates, both owned by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the diners said they were pleased with the decision.
The practices of delivery companies faced increased scrutiny after the pandemic forced tens of thousands of restaurants to close and many more to temporarily shut their dining rooms.

Grubhub, Uber Eats and rival DoorDash Inc have also sued to overturn a New York City law capping the fees they charge restaurants at 15%, while Grubhub and DoorDash are challenging a similar law in San Francisco.
The case is Davitashvili et al v Grubhub Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-03000.

546,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Hong Kong attracted record inflows via exchange-traded funds in March, as retail investors took advantage of a historic dip and an ensuing rebound to bet on further gains. 
Some 60 equity ETFs tracking the city’s indexes added $4.4 billion since end-February, the most in monthly data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2000. The Tracker Fund, the city’s first and largest ETF mirroring the benchmark Hang Seng Index, lured $1.5 billion, more than three times the net inflow for February. 
The piling in of money suggests retail investors are sanguine about Hong Kong’s equity market outlook despite volatility. A growing diversity of products, including those focused on the metaverse, also likely helped ETFs gain traction. The Hang Seng Index has rebounded more than 20% from a mid-March trough, following Beijing’s pledge to end a regulatory crackdown and stabilize markets.

“We have seen retail buying through ETFs when foreign institutional clients were selling in panic,” said Melody He, deputy chief executive officer at CSOP Asset Management Ltd. “It’s a more transparent and efficient way of tactically trading the market.”
The surge in flows into ETFs tracking Hong Kong stocks, many of which are mainland firms, comes as strategists remain split on the outlook for China equities. Skeptics are hesitant to turn bullish barring more policy clarity from the Chinese government, especially on the back of lingering regulatory risks and growing lockdowns in China’s big cities. 
Stocks in Hong Kong are yet to recoup this year’s slump despite recent gains. The Hang Seng Index is down 5% this year, while the Hang Seng Tech Index -- which includes  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. as members -- has lost more than 18%. Both gauges are on track to post monthly losses for March.
Still, another sign of investor optimism can be witnessed in stock purchases via the southbound trading links. Mainland Chinese traders have been snapping up Hong Kong’s beaten-down shares through the links, with net inflows reaching HK$48.9 billion ($6.3 billion) so far in March, set for the biggest monthly figure since December.
The inflows to ETFs signal that the rebound “may have staying power,” said Rebecca Sin, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Chinese technology stocks may finally be on the road to recovery after government pledges revived the market’s risk appetite.”
The ETF market in Hong Kong has a relatively short history, with the first product launching in 1999 and its market capitalization equivalent to less than 1% of the overall stock market. It’s also smaller than the value of ETFs listed in Japan, China and South Korea exchanges, Bloomberg data show. 
But it’s been growing fast of late, with a range of thematic products focusing on tech and ESG helping draw cash. The total market capitalization of 153 listed products on the Hong Kong exchange, including inverse and leveraged funds, reached HK$429 billion in 2021, expanding almost 50% from three years ago. As of February, the average daily turnover has risen to HK$8.9 billion, up 15% from the previous year.  
Regulators are also planning to include ETFs in the stock connect schemes between Hong Kong and mainland bourses, potentially boosting liquidity in the local ETF market.  
“We expect the inflows to continue given more product offerings, diverse issuances and greater connectivity with the mainland,” said CSOP Asset Management’s He. She added that the depth of Hong Kong’s ETF market “will improve over time.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Major U.S. and foreign automakers on Wednesday backed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new tougher vehicle emissions regulations in a court challenge brought by some states and ethanol groups.
Texas and 15 other states have challenged the EPA's vehicle emissions rules that reverse a rollback of tailpipe rules issued under former President Donald Trump.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing nearly all major automakers, said in a court filing the EPA rule ""will challenge the industry"" but provides automakers with ""critically important flexibilities.""
Automakers, the group added, want to ensure ""critical regulatory provisions supporting electric vehicle technology are maintained.""
The states are joined by some corn and soybean growers associations, the American Fuel And Petrochemical Manufacturers and others. Corn growers, a  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) subsidiary and other ethanol producers said the new EPA rules revising emission requirements through 2026 ""effectively mandate the production and sale of electric cars rather than cars powered by internal combustion engines.""
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a challenge joined by Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah. The state of Arizona filed a separate legal challenge.
The automakers, which include General Motors (NYSE:GM) Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Hyundai Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis , said in the court filing the ""transition must be supported by regulatory stability. If the outcome of the litigation remains in question for a significant period ... (automakers) could face stranded investments and planning uncertainty.""

The new rules, which take effect in September and require a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026, aim to speed a U.S. shift to more electric vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday will announce its final parallel Corporate Average Fuel Economy revisions of rules through 2026, Reuters reported. Separately, NHTSA on Sunday confirmed it finalized a dramatic jump in fines for automakers not meeting regulatory standards.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A Massachusetts judge on Wednesday dealt state securities regulators a major setback in their enforcement action against online brokerage Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) by declaring the state's new fiduciary duty rule that underlies parts of the case invalid.
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Michael Ricciuti in Boston ruled https://tmsnrt.rs/3JXkqV5 in a lawsuit Robinhood filed after Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin in December 2020 accused it of encouraging inexperienced investors to place risky trades.
The decision impacts only part of Galvin's administrative enforcement action, and he may still pursue claims that Robinhood's conduct was unethical or dishonest and that it failed to adequately supervise employees.
Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, alleged Robinhood used strategies that treated trading like a game to lure young, inexperienced customers, including by having confetti rain down on the user's screen for each trade made on its app.
He argued that Robinhood violated a fiduciary duty rule he adopted in early 2020 that raised the investment-advice standard for brokers and that its broker-dealer license in the state should be revoked.
The Massachusetts rule went beyond a standard the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted in 2019 by requiring broker-dealers have a fiduciary obligation to provide investment without regard to the interests of anyone but their customers.
But Ricciuti wrote the rule improperly overrode Massachusetts state law governing stockbrokers' duties and that Galvin went beyond his authority by adopting a regulation that conflicted with federal law.
He put his decision on hold to allow Galvin, a Democrat, time to appeal. Debra O'Malley, a spokesperson for Galvin, said his office is reviewing the decision and weighing its options.

An administrative trial is scheduled for Sept. 26. 
Dan Gallagher, Robinhood's chief legal office, in a statement welcomed the ruling, saying Galvin has ""consistently mischaracterized and disparaged Robinhood's platform and customers without any legal basis.""

The SEC's examinations division, tasked with monitoring risks and ensuring investor protection, will also review whether funds' proxy votes align with their ESG-related disclosures and mandates, and whether there are misrepresentations of ESG factors being considered, the agency said in a statement.
The agency's exam outlook highlighted areas that have emerged as priorities for the top U.S. markets regulator since Democrats took the helm in 2021, from climate and crypto to broker-dealers' procedures to handle phishing and other cyber attacks.

The SEC's examiners will focus on custody arrangements for crypto assets and will assess any sales, recommendations, advice and trading of crypto, the SEC said. 
The agency also targeted private funds in its outlook for 2022 exams, with plans to review investment advisers' portfolio strategies, risk management, disclosures and conflicts of interest.

(Reuters) - One of California's big pension funds said on Wednesday it will push companies to add more women to their boards and to disclose more about their carbon emissions, setting out strong markers for the 9,000 companies in its global portfolio.
In votes to be cast at upcoming shareholder annual meetings, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) will vote against the entire board of directors at companies that do not have at least one woman, the $318 billion retirement system said in a press release. 
It also will vote against nominating committee members of boards that are not at least 30% female. Those standards could especially pressure non-U.S. or European company boards, said Aeisha Mastagni, who oversees CalSTRS' stewardship strategies, in an interview.
""It's 2022 and we've been talking about the value of diversity for long enough,"" she said. 
In addition, CalSTRS said it will vote against directors at companies that have not disclosed direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions. A rule recently passed by U.S. Securities regulators, which must still be finalized, has similar requirements.
Some climate activists have also pressed companies to go further and to disclose emissions from suppliers and customers, known as Scope 3. Mastagni said that would be a good regulatory change but the first two types at least will help investors judge corporate emission reduction plans.
Mastagni said the new policies would likely increase the frequency of CalSTRS' votes against directors from 54% last year.
Other big asset managers such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also have called for more boardroom diversity and climate disclosures, as investors pour money into funds that use environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to pick securities.
CalSTRS is the second-largest U.S. public retirement system after the $476 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System. Both have helped push reforms such as last year's drive that elected dissidents to  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s board.

(Reuters) - Florida has reached more than $878 million in settlements with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and three drug companies to resolve claims and avert a trial next month over their roles in fueling an opioid epidemic in the third most populous U.S. state.
CVS will pay $484 million, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd will pay $194.8 million, Abbvie Inc's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit will pay $134.2 million and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc will pay $65 million, Florida's attorney general Ashley Moody said in a statement on Wednesday.
Most of the money will be spent on opioid abatement. Teva will also provide $84 million of its generic Narcan nasal spray, which can temporarily reverse the effects of opioid overdoses.
The four companies denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Endo's accord had been reached in January. 
West Virginia reached a similar $26 million settlement with Endo on Wednesday, attorney general Patrick Morissey said in a press conference.
After the settlements, Florida and West Virginia will both begin pared-back opioid trials next week. West Virginia will proceed to trial on April 4 against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva and Allergen. Florida will proceed to trial against pharmacy chain Walgreens, with jury selection scheduled to begin on April 5. 
Walgreens said its 2012 opioid-related settlement with Florida covered the state's latest claims, and that it will defend against ""unjustified attacks"" on its pharmacists.
CVS and Teva said they would defend against other opioid lawsuits, and Teva said it is ""actively"" negotiating a national settlement of similar claims. Allergan said its settlement also covers claims for generic opioids it sold to Teva in 2016.
Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Florida announced the settlements nine days after Rhode Island reached similar accords with Teva and Allergan valued at $107 million.
More than 500,000 people have died from opioid overdoses in the past two decades nationally, including 75,673 in the year ending April 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On Feb. 25, Johnson & Johnson and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) reached final settlements worth $26 billion over their roles in the nationwide epidemic.
State, local and Native American tribal governments in the United States have filed more than 3,300 lawsuits accusing drugmakers such as OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma of fueling opioid abuse, including by downplaying the risks of addiction.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, handing back some of the recent gains as investors digested key reports on jobs and economic output while monitoring developments in Ukraine.
At 4:45 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 65 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.2%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 338 points, or 1% higher and the broad-based S&P 500 gaining 1.2%, both registering their fourth straight day of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8%.
Helping the tone Tuesday were signs of progress in the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey. However, optimism has quickly turned into skepticism, with a Pentagon spokesman saying Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains under threat even after Russia promised to scale back military operations there. 
“Nobody should be fooling ourselves by the Kremlin’s now-recent claim that it will suddenly just reduce military attacks near Kyiv or any reports that it is going to withdraw all its forces,” John Kirby said. It’s “a repositioning, not a real withdrawal” from positions around the Ukrainian capital.
Also catching the interest of investors are a series of important data releases given the Federal Reserve is in the process of weighing up how aggressively to hike interest rates at its May meeting.
Expectations of sharp interest rate increases saw the 2-year Treasury yield briefly climb above the 10-year for the first time since 2019, a move that is often seen as a warning of an upcoming recession.
March's ADP nonfarm employment change report showed employers added 455,000 jobs in March, slightly better than consensus forecasts looking for companies to have added 450,000 jobs, while GDP for the fourth quarter showed a reading of 6.9%, which compared with expectations for 7.1%.
In the corporate sector, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) traded higher after the company gave a robust forecast for the ongoing quarter, suggesting demand from data centers remains strong.
Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) will also be in the spotlight after the athletic apparel maker beat quarterly earnings estimates and announced a $1 billion stock buyback program. 
Oil prices rose Wednesday, rebounding after a two-day retreat following a fresh reminder of the tight nature of the market as data showed U.S. crude stocks fell sharply last week.
Data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, showed U.S. crude inventories fell by 3 million barrels in the week ended March 25. The official data from the Energy Information Administration showed oil inventories declined by 3.4 million barrels, more than expected.
The oil market had dropped sharply this week on progress in the Ukraine/Russia peace talks as well as demand worries over fresh Covid-19 lockdowns in China, the world’s largest crude importer. 
By 4:46 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.2% higher at $107.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $111.05. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,933/oz.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's watchdog on Wednesday unveiled a draft new rule to enhance blank-check company investor disclosures and to strip them of a legal protection critics argue has allowed the shell companies to issue overly optimistic earnings projections. 
The move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is part of a broader crackdown on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) after a frenzy of deals in 2020 and early 2021 sparked concerns that some investors are getting a raw deal.
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs are shell companies that raise funds through a listing to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing the target to sidestep the stiffer regulatory scrutiny of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
The SEC proposal, which is subject to consultation, broadly aims to close that loophole by offering SPAC investors protections similar to those they would receive during the IPO process, the SEC said.
""Today's proposal, if adopted, would represent a sea change to the rules applicable to SPACs,"" John Ablan, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown who advises companies on IPOs and other deals, wrote in an email to Reuters. ""The SEC is clearly focused on creating incentives ... to undertake the same amount of due diligence that would be done in a traditional IPO.""
The rule would require SPACs to disclose more details about their sponsors, their compensation, conflicts of interest and share dilution. 
It would also enhance disclosures about the target takeover, known as the ""de-SPAC,"" more information, including the sponsor's view on whether the deal is fair to investors and whether the proposed transaction has been vetted by third parties. Such disclosures would have to be issued at least 20 days prior to any solicited votes on the acquisition.
""Companies raising money from the public should provide full and fair disclosure at the time investors are making their crucial decisions to invest,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. 
The rule would also strip SPACs of a liability safe harbor for forward-looking statements, such as earnings projections.
The SEC has stepped up oversight of SPACs amid worries of inadequate disclosures and lofty revenue projections. Reuters reported last year that the SEC was considering new guidance to rein in SPACs' growth projections.
SPAC sponsors say the projections are important for investors, especially when targets are unprofitable startups, but investor advocates say they are frequently wildly optimistic or misleading but have been shielded by the legal safe harbor. 
""The elimination of the statutory safe harbor ... will cause SPAC issuers and their advisers to be more cautious in including pro forma and other financial information with respect to a proposed business combination,"" said Morris DeFeo, a New York-based partner at law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP.
If SPACs do not meet certain conditions they may have to register as investment companies, subjecting them to a slew of other rules, the SEC said. 
Those conditions include: maintaining assets in certain forms, entering into a deal with a target within 18 months of the SPAC IPO, closing the transaction within 24 months and ensuring that the newly merged company engages primarily in the same business as the target.

Gatekeepers who facilitate the deals, such as auditors, lawyers and underwriters, should also be held responsible for their work before and after the SPAC listing, Gensler added. 
The U.S. SPAC market experienced a wild ride in 2021, with an explosion in deals during the first half of the year that quickly cooled off in the second half. All told, 604 SPACs raised $144 billion in 2021, according to data from Renaissance Capital.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a four-day win streak Wednesday, as bets on tech eased following a stumble in chip stocks, while ongoing worries about aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve triggering a recession weighed on sentiment. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.90%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.52%, or 182 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%.
Chip stocks fell more than 2% to weigh on the broader tech sector, pressured by a weakness in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell more than 3% as better than expected second-quarter results and third quarter guidance were offset by worries about slowing growth amid an unfavorable macro environment.
“Investors concerned about inflationary risk and consumer wallet will likely view strong results skeptically,” Credit Suisse said in a note..
Consumer discretionary stocks, which in tandem with tech have underpinned the recent rebound, also stumbled.
PVH (NYSE:PVH) was the biggest sector decliner down more 6% after its softer than expected guidance offset quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations on the bottom line.
 Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) was also big a drag on the sector, down more than 4% after JP Morgan downgraded the building product firm to underweight, on worries about several headwinds including a slowing housing market amid tighter monetary policy.
Bond markets, meanwhile, continued to be closely watched, a day the after a key part of the yield curve inverted, triggering worries about a recession ahead amid fears the Federal Reserve may tightened too aggressively and tip the economy into a recession.
Those worries remained front and center on Wednesday as Fed officials continue to call on the central bank to pick up the pace of tightening to curb inflation at time. 
“Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate,”  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday.
The 10-2 year Treasury yield spread, which turned negative briefly a day earlier, continued to flirt with inversion.
The Fed has said the economy is strong enough to withstand the pace of expected tightening. Economic data on Wednesday was mixed as private jobs gains in April surprised to the upside but economic growth, or GDP, in the fourth quarter was unexpectedly revised down a tenth of a percentage point to a 6.9% increase.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 snapping four-session winning streaks, on waning signs of progress for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia against a backdrop of a hawkish Federal Reserve curbing economic growth.
Russian forces bombarded the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine, a day after promising to scale down operations.
The S&P has rebounded more than 5% in March after starting the year with two straight monthly declines. Still, the benchmark index is on track for its first quarterly decline since the first quarter of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was reaching full swing. 
Stock prices have reacted to headlines about negotiations to resolve Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices for commodities such as oil and metals have surged since the invasion, intensifying already-high U.S. inflation. 
""Ukraine is the controlling narrative for this market, if we are going to get a settlement and we get the potential from that settlement for lower energy prices, which is really the key, and then some sort of return to normalcy in terms of the world economy that is a real positive for the market,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
""If not, we are going to continue to just go back and forth here as the market tries to digest who the winners and losers are because there are a lot of unintended consequences coming out of this war,"" Meckler added. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 65.38 points, or 0.19%, to 35,228.81, the S&P 500 lost 29.15 points, or 0.63%, to 4,602.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 177.36 points, or 1.21%, to 14,442.28.
As inflation intensifies, so does speculation the Federal Reserve may get more aggressive in raising interest rates, which could put a damper on economic growth.
The S&P energy index was the leading sector on the plus side with a gain of 1.17%. It is up nearly 40% this year, which would mark its strongest quarterly performance ever. 
The sector is currently one of only three that are positive on the year and has far outpaced the next closest performer in utilities, which are up nearly 4% on the year but closed at a record high for a fourth straight session. 
Some investors have taken a defensive stance due to fears of excessive Fed tightening and recent signals in the bond market that often act as precursors to a recession. 
Still, economic data continues to indicate a strong labor market. The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls rose by 455,000 jobs last month after advancing 486,000 in February. Investors will watch for Friday's payrolls report.
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc surged 9.58% after forecasting full-year profit and revenue above estimates, as demand for athletic wear remains strong.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.69 billion shares, compared with the 13.93 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 47 new lows.

Investing.com --  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) has reportedly expanded the implementation of its price increase, according to KeyBanc analyst Eric Gonzalez.
TheFly quoted the analyst as saying that based on his proprietary scrape of Chipotle's digital menu, he believes it has expanded the price increase to a further 810 stores. 
In a note to clients, Gonzalez said there had been a price increase of 5%-6% in approximately 1,570 stores, or around 52% of its total footprint. He added that the size of the increase varies by protein and location.
According to the analyst, a new protein flavor — Garlic Guajillo Steak — is also being tested at select locations in Southern California, priced at a 10% premium to the traditional steak protein option.
Gonzalez, who has an overweight rating on the stock, does not expect significant customer pushback and judges that a nationwide price increase would result in an upside to current consensus margin/EPS estimates.

Investing.com – Stocks fell back on Wednesday as the fighting in Ukraine continued and investors braced for more data on jobs and a meeting of the international oil producers cartel to decide next steps.
Wednesday’s jobs data hit a positive note, coming in slightly above expectations, and setting the tone for the government’s broader report on employment for March. 
The new print on economic output for the fourth quarter came in a touch below expectations, meanwhile. Thursday will start out with fresh data on jobless claims for the previous week, which hit a low not seen since 1969 in last week’s report.
Thursday also brings data on personal spending and personal income, along with data on inflation. All of this is happening as the Federal Reserve looks at how aggressively to raise rates at its next meeting, given continued elevated energy prices and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
April will usher in a new wave of earnings reports from the S&P 500 companies, and executive outlooks on inflation and supply channels will be front and center. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobless claims
U.S. jobless claims are set to be reported tomorrow after last week falling to the lowest level in 52 years. Analyst forecasts as tracked by Investing.com see initial jobless claims coming in at 197,000 above the 187,000 reported previously but still at low levels relative to the beginning of the pandemic two years ago. All the data mentioned here will be reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT)
2. Personal spending
Personal spending for February is estimated to rise 0.5% from January, which would be a lower rate than the 2.1% gain in the prior month. That could be a sign consumers cut back on spending because of higher energy and food prices.
3. Personal income
The data on personal income will also be reported. The forecast for personal income in February is a 0.5% gain from the prior month, which is slightly better than the 0% recorded in January.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse's board will leave managers potentially liable for the collapse of its Greensill-linked funds when it asks shareholders to grant them a discharge for other activities, the bank said on Wednesday, as a group of investors pushed for a special audit.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.7 billion) loss in 2021, partly as a result of a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos which hit the bank that March. 
Its reputation was also damaged by the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds (SCFF) linked to insolvent British financier Greensill that same month, for which it is still trying to recover investor funds.
The bank conducted inquiries into both matters, publishing a damning report in July on a ""lackadaisical"" attitude toward risk and ""a lack of accountability"" behind the Archegos loss, but in a surprise move, said it would not publish its Greensill report in January.
Now, pension fund adviser Ethos Foundation and seven Swiss pension funds are pressing forward with demands for more information about the affair, asking shareholders to approve a special audit examining the bank's actions in relation to both Greensill as well as the so-called ""Suisse Secrets"" published in February.
""Due to the ongoing process to recover investors' funds, the legal complexities of the SCFF matter, as well as an ongoing regulatory investigation by FINMA, the board does not intend to publish the related report,"" the bank said on Wednesday. ""It therefore does not recommend proposing discharge with respect to this matter until the related processes are largely concluded.""
Under Swiss corporate rules, directors can be held responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties, with shareholders asked each year to free them from legal liabilities for the previous year.
Approving the vote waives the directors' or management's liabilities, but applies only to facts that have been disclosed to shareholders and the claims of the company and shareholders who approved it.
Credit Suisse withdrew an agenda item from its 2021 AGM asking shareholders to approve management's performance as it conducted investigations into the two scandals.
Now, following investor pushback, it said it would ask shareholders to grant executives and board members a discharge for any liabilities for 2020 and 2021 at its AGM on April 29, but omit matters surrounding the Greensill-linked funds.
It asked shareholders to reject Ethos' proposal for a special audit, saying it had answered questions from the shareholder group seeking more information, which it would make available on its website during the week of April 4. 
A special audit would ""at this stage be detrimental to Credit Suisse and that additional, related disclosure would prejudice the outcome of the recovery processes in particular"", Credit Suisse said.

Ethos, however, said it found Credit Suisse's response insufficient and therefore had decided to press ahead with a vote at the AGM.
Ethos also requested that the audit scrutinise the bank's response to findings published by a group of media outlets in February, who reported the Swiss bank had managed accounts for human rights abusers, fraudsters and businessmen who had been placed under sanctions.

(Reuters) - Profits at the world's biggest banks are expected to fall for the first time in seven quarters, dragged down mainly by a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity and a decline in equity and debt issuance deals. 
According to Refinitiv data, the combined net profits of top global banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) are expected to fall 2% in the March quarter, compared with the cumulative profits in the December quarter.
That would mark their first quarter-on-quarter profit drop since the second quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv. 
Title: Top investment banks' quarterly profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/znpneqxkzvl/chart.png 
The data covers the top 65 global banks, each with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion or more. 
Analysts said lower fee revenue and trading losses due to market volatility triggered by the Ukraine crisis are likely to hurt first quarter profits, despite an overall rise in net interest income levels.
""Market volatility can make issuing equity and debt more difficult, reducing income for these areas of the business that focus on underwriting new stocks and bonds as a major revenue source,"" Andrew Dinnhaupt, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, said in a note this month. 
""This could weigh on companies’ bottom lines, even if their traditional banking operations get a lift from higher (net interest income) and faster loan growth."" 
According to Refinitiv data, the total value of pending and completed deals announced in the first quarter touched $922 billion as of Tuesday, the lowest since the second quarter of 2020. 
Title: Global M&As - Quarterly volume, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/klpykjndrpg/chart.png 
The number of deals where Citigroup acted as bookrunner declined 47% compared with last year, while those involving BoFA Securities Inc and  JP Morgan Chase  fell 39% and 36%, respectively.

Global equity issuance deal volumes plummeted to $129 billion in the first quarter, from $390 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Refinitiv, as the market for initial public offerings came to a virtual standstill. 
Equity underwriting deal volumes fell 80% for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the two most dominant financial advisors on IPOs globally. 
Title: Global equity issuance - quarterly volume, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/byprjbqqepe/chart.png 
Bill Fink, head of U.S. middle market banking at TD Bank, said M&A activity declined in the first quarter due to heightened uncertainties over the Ukraine-Russia conflict, supply chain interruptions and higher inflation. 
""Plus the prospect of the Fed increasing rates beyond the number of times it originally projected, it's a recipe for uncertainty – and the M&A market dislikes uncertainty as it impacts purchase multiples and ultimately purchase price,"" he said.
In February, Citigroup said its total exposure to Russia amounts to $9.8 billion, following questions over whether it will have to set aside funds to cover potential losses. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said that the bank could have to write off nearly half that amount in a ""severe stress scenario."" 
Large U.S. banks are expected to kick off earnings season from April 13.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc unit Waymo said on Wednesday it has started offering driverless rides to employees in San Francisco, accelerating a race with General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co-backed rival Cruise to commercialize the technology in the dense city. 
Waymo also introduced autonomous rides to employees in downtown Phoenix with safety drivers behind the wheel, with a goal to open it to public testing.
""Operating fully autonomously in multiple markets — in addition to Waymo's growing trucking operations — is a critical validator of the scalability of Waymo's operations and technology,"" it said in a statement. 
A self-driving technology pioneer, Waymo started the first U.S. driverless taxi service in 2020, over a decade after it was born in 2009 as a project inside Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While it gives paid rides to hundreds of people a week using Chrysler minivans, Waymo's service has not expanded beyond suburban Phoenix areas that cover about 50 square miles (129.5 square kilometers). [nL1N2R80CD]
Waymo in August started giving autonomous rides free of charge to a limited number of people in San Francisco with safety drivers on board, using its Jaguar electric vehicles equipped with sensors such as spinning lidars on the top. 
Waymo needs to receive at least two more permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to start charging passengers for driverless rides in San Francisco.
Waymo declined to comment on whether it had applied for the permits.

Cruise already is giving fully driverless rides to employees and members of the public free of charge in San Francisco. The company is seeking CPUC approval for commercial driverless service, with a goal to get permitted this year. 
Self-driving technology firms, which have attracted billions of dollars of investments, face challenges of scaling up their technology, after missing their earlier targets to launch commercial services.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stuttered Wednesday, as the run-up in tech stocks paused following weakness in chip stocks as investors continued to watch developments in Ukraine and Federal Reserve officials calling for a faster pace of rate hikes.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.45%, or 157 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.2%.
Chip stocks fell more than 2% to weigh on the broader tech sector, pressured by a weakness in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell more than 2% as better than expected second-quarter results and third quarter guidance were offset by worries about slowing growth amid an unfavorable macro environment.
“Investors concerned about inflationary risk and consumer wallet will likely view strong results skeptically,” Credit Suisse said in a note..
Consumer discretionary stocks, which in tandem with tech have underpinned the recent rebound, also stumbled.
PVH (NYSE:PVH) was the biggest sector decliner down more 6% after its softer than expected guidance offset quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations on the bottom line.
 Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) was also big a drag on the sector, down more than 4% after JP Morgan downgraded the building product firms to underweight, on worries about several headwinds including a slowing housing market amid tighter monetary policy.
Bond markets, meanwhile, continued to be closely watched, a day the after a key part of the yield curve inverted, triggering worries about a recession ahead amid fears the Federal Reserve may tightened too aggressively and tip the economy into a recession.
Those worries remained front and center on Wednesday as Fed officials continue to call on the central bank to pick up the pace of tightening to curb inflation at time. 
“Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate,”  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday.
 The 10-2 year treasury yield spread, which turned negative briefly turned negative a day earlier, continued to flirt with inversion. The spread on the 10-year Treasury, which briefly dipped below the yield on the 2-year Treasury for the first time since 2019, continued to flirt with inversion again.
The Fed has said the economy is strong enough to withstand the pace of expected tightening. Economic data on Wednesday was mixed as private jobs gains in April surprised to the upside but economic growth, or GDP, in the fourth quarter was unexpectedly revised down a tenth of a percentage point to a 6.9% increase."

LONDON (Reuters) -The Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) is considering shifting the clearing of contracts that underpin global debt markets away from London, two industry sources said on Wednesday. 
A potential relocation to Chicago is being evaluated, the sources said of a move that could stoke fresh concerns about Britain's post-Brexit role in global finance.
Clearing has become a politically sensitive topic since Britain left the European Union, with Brussels saying that UK-based clearing houses such as ICE Clear Europe and the London Stock Exchange's LCH would no longer be able to serve customers in the bloc after June 2025.
The EU wants to build autonomy in clearing and end heavy reliance on London.
ICE, owner of the New York Stock Exchange and a futures exchange in London, is a major clearing house for credit default swaps (CDS) contracts, which are widely used by banks and investors as insurance against companies defaulting on bonds.
ICE says it clears about 95% of cleared corporate and sovereign CDS market, with 85% in Chicago and 10% in London.
The sources said it is asking customers in London if they could move CDS clearing to Chicago to increase efficiencies.
""The reason they are asking customers is that it reflects the way CDS clearing is done now,"" one of the sources said.
ICE, which declined to comment, has EU permission to clear CDS trades for EU customers from its Chicago business.
Any move by ICE will be closely watched by London Stock Exchange-owned rival LCH, which operates CDSClear.
""CDSClear continues to expand, and we are looking to develop our services for a wider range of customers,"" said Frank Soussan, global head of CDSClear.
While clearing was given a three-year reprieve, a bar on euro derivatives trading between Britain and the EU following Brexit has forced banks in the bloc to use platforms in New York to trade swaps with a UK counterparty.
Banks warn that efforts by Brussels to force euro derivatives clearing to move from London to the bloc could also see swathes of the activity ending up in the United States.

""The EU's constant bickering with London post Brexit has fundamentally destabilised the business case for derivatives in Europe making the U.S. appear the more flexible, pro-business choice,"" said Patrick Young, who writes a daily newsletter on exchanges.
ICE shifted trading in 245 futures and options contracts in North American oil and natural gas liquids from London to the United States in February 2018 and moved its EU carbon trading from London to the Netherlands in June last year.

""We expect the March 2022 recovery versus the same period in 2019 for both international and corporate bookings to be at their highest levels since the pandemic started in mid-March 2020,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. 
To date, the recovery has broadened, with all regions showing strong improvement from January, it said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands attended the Bangkok International Motor Show this week where electric vehicles (EVs) were in the spotlight due to rising petrol prices and a government subsidy taking 15% off the price of some EV cars.
Thailand, along with most other countries in Southeast Asia, has been slow off the blocks to embrace EVs, but demand is starting to gain momentum with Chinese car makers in particular producing cheaper models and increasingly targeting the region.
""I can't handle paying for the price of gas anymore, so I'm here looking to buy an electric car,"" said Natnicha Srimuang, who purchased an EV at the motor show. Thai gasoline prices are around 40 baht ($1.20) per litre, up 50% from last year.
Some see a switch to EVs as a way to save money longer-term.
""I (want) to invest my money in a good electric car that fits my lifestyle,"" said Patricia Duangcham, who said she expects to save thousands of baht a month from the purchase.
The combination of energy price concerns and more affordable models will help spur EV adoption, said Michael Chong, general manager of Great Wall Motor Thailand.
This year's motor show was also the first since government subsidies for EV buyers were introduced.
While many global car makers displayed EVs, there were long queues to take a peek inside Great Wall Motor's competitively priced 'ORA Good Cat' model.
Domestic demand for EVs is a crucial part of a Thai government strategy to preserve its status as a major regional automaker. The government is targeting production of 725,000 EV units a year, or 30% of total vehicle output, by 2030.
Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest auto assembly and export hub for companies like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd.
State-owned energy firm PTT Pcl has teamed up with Taiwan's Foxconn to produce EVs in Thailand by 2024.
China's Great Wall Motor also plans to produce EVs in Thailand in two years' time.
The demand for EVs has been picking up in Thailand, though from a low base. Last year, the number of registered fully electric cars doubled to about 4,000, though that still pales in comparison with total domestic car sales of 759,119 last year.
Despite the hype around EVs, some attending the motor show intend to stick to combustion engines due to concerns about the new technology.

""(The) EV car is only starting, and no one knows what kind of problems are going to happen,"" said Ponchai Lertlai, 59.

President Vladimir Putin has said Russia, the world's top natural gas producer, will soon require ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for fuel in roubles, raising alarm about a possible gas crunch in Europe. 
""Only payment currency is changing, the contract currency is not,"" one source said. For example, for deals clinched in euros the payment should be made at the official rouble/euro exchange rate set by the Russian central bank, that source said. 
The Russian president told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz by phone on Wednesday that nothing would change for European partners and payments would still be made in euros and transferred to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) bank, a German spokesperson said.
They added that Scholz is committed to a G7 agreement that energy supplies from Russia would be paid for only in euros or U.S. dollars. 
The proposed scheme is one of the options and is not final, the sources said. According to a third Russian source, Gazprombank, Russia's third-biggest bank, could serve as an intermediary for transactions between the gas buyers and Gazprom. 
The payment should be done in the rouble equivalent on a pre-agreed settlement day, the sources said.
""There is no final decision yet, the work is ongoing,"" a financial source involved in drafting the gas payments scheme told Reuters. The central bank, Gazprom and Gazprombank did not reply to a request for a comment. 
Moscow has yet to describe how it will go about the switch, which the Kremlin indicated on Wednesday could extend to Russia's other exports, and the sources offered the first details that investors and customers have been keenly awaiting.
There is no clarity on whether gas buyers from so-called unfriendly countries - those that joined Western sanctions on Russia - will accept the demand to pay in roubles. 
Gazprombank is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas. It was sanctioned by Britain along with some other Russian companies earlier this month. 
On Wednesday, Germany triggered an emergency plan to manage gas supplies under which Europe's largest economy could ration power if a standoff over Moscow's demand for rouble payments disrupts or halts supplies. 
Putin is due to listen to proposals on how to switch the payments to roubles, including from Gazprom and the central bank, on Thursday, and the scheme will be made public, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. 

The customers will not be obliged to switch to roubles as soon as from Thursday, Peskov said, as ""payments and delivery is a time-consuming process."" 
Gazprom, which accounts for 40% of European gas imports, does not disclose gas prices country by country, but has planned to charge Western countries an average $296 per 1,000 cubic metres this year, up from $280 in 2021.

Canadian carriers, battered during the pandemic due to the country's tough rules, are seeing a bounce in spring traffic. But higher oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have cast a shadow ahead of the busy summer vacation season. 
The company plans to increase its full-year capacity by about 150% compared with 2021, or around 75% of 2019 levels before the pandemic. It also expects a 13% to 15% increase in adjusted cost per available seat (CASM) compared with 2019.
Canada's largest carrier is targeting the faster rebound in U.S. traffic to boost its hard-hit international routes, through so-called sixth freedom travel where Americans from smaller cities connect through Canadian hubs like Toronto en route to destinations like Europe.

""This strategy particularly pays off today since sixth freedom demand supports the recovery,"" Galardo told the carrier's investor day. 
Montreal-based Air Canada is the largest foreign carrier operating in the United States and is focusing growth on cities like Atlanta, Austin and Seattle, he said.
Galardo sees rising immigration to Canada fueling demand from destinations like India, even as the carrier is weighing new routes in Africa.

Mediolanum declined to comment.
Braving turbulent markets and the backdrop of international sanctions against Russia that led to the seizure of the mega-yachts owned by oligarchs, Ferretti last Friday pulled off an 890 million euro ($993 million) IPO two years after a previous attempt foundered.
After pricing the IPO near the bottom of the range it had indicated, Ferretti said on Wednesday it had pocketed a net HK$ 1.77 billion ($226 million) from the deal.
It will use the cash to broaden its brand portfolio and also strengthen services for owners of its boats, it has said.
Chinese firms Sunshine Insurance, Sanya Development Holdings, Hainan Free Trade Port Fund, Hainan Financial Holdings and Haifa Holding acted as cornerstone investors taking 53% of the offering, Ferretti said.
Of the rest, the top 10 investors took more than half, the source and a second person close to the transaction said.
The two sources said Italian participation had been hindered by the fact that some of the investors who wanted to buy into the IPO lacked Asian share denominated accounts to deal in.
Ferretti, whose brands include Riva, Pershing and Wally, is owned by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group.

Swiss prosecutors have been working for years to identify assets and bring forward prosecutions in relation to a sprawling international corruption case linked to Brazilian state oil firm Petrobras. 
The so-called Car Wash probe, known in Portuguese as Lava Jato, began in 2014 with the arrest of a currency dealer and mushroomed into Brazil's biggest ever graft scandal, mainly involving Petrobras contracts in which some 200 businessmen, officials and politicians have been convicted. 
In October, Petrobras said it paid more than $850 million to U.S. authorities as part of an agreement on a related corruption probe.
Other banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Brazil's Banco do Brasil and Geneva-based Banque Cramer & Cie, have come into the crosshairs of related international probes.

(Reuters) -Trulieve Cannabis Corp reported a 24% rise in fourth-quarter adjusted core profit on Wednesday, helped by strong demand for pot and related products.
Trulieve's shares were up 2.3% at C$26.48.
The results come as the sector has drawn renewed investor interest with a cannabis decriminalization bill heading for vote in the U.S. House of Representatives this week.
""Certainly, we would all like to see federal change and certainly the American people are supportive,"" Chief Executive Officer Kim Rivers told Reuters.
However, she added that the industry has not been driven by the requirement for a federal change.
""This is a state-by-state operation and what's happening at the state level, is, at this juncture more impactful on our businesses as well as on people's access to cannabis than what is happening at the federal level,"" Rivers added.
Trulieve, which operates in 11 states including Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania, said fourth-quarter revenue surged 81% to $305.3 million also boosted by its $2.1 billion acquisition of medical pot producer Harvest Health.
The company said it expects full-year 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and adjusted core earnings in the range of $450 million to $500 million.
U.S. cannabis sales, which boomed during pandemic-led lockdowns, is forecast to reach $46 billion by 2026, according to industry research firm BDSA, as states like New York and New Jersey open up.
Still, margins and profits remain thin, triggering calls from investors and analysts for consolidation to improve profitability by finding savings in scale.

Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF) posted a loss of $71.5 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a year-ago profit of $3 million.
The company took $73.3 million of non-recurring fair value of inventory step up, and acquisition charges primarily associated with the Harvest buy.

U.S. health officials on Tuesday authorized second booster shots of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccines for people aged 50 and older, citing data showing waning immunity and the risks posed by Omicron variants of the virus.
The BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron has triggered a surge in infections in many countries across Europe and Asia, and raised concerns over a potential new wave in the United States.
More than half of the COVID-19 cases in the United States are now caused by the BA.2 sub-variant, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also authorized a second booster dose of the vaccines for younger people with compromised immune systems. It cleared Pfizer and partner BioNTech's booster shot for those aged 12 and older and Moderna's shot for people 18 and older. 
Rite Aid said eligible customers may walk in to a store immediately or schedule an appointment online from Wednesday.
Walgreens said people can schedule an appointment to receive the second shot starting on Friday, with walk-in appointments available from Wednesday through Friday, depending on store capacity.

Rival CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is preparing to administer the second boosters, the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday. 
Eligible patients can soon schedule an additional dose four months after their initial booster dose, the company said, adding that same-day or walk-in appointments could be possible but are subject to local demand.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government wants to clinch a deal on the sale of state-owned carrier ITA Airways by mid-June, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
ITA took over from Alitalia in October, permanently grounding the 75-year-old, one-time symbol of Italian style and glamour after years of financial losses and failed rescue attempts.
Shipping group MSC and Germany's Lufthansa have expressed interest in buying a majority stake in ITA and requested an exclusivity period of 90 days to iron out details of an acquisition. But Rome opted for a market-based procedure aimed at keeping the door open to other potential suitors.
The government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi wants a privatisation deal in place before the start of summer, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Draghi's office declined to comment.
Under a government decree entered into force early this month, Rome plans to privatise ITA through a direct sale or a public offer while retaining a minority, non-controlling stake in a first stage.
Last week the Treasury picked Equita and Gianni & Origoni as financial and legal advisers, intensifying efforts to find strategic partners.
The ministry has mandated the advisers to review the expressions of interest for the carrier and short list suitors who will be admitted to the data room, a third source said.
Under an agreement with the European Union, Rome can inject up to 1.35 billion euros ($1.51 billion) into the carrier by 2023. A privatisation deal would reduce the financial support granted by the state, limiting the costs for Italian taxpayers.
Last year the treasury paid a first tranche of 700 million euros. It is expected to inject an additional 400 million euros in April, with another 250 million euros scheduled for next year.
In past decades, Alitalia tried and failed to clinch alliances with Air France and, more recently, Gulf airline Etihad.

Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) last week said it wanted to deepen its commercial ties with ITA Airways but was not interested in taking an equity stake in the carrier.

Investing.com – Wayfair (NYSE:W) stock fell 5% Wednesday after Loop Capital downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ with a target of $90, about 27% lower than its current price of $123.
Analyst Laura Champine earlier had a ‘hold’ rating for the stock with a target of $95, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst points out that a slow replacement cycle is a key feature of the furniture industry and Covid-19 did indeed drive demand for the company’s furniture as the stimulus helped families create home offices and home schools.
But now, according to Champine, given the reopening and with most things back to normal, households don’t need two of those set-ups. Instead, she says many consumers are looking to spend on social activities and vacations they’ve been postponing.
“We see persistent cost pressures on every line of Wayfair’s income statement,” she said in her note. The brokerage has lowered its estimate for Wayfair’s current financial year revenue by $400 million and $1 billion for 2023.
She believes that advertising will remain expensive and less productive due to changes to Apple’s privacy rules."

Russia restricted access to Instagram from March 14 and subsequently found its owner Meta Platforms Inc guilty of ""extremist activities"". Moscow is battling with Big Tech to control information flows after it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
Instagram said the decision to block it would affect 80 million users in Russia. Although people can still sometimes access the photo-sharing platform using a Virtual Private Network, domestic alternatives have started appearing, the latest being 'Grustnogram', or 'Sadgram' in English. 
What began as a joke among friends quickly became something that could work, one of Grustnogram's creators Ivan Semkin told Reuters on Wednesday. 
""We tried to draw a concept, it took a day or two, we tried to make it look good and we realised it came out very well, and it was a seriously good thing that we could show to others.""
Semkin said he was now hoping the government would support their project. 
BROKEN HEART 'LIKE' 
""Post sad pictures of yourself, show this to your sad friends, be sad together,"" a message on the platform's website read. 
An image of the app's planned user interface showed a woman in a fur coat standing in front of St Basil's Cathedral on Moscow's Red Square. The search bar tells users to search for sad compatriots. 
Instead of Instagram's heart-shaped 'like' button, Grustnogram offers a broken heart and the option to 'be sad'. 
""We are very sad that many high quality and popular services are stopping their work in Russia for various reasons,"" Afisha Daily quoted Alexander Tokarev, another of the service's creators as saying. ""We created Grustnogram to grieve about this together and support each other."" 

Tokarev said four people, including two freelance programmers, were behind the project, and said he expected the application to appear for Android devices by the end of the week, and later on the App Store. 
Rossgram, an imitation of Instagram in name, design and colour scheme, was set to launch this week, but its founders only succeeded in publishing a video of a prototype hours after the scheduled launch time.

DUBLIN (Reuters) -The world's top aircraft lessor AerCap has submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets stuck in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, setting the stage for a lengthy legal wrangle between lessors and insurers.
Dublin-based AerCap had the largest exposure of any lessor when European Union sanctions forced the termination of Russian leases, accounting for 5% of its fleet by value.
Not only is its insurance claim expected to be the biggest among lessors seeking compensation for the hundreds of planes worth a total of up to $10 billion which remain in Russia, it is also one of the largest single claims ever submitted. 
""Last week we submitted an insurance claim for approximately $3.5 billion with respect to our aircraft and engines remaining in Russia,"" Chief Financial Officer Peter Juhas told investors following the publication of financial results for the final three months of 2021.
""In this case we expect them to be contested, just given the large sums involved across the industry,"" he added. 
Lessors had until Monday to wind up current rental contracts in Russia under sanctions imposed by the European Union.
Analysts have said that the unprecedented nature and scale of the potential losses will likely mean years of litigation between lessors and insurers before any decisions on payouts are taken.
One industry executive predicted an ""ugly battle"" between the leasing and insurance companies. 
AerCap said it may book an impairment in the first quarter of its financial year but it had not yet determined how big that might be. Juhas estimated AerCap's net Russia exposure at around $2.5 billion. 
AerCap had 135 aircraft and 14 engines on lease to Russia but has repossessed and removed 22 aircraft and three engines, it said in financial results for the fourth quarter of the year. 

Its shares were 4% lower at 1415 GMT, and down 18% since the start of the year. 
AerCap, by far the largest aircraft lessor in the world after its acquisition last year of rival GECAS, had 3,701 aircraft, engines and helicopters on its books at the end of December, it said.

586,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Tempting as it is to credit the stock market’s rollicking advance to expectations the economy will thrive despite war and inflation, other forces are at work in the rally.
How much they are responsible for is a serious question for traders and central-bank modelers alike.
Down only three times in two weeks, the S&P 500 has now soared 11% since mid-March to post one of its strongest gains over comparable periods in the last decade. The rebound, defying recession alarms from the bond market, has recouped almost three quarters of its losses from January and February.
Before assigning an economic narrative to the bounce, it’s useful to consider some of the constituencies who have helped fuel it. They include pension funds snapping up shares as the quarter rolls over, computer-driven traders programmed to add equities when volatility plunges, and short sellers forced to buy back borrowed stocks when prices rise.
Their actions help explain why stocks have kept rising despite outflows from equity funds, and add fuel to warnings from some Wall Street analyst that the gains are a bear-market rally. The buying from these groups reflected a need to adjust to market movements, rather than genuine demand driven by improving fundamentals. 
“I question how sustainable it is -- there is a lot of technicals,” said Michael Purves, founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. “You need to see fundamental investors come in and feel comfortable buying this dip. But to do that, they’re going to need to see some stability in the back of the Treasury curve and earnings are going to need to be good.” 
With earnings season still two weeks away, investors are left with few clues on how corporate America is navigating runaway inflation and the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike since 2018. Meanwhile, parts of Treasury curve have inverted, spurring concern that the central bank’s campaign to tame price gains could send the economy into a recession.  
All the uncertainty generated by the Fed and the war in Ukraine sent the S&P 500 as much as 13% from its all-time high in mid-March. At that time, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) projected pension and sovereign wealth funds would need to rebuild equity holdings that had fallen in value, with a potential buying spree totaling $230 billion. 
Whether the subsequent rally was aided by actual pension rebalancing or other investors buying stocks in anticipation of that is hard to determine. Regardless, the move has been powerful. The S&P 500 has jumped 11% and reclaimed major trendlines such as its 200-day moving average. The Cboe Volatility Index plunged to the lowest level in more than two months. 
In some ways, the rally has started a cycle that drives macro systemic strategies to load up on stocks. These funds, using momentum and volatility signals to guide trades, had spent the previous few months betting against the market. 
In the week through Monday, quant funds, including volatility-targeting funds and trend-following commodity trading advisers, purchased $25 billion of equity futures, according to an estimate by Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR). 
A similar dynamic played out on the individual-stock level. Richly valued shares, targeted by short sellers during the rout earlier this year, are outpacing the market on the way up as bears have capitulated. 
A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of the most-shorted companies has surged 27% since its March trough, more than double the S&P 500’s gain over the stretch. 
“Leveraged investors have participated in the current sell-off by aggressively reducing their equity exposure,” Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note. “Short covering by these participants helps to explain why some of the longest duration equities have recently risen sharply in the face of rising interest rates and a more hawkish Fed.”  
While the rally may have emboldened some buyers, it has yet to revive animal spirits broadly. Even as stocks climb back toward all-time highs, sentiment is stuck at levels worse more depressed than during the dark days of the pandemic, according to Goldman’s equity sentiment indicator that tracks everything from retail activity to money flows and fund positioning.
From a contrarian’s perspective, the lack of faith means potential buying power, and the only missing ingredient is some kind of catalyst to convince skeptics that the bull market will live on.
What that catalyst could be is up for debate, though one argument gaining traction is that stocks can work as a hedge against inflation. Indeed, analyst estimates have stood firm during this year’s turmoil, a clear sign of corporate resilience.
How much investors are willing to pay for those profits is the main variable that will influence the market, according to Dennis DeBusschere, the founder of 22V Research. He points to a wild swing in price-earnings multiples as the culprit for this year’s market chaos. With borrowing costs poised to rise in coming years, he sees a ceiling in equity valuations. 
At 20 times earnings, the S&P 500 was traded at an elevated ratio that before the 2020 pandemic had happened only once in the past two decades -- the dot-com era. 
“Be skeptical of chasing the latest narrative,” said DeBusschere. “Financial conditions are likely to tighten and are a headwind for P/E, which limits upside.”

Russia scrapped a 20% value-added tax on gold buying for individuals on March 1 as people rushed to park their savings when the rouble sank to record lows. The currency has been hit by sweeping Western sanctions on Russia in response to what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
State-run VTB said it had received over 200 orders since it started selling gold bars at the start of the month. It said customers most frequently bought one kilogramme bars.
In a situation of ""increased uncertainty,"" gold allows investors to diversify their portfolios, secure their savings and protect them for future generations, VTB senior vice president Dmitriy Breytenbikher said in a statement.
Purchases of precious metals by Russian households should also reduce the amount of cash flooding the economy, analysts have said.
Gold prices hovered near $1,933.7 an ounce on Wednesday, not far from 2020's all-time peak of $2,072.50 and up from around $1,800 at the start of the year.

From Monday, Russia's central bank restarted buying gold from banks at a fixed price of 5,000 roubles ($59.35) per gramme after temporarily suspending purchases from banks in mid-March to meet increased demand for the metal from households.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Indian private lender Axis Bank has decided to bulk up its credit card and retail businesses with a $1.6-billion purchase of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s local consumer banking arm.
The deal announced https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/83190dcd-4ae6-45f4-b3fa-8d39d91a4aa6.pdf on Wednesday is Axis Bank's largest by far and would expand its credit card customer base by 31%, narrowing the gap with the third-biggest player ICICI Bank.
""The acquisition strengthens our market position, reduces gap in key segments with peers and provides opportunity to accelerate retail business growth,"" Amitabh Chaudhry, managing director and CEO of Axis Bank, said at a press conference.
Citi was among the first international lenders to introduce credit cards in India in 1987, but its market share, according to Macquarie, has dwindled to 4% from 13% a decade ago. 
The sale advances Citi Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to overhaul the bank by exiting retail banking operations in 13 countries where it does not have the necessary scale to compete.
'SWEET DEAL' 
Axis Bank, India's third-largest private lender, will also gain access to Citi's local wealth management arm in the deal. The lender expects the purchase to increase its deposit base and loan book by 7% and 4%, respectively, while reducing its capital adequacy ratio by 180 basis points to 13%. 
""It looks like a sweet deal for Axis,"" said Anand Dama, a banking analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services. ""While the assets have good value, I think they got an even better deal on the liability side.""
Apart from the $1.6 billion being paid in cash, Axis will also need to set aside around 35 billion rupees ($461.07 million) for loan provisions and other regulatory requirements related to the deal.
The purchase is expected to close in the first half of next year and excludes Citi's Indian institutional client businesses.

Axis Bank's Chaudhry said technology integration after the acquisition remains a key challenge and could take several quarters.

The membership of Russia's state-owned Alrosa in the RJC has drawn scrutiny, even though the company stepped down voluntarily from the RJC's board earlier this month. 
The Russian diamond producer -- the world's largest -- was added to a UK sanctions list last week and Washington has targeted both the company and its CEO Sergei Ivanov, who, the U.S. Treasury said, is reportedly one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies.
In an emailed statement to Reuters Wednesday, RJC chair David A.

Investing.com – Pearson ADRs (NYSE:PSO) tumbled 6.6% Wednesday after the group’s rejection of an $8.8 billion offer from Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) made the U.S. investment company walk away from the proposed transaction.
“The board of Pearson considered the third proposal, together with its financial and legal advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects,” it said in a statement.
“Accordingly, the board of Pearson unanimously rejected the third proposal.”
Pearson CEO Andy Bird has turned Pearson’s focus to selling directly to consumers and not just its traditional customers comprising schools, colleges, and shops.
The company closed December with 2.75 million registered users on its app including 133,000 paid subscriptions. It recently acquired Clutch Prep, an online video-based learning service to fuel Pearson+ with original video tutorials. It is also catering directly to businesses looking to train staff.
The rejection of Apollo’s offer puts a greater spotlight on Bird to solidify that shift to digital.
Pearson recently set medium-term targets for the first time in six years.
The group expects to achieve mid-single-digit revenue CAGR from 2022 to 2025 and margins to remain relatively stable in the near term while improving to mid-teens by 2025.
Europe’s largest activist investor Cevian Capital currently owns 10.2% of Pearson, making it the company’s largest shareholder."

Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended shareholders oppose the reappointment of Ermotti, as a ""signal of concern"" over the lack of gender diversity on the reinsurer's board, the paper said.
Ermotti joined Swiss Re in October 2020 after a nine-year spell as Chief Executive at Switzerland's biggest bank UBS. He became chairman in 2021.
According to the FT, ISS criticised Swiss Re in its report ahead of the vote, due to take place on April 13, for failing to live up to its commitments to diversity and for falling short of an industry benchmark of having women account for at least 30% of boards.
Three women are standing for election to the 12-strong Swiss Re board, according to an invitation to the AGM seen by Reuters, which would give a 25% representation.
ISS is endorsing the rest of the board appointments and says the vote against Ermotti is warranted ""because the board is insufficiently gender diverse,"" the FT reported. 
ISS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Proxy advisers such as ISS have influence with passive investors and large institutions, who often follow their recommendations.
Swiss Re said it considered gender diversity to be of the ""utmost importance"" in the composition its board, and was committed to reaching the 30% goal by 2023's AGM.

""At Swiss Re, we embrace and build diversity, equity and inclusion, bringing together the best of multiple generations, cultures, skillsets and thinking,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
""We strongly believe that Mr Ermotti's measured approach to succession planning and assuring gender diversity is in the best interests of shareholders and Swiss Re.""

Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) said its net loss rose to 4.05 billion yuan ($637.64 million)from 2.95 billion yuan in the third quarter, taking its full-year loss to 12.2 billion yuan. That is deeper than an 11.8 billion yuan loss in 2020. 
The airline also faces closer regulatory scrutiny following the crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet last week that killed 132 people on board, which has led it to ground 223 planes of that type as a precaution while the investigation proceeds.
The company will closely monitor the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash and evaluate the impact on its financial performance and operational results, said the carrier in its annual report.
Beijing-based Air China (OTC:AIRYY), the country's flag carrier, said its net loss widened to 6.32 billion yuan in the fourth quarter from 3.54 billion yuan and it posted a full-year loss of 16.6 billion yuan. 
China Southern Airlines fell to a fourth-quarter net loss of 5.98 billion yuan, after posting 1.43 billion yuan in the red the previous quarter. It reported a full-year loss of 12.1 billion yuan. 
The Guangzhou-based airline also forecasted a pickup in deliveries of the Boeing 737 series aircraft from 2022, as Chinese carriers are set to resume commercial services of the 737 MAX, which was grounded in China for over two and a half years. 
China's domestic travel market, which had rebounded quickly due to its successful containment of the COVID-19 virus in the early days of the pandemic, is nursing heavy losses as authorities struggle to stop the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant under its strategy of eliminating cases. 
More than two-thirds of planned flights are being cancelled every day across China, according to third-party aviation data providers, while financial capital Shanghai is in the middle of a two-stage lockdown of 26 million people. 
Data firm OAG said on Tuesday that China's available seat capacity this week was down 10.2% from a week earlier and 24.4% from the same week last year.
A strong yuan currency was again a favourable factor this year, offering some relief to Chinese airlines that have financed a large portion of their foreign debt obligations in U.S. dollars. 
However, high fuel costs, which already inflated costs last year, are set to weigh on bottom lines this year, as Russia's war in Ukraine heightens geopolitical risks and reinforces broader inflationary pressures across the supply chain. 
Brent crude futures stood at $113 a barrel, up 45% from the end of last year. 
China remains virtually shut off from international markets as already reduced flights get suspended under its ""circuit breaker"" system when there are COVID-19 positive arrivals, leaving many passengers stranded abroad.

Domestic flights over the northern summer season that began this week and lasts through October are set to reach 117,000 flights per day, up 6.8% from a year ago, according to aviation data provider Flight Master, although a large number of them could be cancelled.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Air France-KLM and its Dutch subsidiary KLM on Wednesday lost their challenge against million-euro fines re-imposed by EU antitrust regulators five years ago for taking part in an air cargo cartel two decades ago.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) said it was considering appeal against the decision.
Air France and 10 of its peers had in 2015 won their court fight against fines levied by the European Commission in 2010 for fixing air freight services, fuel and security surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006.
The EU competition enforcer subsequently fixed procedural errors pointed out by the Luxembourg-based General Court and in 2017 re-issued the same penalties except for Martinair which had its fine reduced. 
The airlines then took their case back to the General Court, Europe's second-highest.
The Luxembourg-based court rejected Air France KLM and KLM's appeals and those brought by Martinair Holland, Cargolux, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY).
""Air France-KLM has taken note of the EU General Court’s judgement on the appeal filed against the decision of the European Commission of 17 March 2017 against 13 cargo operators, including Group airlines Air France, KLM and Martinair for practices considered to be anti-competitive in the air cargo sector,"" Air France KLM said in a statement.
""The Group will immediately analyse this decision in view of an appeal before the Court of Justice. Provisions of 350.6 million euros ($391 million) including interest have been made in respect of these fines in the accounts on 31 December 2021,"" it added.
The Commission had fined Air France 182.9 million euros, the highest, followed by KLM at 127.1 million. The total fine for the cartel made up of 12 airlines came to 776 million euros.
The court reduced the fines for Air Canada, Japan Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY), Latam Airlines Group and its subsidiary Lan Cargo. 
SAS's fine remained about the same after judges reduced the penalties for part of its infringements but increased them for others.
Lufthansa and subsidiary Swiss International Airlines escaped a fine as it alerted the EU competition authority to the cartel.

The cases are T-323/17 Martinair Holland, T-324/17 SAS Cargo Group and others, T-325/17 KLM, T-336/17 Air Canada, T-334/17 Cargolux Airlines, T-337/17 Air France–KLM, T-338/17 Air France, T-340/17 Japan Airlines, Case T-341/17 British Airways, T-342/17 Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and others, T-343/17 Cathay Pacific Airways, T-344/17 Latam Airlines Group & Lan Cargo and T-350/17 Singapore Airlines & Singapore Airlines Cargo.

Nowinski argues that some customers may decide to stay away from OKTA as the company failed to notify the public about the incident in a timely manner.
While the CyberArk platform likely would not have prevented the breach any better than the Okta technology, we believe the time lapse between when the breach was identified (January) and when the breach was disclosed to customers (March) could sway customers toward CyberArk. If this incident does result in a higher win percentage, CyberArk should be able to exceed the 17% revenue growth management guided to for FY22,
though we believe the current valuation is likely factoring in some of this upside, Nowinski said in a client note.
A new price target on EW-rated CYBR is now $170.00 per share, up from the prior $150.00.
Similarly, the analyst hiked the price target on SailPoint to $60.00 per share, up from $55.00.
With Okta's upcoming new IGA solution not launching in North America until mid-year, we see a minimal competitive threat from Okta near term, Nowinski added on SAIL.

The price of nickel, which is essential to making batteries for electric vehicles, had been rising steadily even before the conflict in Ukraine drove it up even further and triggered chaos at the London Metal Exchange in early March.
Prices of other metals used in cars, including aluminum, palladium and lithium, have also soared recently.
Tesla, the world's largest automaker, signed the multi-year supply deal with Vale for nickel from Canada, Bloomberg reported.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Vale declined to comment on the report, but said it had stated previously that the company currently sells 5% of its production into the EV market and plans to increase that to 30%-40%.

Tesla has been less affected by supply chain issues arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared with other automakers that have cut production as they face shortage of several components including chips and battery metals of EVs.
Chief Executive Officer CEO Elon Musk said earlier this month that the electric car maker and his rocket company SpaceX are facing significant inflationary pressures in raw materials and logistics.

The company, which produces about 80% of its output in Russia, proposed a dividend of 0.55 euros per share, down from the 1.32 euros flagged previously.
The conflict in Ukraine has caused high uncertainty related to Nokian's operational environment and manufacturing capacity, the company said.
Nokian also plans to ""expedite"" new production capacity in Europe, it said without elaborating.
Inderes analyst Joonas Koerkiakoski said the decision to reduce the proposed dividend was to be expected.

After Russia sent its troops into Ukraine, Nokian shifted part of its production from Russia to Finland and the United States ahead of possible sanctions. 
The company also scrapped its full-year guidance, citing a slump in the value of the Russian rouble and disruptions to the Russian payment system.

Analyst Stefan Slowinski said investments during the COVID-19 pandemic to build fulfillment centers for faster deliveries and employee bonuses to keep its warehouses staffed in a tight U.S. labor market may eat into the company's margins.
He added that capital expenditure could grow in the mid-teens, initiating with a price target of $2,800. 
Amazon's shares were down about 1% at $3,354 in early trading in a weak broader market.
Of the 58 brokerages covering Amazon, 20 rate the stock ""strong buy"", 36 ""buy"", one ""hold"" and one ""sell"", according to Refinitiv data. The median price target is $4,000.
Amazon boomed during the pandemic as consumers were highly dependent on online shopping for everyday essentials, but those shoppers are now returning to stores.
Customers are also cutting back on discretionary spending in a highly inflationary environment, at a time when costs of raw materials, procurement and shipping are rising for companies. 
""While margin expansion is possible, clearly with high inflation the consumer is under pressure... Amazon is already increasing prices on their customers by increasing their Prime pricing,"" Slowinski said.
He added that Amazon would not raise pricing on many products to match inflation and would probably take a hit. 
The company would need to allocate capital expenditure for its cloud business, as it aims to expand footprint by about 30% in a competitive market, he said.

""Worldwide shipping costs have gone crazy for everybody,"" Friedland told the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago. ""It has posed a challenge, but we see that coming down and you can move the material, it just takes a bit longer.""
Of the $1.28 a pound costs reported by the company for the last quarter of 2021, the cost of logistics for delivery to China accounted for $0.37, or 29%.
Ivanhoe, which operates the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in southern Congo's Lualaba province, currently trucks its output to the South African port of Durban.
It is now looking at using an alternative route through Angola to cut back on transportation costs, Friedland said. 
""It's about a third of the distance and a new Angolan railroad is going to move us much closer to the ocean,"" he said.

The company’s long-term vision and strategic outlook failed to reverse the losses.
President and CEO Joel Anderson said, the company is navigating a dynamic macro environment related to the lingering impacts of the pandemic.
Sales in the fourth quarter rose 16% to top $996 million. Comparable sales were up 3.4% compared to a time when stimulus check-loaded customers came flocking to stores. The company opened 17 new stores in the quarter and had 1,190 stores in 40 states as on January 29.
Net profit was up more than 13% and topped $140 million to beat estimates.
“We delivered sales growth in line with our expectations against the difficult comparison to last year's stimulus-fueled comparable sales increase of 13.8%, and despite the impact of weather in January. The strength was broad-based, with Sports, Candy, Seasonal and Style worlds outperforming,” Anderson said in a release.
Five Below expects 2022 net profit to be $306 million on net sales of $3.21 billion, both estimates at the center of the guidance range.
As part of its long-term vision, the company aims to double sales and more than double EPS by end of financial year 2025. It expects to have 1,000 new stores in that time."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday issued new guidance to broker dealers and investment advisors on how to satisfy their obligations to retail investors and comply with agency rules when recommending investment products. 
The guidance clarifies brokers' and advisors' obligations under the SEC's long-standing Investment Advisor Fiduciary Standard and its Regulation Best Interest rule, passed in 2019. 
A key focus is how much brokers and advisors should disclose in cases where they may have conflicts of interest. Investment firms often offer brokerage accounts and advisory accounts, but the rules governing these two types of accounts differ. Advisers must place clients' interests ahead of their own, while brokers must only believe that recommendations are suitable for clients. 
The SEC wants to ensure advisors and brokers consider alternatives and cost, address conflicts of interest, and implement policies and procedures for making recommendations. 
""Firms may have a significant conflict of interest if the account type that is most profitable for them, for example, is not the type of account that is the best fit (for a) particular investor,"" an SEC official said.
The Republican-led SEC finalized Reg BI in 2019 in what was widely seen as a win for Wall Street after its 10-year battle over regulation of the investment advice industry. It fought off a more onerous proposal by the Department of Labor. 

Consumer groups criticized Reg BI for being too vague in its definition of “best interest” while not addressing all conflicts, including the higher payments that brokers receive for selling products that are more expensive to trade.
Wednesday's measure under the now Democrat-led SEC, seeks to plug some of these gaps, analysts said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has breathed new life into an investigation of Google Maps to determine if bundling the service together with other Google software illegally stifles competition, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The probe of the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit first came to light in late 2020 and had been quiet until recent months when investigators again began making inquiries, the sources said.
Google said it cooperates with regulators and welcomes their questions. The Justice Department declined comment.
The probe has two components.
One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided through infotainment screens in vehicles. In its Google Automotive Services package for automakers, the search company bundles together Maps, the Google Play app store, Google Assistant and other services. Car companies are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps with voice assistants developed by smaller rivals, one source said.
In response, Google said the integration provides the best user experience, and that in some instances a rival voice assistant can function with Google Maps.
The other component focuses on app and website developers. Specifically, the department is looking at Google's requirement that if a website or app uses one Google technology, say Google's location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other technologies developed by Google’s rivals, the two sources said.
A congressional antitrust panel concluded in a Big Tech staff report issued in 2020 that Google ""enforces this provision aggressively"" and effectively forces developers ""to choose whether they will use all of Google's mapping services or none of them.""
Google said its policies are aimed at preventing poor experiences, noting that mixing a Google Map with information on another map could lead to errors. The policies also stem from restrictions that partners place on how Google can use their data, it said.
The policies have some exceptions, and Google added that developers ""are also free to use other mapping services in addition to Google Maps Platform – and many do.""
MONEY AND DATA AT STAKE
Two developers have told Reuters over the past year that they received violation notices from Google in recent years after mixing data from the company's services with maps from other providers. The developers said the competing options were less expensive or more detailed than Google Maps in some cases.
The developers, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by Google, also have expressed concern about the company's new privacy options for users of its Android mobile operating system that could limit data collection by rival mapping providers. 
At stake are money and data, including about places and people's interests. Google does not separately disclose sales from licensing the map-related tools. But Google over the years has hiked mapping fees and tied the business to its Cloud unit, whose sales growth is of keen interest to investors.
In addition, the enduring use of Google's mapping services enables the company to collect more data to maintain its dominance over competing options.
Tying products together is not always illegal but antitrust enforcers have stepped in when such bundling does not benefit consumers.
In 1998, the government sued  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for allegedly breaking antitrust law by tying its operating system monopoly to Internet Explorer to crush rival browser Netscape.
There is no sign that the department's staff investigating Google Maps have recommended whether to sue, one of the sources said.
Google already is fighting a lawsuit the department filed in 2020, accusing it of breaking antitrust law to maintain its dominance of search and search advertising. It goes to trial in 2023.

A lawsuit against Google over its dominance of the online advertising business has long been expected to follow. That probe is further along than the one into the maps business, one source said.
The antitrust enforcer could be hampered in wrapping up the long-running probes because it has been swamped by an unusually large number of merger reviews and merger-related trials. A merger trial is expected in April and two more are expected in August.

Investing.com – RH (NYSE:RH) stock plunged nearly 12% Wednesday after the high-end furniture retailer said it had experienced softening of demand in the first quarter so far.
First quarter net revenue is seen growing 7-8% compared to the 78% growth in the same period last year. The company said the weakening coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February and the market volatility that followed.
The company said, “it is prudent to remain conservative until demand trends return to normal.”
The company flagged its concerns after its revenue in the fourth quarter through January 29 fell short of estimates.
Net revenue in the current year is seen growing 5-7%, compared to the 32% growth in financial year 2021. Adjusted operating margin could go either way compared to last year’s, according to the company’s forecast. It is seen between 25% and 26% compared to 25.6% in 2021.
The company just about met the lower end of its annual revenue outlook in 2021. In its third revision of the year, the company had, in December, said its annual revenue would grow 32-33% compared to the previous forecast of a 31-33% rise. Annual revenue rose 32% to $3.76 billion while fourth quarter revenue was up 11% at $903 million.
The company’s online businesses continue to lose money while adjusted operating margin expanded by 1.5 percentage points to 25.2% in the quarter.
Adjusted profit in the fourth quarter rose 14% to $164 million."

The economist argues that the consistently strong jobs data in recent months is likely to allow the Fed to focus more on inflation, hence she expects to see a 50bp hike in May.
The unemployment rate could become just as important to watch as average hourly earnings for signs of a tight labor market, with further declines likely to increase the Feds sense of urgency in raising rates at least back towards their estimated long-run neutral rate. We expect a very low unemployment rate throughout the summer months to support our base case for 50bp hikes at each of the next four FOMC meetings, implying the Feds long-run nominal neutral rate of ~2.5% is reached by September, Clark wrote in a client note.

Investing.com --  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) shares opened 15% lower Wednesday after tumbling in extended and premarket trading following the company's earnings and revenue miss. 
The online retailer of pet food and other pet products reported a loss per share of $0.15 on revenue of $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a loss per share of $0.06 on revenue of $2.42 billion. However, sales did rise to $2.04 billion.
In its shareholder letter, the company said the results showed “the conflict between the fundamentally strong demand that underpins our business and the highly challenging operating environment.”
While Chewy said there were positive trends in site traffic and order volumes, it saw operating conditions in some regions “deteriorate” due to the omicron variant, which “disrupted already-weakened supply chains across our industry.”
However, the company believes the ""near-term pressures on gross margin likely peaked in the fourth quarter,"" and they are ""already seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter.""
Chewy sees net sales in the first quarter between $2.4 billion and $2.43 billion, with net sales for full-year fiscal 2022 between $10.2 billion and $10.4 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire investor Richard (Ric) Kayne is seeking two board seats at Athira Pharma, arguing the biotech company needs a new chief executive officer to successfully guide its development of treatments for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Kayne, who founded private equity investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, told Athira shareholders that he nominated himself and George Bickerstaff, a former chief financial officer of Novartis Pharma AG, to the company's eight- person board, according to a letter seen by Reuters that was sent to shareholders on Wednesday.
He told the company about his plans last month.
The company's stock price climbed 2.15% in early trading as the broader market was off modestly.
""Simply put, Dr. Litton is not the right CEO for Athira,"" Kayne wrote, noting that Litton has little operational, clinical trial or scientific experience and spent most of his career in business development roles.
Mark Litton became CEO last year, succeeding Leen Kawas. Kawas oversaw the development of ATH-1017, an agent designed to regenerate brain tissue, and the company's public listing in 2020.
Kayne, who owns 4.8% of Athira's stock, says the stock price has tumbled 26% since Litton took over day-to-day operations in June and investors generally don't have faith in Litton's credentials or his ability to tell the company's story.
He is similarly critical of Athira's board, arguing the directors had little relevant expertise until recently when new members with biotech experience were added after he started pushing for changes. Kayne said the company offered him a board seat earlier this month but noted the ""offer was quickly rescinded with little explanation.""
A company representative said three independent directors joined in the last year and that the board already has the skills Kayne and Bickerstaff would add. She noted that board members have spoken with Kayne ""numerous"" times in an effort to find a ""collaborative path"" but that Kayne ""rejected our attempts to find common ground."" 
""Adding me and George Bickerstaff will help the Board restore credibility and refocus on what really matters: attracting the best management team and giving ATH‑1017 the best chance of success,"" Kayne wrote.

Five Below reported Q4 EPS of $2.49, up from $2.20 in the year-ago period and just above the consensus estimates of $2.48. Net sales came in at $996.3 million in the quarter, up 16% YoY and short of the analyst consensus of $1.01 billion.
The company reported a total location count of 1,190, up 1.4% QoQ and in line with the consensus projection. The number of store openings was 17 for the period, also in line with expectations.
Going forward, Five Below expects Q1 EPS in the range of 54c to 62c, well below the consensus estimates of 88c per share. The company expects comparable sales growth from 0% to 2%, compared with the analyst estimates of 1.13% growth. Net sales in the first quarter are expected in the range of $658 million, missing the consensus projection of $681.6 million.
Five Below expects EPS for the full year in the range of $5.19 to $5.70, short of the analyst expectations of $5.86 per share. FY net sales are expected in the range of $3.16 billion to $3.26 billion, compared with the analyst expectations of $3.35 billion.
The company expects to double sales and more than double EPS by the end of FY2025. It plans to open 1,000 new stores by the end of FY2025, including 375-400 new stores in the following two fiscal years, plus 550-600 new stores over FY 2024 and FY 2025.
The discount store company expects to triple the number of stores to more than 3,500 by the end of FY2030. FIVE's operating margin target is roughly 14%.
We delivered sales growth in line with our expectations against the difficult comparison to last year's stimulus-fueled comparable sales increase of 13.8%, and despite the impact of weather in January,"" FIVE said in a statement.
Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane believes the updated store target is below investor expectations, based on our conversations.
Our key questions include the cadence of SSS in the quarter; QTD trends; view on the supply chain and transportation costs; outlook for new and existing markets given the updated long-term store target; details on new store performance; the uplift from Five Beyond; drivers to the long-term margin expansion, and the consideration of price increases given the inflationary environment, McShane wrote in a client note.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday as the peace euphoria of Tuesday faded against a backdrop of continued Russian offensives in part of Ukraine. Fears of inflation were also in evidence again as the latest revision of fourth quarter GDP data contained an upward revision to key measure of inflation in the period.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5 points - effectively flat - at 35,289 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%.
Earlier, a Ukrainian government spokesman said that Russia had renewed and intensified its attacks in the east of the country, lending substance to Western suspicions that the announcement of a de-escalation in the region around Kyiv (following some damaging battlefield reverses) was little more than a maneuver to gain time to regroup. Optimists pointed to more comments from the head of Russia's negotiating team in Istanbul.
News closer to home was more encouraging. ADP's monthly report on private sector hiring indicated that 455,000 jobs were created through the middle of March, only a slight moderation from February's rate. That follows the Labor Department's monthly job openings survey on Tuesday that showed vacancies still close to record highs, with little sign of a slowdown in sight. However, GDP growth data for the fourth quarter were revised down slightly to an annualized rate of 6.9% while the rate of personal consumer expenditures inflation was revised up to 6.4%.
The mood was supported by two stronger-than-expected earnings reports that came in the previous evening.  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock rose 6.7% to its highest in nearly three months after it beat forecasts with both its latest quarterly numbers and its guidance for the current year. Meanwhile Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock rose 4.7% as the company reported a banner quarter, thanks to the burgeoning demand for data center chips and high prices paid by automotive groups beset by component shortages. 
Going in the other direction was Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock, which lost 15% after the online pet food retailer reported a quarterly loss that was more than double expectations. It blamed the development on the wave of Omicron-variant COVID-19, which it said disrupted its already-strained supply chains. Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) stock also fell 3.6% after the discount retailer likewise missed expectations with its quarterly numbers. 
Elsewhere, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock surged 6.7% after the COVID-19 vaccine maker announced a special dividend and flagged plans for a buyback program worth up to $1.5 billion. The makers of COVID-19 vaccines have lost significant momentum in recent weeks as the disease has appeared to become both endemic and less virulent. Even at its current level, BioNTech stock is down 50% from its peak only four months ago.
Further afield, ADRs in German chemicals giant BASF (OTC:BASFY) fell 3.1% after Germany proclaimed the first stage of a three-stage emergency plan that could lead to the rationing of natural gas. Russia has threatened to stop shipments if 'unfriendly' countries don't pay it in rubles from the start of April, a move that would undercut existing sanctions on Russian banks including the central bank. Germany and other G7 members rejected that demand earlier this week, and the Kremlin walked back its previous threat a little earlier on Wednesday, saying any supply curtailments would take place over time."

LONDON (Reuters) -China's biggest offshore producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd is preparing to exit one of the North Sea's largest field in a strategic shift of focus to newer oil and gas developments and away from Western assets, banking and industry sources said. 
CNOOC has hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to start preparing a formal sale of its North Sea assets, which could raise more than $3 billion, the four sources said.
CNOOC declined to comment. Bank of America declined to comment.
CNOOC acquired the North Sea assets as part of its $15 billion purchase of Canadian producer Nexen in 2013, in its largest overseas acquisition yet. 
The deal was then seen as evidence of China's growing role in the international oil and gas industry as CNOOC took over the operatorship of one of Britain's largest oilfield Buzzard, whose crude is among the streams that set the North Sea Brent benchmark oil price. 
The planned sale coincides with a sharp rise in global oil and gas prices following a tightening of global supplies and oil exporter Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began at the end of February.
Given the extreme volatility of the markets, it is unclear if buyers and sellers would be able to agree on the value of assets, the sources said.
CNOOC, which holds a 43.2% stake in the Buzzard field, oversaw investment in the drilling of new wells that arrested its declining output. Today Buzzard produces around 80,000 barrels per day. 
CNOOC also operates and holds stakes in the Scott, Telford and Rochelle North Sea fields cluster and has a 36.5% stake in the Golden Eagle field. 
Two Chinese industry executives said the planned sale was part of a broader review of CNOOC's international assets as the Chinese giant seeks to focus on its most profitable and largest assets as well as new development prospects in Guyana and Uganda.
One of the sources said CNOOC's top mangement, including chairman Wang Dongjin, found managing former Nexen assets in Western nations such as Britain, Canada and the United States was ""uncomfortable"" because of red tape and high operating costs compared with developing nations. 
Growing trade tensions between the United States and China, exacerbated by China's stance over the war in Ukraine, have also played a role, as China fears possible tarrifs and sanctions in the future could impact its investments, a banking source said.
All of the sources asked not to be named because the sale is not yet public.

CNOOC's success in making sizeable discoveries offshore China, particularly in the vast Bohai Bay basin, has given it confidence to offload these marginal assets, the two Chinese sources said.
CNOOC reported on Wednesday record annual net profit for 2021, with earnings nearly tripled from 2020.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded 1% lower in premarket Wednesday, giving up its previous session’s gains amid reports of the company tying up supplies of nickel in secret deals.
The stock had added $84 billion in valuations Monday on the company’s plans for a second stock split in less than two years.
Tesla is focused on nickel-based chemistries for longer-range vehicles. It uses iron phosphate for shorter-range vehicles.
According to a Bloomberg report, among the many such deals the world’s most valuable automaker signed, is a multiyear supply pact with mining giant Vale. The agreement, which hasn’t been announced, covers nickel from Canada, the report said.
The efforts are part of CEO Elon Musk’s focus on vertical integration to maintain control over the supply chain, important for controlling costs and ensuring timely deliveries.
Musk has repeatedly flagged nickel supply as the company’s biggest concern and the metal’s availability is a source of anxiety throughout the EV sector. Battery-sector demand for nickel is expected to more than triple to about 1.5 million tons in 2030 from 400,745 tons this year, according to BloombergNEF.
Sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have added to worries about secure supplies, since the country holds about 17% of global capacity for refined Class 1 nickel, the type required for EVs.
The London Metal Exchange had to intervene on March 8 to calm the nickel market after prices spiked as much as 250% in two sessions to go beyond $100,000 a ton. That spike was due to a short squeeze and the gains have mostly pared since, but the market remains anxious about where prices are headed.
In January, Tesla committed to buy 75,000 metric tons of nickel concentrate from a Talon Metals (TSX:TLO) project being developed in Minnesota. That followed agreements with BHP (NYSE:BHP).

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a shortage of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in a car and are unique to each model, hitting the automotive sector.
""This threatens a loss of truck production for several weeks and a massive reduction in production in the second quarter,"" MAN said in a statement on Wednesday.
Since March 14, production has been at a standstill at its truck plants in Munich and Krakow, and it has seen significant production downtimes in Nuremberg, Salzgitter and Wittlich, MAN said.
MAN said it would take several months to duplicate Ukrainian supply structures for truck wiring harnesses in other countries.
In addition, it has decided to stop spending on non-business-critical activities and implement a hiring freeze. 
MAN has prolonged shortened working hours in Munich, Nuremberg, Salzgitter and Wittlich, and extended them to include administration.
""This means that up to 11,000 MAN employees in Germany will go on short-time work at the peak,"" it said, adding that country-specific regulations would apply to employees abroad. 

MAN has offered customers the possibility to cancel their orders as it is unable to meet its agreed delivery deadlines. They can also place orders at new conditions, it said.

The analyst said he is more confident in his Q1 delivery forecasts of 2,100 units and sees scope for upside. RBCs data shows an improving production ramp, Spak said in a client note.
Earlier this month, Rivian suggested they produced 1,410 vehicles in 2022 but said that in recent weeks the average weekly production rate was practically doubled to Q421 numbers.
RBC estimates the weekly production of around 320 vehicles per week. This implies a Q122 production level of ~2.37k.
We note that Visible Alpha consensus 1Q22 deliveries is 1.5k (but based on only 7 inputs). We forecast 1Q22 production is closer to the 2.4k level but assume that ~1 week of production is in transit, Spak added.
The analyst also weighed in on the massive selloff in Rivian shares.
The bar has been reset, we continue to have faith in management, the product, the business plan and the go-to-market strategy. We also believe Rivian is thinking thoughtfully about the entire value chain and how that needs to evolve (down and upstream). The near-term risk is supply chain, but we believe management contemplated the risks in their revised outlook. We view current levels as an attractive entry point for long-term holders. Tactically, as shown above, we may start to get more positive data points. Hitting near-term expectations can lead investors to gain more confidence in outer-year potential. And the valuation looks relatively attractive with an interesting risk/reward, Spak added.

620,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:26AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that a proposed sovereign Eurobond buyback would stop discrimination against Russian bondholders, who he said were not able to access funds sent to settlement system Euroclear, Interfax reported. 
Russia has offered to buy back dollar bonds maturing next week in roubles in a move seen by analysts as helping local holders of the $2 billion sovereign issue receive payment, while easing Moscow's hard-currency repayment burden.
The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4, Russia's biggest debt payment this year, follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its actions in Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.
""This is because we see money coming into Euroclear successfully reaching foreign holders, money on our debts,"" Interfax quoted Siluanov as saying. ""And settlements are frozen for Russian resident holders.""
Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""So in this case we have offered to settle directly with our residents in roubles, so as not to discriminate against our security holders and have proposed the possibility of buying back our debt from Russian residents,"" Siluanov added.
The finance ministry did not say how much of the issue is owned by foreign investors, but a Russian source familiar with the process said that the bulk of the Eurobond due on April 4 is split among Russian holders. 
The rouble initially crumbled after the sanctions, plunging by as much as 40% against the dollar since the start of 2022, but has since recovered some ground and was trading at around 83 to the dollar on Wednesday.
Although that is some way off levels of around 75 before Russia began what it calls a special operation in Ukraine, there were signs that the buyback may be popular among Russian bondholders. 
""Some Finam clients have those Eurobonds in their portfolio and they plan to take part in the finance ministry's buyback,"" said Dmitry Lesnov, head of Finam brokerage's client service development department. 
""The benefit of this decision may be that clients receive certainty on their positions and will be able to receive payments on assets, in spite of restrictions, introduced by European depositories Euroclear and Clearstream,"" Lesnov said. 
The bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30. 

Bondholders who do not sell their Eurobonds under the voluntary offer will be paid in U.S. dollars on April 4, another source familiar with the buyout process said. Russia has made other dollar coupon payments earlier this month. 
Russia's next deadline is on March 31, when a $447 million payment falls due. On April 4, it is also due to pay $84 million in coupons on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond.

Discount stores, which have benefited from shoppers turning to off-price retailers to protect their pockets during the pandemic-led economic downturn, have been bumping up prices and focusing on selling costlier items to offset shrinking margins.
Dollarama's U.S. counterpart  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) also raised prices for most of its products to $1.25 from the traditional $1 price point last year, in a bid to protect its profits from spiraling freight costs.
Montreal-based Dollarama, which has over 1,400 stores across Canada, said it expects supply chain and other inflationary pressures to be more this year and projected a decline in gross margins for its fiscal year 2023. 
The company said it expects annual gross margin to be between 42.9% and 43.9%. It reported a gross margin of 43.9% in the fiscal year ended Jan. 30.
Dollarama also saw a boost from increased spending on seasonal items in the holiday quarter, as well as price-sensitive shoppers looking to buy everyday essentials at cheaper rates, as higher prices of everything from clothing to cooking sauces began to hit consumers' wallets.
The dollar store chain posted an 11% rise in fourth-quarter sales, in line with analysts' average estimate, even as a fresh round of COVID-related restrictions hampered footfalls at its stores over the holiday season.
Sales rose to C$1.22 billion ($977.64 million) in the quarter from C$1.10 billion a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday proposed expanding the definition of broker-dealers and mandating that Principal Trading Firms (PTFs) must register with the agency in a bid to enhance market resiliency and help level the playing field.
The Wall Street regulator said its proposal, which is subject to public consultation, aims to expand the definition of a dealer as ""one that engages in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,"" which would capture a range of activities it sees as critical to the agency's monitoring of systemic risk.
""In recent years, we've seen a number of high-profile events in markets with significant participation by PTFs. Tremors in the Treasuries markets in 2014, 2019, and at the beginning of the COVID crisis in 2020 demonstrate the importance of the SEC's oversight of dealers,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.
Monday's proposal specifies that broker dealers who routinely make comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day must register with the regulator. 
Dealers who ""routinely express trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other market participants"" must also be registered, the SEC said, in addition to mandating that a dealer must register with the agency if she earns revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer.
The regulator also seeks to scrutinize dealers who capture any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests.

Regulators have long argued that high-frequency trading, a computerized strategy that can move billions of dollars in fractions of a second, carries risks in the U.S. government bond market that threaten the ability of the market to function, as well as the ability of investors to fairly value assets.
The SEC, as the U.S. market's regulator, should require that such trading firms comply with capital and record-keeping rules and be subject to periodic exams, much like equities and corporate bond markets, Gensler has argued.

The analyst is cautious on HOOD as he sees strong competition that will likely weigh on user growth. Moreover, 2022 is seen as a transition year.
HOOD has established a presence in the retail trading marketplace with a sleek and user-friendly mobile app offering free stock, options, and crypto trading. We see a significant opportunity for HOOD to grow with this ~150m Gen Y/Z demographic as they age into their prime earning and savings years. The financial super app the company envisions can offer a full suite of financial services products with significant revenue potential, just as SCHW has met the needs of the baby boomers and Gen X, Cyprys said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley projects the account growth at a 6% CAGR to 41 million by 2031 and a similar 6% CAGR through 2024, which is significantly below the Street consensus of 13%.
Overall, Cyprys is bullish on Robinhood's long-term potential and opportunity set but sees near-term challenges and limited visibility.
A higher interest rate environment reduces shareholder patience to wait for progress on growth and the path to profitability. HOOD went public in July 2021 at $38/share, and with the stock down ~80% from the August peak, we see sentiment skewing negative, though a $7/share cash pile provides downside support. However, tough comparisons loom over the next several quarters: Retail customer engagement in the markets has softened in the more challenging macro/geopolitical backdrop, pressuring account growth and transactional revenues, Cyprys concluded.
The set price target implies a near 6% downside compared to Tuesday's closing price.

624,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The rouble firmed on Wednesday, extending a recovery and heading towards levels seen before Russia launched what it calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine.
Stocks inched higher on the fifth trading day after a month-long hiatus.
At 1147 GMT, the rouble was 2% higher at 83.50 against the dollar and had touched 82.55 on the Moscow Exchange, a level last seen on Feb. 25, the day after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.
Against the euro, the rouble rose 2% to 92.30, having briefly hit 90.73, its strongest since Feb. 23.
The rouble is now driven by export-focused companies that are obliged to sell foreign currency as well as by month- and quarter-end tax payments that boost demand for roubles, while importers' activity is low, said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank.
""This created an imbalance on the currency market as a result of which foreign currency supply substantially exceeds demand and thus leads to the firming of the (rouble) rate... I see the current (rouble) rate strengthening as temporary,"" Orlova said.
Dynamics driving the rouble lately are to some extent artificial. The currency, which had been free-floating until late February, is now steered by capital controls, a ban on buying cash dollars and euros and other administrative measures.
Sberbank CIB said the rouble could continue firming until the central bank starts to ease capital controls.
On the interbank market, the rouble traded at about 83 against the dollar. Banks offered to sell euros at 91.25 roubles and buy at 95 roubles.
This week, the rouble received some support from the recent round of Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, where the Russian delegation promised to scale down military operations around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.
The Russian currency is extending gains made last week after President Vladimir Putin demanded that natural gas exported to Europe or the United States be paid for in his country's currency.
European countries, which import about 40% of their gas from Russia and pay mostly in euros, say state-controlled Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is not entitled to redraw contracts. The G7 group of nations rejected Moscow's demands this week.
VOLATILE STOCKS
Russian stocks have moved sharply and sometimes erratically in the past few days, after the central bank allowed the market to end a nearly month-long pause. 
Trading hours on the stock market are shorter than in the past and trading volumes are far lower than normal, and non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
London-listed internet firm VK, one of a few companies to have flagged issues with servicing debt, saw its Moscow depositary receipts rallying 27% at some point on Wednesday after a 72.3% leap the day before. They ended the day 9.7% higher.
Shares in Russian state energy company Inter RAO jumped 25.5% after that firm recommended paying dividends.

The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 7.7% to 949.23 points, and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 4.3% higher at 2,513.0 points.
Flag carrier Aeroflot, one of the most volatile securities since the reopening, jumped 24.7%. Oil major Rosneft was 4.6% higher and dominant state lender Sberbank gained 4.5%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's H&M is seen swinging back to profit in its December-February quarter as pandemic effects ease, though the closure of its Russian stores and the economic fallout from war in Ukraine has made the company's outlook more uncertain. 
Analysts polled by Refinitiv on average expect the world's second-biggest fashion retailer to report a pretax profit of 1.04 billion crowns ($112.2 million) for its first quarter on Thursday.
Sales were up 23% year-on-year, H&M has reported, but down 11% from two years earlier, before the pandemic.
The year-ago period, when nearly half of stores closed due to the second wave of the pandemic, H&M made a 1.39 billion crown loss. Two years ago, it made a 2.50 billion crown profit.
Alongside many other companies reacting to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, H&M on March 2 said it would temporarily close its stores in Russia, expressing concerns about the ""tragic developments in Ukraine"". 
Some companies, such as brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), have decided to exit Russia permanently, while the Kremlin has threatened to seize assets of companies that pull out.
Russia was H&M's sixth-biggest market with 4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. While the group is reducing its store count overall, it has been increasing its number of stores in Russia, to 170 at the end of November.
Analysts have been lowering full-year earnings estimates for H&M recently.
""For H&M we could see further downside risk to estimates if H&M decides to pull out of Russia/Ukraine permanently due to the conflict there, or this leads to further upwards pressure on inflation and commodity prices,"" RBC analysts said in a note.
H&M's sales halt in Russia follows a sharp drop in demand in China over the past year, related to concerns the group has expressed about workers' rights in the Xinjiang cotton growing province. China had accounted for around 4% of H&M's sales. 
As recently as January H&M unveiled targets to double sales by 2030 and to reach an operating margin of 10% by 2024. Last year it reached 7.7%.
Competitor and market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, grew sales 33% year-on-year, and 21% from the same period in 2019, in the six weeks from Feb. 1.

H&M's shares are down 18% so far this year, while the European retail index is down 22%, and Inditex 26%.

Investing.com – BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock gained 8% in premarket trading Wednesday after the company beat fourth-quarter estimates and promised to channel its surging cash flows from its life-saving Covid-19 vaccines into the research of similar therapies for oncology and other infectious diseases.
A special dividend of 2 euros per share and a likely buyback of up to $1.5 billion worth of shares were also adding to the gains in the stock. The company expects to authorize the share repurchase plan that will be executed over two years.
The company expects its Covid-19 vaccines to generate sales of anywhere between 13 billion euros and 17 billion euros. That will be less than the 19 billion euros the company booked in 2021 and indicates a slight softening of demand with much of the world’s population vaccinated with at least one dose. The virus is also expected to weaken with most of the world having had at least two surges since 2020.
Revenue in the final quarter was 16 times higher at 5.53 billion euros, riding on the unique mRNA technology in the company's vaccines that saved millions of lives the world over. Under collaboration agreements, territories have been allocated amongst BioNTech,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and Fosun Pharma (HK:2196) based on marketing and distribution rights. Gross profits are shared between the companies.
As of mid-March, BioNTech and Pfizer have signed orders for nearly 2.4 billion doses in 2022, the former said in a release. As of the beginning of this month, they have so far delivered more than 3.1 billion doses of BNT162b2 to more than 170 countries.
Net profit in the quarter was 3.16 billion euros.
The company said it is developing the next generation of Covid-19 vaccines while fully leveraging the potential of all technology platforms across autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and regenerative medicines.

628,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated the research coverage on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block (NYSE:SQ) with a Buy rating.
On the former, Ng forecasts EPS growth of over 20% after 2022, which should likely help PYPL shares to re-rate following massive losses suffered recently.
The EPS growth will be driven by secular tailwinds from the digitization of payments and e-commerce growth, abating headwinds after 2022 (e.g., eBay, supply chain, credit & funding normalization), and product initiatives to improve monetization & market share at Venmo and Paypal.
Ng has a $144.00 per share price target on PYPL, which signals an upside of nearly 19%.
Similarly, Ng started Block at Buy with a $173.00 per share price target.
SQ is well-positioned to benefit from Cash App's growing monetization from new product features (e.g., tax preparation, card spending, cash management, stock investing, Bitcoin) while enjoying ongoing user growth from the network effects of P2P payments, as well as Square's continued share gains within SMB acquiring. The recent acquisition of Afterpay should generate synergies and integrate the Square and Cash App ecosystems through the addition of new consumers and merchants, as well as helping to establish commerce & brand discovery features into Cash App while generating leads for merchants, the analyst wrote in a client note.

The analyst remains bullish on Disney's Theme Park recovery as metrics show that the company is yet to experience strong demand despite achieving near-record results in FY1Q.
This prediction is backed by the following factors:
All these factors are likely to provide additional tailwinds over the next 18-24 months.
The robust recovery, thus far, is currently being driven by a bounce back in domestic attendance, yield management, Genie+ and strong merchandise sales. DIS was opportunistic during the pandemic to implement transformational changes to the park to increase the longer term operating margin potential of the business. These include implementing a new park reservation system, mobile ordering, managing annual pass holder visits (which are typically lower revenue generators), integrating food and merchandise through storytelling (a large driver of per-cap increases) and new attractions, Reif Ehrlich said in a client note.
The analyst expects to see new investments in attractions, ships, locations to continue driving additional attendance.
As a result, Reif Ehrlich raised FY23/24 estimates for Parks, Experiences and Products. The analyst is also positive about other parts of Walt Disney's business.
With the parks in strong recovery mode, content ramping for Disney+, peak Disney+ losses expected in FY22, and options on sports betting, NFTs, metaverse, etc., Disney is entering a period of very strong earnings growth (44% EPS CAGR ˜21-24E), the BofA analyst concluded.

630,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. profits are likely to feel the heat from a jump in wages this year caused by a historically tight labor market, according to Morgan Stanley strategists. 
“The challenges companies face in attracting workers seems to be worsening in quarters,” strategists including Andrew Pauker and Michael Wilson wrote in a note.
Companies have so far responded by raising prices to offset higher wage costs, but that could become increasingly difficult as demand weakens across industries such as household durables and autos, they said.
After consistently lagging behind productivity growth over the past two decades, wages have rapidly caught up in the post-pandemic economic recovery. What’s more, the jump in costs is likely here to stay, rather than being a temporary squeeze as fiscal policies lead to persistently tight labor markets.
“Wage gains are not just due to the rapid recovery from the Covid-19 shock that may ease as the economy loses some steam,” said Morgan Stanley economists Julian Richers and Ellen Zentner. “Instead, higher wage growth in excess of productivity is likely to be the norm, not the exception for some time as the labor share of corporate income normalizes.”
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists flagged the issue last month, saying that concerns about rising wages had dominated fourth-quarter earnings calls at S&P 500 companies. 
For Morgan Stanley strategists, a “full convergence of real wages with productivity implies that economy-wide pretax profit margins would fall to 10.7% from 17.8%.” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts expect operating margins of 16.5% in 2022.
Earnings Could ‘Make It or Break It’ for Stocks: Barclays’ Cau
The Morgan Stanley strategists recommend utilities, telecoms and energy as sectors that are relatively immune to higher wages, while hotels, restaurants and leisure, retailers and healthcare providers and services are more exposed. 
Among individual stocks, investors should focus on names that still have the ability to pass on costs to consumers, that have more flexible cost structures and more durable margins.
They listed FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).,  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)., AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO). and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) among firms “adversely exposed” to wage pressures.

631,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MILAN (Reuters) - A strategic plan for Generali (MI:GASI) backed by rebel shareholder Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone goes in the right direction by setting up the company for growth, another of the top investors in Italy's biggest insurer was quoted as saying.
Leonardo Del Vecchio, the billionaire founder of eyewear giant Luxottica and the third-largest investor in Generali behind Caltagirone, told Bloomberg in an interview that candidates put forward for Generali's board by Caltagirone were ""highly competent and well balanced."" 
Construction magnate Caltagirone has challenged the reappointment of Generali Chief Executive Philippe Donnet, by proposing the group's former head of Austria, Luciano Cirina, as an alternative CEO.
His slate of board nominees also includes former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna as chairman.
The duo unveiled their strategic plan for Generali, dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"" in a reference to the insurer's symbol, on Friday in Milan.
Del Vecchio, 86, expressed appreciation for the plan saying it reflected ""a long-term entrepreneurial vision that doesn't just look for dividends but also at the need to grow the company.""
Del Vecchio holds around 8% of Generali and is considering further raising the stake, Bloomberg reported quoting sources familiar with the matter.
Generali's board, with backing from the company's single largest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), has proposed handing Donnet a third term as CEO when shareholders vote to name a new board on April 29.
Donnet in December presented his own three-year strategy for Generali, hiking dividends and announcing the first share buyback in 15 years.
The alternative plan Donnet's challengers unveiled on Friday targets much higher profit growth to be achieved in part through mergers and acquisitions, as well as cost-cutting.
Del Vecchio said he hoped to see ""major and transformative transactions"" at Generali, which a chairman ""with operating capabilities"" could help to achieve.
The Luxottica founder also backed the choice of Cirina, who was fired by Generali on Monday for alleged breach of contract, as CEO because he came from within the group.
Finally, he took aim at Mediobanca, in which he is in turn the single biggest investor with nearly 20%, saying Generali's growth may have been ""held back by a shareholder that is only interested in extracting dividends.""

Mediobanca derives a third of its profits from its near 13% Generali stake and Del Vecchio in the past has criticised what he deemed an excessive reliance on the Generali contribution.
To counter the two tycoons' weight at the April 29 AGM Mediobanca has borrowed shares in Generali to reach a 17% voting stake, a move which also drew criticism from Del Vecchio.

632,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 07:03AM ET</span>",,,"BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating and a $215.00 per share price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares following reports that the Cupertino-based giant is planning to cut iPhone SE production.
Nikkei recently reported that Apple is looking to produce 20% fewer iPhone SE next quarter as it is experiencing weaker demand amid war in Ukraine. Moreover, the report noted some order cuts for iPhone 13 and AirPods.
Mohan reiterated that the demand for iPhones remains strong following his analysis of iPhone trade-in prices.
Apple is offering trade-in values that are at a discount compared to 3rd parties in the U.S. and the UK. Further, Apple recently reduced the trade-in prices for the majority of its models in the U.S., UK and China. In our opinion, lower Apple trade-in prices vs 3rd parties and the reduction in overall iPhone trade-in prices signifies strong demand. This compares to the year 2019 when Apple was offering high trade-in prices vs 3rd parties to drive upgrades, Mohan said in a client note.
Moreover, BofA's recent survey showed that over 25% of respondents globally still have old iPhones (iPhone 8 or earlier).
We see this as an opportunity for driving a replacement cycle. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus ownership is relatively higher in China compared to the U.S. and U.K. Apple could be targeting to upgrade these users to a newer iPhone which could be a reason Apple still accepts the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models for trade-in in China but not in the U.S. and U.K.
The analyst is also not worried about the new round of lockdowns in Shanghai as both Apple and Foxconn are able to relocate production to other non-impacted areas.
We do not expect a material impact from these shutdowns, Mohan concluded.

(Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747-8 freighter leased to Russia's AirBridgeCargo has flown to California from Hong Kong, according to FlightRadar24, after a U.S. judge signed an order allowing lessor BOC Aviation Ltd to repossess it.
The order was unsealed and made public on Tuesday, court documents showed and the aircraft arrived in the United States on March 25, according to the flight tracking service. 
BOC Aviation and its lawyers declined to comment.
Singapore-based BOC Aviation is one of many global aircraft lessors that had planes on lease to Russian airlines before sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced the cancellation of leases and insurance policies.
More than 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion remain in Russia despite a Monday deadline for contract cancellations, though the Interfax news agency last week reported that 78 had been seized abroad.
BOC Aviation shares closed 4.4% higher on Wednesday, outpacing a 1.4% rise in the Hong Kong index. The lessor on March 10 said its 18 planes leased to Russian airlines had a book value of $935 million and could be affected by insurance policy cancellations.
In court documents filed on March 14, BOC Aviation sought orders for one of three 747-8 freighters on lease to AirBridgeCargo that was in Hong Kong to be repossessed and flown to the United States for storage.
BOC Aviation said the aircraft was worth $148 million and that AirBridgeCargo had breached leases for two other 747-8s when it flew the planes, which were in mainland China, back to Russia despite the lessor's explicit instructions to ground them on March 5 after insurance coverage was cancelled. 
One of the planes returned to Russia even after its airworthiness certificate was suspended by Bermuda, the location of registry, BOC Aviation said.
Those two freighters remain in Russia, according to FlightRadar24 data. 

Volga-Dnepr Group, the owner of AirBridgeCargo, said on March 18 it had grounded the subsidiary's fleet of Boeing planes because of Western sanctions, according to media reports. 
A Volga-Dnepr spokesperson on Wednesday declined to comment on the situation, citing ongoing negotiations with lessors.

(Reuters) - A Zimbabwean company that had been banking on Chinese financing to build a major coal-fired power plant says it is now looking for alternative backers as China pulls back on funding such projects overseas.
The effort by RioZim Ltd, one of Zimbabwe's biggest mining and energy companies, reflects how China's recent U-turn on foreign coal financing is forcing developing nations across Africa and Asia to rethink their energy plans. China, which had been a top funder of coal power projects around the globe, announced in September it would not build new coal projects abroad as part of efforts to curb future carbon emissions.
Energy and climate specialists are watching to see the impact, including whether it will force a speedier shift to cleaner energy, result in other funders stepping in or lead to power shortages. Zimbabwe, which already suffers from a lack of electricity, has among the biggest coal reserves in Africa.
""The energy policy juncture Zimbabwe now finds itself at is emblematic of what many developing countries around the world are facing,"" said Leo Roberts, UK-based research manager who focuses on coal transition at climate think tank E3G.
Plans for the multi-billion dollar Sengwa power plant in northwest Zimbabwe involve more than doubling the country's current electricity capacity.
RioZim's energy division, Rio Energy, had been hoping for funding for the planned plant and associated coal mine from Chinese banks Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China Minsheng Banking Corporation Ltd.
Now, Rio Energy is considering alternative financing plans. ""We are still in the market to fund the project and we will work with all possible funders, including the Chinese,"" parent RioZim told Reuters.
The company said another option under consideration is to transform the project to a gas-powered plant, but that idea is ""subject to the outcome of feasibility studies"" and no time frame for those has been set.
RioZim told Reuters that ICBC and Minsheng Bank ""came in to play a supporting role"" but that it can't comment on the current status of their involvement because it doesn't have a direct relationship with the companies. Chinese bank financing for coal power plants overseas has often been arranged to support Chinese construction companies, which then enter into building contracts with the company planning the power plant.
ICBC told representatives of environmental non-governmental organisations in a June 2021 meeting that the bank would no longer finance the Sengwa project, according to two people who attended the meeting.
ICBC did not respond to requests for comment, including about the meeting or whether it plans to fund the Sengwa project. Minsheng Bank also didn't respond to Reuters questions about funding plans.
Plans for another large coal power project in Zimbabwe, known as Lusulu, are also up in the air, according to PER Lusulu Power, the Harare-based energy company behind the plant which had been planning on Chinese backing.
A Zimbabwe government spokesperson declined to comment on the status of either project. He said Zimbabwe has the right to exploit its coal resources if needed and would not ""sacrifice growth prospects on the altar of arguments to do with the environment.""
China's foreign ministry didn't respond to questions about the status of the funding of the Sengwa and Lusulu projects. But it said Beijing will support developing countries in shifting to greener energy.
The foreign ministry added that China, which has close economic and diplomatic ties with Harare, ""will increase its support to Zimbabwe's development of renewable energy power projects, and help Zimbabwe's sustainable development.""
HANGING IN THE BALANCE
Christine Shearer, programme director for coal at U.S. think tank Global Energy Monitor, said Chinese financing for coal power appears to be frozen.
Despite the lack of clarity about what Xi's announcement means for planned projects, no new coal plants have since publicly announced Chinese support, ""suggesting the international financing tap for new coal projects from China has indeed been turned off,"" said Shearer.
Globally, some $63 billion of Chinese state financing across 57 projects could be at risk from China's withdrawal from coal financing overseas, according to Global Energy Monitor. The pullback could cut Africa's pipeline of coal power projects by two thirds to 3.6 gigawatts (GW), estimates think tank E3G. 
In Zimbabwe, less than half the population has access to electricity. The country has been betting on coal-fired power to address chronic electricity shortages and create jobs.
RioZim has talked about building the Sengwa plant for more than a decade. Plans include adding 2.8 gigawatts (GW) to the grid and restarting the adjacent coal mine, which has been closed since 2014. Currently, Zimbabwe has the capacity to generate around 2.3 GW, which comes mostly from a large hydroelectric power plant but also four coal-fired power stations.
The planned Sengwa plant, near the town of Gokwe, would create 1,100 permanent jobs and nearly four times as many temporary construction jobs, according to Rio Energy. Sedeya Jetro, head of a local primary school, said the jobs would enable parents to pay school fees and ""mean a lot to this community.""
Rio Energy told Reuters that ICBC had in 2019 provided an expression of interest - or non-binding commitment - to a Chinese construction company to fund the first phase of the Sengwa project. Neither the construction company, PowerChina International Engineering Co., nor its parent, Power Construction Corporation of China, responded to requests for comment.
Minsheng Bank also provided a non-binding commitment to RioZim to fund a second phase of the Sengwa project, according to Rio Energy and an August 2020 letter of interest from Minsheng Bank that Reuters reviewed. The pledge expired in February 2021, according to the letter.
A Minsheng Bank official who signed the document said in an emailed response to Reuters that the letter of interest was ""a trade secret"" and didn't respond to questions about funding plans. Spokespeople for Minsheng Bank and ICBC didn't respond to requests for comment.
Rio Energy was hoping for $3.4 billion of funding for the second phase of the power plant, according to a draft contract with a unit of engineering and construction company China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC). The contract, which was reviewed by Reuters, was dated November 2020 and drafted by both companies.
In response to questions about the planned Sengwa plant, CGGC's parent company China Energy Engineering Corporation told Reuters that a subsidiary signed a construction cooperation agreement in 2020. ""There is no progress on this project currently,"" it said, citing a lack of financing commitments.
PER Lusulu Power plans to build the 2.1 GW Lusulu plant in Zimbabwe's western province of Matabeleland North. It announced in 2015 that Chinese financial institutions had agreed to fund its construction, subject to conditions. PER Lusulu Power's website says the company entered into a construction contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation, which would secure debt finance from Bank of China.
PER Lusulu Power had also sought financing of up to $2 billion for the project from ICBC, according to extracts of a term sheet dated August 2020 viewed by Reuters. The term sheet is a non-binding agreement setting out the terms and conditions for an investment. It was unsigned, and was prepared by ICBC, according to a person familiar with the document.
Bank of China said in a statement that it doesn't have any electricity projects in Zimbabwe and has no plans to develop any. ICBC and China State Construction Engineering did not respond to questions about the Lusulu project. 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
One Chinese-funded project that is progressing is in the northwestern town of Hwange, where construction was already well underway when China announced its coal-funding freeze. The project involves the expansion of an existing coal-power plant and has been financed by a loan of roughly $1 billion from Export-Import Bank of China, the Zimbabwe government has said.Zimbabwe Power Company, which manages the plant, said in a November statement that the expansion ""continues to progress well"" and was more than two thirds complete. China's EximBank didn't respond to a request for comment.
The project is expected to increase employment by nearly doubling the current 2,853-strong workforce, while also sustaining the town's coal-mining industry, which employs thousands more people. The Zimbabwean government spokesperson said the country will be much better placed to meet electricity demand once the expansion - which is due to add 600 megawatts - is complete.
Renewable power advocates in Africa and elsewhere say China's pullback from coal power provides an opportunity to clean up. Zimbabwe is expanding its plans for generating renewable energy, such as solar power, but such projects can require fewer permanent employees than coal, making them less attractive for governments keen to generate employment. 

Sydney Gata, executive chairman of the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, said that an instant switch to solar and wind isn't feasible given the scale of the country's power needs.
""Renewables are not an immediate plan B for Zimbabwe,"" he said.

The second proposal valued each Pearson share at 854.2 pence while the third offer came in at 884.2 pence. Pearson shares were trading at 697 pence at 0950 GMT on Wednesday. 
""The board of Pearson considered the third proposal, together with its financial and legal advisers, and concluded that it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects,"" it said in a statement.
""Accordingly, the board of Pearson unanimously rejected the third proposal.""
Pearson's decision to dismiss a takeover, after it spent seven years navigating the difficult switch from traditional learning to online, will put even more focus on boss Andy Bird, and whether his new strategy can work. 

Bird has lately sharpened Pearson's focus to sell directly to consumers and not just schools, colleges or shops, while also expanding into the workforce training sector with recent acquisitions.
The company recently set medium-term targets for the first time in six years, believing it has turned the corner after changes in the industry hit its once thriving U.S. higher education courseware business, leading to a string of profit warnings. ($1 = 0.7605 pounds)

Chewy reported fourth-quarter net sales of $2.39 billion, up 17% YoY and below the analyst consensus of $2.42 billion. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $28.1 million, compared to a $60.8 million profit in the year-ago period and an expected loss of $73,000.
The number of active customers in the quarter was reported at 20.7 million, missing the consensus projection of 20.9 million. Net sales per active customer came in at $430, just above the analyst expectations of $429.61. Chewy reported a Q4 gross margin of 25.4%, compared to 27.1% in the year-ago period and consensus estimates of 26.2%.
For the first quarter, the retailer of pet-related products expects net sales in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.43 billion, missing the analyst estimates of $2.51 billion. For the full year, Chewy expects net sales to range from $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, below the consensus projection of $10.79 billion.
The company expects the FY2022 gross margin to be in line with the FY2021 gross margin.
Our ability to deliver 24% net sales growth in 2021, on top of the outsized growth we delivered last year, reflects the durability of our business and the Pet category beyond the near-term benefits of the pandemic, and is a strong testament to Chewy's ability to execute in the face of rapidly evolving macro conditions, CEO Sumit Singh said.
BofA analyst Nat Schindler lowered the price target to $108.00 per share, down from the prior $133.00 following as earnings suggest the company is suffering a growth slowdown in the first half of this year. Still, Schindler remains Buy-rated as he likes the long-term Chewy story.
We continue to see Chewy's subscription-driven model and recession-resistant segment as appealing and sustainable heading into a post-pandemic world. We reiterate our Buy rating and shift our valuation model by a year to FY23, Schindler said in a client note.
Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler echoed Schindler's comments.
Long-term, we remain positive on CHWY fundamentals given: 1) the significant shift in pet care spending to the digital channel; 2) predictable customer economics; and 4) our expectation for 15%+ long-term revenue growth and 5-10% long-term EBITDA margins (vs. ~1% in FY21). That said, we believe shares are fairly valued at ~7.5x FY22 EV/Gross Profit and believe that risk/reward is balanced at current levels, Kessler wrote in a memo to clients.

Investing.com –  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock surged 7.5% in premarket trading Wednesday after the company issued a strong forecast for the year, indicating sticky demand for its athletic wear.
The company benefited immensely in the last two years as people preferred its comfortable and casual clothing to manage both office and domestic chores during lockdowns. That demand isn’t weakening as people focus on health and general well-being more than they ever did.
For the year, the company expects revenue to be $7.49-7.61 billion. Diluted profit per share is seen at $9.25 at the midpoint of its guidance range.
The company crossed $6 billion in annual revenue for the first time while net revenue in the fourth quarter through January 30 rose 23% to $2.1 billion.
It was up 21% in North America and 35% internationally despite many of its stores operating for fewer hours in the last quarter.
Like most other companies, LULU continues to see cost pressures in labor, raw materials, and transportation. As a result, prices hikes will follow, Reuters quoted Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald as telling analysts.
""We are taking modest selective price increases over the course of the year... It's a very small portion of our styles that are impacted... this will help offset some of the pressure we're seeing on average unit cost”.
The company closed the year with 49% more inventories in dollar terms and 33% on a number of units basis, suggesting tight control over stocks in an environment of supply chain issues.
In the current quarter, net revenue is seen at $1.54 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. Diluted EPS is expected to be $1.38-1.43 for the quarter.

RH reported adjusted EPS of $5.66 in the fourth quarter, up from $5.07 in the year-ago period and beating the consensus estimates of $5.60 per share. Net revenue in the quarter came in at $902.7 million, up 11% YoY, though below the analyst estimates of $933 million.
The adjusted gross margin was reported at 50.4%, up from 47.4% in the year-ago quarter and above the consensus projection of 48.5%. The adjusted operating margin stood at 25.2% in the period, up from 23.7% in the year-ago period. RH reported a total location count of 81 in Q4.
For the current first quarter, RH expects an adjusted operating margin in the range of 23% to 23.5%. The company anticipates Q1 revenue growth of 7-8%. For the full-fiscal 2023, the company expects revenue growth of 5-7% and estimates adjusted operating margin to range between 25% to 26%.
Furthermore, the home-furnishings company said it plans for a 3-for-1 stock split in the spring.
RH's CEO Gary Friedman plans to offload roughly 1.7 million shares related to 2.9 million options that are due to expire. Following the sale, Friedman will retain beneficial ownership of around 21%.
The company said that rising inflation and interest rates, as well as geopolitical tensions, continue to add to the uncertainty. It said first-quarter sales and margin trends remain healthy, though the company has seen softening demand following Russias invasion of Ukraine and the consequent market volatility.
Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski upgraded RH to Buy from Hold with a $560.00 per share price target.
Matuszewski argues that the plunge in RHs P/E seems excessive, hence he sees a solid buying opportunity in a high-quality and branded business. The analyst also sees strong demand for furniture driven by the companys initiatives.
Elsewhere, BofA analyst Curtis Nagle lowered the price target to $650.00 per share from the prior $700.00 after not so cool results.
Despite recent uncertainty, RH management has also never been more positive on the company's competitive positioning, reiterating several large growth initiatives launching this year and long-term revenue targets. RH is operating with strong margins in a difficult environment, and has optionality with $2.2bn of cash on its balance sheet. We expect continued domestic share gains and new market expansion in Europe and reiterate our Buy rating, Nagle said in a client note.

IKEA said it was committed to retaining as many affected workers as possible, noting it would create over 600 other jobs across the capital before the store closes.
A period of consultation with affected workers has begun.
""The proposal to close the Tottenham store follows an extensive assessment of IKEA UK’s presence in London in line with changing shopping behaviours,"" IKEA said, noting that last year, almost half of its sales were made online.
""This, combined with the redevelopment of the area where the store is located, prompted (IKEA) to assess the long-term viability of the site.""
Trade union Usdaw said the closure was ""devastating news"".
IKEA has five other London stores - in Croydon, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Lakeside and Wembley.

It said it was investing over 1 billion pounds ($1.31 billion) in London over the next three years, including opening a new fulfilment centre in Dartford in December this year and a new store on Oxford Street in autumn 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of the Ukraine war on banks in the European Union is 'manageable' but the effects of commodity markets on lenders needs to be watched, the bloc's body for winding down failing banks said on Wednesday.
The war has created volatility in markets like commodities and raised the spectre of a slowdown in the economy.
""We are monitoring the entire banking space, looking at first round impact, which seems from all we are seeing manageable,"" Elke Koenig, chair of the Single Resolution Board, told a media conference.
The impact of commodity markets on banks is an area to be watched, however, Koenig said.
""I would not see anything currently that I find deeply troubling for the moment."" 
However, Koenig said she does expect the level of souring loans to pick up due to economic slowdown.
The SRB intervened in the European operations of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, which looked set to fail as due to a run on deposits after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A second Russian bank, VTB, continues to operate in Europe because, unlike with Sberbank, its largely Germany based depositors had not fled, Koenig said.
The SRB requires banks in the EU to issue a set amount of special debt that can be written down in a crisis to replenish depleted capital without the need for taxpayer bailouts.
There were no worries that banks won't meet a 2023 deadline for special debt issuance, SRB officials said, but banks need to continually be on guard as existing debt expires over time.

""You need to issue this on a constant basis,"" Koenig said.
In case of a special debt shortfall in a crisis, a backstop single resolution fund is being created with contributions from banks and will be in place soon, Koenig said.

On Wednesday, the world's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), warned that China faces ""shrinking demand, disrupted supply and weakening expectations"" in its annual earnings report.
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd(AgBank) signaled the same in its full year report. 
China's banking industry is facing ""a more complicated and severe business environment,"" the country's second-biggest lender by assets, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB), said on Tuesday.
""The global epidemic will continue to recur, the easing policies of developed economies will be withdrawn, geopolitical conflicts will intensify,"" Bank of China (BoC) also said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the president of China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom), on Friday said it would be difficult for the bank to deliver satisfactory earnings this year.
China has been battling a resurgence in COVID infections in some of its largest cities, which has led to partial and full-scale lockdowns which analysts say will be a drag on the economy.
The main impact on banks will be ""rising loan delinquencies among service sectors"", said Nicholas Zhu, a banking analyst at Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
""These industries include wholesale and retail, leisure travel and other consumer discretionary services,"" he added.
The banks' warnings about the difficult outlook came alongside full-year net profit figures from the five lenders which beat estimates.
ICBC's net profit increased 10.3% to 348.3 billion yuan, above estimates, while AgBank also outperformed. 
It was the same story at BoC, CCB and BoCom.
SOUR DEBT
The non-performing loan ratios at four of the five lenders fell, though it increased at BoC.
However, corporate bad loans to the real estate sector jumped 98% at AgBank to 28.2 billion yuan, as developers continue to smart from stringent debt rules introduced last year. At CCB, real estate bad loans rose 50% on year to 13.5 billion yuan.
Since the introduction of the 'three red lines' rules on debt ratios last year, developers large and small have had cash flow issues.
However, large banks’ exposures to distressed developers such as Evergrande only account for a small proportion of their loan books and shareholders’ equity, said Zhu. 
""The impact on some regional banks will be larger because of their portfolios’ higher concentration and fewer mitigants,"" he added.

The net interest margin, a key gauge of bank profitability, stood steady at all the lenders other than CCB.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -As a stunning rebound in U.S. stocks charges on, investors are questioning how long the surge can continue in the face of a hawkish Federal Reserve, warnings of recession from the bond market and geopolitical uncertainty. 
The S&P 500 is up 11% since March 8, its biggest 15-day percentage gain since June 2020, led by many of the high-growth stocks that have been pummeled for much of the year. The benchmark index has cut its year-to-date losses to 2.8%, after it earlier swooned by as much as 12.5%. 
The move has come despite a broad range of concerns that rocked equities earlier this quarter, among them the war in Ukraine, surging inflation and a sharp rise in Treasury yields fueled by tightening monetary policy from the Fed.
Stocks shrugged off the latest ominous sign from the bond market on Tuesday. The S&P 500 closed up 1.2% even as the widely tracked U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since September 2019, a phenomenon that has reliably predicted past recessions.
""It's been mystifying,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""I think that the bond market is sober and the equity market is quixotic."" 
Investors are pointing to a number of factors that could be driving the bounce in equities. 
Many have taken heart from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's assessment of the U.S. economy as strong enough to handle an aggressive pace of rate increases and may be cheering a Fed that now appears to be tackling sky-high inflation head on, analysts said. 
The S&P 500 has gained over 6% since the Fed's March 16 monetary policy meeting, at which it raised interest rates by 25 basis points and penciled in 150 basis points of tightening for the rest of the year.
""While stock investors love low interest rates, they don't love an inflationary environment that gets out of control,"" said J. Bryant Evans, investment advisor and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management. 
Recent weeks have also seen institutional investors driving up prices as they unwind so-called ""short"" bets against equities, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent report. 
At the same time, individual investors have been using the weakness in stocks as an opportunity to buy, the bank said.
According to Goldman, $93 billion of capital has flowed into U.S. equity funds since the start of the year, ""suggesting that households have continued to buy after the record year for U.S. equity inflows in 2021."" 
Indeed, many of the stock rally's biggest gainers have come in high-growth, retail investor favorites that had been hammered as bond yields shot higher earlier this year. Those include so-called meme stock darlings GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, whose prices have more than doubled from their 2022 lows, and Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund ETF, which is up 36.5% from its recent low.
Strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research said March 8 may have marked a bottom for the stock market this year, believing stocks are gaining support from investors using equities as a hedge against inflation, which stands at its highest level in nearly four decades. 
""The fog of war had masked the outlook, but the long-term bull market, punctuated by panic attacks, remains intact,"" he wrote on Tuesday.
The corporate earnings outlook also remains solid, even as higher energy and other prices threaten to erode profit margins. Estimates for S&P 500 profits have risen since the start of the year with companies overall expected to increase earnings by 8.8% in 2022, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
""Stocks were knocked down, but earnings estimates just kept going up,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ""Investors are hesitant to really unload on stocks here as the earnings and economic picture looks still very favorable."" 
Another factor may be investors adjusting their portfolios as the quarter winds down, strategists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said. Investor rebalancing of portfolios ""likely played a major role over the past two weeks, hurting bonds and supporting equities,"" they wrote.
Plenty of investors are suspicious of the rebound. Neuberger Berman said on Monday it was looking to ""fade"" equity rallies.
""High inflation, rising rates and slowing growth is a potentially poisonous mix for equity investors,"" Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer, multi-asset class, at Neuberger said in a written commentary. 

Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said he was holding slightly higher than normal cash levels in client portfolios.
""I am wary that this is a bear market rally that could turn around and that we could re-test the lows,"" Pavlik said.

Investing.com – Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock traded 4% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company gave a robust forecast for the ongoing quarter, suggesting demand from data centers remains strong.
Sales could touch $8.9 billion in the third quarter, the company said. At their worst, they will be $8.5 billion, but still higher than a year ago. Adjusted profit per share could touch $2.47 and will be at least $2.45.
Quarterly gross margin is also seen between 47% and 49% on an adjusted basis.
Micron is looking at a record year in fiscal 2022,” he said in an interview. “Our end market demand is strong, our customers’ demand is strong and supply is constrained,” Bloomberg quoted CEO Sanjay Mehrotra as saying.
Memory chips are now used in a wide range of consumer devices like TVs and washing machines, going beyond their traditional market of computers and smartphones. That’s helped Micron continue to grow even as the PC market slows.
A large part of Micron’s recent growth has come from supplying chips to data centers. That infrastructure has boomed as companies invest heavily in digital ecosystems to cater to customers faster and better.
Data center revenue grew more than 60% in the second quarter. Automation of factories and security systems was behind around 60% growth in industrial sales. Auto revenue set a new record.
While ruling out any impact on production volumes due to the Russia-Ukraine war but given that the region is a supplier of gases and some minerals that go into chips, costs could rise, Mehrotra said.
In the quarter through March 3, Micron’s revenue grew 25% to $7.79 billion. Net income was $2.26 billion, or $2 a share, more than triple what it was a year ago.",,,

Net revenue came in at $2.13 billion, up 23% YoY and almost in line with the analyst expectations of $2.14 billion.

The company's board also approved a new stock buyback program of up to $1 billion.
Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach reiterated a Buy rating as better than feared results showed LULU has the best-in-class brand momentum.
We come away from F4Q with improved conviction in LULU's several drivers of durable growth that enable the company to gain market share despite tough compares. These include core product momentum, category extension (footwear / golf / tennis), faster store rollout, and ongoing strength in digital. We anticipate more detail on several of these drivers, as well as the margin opportunity for key business lines (footwear / international) at the company's April 20th Investor Day.

DUBAI (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest money manager, is seeking more infrastructure deals in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region and is also looking to invest in private companies in the region, an executive said.
The U.S. group, which manages more than $10 trillion in assets, recently led a consortium purchase of a $15.5 billion stake in  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s gas pipelines company, having taken a stake in Abu Dhabi energy company ADNOC's pipeline assets a couple of years earlier. 
""We're looking at many of those types of opportunities,"" Stephen Cohen, head of BlackRock's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told Reuters. 
""We're looking at a number of things on the private market side across the country,"" he said, citing unlisted growth companies in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.
Cohen said BlackRock is also looking across the region for infrastructure investments and what he called ""transition finance"" to fund long-term sustainable energy projects that help to reduce carbon emissions.
Gulf oil producers are considering sales of stakes in energy assets and raising cash through long-term leases, capitalising on a rebound in crude oil prices to attract foreign investors
RUSSIA IMPACT
When asked about the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said Europe's move to diversify its energy sources ""naturally plays"" to the strength of the Gulf region.
Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the exposure to Russia in its clients' portfolios was less than 0.2% of BlackRock's assets under management, Cohen said.
A BlackRock spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that the exposure to Russia of its clients is less than 0.01% following a markdown in the value of those assets.
""Following the invasion, BlackRock moved quickly to suspend the purchase of any Russian securities. BlackRock is monitoring the direct and indirect impacts of the crisis and working with our clients to support them as they take appropriate investment action,"" Cohen said.

He said the company is also looking at expanding its team in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It currently has 44 employees in the UAE and 15 in Saudi Arabia, BlackRock says.
BlackRock has launched two Saudi Arabia-focused exchange-traded funds and recently advised the kingdom to launch a national infrastructure fund.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trader Vitol Group made a record net profit of just over $4 billion last year, sources familiar with the matter said, as oil, natural gas and other commodity prices soared.
Vitol, the world's biggest independent oil trader, declined to comment. 
The unaudited result beats its previous record net profit in 2020, when oil markets were upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bloomberg reported Vitol made $3.2 billion in 2020. The company does not disclose its net profit. 
Last week, Vitol said revenues leapt to $279 billion in 2021 as oil prices recovered from 2020 lows. Its revenues were $140 billion in 2020. 
The company said it traded 7.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products in 2021, up from 7.1 million bpd in 2020. Traded oil volumes were still lower than its 2019 record of 8 million bpd after taking a hit during the very low demand period of the pandemic. Jet fuel in particular was still down 22%.
For traders, 2021 was initially a tougher year to make money than 2020, when the market structure was in a dramatic contango - with front-month oil futures prices lower than the following months - which makes storing oil profitable. 
For most of last year, the market was in backwardation - the opposite situation - but the oil price became more volatile and rose by over 50% compared with the start of the year. 
The sharp rally in gas prices in the second half of 2021 boosted traders' bottom lines. Natural gas and electricity prices around the world soared on tight gas supplies and higher demand as economies rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Benchmark European gas prices TTF and Asian LNG prices spiked to unprecedented levels in the fourth quarter, though TTF has since hit new records following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
“When you see the Henry Hub to TTF spread, it’s a multiple of what it used to be so it boosts the profitability,” one of the sources familiar with the results said.
Vitol traded 12.9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2021, up from 10 million in 2020, while its power and gas volumes grew by 30%. 

Rival trading firm, Geneva-based Trafigura, posted a record net profit of $3.1 billion for its financial year ending Sept. 30. Last week, Swiss firm Mercuria Energy Trading reported a record net income of $1.26 billion. 
Oil major Shell (LON:RDSa), the largest trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG), said its integrated gas earnings were boosted by ""significantly higher"" profits from trading.

China Securities Regulatory Commission said it holds ""zero tolerance"" towards illegal behaviour in the stock market and has punished some brokers who analysed, forecast, or offered investment advices by applying aspects of feng shui such as the heavenly stems and earthly branches, also known as tiangan dizhi, Yin-Yang, and Five Elements, according to the official China Securities Journal.
The newspaper did not offer more details or name any of the brokerages that were fined by the regulator.
Some Chinese brokerages, including Guosheng Securities and Essence Securities, have received warning letters from the regulator over the past year after they released reports by applying feng shui to form their investment strategies, according to statements on the regulator's website, as some of these notes prompted wide market discussion.

The latest crackdown also came at a time that Chinese stock markets are experiencing higher volatilities, with the blue-chip CSI 300 Index losing about 14% so far this year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's antitrust agency on Wednesday raided offices of tyre companies including Germany's Continental AG (OTC:CTTAY) and India's Apollo Tyres and CEAT in a case of suspected competition law violations, four sources told Reuters.
Shares of Apollo, one of India's biggest tyre makers, fell as much as 3% after Reuters first reported the raids, while CEAT dropped 2.2% in the Mumbai market, which was trading higher. 
Shares in Continental, which is a relatively small player in India, fell about 3.5% in morning trade in Frankfurt. 
Apollo did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls and messages to CEAT spokespeople went unanswered.
In a statement after the Reuters report was published, Continental confirmed that officers of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had visited its office near New Delhi. 
“Continental is fully cooperating with the authorities,” it said.
The raids were being conducted by CCI officers across multiple cities, the sources said.
The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency does not publicly disclose its raids.
One of the sources said the case was related to an antitrust investigation into the use of unfair trade practices and rigging of bids while supplying tyres for public transport vehicles in the northern state of Haryana.

Reuters reported in 2020 the CCI was conducting a broad investigation covering many tyre companies after it received a complaint from the Haryana state government. The CCI said at the time: ""there appears to be some arrangement or understanding amongst the tyre manufacturers"". (https://reut.rs/3JQHvJe) 
A finding of bid-rigging could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the prices were fixed by the companies, or 10% of annual revenue, whichever is more.

The RJC, which sets ethical standards for the jewellery and watch industry and whose members include Richemont's Cartier and  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF), has failed to suspend Russian companies or urge its members to halt business in the country following its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Pandora said.
""The war requires all businesses to act with the utmost responsibility regarding any interactions or business dealings with Russia and Belarus,"" Chief Executive Alexander Lacik said in a statement. 
""Pandora cannot in good faith be a member of an association that does not share our values,"" he added.
RJC was not immediately available for comment.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown roiled auto production on Tuesday as two major suppliers joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in shutting plants to comply with measures to control the spread of the coronavirus.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s joint venture in Shanghai maintained production by asking workers to sleep on factory floors and getting passes for trucks to continue deliveries, two people familiar with the matter said.
A key auto supplier, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) PLC, told workers at one of its Shanghai facilities that supplies Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture to head home on Tuesday because of the need to enforce COVID controls, people briefed on the measure said.
Thyssenkrupp said it had closed a facility in Shanghai where it assembles production lines for automotive components, including powertrains and batteries, until April 6 to comply with local coronavirus regulations.
The Aptiv and Thyssenkrupp closures came on the second day of a lockdown in Shanghai, home to 26 million people and a major hub for manufacturing of vehicles and other goods. The city has instituted tough controls on movements of people to try to control the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant.
The lockdown, one of the biggest tests for China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, has forced automakers and suppliers to either try to adapt with extreme measures to keep factories running or to shut down and risk delayed shipments at a time when demand for vehicles is strong.
German auto supplier Bosch on Tuesday said its two plants in Shanghai are working with reduced personnel. ""We are doing everything we can to maintain the supply chains as much as possible and to serve the demands of our customers,"" the company said in a statement. 
For global automakers and suppliers, the latest coronavirus-related disruptions in China, the world's largest market, are piling on top of problems created by the war in Ukraine.
The measures GM took to keep its Shanghai plant open equate to a ""closed-loop"" management process, which China's financial hub has asked companies to adopt to stay open during a two-stage lockdown to battle its outbreak.
In the bubble-like arrangement, workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of the world to prevent virus transmission. A similar system was used at the Winter Olympics in Beijing to seal event personnel off from the public.
The facilities, which GM runs as part of a joint venture with Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC Motor Corp, produce Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles. The facilities are in areas east of Shanghai's Huangpu River that have been locked down from Monday to Friday.
CONTINGENCY PLANS 
GM, which said on Monday that its Shanghai joint venture was producing normally, declined to comment on the arrangements at its factory. A spokesperson said the company and its joint ventures had developed and were executing contingency plans with their suppliers to mitigate uncertainty related to COVID-19. SAIC did not have immediate comment.
SAIC-GM's ability to keep its Shanghai production lines running contrasts with that of Tesla Inc, which Reuters reported has suspended production for the four-day period. It was unable to secure sufficient provisions for its workers to achieve closed-loop management, one source said.
The workers at the affected Aptiv site were told to stay home on Wednesday and await further notice, the four sources told Reuters. Two of the sources said the affected compound produces for Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture with SAIC.
Aptiv's Shanghai facilities are in the west of the city and had not been affected by the city's lockdown, which started in eastern districts. The sources said the workers at the affected facility had been told that it had to shut due to COVID-19 issues. 

Aptiv declined to comment on the production suspension. ""I can confirm that we are following all government orders and not impacting customers' production,"" an Aptiv spokesperson said. Tesla, GM and SAIC did not have immediate comment. 
TCL Corp and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Foxconn and Shenzhen Deren Electronic Co Ltd managed to keep production going in southern China this month with closed-loop management after manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen and Dongguan were hit by similar lockdown measures.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s hefty gains amid skepticism over the likely success of the latest Ukraine-Russia peace talks. 
By 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 outperformed, climbing 0.2%.
Investor sentiment was boosted Tuesday after Russia stated it will sharply reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv following face-to-face peace talks between the two sides in Istanbul, with chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky saying the country would take steps to “de-escalate” the conflict.
This prompted European equities to close sharply higher, with the DAX gaining 2.8% and the CAC 40 rising 3.1%.
However, the tone has become more circumspect Wednesday, with the Pentagon warning that Kyiv remains under threat and U.S. President Joe Biden saying he’ll wait and see whether Russia delivers on its pledge. 
""The good news from the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul is not that Putin is suddenly acting in good faith,” said former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Twitter, “but that heroic Ukrainian resistance is making him look for off-ramps and diplomatic disguise.""
Meanwhile, Germany, Europe's largest economy, is bracing for a cut-off of Russian gas supplies, activating the first phase of a national emergency plan. The move comes two days ahead of a deadline set by Russia for 'unfriendly' states to start paying for deliveries of Russian energy in rubles, rather than in euros or dollars.
Spanish inflation data gave a vivid illustration of the impact of the war on the Eurozone economy, jumping 9.8% from a year ago in March, surging at the fastest rate in almost four decades.
Italy and Germany will release their inflation numbers later in the session, feeding through to Friday’s Eurozone release, which is expected to show a fresh high considerably above the European Central Bank’s 2% target.

Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said its group, including Daihatsu and Hino Motors Ltd, produced 884,528 vehicles globally for the month, an increase of almost of 11% from the same month a year ago. 
It also produced a record number of vehicles for February in markets outside Japan despite a parts shortage triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak.
Toyota alone exceeded its February global production target plan released a month earlier by almost 41,000 vehicles. But the production level was below the year-ago period due to a COVID-19-induced parts supply shortage in North America and tight parts supply in Europe because of rising demand.
While it also faced tight semiconductor supplies in China, the automaker said it had used chips that were rendered surplus from a factory shutdown in January due to COVID-19 to mitigate this. 
Likewise, Honda Motor said its February global production rose by 8.1% with 344,712 vehicles. Although the semiconductor shortage and COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and lowered production level compared to February last year in North America, the problem was not severe in Asia, where production level increased compared to the same time last year.

In contrast, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co said its global production for February was down 7.8% year-over-year at 275,437 units due to the shortage of semiconductors. 
Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp's February global production fell by 23.6% during the same period at 47,625. The company said it had adjusted and suspended operation due tight supply of parts using semiconductors.

Whether or not you believe in the signalling power of the U.S. Treasury curve, inversion of the key 2-10 year segment remains a sit up and pay attention moment for world markets.
That's what happened, albeit briefly, on Tuesday when two-year bond yields rose above 10-year ones, inverting the curve for the first time since 2019 in what is widely regarded as an indicator of rising recession risks. That spread is just under four bps in London, flirting with inversion territory. 
And while Fed researchers believe the predictive power of the spread to signal a recession is ""probably spurious,"" suggesting other yield curve measures are better, the spread's track record as a recession indicator is punchy. 
Since the 1960s, an inverted Treasury curve has been followed by a recession within two years, including the 2020 downturn caused by COVID-19. That means the significance of the latest inversion won't be lost on markets -- or the Fed.
And in another wow moment for the bond markets, the two-year German bond yield popped briefly into positive territory for the first time in eight years. Only three weeks ago, that yield troughed at around minus 80 bps. 
With Germany warning that it could be heading for a gas supply emergency even as inflation surges, bond yields may be headed higher.

Russia-Ukraine talks meanwhile will remain in focus, with positive headlines likely to be a trigger for a fresh risk-on move. 
Asia shares joined a global rally as hopes rose for a negotiated end to the Ukraine conflict. European stock futures are mixed and U.S. futures are a touch softer. 
Equity markets appear to be in a rally on anything kind of mood but uncertainty remains high and that resilience will likely be put to the test soon. 
German inflation data out later in the day is also one to watch.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:
- Japan boosts defence of benchmark yield as global pressures persist
- Auto manufacturers scramble as Shanghai locks down 
- ECB President Christine Lagarde, Governing Council member Pierre Wunsch, ECB bank supervisor Edouard Fernandez Bollo, ECB board member Fabio Panetta speaks to European parliament

The remaining NZ$950 million will be used to strengthen the balance sheet and aid recovery from the COVID-19 ravages, the carrier said. It has also undertaken a fresh debt of NZ$400 million from the government to provide additional liquidity. 
""The timing is right to position our airline for recovery,"" Chairman Therese Walsh told reporters.
The carrier, which uses a June-end financial year, plans to return to 2019 profit levels by 2025 and to restart dividends by 2026, she said.
Chief Executive Greg Foran said capacity would reach 90% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025 but would be weighted more toward domestic flights than in the past.

HANOI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Vietnam's automaker VinFast said on Tuesday it has signed a preliminary deal to initially invest $2 billion to build a factory in North Carolina to make electric buses, sport utility vehicles (SUVs) along with batteries for EVs.
The unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup, said it plans to have a total investment of $4 billion in its first U.S. factory complex. 
Construction should begin this year as soon as the company gets necessary permits, and is expected to finish by July 2024. The plant's initial capacity will be 150,000 units per year, Vinfast said. 
""With a manufacturing facility right in the U.S. market, VinFast can stabilize prices and shorten product delivery time, making our EVs more accessible to customers,"" said Nguyen Thi Thu Thuy, Vingroup vice chair and VinFast Global CEO. 
VinFast has begun taking pre-orders globally for two electric SUVs with a goal to begin delivering them in the fourth quarter.
U.S. President Joe Biden said the VinFast investment, which will create more than 7,000 jobs, is ""the latest example of my economic strategy at work."" 
""It builds on recent announcements from companies like GM, Ford, and Siemens to invest in America again and create jobs, said Biden, who set an ambitious goal for half of new car sales to be electric by 2030. 
This will be North Carolina’s first car plant and it is the largest economic development announcement in the state’s history, the governor's office said in a statement. 
VinFast said prices for its VF8 sport SUV started from $41,000 in the United States. By comparison, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) SUV sells for around $63,000. VinFast is targeting global electric vehicle sales of 42,000 this year.
PRODUCTION IS HARD 
VinFast is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with affordable electric SUVs and a battery leasing model. 
Other electric vehicle startups like Rivian and Lucid have slashed their production targets this year due to supply chain disruptions caused by coronavirus, which hit their share prices. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last year, ""It's insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.""

VinFast, which became Vietnam's first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer in 2019, plans to transition to all-electric vehicle production from late 2022. 
Outside of North America, the company is looking for a plant in Germany, it said in January.

Over the past week, 15 companies seeking initial public offerings (IPOs) on Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market have suspended applications, almost all citing impacts from the epidemic, exchange filings showed. The city started lockdowns on Monday.
In Shenzhen, which conducted three rounds of mass testing in March, 67 IPO applicants targeting the start-up board ChiNext have suspended the listing process this month, citing the need to update disclosure to regulators, according to filings. 
In all, the suspensions potentially delay fundraising worth 60 billion yuan ($9.4 billion), official newspaper Securities Times estimated. That's equivalent to more than one-tenth of China's roughly $84 billion in domestic IPO fundraising in 2021.
The real impact on IPO fundraising is likely bigger, as listing hopefuls on China's main equity boards are not required to make timely disclosures on the vetting process.

To minimise the impact, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has vowed to maintain the steady operation of capital markets during the ""special"" virus control period.
The bourse said on Sunday it would continue to vet share sale plans by STAR Market candidates and strengthen online communications with issuers and underwriters.
Nevertheless, a growing number of IPO applicants are pressing the pause button, at a time when many companies are required to update their financial results. 
Nanjing CIGU Technology Corp, which plans to list on STAR, said on Tuesday it is applying to the Shanghai bourse to suspend vetting of its application.
""Due to the epidemic, the company and intermediary agencies cannot complete due diligence, or answer regulators' queries during the stipulated time period,"" the company said. 
Other STAR candidates which halted IPO plans over the past week include Guangzhou Xaircraft Technology Co, CICT Mobile Communication Technology Co and Yuanjie Semiconductor Technology Co.
In Shenzhen, companies including Guangdong Lvtong New Energy Electric Vehicle Technology Co, Plotech Technology (Kunshan) Co and Shenzhen Mould-Tip Injection Technology Co have halted IPO plans over the past month, according to exchange filings.

The Hang Seng Tech Index was up 0.3% as of the mid-day lunch break in Hong Kong, having earlier gained as much as 2.3%, following the report which said Beijing is preparing new regulations on the live-streaming industry including a daily cap on tipping -- a key revenue source for such firms. Key player Kuaishou Technology slid as much as 8.3%, reversing an earlier surge buoyed by the firm’s earnings beat. 
The latest regulatory development sours sentiment as investors were expecting China to loosen its grips following Vice Premier Liu He’s mid-March pledge to stabilize capital markets and end crackdowns on private enterprise. The Hang Seng Tech Index has jumped more than 30% from its trough two weeks ago. 
“This will create pressure for live streaming firms as they share a proportion from digital tips,” said Willer Chen, analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd. “If true, this will be a big regulation on live-streaming hosts. A great number of leading hosts earn way higher than the proposed 10,000 yuan daily cap.” 
Sentiment has also been fragile following a number of earnings miss by technology companies, including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. The 30-day volatility for the Hang Seng tech gauge is at a record high as traders look for more clues on the sector’s earnings and regulatory outlook.

The firm is selling the land-use and building ownership rights for the project, which is under construction, to Zhejiang Zhejian Real Estate Group and Zhejiang Construction Engineering Group, Evergrande said in a filing. 
It will use the proceeds to repay construction fees of 920.7 million yuan owed to Zhejiang Construction Engineering and the rest for its own general working capital. The deal is expected to post a gain of about 216 million yuan. 
Saddled with over $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande has been struggling to repay suppliers, creditors and complete projects. State-owned enterprises have stepped in to help with the debt restructuring process and taken over some of its assets to quell market concerns about a disorderly collapse. 
In a separate filing late on Tuesday, Evergrande said it had set up an independent committee to investigate how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan in deposits of its property services arm, Evergrande Property Services Group, that had been pledged as security for third party guarantees.
Preliminary investigation has found the pledge of the relevant deposits and the enforcement by banks took place in 2021, Evergrande said.
Shares of its unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group resumed trading on Wednesday and plunged up to 14.5%. 
They have been suspended since last Monday pending news of the enforcement. But trading will be halted again on Friday per listing rules as the firm will not be able to publish its 2021 financial results by March 31. 

Shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services have both been suspended since last Monday.

TOKYO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Sony Group Corp's revamp of its PlayStation subscription service is a major step toward levelling the playing field with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rival Game Pass, although holding back new releases may dampen enthusiasm, analysts say. 
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY) said its expanded PlayStation Plus service will offer hundreds of games, including recent hits such as ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"", for a flat monthly fee when it launches in the United States, Europe and Japan in June. 
The service will not include new releases, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan told Reuters, but users can still find big-budget titles such as ""Returnal"" and ""God of War"". 
""There will be more from PlayStation Studios, and all of the major publishers will be represented,"" Ryan said.
Sony is widely seen as leading in the console war, selling 17 million PlayStation 5 (PS5) units even as chip shortages hit production, but has been under pressure to respond to the growth of Netflix-style game subscription services. 
The revamped Sony service combines the current PlayStation Plus, which has 48 million subscribers and offers online gaming and only a few free games each month, with PlayStation Now, which has 3.2 million users and a library of games to download and stream.
There are three tiers, priced at $9.99 to $17.99 monthly or $59.99 to $119.99 annually. The lowest-price tier, PlayStation Plus Essential, looks like Sony's current offering.
PlayStation Plus Extra adds a catalogue of PS4 and PS5 games. PlayStation Plus Premium offers a further library of older titles, cloud streaming in major markets and time-limited game trials. 
Such streamlining is ""overdue"", said Lewis Ward, head of gaming research at IDC. 
""The number of PlayStation subscribers in the higher two tiers... will tick up over time, which is undoubtedly a core reason for this change,"" Ward said.
Given the high cost of developing new games, analysts had raised concerns that pressure to bundle more content with subscriptions may eat into profit at Sony's coveted games unit.
Sony will seek to preserve new game sales alongside the subscription service. 
""I think this move should improve margins, as more gamers will be driven to higher-cost subscriptions,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis. 
""If content acquisition costs do increase, Sony will need to balance that with the additional revenue it will be generating from the PS Plus subscriber base,"" he added.
HIGH STAKES GAME
Microsoft is aggressively growing Game Pass, which has 25 million subscribers, by adding new titles on their launch day while buying studios to expand its offerings. 
In January, the Redmond, Washington-based firm struck a $68.7 billion deal for ""Call of Duty"" publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
Sony, which has built its own in-house studio network, responded by buying ""Destiny"" publisher Bungie for $3.6 billion, with many analysts expecting further dealmaking.
Microsoft has gained an early lead in subscriptions, accounting for 60% of the games subscriptions in North America and Europe, compared with 7% for Sony, according to Ampere Analysis. Subscriptions make up only 4% of total gaming spending.
""PlayStation believes it is smarter for them and for third-party publishers to put older games into the subscription plan so that new games can maximize their revenue potential during their launch windows,"" said IDC's Ward.
That hesitance means Sony's offering ""won't have the pull of Microsoft's service,"" added Ampere's Harding-Rolls.
Sony's newly announced pricing is seen as competitive. The premium tier's $120 annual fee compares with $180 for Game Pass Ultimate. Both offer cloud gaming, with Sony users able to stream titles to their consoles and PC. 
Cloud gaming is seen as the future for the industry, because it doesn't require downloading or installing games on a console or PC. That is a potential threat to the console business, whose operators that have acted as industry gatekeepers. 
An annual subscription to the mid-tier PlayStation Plus Extra, which lacks this cloud-gaming feature, works out at just over $8 monthly, compared with $9.99 for the Game Pass. 
""Value and pricing of that nature would simply not be possible if we were to put our new games into the service upon their release,"" said Sony's Ryan.

Microsoft has said that Game Pass subscribers play more games and spend more on games, too - a view echoed by Sony. 
""Everything comes down to engagement,"" Ryan said. ""If you get people engaged on your platform, monetization typically follows.""

(Reuters) -United Auto Workers (UAW) President Ray Curry said on Tuesday he has had no discussions with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or its Chief Executive Elon Musk about a potential union vote by workers at the electric-car maker's California factory.
On March 3, Musk tweeted that he was inviting the ""UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them."" 
During an online press event, Curry said Tesla could drop an appeal of a U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling that it violated U.S. labor law and ""reinstate some workers who were actually terminated.""
""That would be a good faith effort if they were interested in having that type of exchange,"" Curry added.
""We definitely would welcome that opportunity,"" Curry said. ""It's not the whim of a tweet or anything else... it's about the workers in those locations having a voice inside of their workplace.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Curry also said he is engaged in ongoing discussions with Detroit's Big Three automakers about joint venture battery plants and the potential for the union to represent workers.
""Those have not generated final decisions,"" Curry said, noting that they have not started production. ""Our No. 1 goal for the joint ventures is to make sure that those locations that are supplying components to (UAW represented auto plants) are represented"" by the UAW.
Curry wants General Motors (NYSE:GM) Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis to ensure a ""level playing field"" for organizing efforts. ""Card checks, neutrality and other things are clearly on the table for those discussions,"" Curry said.
The union chief said the UAW also wants to organize autoworkers at start-ups, saying the goal is to ""be able to represent any auto work assembly that would take place in the country, especially EV pieces."" 
Last year, the NLRB ordered Tesla to direct Musk to delete a 2018 tweet saying employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union. 
Musk has repeatedly heaped criticism on the UAW. On Tuesday, he tweeted: ""UAW slogan – 'Fighting for the right to embezzle money from auto workers!'""
Musk was referring to the guilty plea of a UAW local official to embezzling $2.2 million in union funds.

Curry said the union had adopted significant reforms and that it was its auditors who had found the wrongdoing and referred the issue to federal prosecutors that led to the guilty plea. 
Curry, who became president last summer after his predecessor retired a year before his term ended, said he plans to run for a new term as president later this year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with investors digesting the probability of a de-escalation in the war in Ukraine and oil pared declines.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.27% by 10:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI 50 was up 0.27% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.8%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.85%. China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.63% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.41%.
Oil clawed back some of its losses in early Asian trading, with investors remaining cautious about the war coming to an end. Russia said it will sharply reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said the country would take steps to “de-escalate” the conflict.
However, Tuesday’s talks between Ukraine and Russia failed to reach an agreement on a cease-fire, with the Pentagon warning that Kyiv remains under threat. With no end in sight to the war in Ukraine triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, analysts are casting doubt on Russian intentions.
Hopes that Ukraine and Russia could make progress in peace talks had seen oil prices and inflation expectations come down, giving bonds a respite from their recent drubbing. Long-end yields slid, which led to a brief inversion in the two- to 10-year curve. 
The U.S. Treasury yield curve’s inversion sparked a debate over the risks of a growth downturn as central banks begin to tighten their monetary policies. They include the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to continue hiking interest rates throughout 2022.
“We knew that we were late-cycle and typically the yield curve inverts, and it takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months to actually move into a recession,” Pacific Investment Management Co. portfolio manager Erin Browne told Bloomberg.
“There are reasons to believe this time around that yield curve inversion may not be as good an indicator as it has been in the past, particularly given the enormous amount of quantitative easing undertaken by global central banks,” she added.
Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker said he expects a series of “deliberate, methodical” rate increases in 2022, but said he is open to a half-point move in May if near-term data shows more inflation. Harker’s colleagues, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, and New York Fed President John Williams will speak on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
In the latest U.S. data, the Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence Index was at 107.2 in March 2022, while JOLTs job openings totaled 11.266 million. Further data, including the GDP and the latest jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, will be released later in the day and on Friday respectively.
In Asia Pacific, China will release its manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) on Thursday, followed by the Caixin manufacturing PMI on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P notching their fourth straight session of gains, on optimism some progress was being made toward a deal to resolve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. 
Russia pledged to cut down on military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine, while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status, the first sign of progress toward peace in weeks.
Prices eased for oil and other commodities, helping calm concerns about rising inflation and the path of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has started hiking interest rates to combat rising prices. 
""If you look over the course of the month this war has been going on, the market has priced in much more bad news than good news,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
""It certainly shows the market has a natural coiled spring that will be a reaction function to any good news and we saw a bit of that this morning, but everything will have to be taken with a grain of salt and we will have to see things actually play out versus being actually talked about.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 338.3 points, or 0.97%, to 35,294.19, the S&P 500 gained 56.08 points, or 1.23%, to 4,631.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 264.73 points, or 1.84%, to 14,619.64.
After a dismal start to the year for stocks that saw the S&P 500 fall into a correction, commonly referred to as a drop of more than 10% from its most recent high, the benchmark index is now down less than 3% on the year. 
Still, there were signs of market nervousness that the Fed could make a policy mistake that leads to a slowdown, or possibly a recession, in the economy as the widely tracked U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury inverted for the first time since September 2019.
""While I think the ultimate result of an aggressive Fed tightening cycle is a recession, I do not expect it to occur quickly. Historically speaking, all recessions are preceded by 2s10s inversions, but not all inversions result in recessions,"" said Ellis Phifer, managing director, fixed income research, at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.
After slumping more than 2% on Monday, the S&P energy index was the only declining sector as crude prices fell more than 1%.
As the conflict in Ukraine has escalated in recent weeks, already rising prices saw more upward pressure on commodities such as wheat, energy and metals.
But even with the recent surge in inflation, data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March, while the current labor environment favors workers.
Real estate, up nearly 3% on the session, was the best performing sector, which indicates some investors may see inflation remaining but no recession on the horizon. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the group since Jan. 28. 
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) gained 3.70% after the global delivery conglomerate named operating chief Raj Subramaniam as its top boss.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.22 billion shares, compared with the 14 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.97-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 51 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 38 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets tore higher across the world on Tuesday and oil prices shed $2 a barrel, as investors celebrated signs of progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine that they hoped would lead to a settlement in a five-week conflict.
Even though the U.S. government warned that Russia's latest move was a sign it is redeploying, not withdrawing, troops, investors nonetheless piled into risky assets, ignoring surging inflation and imminent rate hikes that could mar the growth outlook and upend stock market buoyancy.
In a sign that the exuberant stock market may run into headwinds, a closely-watched section of the U.S. yield curve briefly inverted for the first time since September 2019, signalling a possible recession ahead.
Indeed, some analysts warned that the latest bout of optimism may be misplaced.
""Over the last two weeks, the S&P has produced one of its sharpest rallies in history, larger than the biggest 10-day rallies in seven of the S&P's 11 bear markets since 1927,"" said analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Equity Derivatives Research.
""It has done so despite clearly weaker fundamentals (more hikes, higher inflation, and curve inversion) and the Fed leaning against equity market strength to hike faster,"" they wrote, adding that they think sustained gains in U.S. stocks are unlikely.
U.S. stock indices jumped over 1%, Europe's main bourses enjoyed 1% to 2.5% gains, and oil tumbled close to $5 at one point as Russia's deputy defence minister emerged saying Moscow has decided to drastically cut military activity around Ukraine's capital Kyiv and also Chernihiv.
With Tuesday's rally, Wall Street - aided by data that showed a rebound in U.S. consumer confidence in March - notched its fourth straight day of gains. Asia was lifted overnight too after the Bank of Japan defended its vast stimulus programme, although the yen's worst month since 2016 was still raising eyebrows.
Dealers also shrugged off bigger-than-expected drops in French and German consumer confidence data and signs that Russia will push ahead with plans to start billing for its gas in roubles, and is prepared to risk a historic sovereign debt default.
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield - the main gauge of European borrowing costs - hit its highest since early 2018 and 2-year yields turned positive for the first time since 2014, adding to the seismic shifts in global rates markets this year as inflation has surged.
U.S. Treasury yields paused their ascent on Tuesday, but have risen an eyewatering 165 basis points this quarter. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S Treasuries retreated to 2.391% while the equivalent 2-year yields were at 2.367%. More than 200 basis points of U.S. interest rate rises are also now priced in for 2022 which, if realised, would be the most in a calendar year since 1994.
The difference between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields, which is tracked as a harbinger of recession, briefly fell as low as minus 0.03 of a basis point on Tuesday, as traders bet that aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve could hurt the economy over the long term. 
This so-called curve inversion is considered a reliable predictor of recession, although some analysts say the curve has been distorted by quantitative easing and investors should not read too much into it. The Fed has also urged investors to watch other curve segments which are still steep, giving it room to tighten policy further and faster.
""We have seen something that is a little unprecedented because the Fed is suddenly facing a question about its credibility and whether it can effectively reduce inflation,"" said Amundi's head of multi-asset strategies, Francesco Sandrini.
He added that Amundi had revised its European growth forecast downward to 1.5% for the year from 2% previously, but it could be lower if the situation continues to deteriorate.
""We question a lot our forecasts,"" Sandrini said, especially as Europe's big companies are more heavily exposed to commodity price pressures than U.S. counterparts. ""It is extremely complicated, we need to proceed cautiously.""

All the three of the main S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes are on course to end March higher. However, they are also set to record their worst start to a year and indeed any quarter since the start of 2020 when the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on financial markets.
In the currency market, the yen continued to languish at 122.88 per dollar even after staging a small recovery from its bruising the day before, when the Bank of Japan vowed to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year government bonds to prevent its bond yields from rising too much further.
The central bank was finding it tough going, however. The 10-year JGB yield stood at 0.245%, right up against the BOJ's implicit 0.25% cap. 
Among commodities, oil prices clawed back some of the day's losses, which were incurred after Russia's top negotiator in the talks with Ukraine described the discussions as ""constructive"". Brent crude settled down $2.25, or 2%, at $110.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell $1.72, or 1.6%, to $104.24.
Prices had weakened earlier too as China's financial hub Shanghai tightened its latest COVID-19 lockdown, after it reported a record 4,381 asymptomatic cases and 96 symptomatic cases for March 28 - though the caseload remains modest by global standards.

A month after taking on McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) over the treatment of pigs, Icahn is expanding the battle beyond animal welfare to include focusing on what he calls ""egregious wage gaps"" between Kroger's chief executive officer and cashiers, stock clerks and others.
The activist investor wrote a letter to Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen on Tuesday, pointing out the supermarket chain's inability to create policies concerning animal welfare and criticizing its wage disparities.
In response to Icahn's letter, Kroger said that it prioritizes ESG matters and the board, along with its committees, directly oversee its animal welfare strategies. 
Kroger added that while it was not directly involved in raising or processing of any animals, the company has established a framework to clearly define its policies, requirement and practices, including its Animal Welfare Policy that hopes all suppliers transition away from gestation crates by 2025.
Icahn nominated Alexis Fox and Margarita Paláu-Hernández to stand for election to Kroger's board, during the company's 2022 annual meeting.
Fox is the co-founder of Lighter, a startup that focuses on plant-based diet, while Paláu-Hernández is the founder and chief executive at Hernandez Ventures, a private firm involved in Spanish-language media, business and real estate ventures.

The grocer said it will review the proposed nominees and present its formal recommendations.
Icahn previously made a similar push at McDonald's in February, nominating two members to its board in an escalating fight over the treatment of pigs by the burger chain's suppliers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The outgoing head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday the agency's ""zero tolerance policy"" for addressing unruly passengers should remain in place indefinitely.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told reporters the policy first imposed in January 2021 should remain even if the Biden administration decides to lift a mandate requiring masks onboard airplanes.
The Biden administration has extended the transit mask mandate through April 18 and is considering whether it should end or again be continued. The FAA in March 2021 extended the zero tolerance policy and said it would enforce it at least as long as the face mask order remained in effect.
""Regardless of what happens with the mask mandate, I think this is something that we need to keep in place,"" Dickson said Tuesday.
The FAA said since January 2021, there have been a record 6,900 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules - but have declined.
""Once the federal mandate is lifted, I think we can safely assume that those rates will decline further,"" Dickson said.
The FAA last month said it has referred 80 unruly airplane passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Dickson spoke to Reuters and another media outlet Tuesday just days before he steps down about halfway through his five-year term as FAA chief, discussing a wide range of challenges he has faced in the job.
He praised Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s efforts to improve its relationship with the FAA.
""We are demanding more transparency and completeness and rigor out of their processes,"" Dickson told reporters Tuesday. ""(Boeing) will call me if there is anything that they think I am going to be concerned about ... They are not asking for anything.""
Last week, the FAA warned the planemaker may not gain certification of a lengthened version of the 737 MAX ahead of a key safety deadline set by Congress, a source told Reuters.
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the 737 MAX 10 before the end of the year. Dickson declined to say if he thinks Boeing can win approval before January.
""Boeing knows what it needs to do and what it needs to provide to us,"" Dickson said.
Boeing said it shares ""an enduring commitment to safety and transparency with the FAA and respect their oversight role as we engage with their team going forward.""
Dickson declined to comment on last week's not guilty verdict of a former Boeing test pilot charged with deceiving the FAA during its certification review of the 737 MAX.

Asked if Boeing had been properly held to account for the two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, Dickson said: ""We hold Boeing accountable everyday as we do ourselves.""
Boeing entered into a $2.5 billion deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January 2021.

The decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco allows potentially millions of individuals and businesses that paid for ads on Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram since Aug. 15, 2014 to sue as a group.
Meta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
The lawsuit began in 2018, as DZ Reserve and other advertisers accused Facebook of inflating its advertising reach, by increasing the number of potential viewers by as much as 400%, and charging artificially high premiums for ad placements.
They also said senior Facebook executives knew for years that the company's ""potential reach"" metric was inflated by duplicate and fake accounts, yet did nothing about it and took steps to cover it up.
After calling out Meta's ""blunderbuss"" objections to class certification, Donato rejected its contention that the class was too diverse, including ""large sophisticated corporations"" as well as individuals and small businesses, and that it would be too hard to calculate damages.

Donato also said it made sense to let individual plaintiffs sue as a group, given that ""no reasonable person"" would sue Meta individually to recover at most a $32 price premium.
The judge is expected later this year to consider Meta's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday sought to cast doubt on the testimony of the wife of a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, who is on trial over allegations he helped loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. 
Roger Ng, Goldman's former chief for Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-corruption law. Prosecutors say he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from 1MDB development fund, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty. 
Hwee Bin Lim, Ng's wife, testified on Monday that she made a $6 million investment in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Judy Chan, Leissner's then-wife. Lim said she received around $35 million as a return on that investment in 2012 and 2013.
But prosecutors say that money represented kickbacks Leissner paid to Ng from the 1MDB scheme. Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith on Tuesday, Lim said she was no longer in possession of a two-page agreement she signed with Chan describing the deal and had no written updates on investment performance. 
Smith repeatedly asked Lim why, despite her training as a corporate lawyer, she did not press for documents or keep records.
""For investment in China there's no point for you to have documents,"" Lim said. ""Where do I go to enforce it?""
Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges as Ng in 2018, testified last month that the investment involving the two men's wives was a ""cover story"" to explain the kickback payments so the banks that would process the transfer would not grow suspicious.

The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history, in which U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB and meant for the economic development of Malaysia was instead diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Fintech Stori, whose credit cards target the overwhelming majority of Mexicans who lack any kind of formal credit, said on Tuesday it plans to invest $175 million to grow in 2022 as it grows its customer portfolio and hires more people.
The startup issues its cards to ""underbanked"" Mexicans like 33-year-old Nadir Redon Texta, who makes a living reselling clothes and stainless steel accessories in the town of Zihuatanejo and could not get a credit line in any bank.
""I earn from 4,000 to 8,000 pesos every month, since my business is informal and seasonal,"" he said in a phone interview. ""I started with a 1,500 Mexican pesos ($75.18) monthly credit with Stori and I've always been able to pay it.""
Only 31% of Mexicans have some type of credit, and those who do, tend to use department store or convenience store cards, according to the country's statistics agency.
Stori extends a line of credit to 99% of applicants after a background check that studies a combination of factors like where they live and how they make a living, said Marlene Garayzar, the co-founder of the company launched in 2018.
""Some applicants don't have the official documents that we require. Otherwise, our percentage of acceptance could reach 100%. We give credits as small as 500 pesos, and, in our experience, people do pay,"" she said.
Garayzar said Stori, which is backed by such investors as U.S. GGV Capital and Goodwater Capital, expects to expand into at least one other Latin American country in the next two years but declined to say which markets it is considering. 
Mexicans with informal jobs or bad credit history tend to knock on many doors before they can get approved for a loan. That was the case of Eduardo Alvarado, 28, whose request for a card was rejected by Brazilian fintech Nubank.
""Nu asked me to try again later, so I went to Stori and they accepted me. Months later, I tried again with Nu, and they approved it. I guess it was quite influential to have Stori as a starting credit."" he said.

Stori has one million clients and most of them are first-time credit card holders, while Nubank has around 1.4 million customers in Mexico and 60% of them had some other card before contracting its services.

(Reuters) -Lululemon Athletica on Tuesday forecast full-year profit and revenue above estimates as demand for athletic wear remains consistent even as people return to offices, and said it plans selective price increases on some of its products.
Shares of the yogawear maker rose about 8% in extended trading as the company also posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings despite reduced store hours due to an increase in Omicron infections.
Since the pandemic started, many consumers have shifted their preference to comfortable and casual clothing helping brands such as Lululemon whose athleisure and sportswear have now become a major part of everyday fashion. 
""We are taking modest selective price increases over the course of the year... It's a very small portion of our styles that are impacted... this will help offset some of the pressure we're seeing on average unit cost,"" Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald said in an earnings call.
Morningstar Research analyst David Swartz said as Lululemon has premium pricing all the time, ""having high cost, high price products is nothing new for Lululemon... they can push through that price increase without any problem."" 
Lululemon forecast full-year 2022 revenue between $7.49 billion and $7.62 billion, while analysts are expecting $7.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
It also forecast full-year profit between $9.15 and $9.35 per share, compared to estimates of $9.06 per share.

""Raising prices helps the company especially as they are still being impacted by lingering supply chain issues. And given the fact that they don't need to be as promotional, they probably have some room to raise prices,"" said Matthew Jacob, senior analyst at M Science.
Excluding items, Lululemon earned $3.37 per share in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, beating estimates of $3.28 per share.

Ukraine's two leading neon suppliers, which produce about half the world's supply of the key chip-making ingredient, have halted their operations, threatening to drive up prices and worsen an ongoing semiconductor crunch.
Global chip output was already under pressure after the pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.
That same demand helped Micron forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates and deliver higher-than-expected results in the second quarter, sending shares up more than 4%.
""We currently do not expect any negative impacts to our near-term production volumes because of the Russia-Ukraine war, but we do expect an increase in our costs as we secure supply of certain raw materials that could be addressed,"" Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in a post-earnings conference call.
Recent efforts to diversify supply and maintain inventories of raw materials and noble gases helped contain the blow, he added.
The impact from Ukraine-driven supply shortfalls will not show up until about seven to nine months later, when global raw material inventories run out, said Kinngai Chan, managing director - semiconductors at Summit Insights Group LLC.
Micron forecast current-quarter revenue of $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $8.06 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Revenue rose 24.8% to $7.79 billion, beating estimates of $7.52 billion.

Micron also charged more for its NAND and DRAM memory chips, helping gross margins as a percentage of revenue rise to 47.2% from 26.4% last year.

(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Tuesday authorized a second COVID-19 booster dose of the two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines for people age 50 and older, citing data showing waning immunity and the risks posed by Omicron variants of the virus.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration agency said the new boosters - a fourth round of shots for most vaccine recipients - of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines are to be administered at least four months after the previous dose. They are intended to offer more protection against severe disease and hospitalization.
The FDA also authorized a second booster dose of the vaccines for younger people with compromised immune systems - those aged 12 and older for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and 18 and older for Moderna's.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) backed the FDA's authorization, recommending the additional shot, particularly for older people and those with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk.
The decision to offer second boosters in the United States comes as some scientists have raised concern about the highly contagious and newly predominant BA.2 Omicron subvariant, which has driven up COVID-19 cases in other countries. 
""If it were my relatives, I would be sending them out to do this,"" top FDA official Dr. Peter Marks said during a news conference of getting booster shots. ""COVID-19 has had a really disproportional adverse effect on people 65 years of age and older and those with comorbidities.""
COVID cases in the United States have dropped sharply since a record surge in January, but have seen a small uptick over the past week, according to CDC data.
BROADER BOOSTER CAMPAIGN MAY BE NEEDED
Marks said the FDA will soon weigh the benefits of authorizing another round of boosters - perhaps specifically targeted to combat new variants of concern - to a broader population after the summer.
""There may be a need for people to get an additional booster in the fall along with a more general booster campaign, if that takes place, because we may need to shift over to a different variant coverage,"" he said.
The FDA said it looked at data from a relatively small, ongoing clinical trial in Israel to help make its decision. In addition, safety data from more than 700,000 people who received second boosters in Israel revealed no new concerns, the agency said. 
Scientists and officials have debated for months if and when an additional booster shot would be needed as they parsed data on how long protection from the vaccines and boosters would last.
""It's not clear that now is the right time for people to get a fourth dose,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said. 
If there is a surge in cases in late fall or early winter, as is typical for respiratory viruses and influenza, an additional boost may then be needed, he said. The body's neutralizing antibodies spurred on by a fourth booster given now may decline in just a few months, he said. 
It is also unclear whether young, healthy people will need a fourth shot. The study of Israeli healthcare workers cited by the FDA suggested that the fourth dose added little additional protection in the age group.
Biden administration officials have said that the U.S. government currently has enough doses of the vaccines to meet the demand for another round of booster shots in older Americans, even as funding for the U.S. pandemic response has all but run out. 

They say that unless Congress approves more spending, the government will not be likely to be able to be pay for future inoculations, if they are needed, particularly if the vaccines need to be redesigned to target new variants. 
Around two-thirds of fully vaccinated Americans over the age of 65 and just over half of people between the age of 50 and 64 have gotten their first booster dose so far.

Subramaniam, 54, joined FedEx in 1991 and is also a company director. He moves into the role as the company faces mounting competition from historical rival  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) and former customer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Higher labor costs and internal missteps have weighed on margins, while UPS has sharpened its operations.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who spent years building his reputation as a vocal corporate agitator, now plans to work mainly behind the scenes with management and adopt what he calls a ""quieter approach"" to force change.
Fresh off three years of strong double digit returns, Ackman told investors on Tuesday that corporate America now knows who he is and that there is no need for the kind of noisy tactics other activist investors might employ.
""All of our interactions with companies over the last five years have been cordial, constructive and productive,"" Ackman wrote in the Pershing Square Holdings Annual Report.
""So if it is helpful to call this quieter approach Pershing Square 3.0, let it hereby be so anointed,"" he wrote.
Ackman on Tuesday put into writing what investors had long suspected; the once voluble investor who fought noisy proxy contests at  Target  (NYSE:TGT),  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway and Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) was shifting gears.
Pershing Square's recent investments - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Canadian Pacific, again, - underscore the new mood as Ackman immediately heaped praise on the men in charge. In earlier years, his pressure campaigns often led to CEO changes at companies like JC Penney (OTC:CPPRQ), Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).
Ackman also said he would never again delve into the noisiest for activism: ""activist short selling"" as he did at nutrition company  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF).
""We have permanently retired from this line of work,"" he wrote.
Ironically, just as Ackman is trying hard to stay out of the limelight, Carl Icahn, the prominent activist he sparred with publicly on cable television over Herbalife, appears to be moving the other way.
Supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co said on Tuesday that Icahn plans to nominate two people to its board. He is also fighting for board seats at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and is battling Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings.

Meanwhile, Ackman wrote Pershing Square 3.0 will make ""our jobs easier and more fun, and our quality of life better.""
While Pershing Square is nursing small losses for 2022, the firm is still faring far better than the broader stock market thanks to interest rate hedges that protected against a sharp market drop. The last three years were lucrative. In 2021, Pershing Square Holdings returned 26.9% after a 70.2% gain in 2020 and a 58.1% increase in 2019.

GRUENHEIDE, Germany (Reuters) - Elon Musk was cheered as he oversaw the handover of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s first German-made cars at its Gruenheide plant on Tuesday, marking the start of the U.S. automaker's inaugural European hub just two years after it was first announced.
Loud music played as 30 clients and their families got a first glimpse of their shining new vehicles through a glitzy, neon-lit Tesla branded tunnel, clapping and cheering as Tesla Chief Executive Musk danced and joked with fans.
""This is a great day for the factory,"" Musk said, describing it as ""another step in the direction of a sustainable future"".
Musk said that Tesla is likely to launch a test version of its new ""Full Self-Driving"" software in Europe later this year, depending on regulatory approval.
""It's quite difficult to do full self-driving in Europe,"" he told factory workers on Tuesday, saying much work needs to be done to handle tricky driving situations in Europe where roads vary a lot by country. 
Although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also attended the event, lauded the gigafactory as the future of the car industry, it has faced opposition and some environmental activists blocked the factory's entrance while displaying banners flagging its high water use.
Two protestors abseiled from a motorway sign near the factory, blocking traffic for hours after the event.
Musk had hoped to begin output from the factory eight months ago, but licensing delays and local concerns around the plant's environmental impact held up the process.
Tesla was forced to service European orders from Shanghai while it awaited its German licence, adding to rising logistics costs at a time when it was struggling with industry-wide chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
It got the final go-ahead from local authorities on March 4 to begin production in Germany, provided it met conditions ranging from its water use to air pollution controls.
The plant opening came on the same day as the top U.S. securities regulator urged a federal judge not to let Musk back out of an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored.
Tesla shares ended up 7.9% at their highest level in more than two months on Tuesday. 
RACE WITH VW 
The new owners received the Model Y Performance configuration, a vehicle costing 63,990 euros ($70,500) with a 514 km (320 miles) range, Tesla said, adding that new orders from the plant could be delivered from April.
Tesla said that around 3,500 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far.
At full capacity, the plant will produce 500,000 cars a year, more than the 450,000 battery-electric vehicles that German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) sold globally in 2021. 
It will also eventually generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, surpassing all other plants in Germany. Tesla is expected to initially import batteries from China for its German-made Model Ys before it starts local battery production.
Musk said on Tuesday that battery production will be a ""challenge"" next year and will be ""the limiting factor"" in the coming years, as Tesla aims to aggressively boost vehicle production. 
For now, Volkswagen still has the inside track in the race to electrify Europe's fleet, with a 25% market share to Tesla's 13%. Musk has said ramping up production would take longer than the two years it took to build the plant.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted Gruenheide would produce around 54,000 cars in 2022, increasing to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.
Volkswagen, which has received 95,000 EV orders in Europe this year, is planning a new 2 billion euro EV factory alongside its existing facility in Wolfsburg and six battery plants across Europe.

But its timeline lags Tesla's, with the EV factory due to open in 2026 and the first battery plant in 2023.

Away from eastern Europe, the week sees the release of a lot of important U.S. economic data, including the much-watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report due out Friday. 
Ahead of that, JOLTs job openings for February came in at 11.3 million, against expectations for 11 million. The data, along with other jobs data to be released this week, will be studied carefully given the Federal Reserve is seen to be mulling whether to move more aggressively on interest rates at its May meeting.
Expectations of sharp interest rate increases have resulted in the 5-year Treasury yield rising above the 30-year yield, the first such inversion since 2006, prompting fears of a recession.
However, stock investors shouldn’t worry just yet, said strategists at JPMorgan Chase. “Recessions don’t typically start ahead of the curve inverting, and the lead-lag could be very substantial, as long as 2 years,” they said, in a note. “Further, over this timeframe equities tended to beat bonds handsomely.”

MILAN (Reuters) -The board of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) on Tuesday was informed about a proposal from CVC for a stake in its enterprise services business and its directors were also briefed on discussions with KKR over a rival approach.
CVC has put a value of 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) including debt on what would be a newly created TIM enterprise services business, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday.
The interest from CVC comes as TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to split TIM's service business from its network operations as part of a broader strategy to revamp the debt-laden former phone monopoly.
U.S. fund KKR pitched a non-binding offer for TIM in November, valuing the whole of the group at 33 billion euros, when including net debt. 
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group's ""untapped value"".
On Monday TIM said it remained in talks with KKR to assess the ""attractiveness, actuality and deliverability"" of its approach. Two people with knowledge of the matter said TIM had asked KKR to further clarify the terms of its bid by April 4.
Also on Monday, TIM said that CVC, in its expression of interest, proposed setting up an entity including connectivity operations for big corporate clients, cloud, cybersecurity and IoT services.
CVC's evaluation of the business, included in the fund's proposal, was first reported by Italian daily La Stampa.
Analysts' valuation for the targeted business ranges widely between 5 and 10 billion euros. TIM and CVC both declined to comment. 
BID INTEREST
The European private equity firm would be interested in taking a share of up to 49% in the business once it would be carved out, sources have previously said.
CVC, which is being advised by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Nomura, requested a 10 week exclusive period for negotiations, including eight weeks for due diligence, the same sources added.
Private equity firms are looking at whether there is value to be found in European telecoms companies as the telcos seek to improve fast services delivered over broadband.
One of the sticking point in negotiations remained KKR's request for due diligence before formalising its bid, which the fund reiterated last week, two sources said. 
In a letter sent to the U.S fund late on Monday, TIM asked KKR to clarify by Monday whether its due diligence would only have a confirmatory nature as requested by the phone group, the sources said.

TIM also asked whether the November price of 10.8 billion euros for the equity was confirmed, and sought details on the financing of the bid after KKR said it would not make extensive recourse to debt, the sources added. 
One of the sources said that in reaffirming its interest for TIM, KKR had made a reference to recent market volatility which raised a question mark over whether the terms of its initial indicative proposal stood.($1 = 0.9098 euros)

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched gains on Tuesday, as a tech-fueled rally and growing hopes of a de-escalation in the Ukraine-Russia conflict helped stocks shrug off further signs from the bond market sounding the alarm on a potential recession. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.3% to close above 4,600 for the first since January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.97%, or 339 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.84%.
Russia sees its pledge to reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas as a means of building up trust in talks with Ukraine that could ultimately lead to an agreement that could prove key to ending the war. 
There are doubts about whether much can be read into Moscow's willingness to scale back military activity as Russia’s progress toward Kyiv has stalled recently, and there wasn’t any mention of cutting back military operations in the South of Ukraine, where fighting has intensified.
The prospect of progress at the talks were boosted a day earlier after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was open to discussing some of the Kremlin’s demands around neutrality.
Oil prices, dominated by headlines from Ukraine and Russia, were in the red, dragging energy stocks lower as investors cooled their expectations of prolonged war disrupting energy supplies.

Investing.com -- Stocks continued to climb higher, as investors await key economic reports on jobs and economic output on Wednesday.
Despite Russia’s continued assault on Ukraine, and peace talks meant to at least achieve a ceasefire, investors appeared to focus on the upcoming data releases. 
The strong surge in stocks, particularly technology shares, in the afternoon on Tuesday came despite a recession warning in the bond market, when the 2-year Treasury yield briefly ran higher than the 10-year for the first time since 2019.
The Federal Reserve is trying to weigh how aggressively to target inflation, and the jobs data this week will factor into its decision making at the May meeting. 
Expectations are building that the Fed will raise rates by a half-point rather than the customary quarter-point increase. On Tuesday, data on job openings showed there were 11.3 million positions available in February, and some five million more than there were workers available.
Oil has been pressured in recent days, falling again on Tuesday ahead of the government’s much-followed report on inventories for the previous week. The oil industry’s own report is due out after the market closes tonight.
Later this week, the government will release data on personal income and spending, which may show how households have been affected by rising prices for food and other goods and gasoline price spikes in the last month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. ADP payrolls
March's ADP non-farm employment change data —  a measure of the monthly change in non-farm, private employment — is set to be released Wednesday morning at 8:15 AM ET. Consensus forecasts are for companies to have added 450,000 jobs, below the previous 475,000 reported. But the data comes a couple of days before the government's broader report on employment and is likely to be a barometer of market sentiment.
2. Economic output
GDP for the fourth quarter will also be reported at 8:30 AM ET, with expectations for a 7.1% reading from the month before, well above the previous 2.3% number.
3. Crude inventories
Elsewhere, crude oil inventory data will be released mid-morning at 10:30 AM ET, with analyst's forecasting crude oil inventories falling 1.022 million barrels. This data comes as oil prices have steadily fallen despite Russia's war on Ukraine and sanctions potentially hitting supply. EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks are forecasted as falling 1.550 million, while gasoline inventories are forecast to fall 1.744 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon delayed its decision to award an enterprise-wide Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract that could be valued as much as $9 billion to December from April, the Pentagon's chief information officer said on Tuesday.
Proposals are being evaluated from four companies: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Pentagon Chief Information Officer John Sherman told reporters. 
""This is going to take us a little bit longer than we thought,"" Sherman said, adding that the workload to evaluate multiple proposals simultaneously was cumbersome. 
Up to four winners could be selected with the combined value of the contracts coming to as much as $9 billion over five years if all options and extensions were exercised, Sherman said.
The JWCC is the multi-cloud successor to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), which was an IT modernization project to build a large, common commercial cloud for the Department of Defense.

While the Trump administration wanted a single cloud-computing provider for the Department of Defense as laid out under JEDI, the Biden administration canceled it in favor of parceling out the project to multiple companies.
Such a move would put the military more in line with private-sector companies, many of whom split up their cloud computing work among multiple vendors to avoid being locked in to any specific one.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Investors publicly rebuked Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Chief Executive Borje Ekholm and the telecom equipment maker's board on Tuesday over a scandal involving potential payments to Islamic State.
Ekholm's handling of an internal probe into Ericsson's operations in Iraq has come under scrutiny after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said the company was in breach of a 2019 deferred prosecution agreement for failing to inform U.S. authorities of potential misconduct it had uncovered there.
The risk of a hefty fine for that breach has lopped a quarter off Ericsson's market value and angered investors, who were not given any information about the company probe until media enquiries about it earlier this year.
At the group's annual general meeting (AGM) on Tuesday, shareholders representing more than 10% of Ericsson shares voted against discharging board members of liability for the previous year. That means Ekholm and other board members could be held personally liable for their actions.
Under Swedish law, if board members are not annually discharged of their liabilities by shareholders owning at least 10% of the stock they can be sued by the company and its investors.
Shareholders, however, approved a proposal to reappoint the CEO and the board.
Several criticised the handling of the Iraq probe during the meeting. But many questions were left unanswered, with Chairman Ronnie Leten and CEO Ekholm saying they were unable to give details due to the ongoing DoJ investigation.
""I fully understand the concern over the recent turbulence in Ericsson. I want to emphasise again the full commitment to rebuild your trust in Ericsson,"" Leten told the meeting.
Ericsson shares closed down 1.6% at 85.87 crowns. 
In comments after the AGM, Leten said Ekholm and the management team had the full support of the board.
""We have made good progress, but there is much still to do,"" he said in emailed comments, noting his work on ethics and compliance in five years at the helm. 
While losing the vote may not mean Ekholm has to step down, it will raise further questions over his stewardship.
Ekholm, the company's chief financial officer Carl Mellander and Ericsson have been named as defendants in a U.S. class action lawsuit accusing them of misleading investors over the company's dealings in Iraq.
In 2014, a scandal over business dealings in Uzbekistan at telecoms company Telia Company, then called TeliaSonera, led shareholders to vote against discharging former CEO Lars Nyberg from personal liability in 2014.
Nyberg was later charged with bribery, but was acquitted by a Swedish court.
TRANSPARENCY 
Ekholm took https://www.reuters.com/article/ericsson-ceo-idINASM00072G the helm at Ericsson in 2016 after a string of poor results https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ericsson-ceo-idUSKCN1050IT and when the company was under investigation by U.S. authorities over bribery allegations.
Backed by top shareholder Investor AB, he revived the company's performance and paid https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU a $1 billion fine to the DoJ to settle bribery cases in several countries.
In the same year, a company probe into its operations in Iraq identified payments designed to circumvent customs at a time when militant organisations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.
While Ekholm has been fostering transparency and urging employees to speak up about improprieties, the company did not disclose details of the new probe to shareholders.
Ekholm told Reuters in February the substance of its findings did not pass the threshold to make a disclosure.
Last week he told investors that he had instructed his staff to disclose the investigation to the authorities. The company replaced Chief Legal Officer Xavier Dedullen, who handled the settlement in 2019, earlier this month.
An Ericsson spokesperson said Dedullen declined to comment.

Cevian, which owns just under 5% of Ericsson shares, had said it would have to vote against discharging board members of their liabilities because it did not have enough information to do otherwise, while it would support their re-election.
Investor AB said it would vote in favour of discharging the board and it had full confidence in the board and CEO.

Cargojet said on Tuesday it had reached a five-year extendable deal to provide air-transportation services for DHL Network Operations, as demand for e-commerce soars during the pandemic. 
Shares of Ontario-based Cargojet, which provides time sensitive air cargo services, rose almost 14% to C$186.10 in mid-day trading.
International flights using widebody aircraft that offer belly space for shippers are returning more slowly than domestic traffic, creating the need for additional capacity on dedicated cargo planes.
DHL Express Division said the deal for Cargojet to support its international requirements could be renewed for an additional two years.
Under the deal, DHL would be issued warrants to acquire up to 9.5% of Cargojet's outstanding voting shares over a period of seven years, at a price of C$158.92 each, with vesting tied to the delivery of C$2.3 billion in business volume during the term. 
""Cargojet is an important aviation partner of DHL in North America and we see this expansion of our relationship further strengthening intra-regional and intercontinental links to and from this region,"" said Mike Parra, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express Americas.

""This step builds on the significant investments we have made in DHL's aviation capacity and capabilities over the last two years in the Americas,"" Parra added.

Delfin, the holding of the Italian billionaire Leonardo del Vecchio, and Fondazione CRT said they ended the pact as of March 27 since the purposes for which they signed it have ceased to exist.
Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle that has cast doubt on the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, whose term ends in April.
With the backing of Mediobanca, the insurer's board has put Donnet forward for a third term.
Italian tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who is Generali's second-largest shareholder, has proposed veteran former Generali executive Luciano Cirina as CEO in a challenge to Donnet.
Caltagirone, who holds 9.52% in Generali, had also been part of the pact with Delfin and CRT but quit in January to prevent, sources said at that time, regulatory scrutiny on whether the alliance was indeed a consultation pact or represented a more substantial concert party which could have seen its voting power curtailed.

Investment bank Mediobanca is the largest shareholder in Generali and the row over the board stems from differences between it and the other large investors over how the insurer is run.

Despite the momentum, there are signs that the end of pandemic-era financial aid and inflation hovering at 40-year-highs, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are beginning to hurt the finances of lower-income Americans.
Executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which together bank around half of all U.S. households, have said for months the American consumer is in good health, spending more and using account balances, which grew during the pandemic, to pay down credit cards and other debt.
So far, they say, consumer spending appears to be holding up. But the outlook for income growth an 
Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, said its customers spent $63 billion in February on debit and credit cards, up 21% from a year ago, with higher spending on travel, dining, public transportation and gym memberships.
""We saw a strong continuation of payment and spending trends in February,"" said Mary Hines Droesch, head of consumer and small business products at Bank of America. ""(The data) suggest more consumers are returning to the office and resuming more in-person activities.""
U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March, while retail sales in February, the most recent month available, rose more than 17% over last year, according to data from the U.S. Commerce Department.
""Despite record-high inflation and an 11-year low in consumer sentiment, U.S. consumption, especially retail sales, has proven resilient,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management. 
Consumer behavior was bolstered by a tight labor market, excess savings and ""solid household balance sheets,"" she said. 
More data will be available on April 13 when JPMorgan kicks off earnings season, followed by Wells Fargo on April 14 and Bank of America on April 18. 
While people return to old spending habits - confidence about their prospects for meaningfully growing income over the next two years is at an eight-year-low, according to data from the University of Michigan, and economists say real incomes, a more specific measure of wealth, are cratering.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economic analyst Jason Briggs expects that real household income will only grow by 0.5% in 2022, and that income for the lowest-wage earners will decline this year because of inflation and the end of government assistance.
""The largest headwind to real spending growth in 2022 is very weak real income growth,"" Briggs wrote in a note to investors last week. 
One area of lending - cars - is seeing a rise in delinquencies from borrowers who have the lowest-quality credit. 
Delinquencies on auto loans rose in February for the ninth-straight month, led by sub-prime borrowers, according to a report from Manheim Consulting. The report also found that the percentage of sub-prime auto loans in serious delinquency was at its highest rate since 2006, although the proportion of overall loans that are subprime has been hovering near record lows.
The New York Federal Reserve last week identified another possible reason for trouble on the horizon: 37 million federal student loan borrowers will have to start making payments again starting in May. 
Payments on federal student loans have been suspended since March 2020 when the government temporarily placed these loans in administrative forbearance.

Meanwhile, the 10 million borrowers with private student loans who had to continue making payments ""struggled with their debt,"" New York Fed research analysts wrote.
""The difficulties faced by these borrowers in managing their (private) student loans and other debts suggest that (federal student loan) borrowers will face rising delinquencies once forbearance ends and payments resume,"" New York Fed researchers wrote in a blog post.

The move comes a week after the Dutch Senate passed a motion asking Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government to ""use its powers"" to temporarily block construction of the site in the northern town of Zeewolde, 50 km east of Amsterdam.
""Given the current circumstances, we have decided to pause our development efforts in Zeewolde,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.
The town in December had approved plans to build the largest facility of its kind in the Netherlands, from which Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would serve users across Europe.
It would use 1.38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and cover 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, and was expected to run on green energy and create 400 permanent jobs.
It was, however, opposed by some environmental campaigners who do not want the limited supply of sustainable power generated in the Netherlands to be used by a multinational company. Some residents of Zeewolde said they felt their voices had not been heard in the permitting process.
The Senate motion asked the government to delay construction until a government policy on data centres had been agreed.

“After having been invited in 2019 by the local, provincial and national government to consider a data center investment in the Netherlands and Zeewolde in particular, Meta envisioned a strong partnership that would bring jobs and community benefits to the region,"" the spokesperson said.
The company left the door open to restarting the project, saying it would continue to cooperate with the municipality over what to do next.

The agreement will see the companies work together to create, develop, manufacture, and commercialize IgM antibody agonists against three oncology targets and three immunology/inflammation targets.
According to Sanofi, the terms of the collaboration see IGM receive a $150 million upfront payment, as well as Sanofi expressing an interest in purchasing up to $100 million of IGM common stock.
In addition, IGM will lead the research and development activities and assume related costs from the approval of the first biologics license application in exchange for up to $940 million in development and regulatory milestones per oncology target.
Sanofi will lead all following development and commercialization activities for its oncology target after the first marketing approval, leading to the companies sharing profits 50:50 and IGM eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales in the rest of the world.

The deal offers $28 for each Nielsen share, a premium of 60% since early March when the deal talks were first reported. Shares of Nielsen jumped about 21% in mid-day trading.
Nielsen had earlier this month rejected an offer of $25.40 per share from the consortium without naming the suitors. 
The offer was led by Brookfield and Elliott Management's tech-focused private equity arm Evergreen Coast Capital Corp, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Nielsen gathers viewership data across TV, radio and digital platforms that are used by advertisers and others to determine prime-time hours, but it has been under pressure as more cord-cutters move to streaming.
""As a private company, Nielsen will be even better positioned to deliver the best measures of consumers' rapidly changing behaviors across all channels and platforms,"" said Dave Gregory, Managing Partner at Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU), which is investing about $2.65 billion in preferred equity.
Activist investor Elliott had pushed Nielsen for a sale in 2018, forcing the market research company to consider splitting into two publicly traded firms a year later.

But the plan was scrapped in 2020 when Nielsen decided to sell its consumer goods data unit for $2.7 billion to sharpen focus on its media business.
Including debt, Tuesday's deal is valued at $16 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.

Investing.com – NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) stock traded 4.5% lower Tuesday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded it to ‘equal-weight’ with a target of $28.
The stock has traded at a low of $26.47 so far in the session that’s still underway.
According to StreetInsider, the brokerage sees “limited catalysts” for the cybersecurity company.
""Slowing topline and macro suggest downside risk to FY23 consensus revenue estimates, while NortonLifeLock faces an uncertain regulatory path for closing the proposed Avast transaction,” analyst Hamza Fodderwala wrote in a note.
Earlier this month, Britain's anti-trust regulator said the company’s proposed $8.6 billion purchase of Avast needed a deeper probe owing to competition concerns.
The Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software.
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation, and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe, according to a Reuters report earlier.
NortonLifeLock had then said it did not plan to propose any remedies. It called the CMA's decision ""surprising.""
Under the deal announced in August, Avast shareholders were to get a mix of cash and newly issued shares. NortonLifeLock expected the merger to result in cost savings of $280 million.
If the deal fructifies, the new company will serve more than 500 million users including around 40 million direct customers."

Assuming the underwriters choose to subscribe to the 825,000 shares they have the option of buying, the dilution will amount to about 9.6% of the current outstanding equity. A share dilution tends to depress a company’s earnings per share.  
Southwest’s purchase of Questar was opposed by investor Carl Icahn, whose offer to buy the former at $82.50 per share was rejected by the company. Southwest shares are currently trading around $78.
It termed Icahn’s offer “inadequate, structurally coercive, highly conditional” and said it undervalues the company. The activist investor’s first offer of $75 for each share of the company was rejected by it on November 9 last year.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has made little secret in recent weeks of his ire at state-run oil company Petrobras over rising fuel prices, teasing the possibility of swapping out its chief executive.
However, Adriano Pires, the man tapped for the job on Monday, did not fit the profile that the market was expecting.
A well-known energy consultant and academic who once worked at national oil regulator ANP, Pires is a staunch defender of the market-friendly policies at Petrobras that Bolsonaro bashes, particularly the way it tracks global energy markets with its domestic fuel prices.
In a public debate last month, Pires said he hoped Brent prices would soar to $200 per barrel so the government could rake in tens of billions of dollars in dividends as the largest shareholder of Petrobras. 
In a column this month for financial blog Brazil Journal, he criticized the company for keeping domestic prices too far below global benchmarks.
That may be one reason the market seems to have taken the sudden putsch of current CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna in stride. 
Brazil-listed preferred shares in the company, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, opened 2% higher on Tuesday, even amid fears the shake-up may portend more intense political pressure heading into Brazil's October elections. 
""Pires is someone with a technical background in the energy sector who sympathizes with Petrobras' current pricing policy. Therefore, for now we do not see negative impacts in the medium term,"" Guide Investimentos analyst Rodrigo Crespi wrote in a note to clients.
Pires, who did not respond to a request for comment, holds a doctorate from the Sorbonne, and co-founded the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure think tank (CBIE). 
He is a long-time columnist, consultant and professor of energy policy, and spent roughly two and a half years in high-ranking positions in Brazil's ANP national oil regulator through 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile.
In his public comments and articles, Pires has not advocated a totally hands-off approach to the fuel market, instead calling for measures that would cushion consumers from high fuel prices without incurring losses for Petrobras and the private sector.
In particular, he has favored a government fund, financed in part by royalties currently paid by oil producers in Brazil, that would help to stabilize fuel prices at the pump during periods of high volatility. 

Bolsonaro has also shown interest in such a policy, which is awaiting consideration in the lower house of Congress after government allies pushed a bill through the Senate.
However, the proposal has met stiff resistance from Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who argues it would serve little social purpose, particularly when compared to its potentially enormous impact on public finances.

NextEra, however, said the department's decision did not affect the company's long-term financial expectations. 
U.S. trade officials on Monday said they would launch an investigation that could result in tariffs on solar panels imported from four Southeast Asian nations, a blow to clean energy project developers, like NextEra, that rely on cheap imports to keep costs down.
The Commerce Department's decision regarding imports from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia was a victory for Auxin Solar. The San Jose, California-based solar manufacturer this year requested the probe, arguing that Chinese manufacturers shifted production to those nations to avoid paying U.S. duties in place for nearly a decade on Chinese-made solar goods.
""We are disappointed with the Commerce Department's decision to grant Auxin's request to investigate as we believe it has no merit,"" NextEra Chief Executive John Ketchum said in a statement.
""However, we are optimistic the investigation will be resolved favorably and that no additional antidumping and countervailing duties tariffs will be put in place,"" Ketchum said.
But, he said ""some of NextEra's solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by the disruption this decision is expected to cause.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday said it will review whether startup technology firm Pony.ai complied with government reporting requirements for driverless crashes.
Pony.ai earlier this month agreed to issue a recall for some versions of its autonomous driving system software after an October crash in California. The recall, which the NHTSA said was the ""first recall of an automated driving system,"" covered three vehicles.
The NHTSA said it will review whether Toyota-backed Pony.ai complied with reporting requirements ""with respect to both the timeliness and accuracy of its reports.""
On Oct. 28, a Pony.ai vehicle that had been operating in autonomous mode hit a street sign on a median in Fremont, California, after turning right, prompting California in December to suspend the company's driverless testing permit. No one was injured in the incident.
Pony.ai on Tuesday said it reported the incident to the NHTSA in ""a good faith effort to comply with the relevant requirements"" and added that it ""has been fully cooperating with NHTSA throughout the process.""
Pony.ai said earlier that the crash occurred less than 2.5 seconds after the automated driving system shut down. It said in very rare circumstances, a planning system diagnostic check ""could generate a 'false positive' indication of a geolocation mismatch.""
The NHTSA told Pony.ai earlier it believed the software had a safety defect and requested that the company conduct a recall. 
The company said it has updated the software code and the three affected vehicles have been repaired.
Earlier this month, Pony.ai announced that it had completed a new round of financing that gives it a valuation of $8.5 billion. 

California last year said Pony.ai had 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit.
The suspension does not impact Pony.ai's permit for testing with a safety driver.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Bermuda court on Tuesday ruled former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and his family are due damages ""substantially in excess of $500 million"" from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s local life insurance arm in a costly setback for the bank.
The court said that Ivanishvili and his family were due the damages as a result of a long-running fraud committed by a former Credit Suisse adviser, Pascale Lescaudron.
Credit Suisse said its life insurance subsidiary, which is in the process of being wound down, intended to ""vigorously pursue"" an appeal of the verdict.
The ruling is another blow for the scandal-stricken bank, still reeling from billions in losses racked up in 2021, which prompted a top management shake-up, and as it faces further probes over compliance and risk failings.
Chief Justice Narinder Hargun of the Supreme Court of Bermuda said: ""CS Life did not take action or adequate action to prevent Mr. Lescaudron's fraudulent mismanagement of the policy accounts because it was prioritising the revenues Mr. Lescaudron generated for Credit Suisse over the interest of its clients."" 
A client of Credit Suisse between 2005 and 2015, Ivanishvili alleged he racked up hundreds of millions in losses due to forged trades made by his Geneva-based private banker, Lescaudron, appointed to handle his investments in 2006.
Lescaudron was convicted by a Swiss court in 2018 of having forged the signatures of former clients, including Ivanishvili, over an eight year period, and admitted he falsified trades and hid mounting losses as part of a scheme that made him tens of millions of Swiss francs. 
The Bermuda case covers only a portion of the damages Ivanishvili is seeking from Credit Suisse, centering on roughly $400 million in alleged losses incurred from fraudulent and ""imprudent"" trades on $755 million invested in insurance policies at Credit Suisse's Bermuda-based life insurance subsidiary, CS Life.
The Bermuda court said the extent of damages was yet to be settled but should be calculated based on the amount Ivanishvili's policies would have generated through March 29, 2022 had they been invested in a suitable medium-risk portfolio instead.
""The plaintiff's primary claim is for damages calculated as amounting to $553.86 million as of 31 July 2020, being the difference between the value of the assets on the policy accounts...and the total value...had they been invested instead in the medium-risk portfolio identified by the plaintiffs' investment expert,"" Hargun said in the verdict delivered by video conference.
'SEVERE CRITICISM'
A spokesperson for Ivanishvili said the ruling confirmed the Bermuda subsidiary was aware of Lescaudron's frauds.
""It is shocking that Credit Suisse continues to refuse to offer the Claimants compensation or repay the money it admits was stolen, whilst continuing to behave in a manner which has drawn severe criticism from the Court,"" he said.
Total losses yet to be repaid, spanning investments in Bermuda, Singapore and Switzerland, exceeded $800 million, he said.
The spokesperson also said Ivanishvili and his family would continue to quantify losses incurred both in Bermuda and in Singapore, ""where Credit Suisse's Trust business is adopting the same tactics to avoid taking responsibility.""
The Swiss bank last week flagged potential losses exceeding $500 million in connection with the Bermuda ruling.
Lescaudron, sentenced to five years in prison by a Swiss court in 2018, was ordered to pay damages of $130 million in Switzerland in connection with the fraudulent schemes set up in relation to Ivanishvili and other clients.
Credit Suisse was recognised as a victim in the Swiss case, and has said Lescaudron operated as a lone wolf and worked to conceal his illegal activities from the bank.
The Bermuda court said Lescaudron's fraudulent mismagement included making investment decisions without proper authority, making sales and purchases below market value and ""forging documents (and) executing investments for the purpose of obtaining unlawful commissions.""
Credit Suisse last week said it had already set aside reserves to handle the Bermuda matter, without specifying further, and would determine whether it needed to increase them.

Ivanishvili is also suing the bank and an affiliate, Credit Suisse Trust Ltd., in Singapore over trusts set up there.
He is seeking a further $300 million in the Singapore case, his spokesperson said, which is set to go on trial in September.

According to the government gazette, Deutsche Bank had not applied the required measures to manage the ""existing conflict of interest in the repurchase from clients of structured bonds issued by Deutsche Bank Group, applying significant spreads compared to their fair value of which customers were not informed.""

Several copper miners have paused investment decisions in the country while the political negotiations play out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department said Tuesday https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2020-0052-0078 it had approved the bid of China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp to temporarily move New York-to-Shanghai flights over COVID-19 measures to a different Chinese airport.
The department granted China Eastern's request starting March 31 to move existing twice weekly Shanghai westbound passenger flights from New York to China's Fuzhou Change International Airport in Fuji province through the end of April.
The Chinese airline said earlier because of ""evolving coronavirus pandemic control measures in the Shanghai region, China Eastern has been instructed"" by Chinese aviation officials ""to divert Shanghai-bound passenger flights arriving from the U.S. to certain alternate airports in China."" 
China's aviation regulator said earlier this month it would divert 106 international flights scheduled to arrive in Shanghai to other domestic cities from March 21 to May 1 due to COVID-19.
The affected flights include those operated by Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Juneau Air and Spring Airlines, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.
On Tuesday, China’s most populous city tightened the first phase of a two-stage COVID lockdown, asking some residents to stay indoors unless they are getting tested as the number of new daily cases exceeded 4,400.
The financial hub of Shanghai, home to 26 million people, is in its second day of a lockdown authorities are imposing by dividing the city roughly along the Huangpu River, splitting the historic center from the eastern financial and industrial district of Pudding to allow for staggered testing.

Since early 2020, China and the United States have been at odds at various times about international flights between the two nations and restrictions imposed by both countries.
In January, the U.S. government said it was suspending 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government's decision to suspend some U.S. carrier flights over COVID-19 concerns.

Investing.com --  Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) is reportedly nearing a deal with a San Francisco company to add more taxis to its platform, the New York Times reported Tuesday. 
The report cited people familiar with the matter as saying Uber is close to completing a deal with a San Francisco partner, Flywheel Technologies, to allow Uber passengers to call a taxi through the Uber app. The NYT also said it has seen a video presentation by the city’s transportation agency.
The potential deal follows a similar move from Uber last week that saw the company partner with New York City taxi companies. It marks a further move away from the company's previous stance that put it at loggerheads with traditional taxi firms.  
It also adds to the positive news for Uber after it was granted a two-and-a-half-year license to operate private hire vehicles in London.

The next is a $15 monthly or $100 annual PS Plus Extra package that includes a selection of 400 downloadable PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles.
The most expensive package PS Plus Premium costs $18 a month or $120 annually. It includes 340 more games than Extra, and lets players stream a wide selection of games.

The analyst also lowered sales estimates for this and next year to more reflect the consensus view among analysts. This has resulted in a new price target of $140.00 per share, down from the prior $185.00.
Though ETSY beat expectations last quarter, we think the macroeconomic environment has materially worsened since our last note in late February. We now expect 15% GMS growth this year, down from our prior estimate of 19%. We have GMS targeted to grow 20% over the longer term, compared to our prior estimates of 25% (which were above management's long-term outlook). Our earnings estimates were already below consensus, but we are lowering them today on additional inflation in digital advertising. We are hearing from several consumer companies of digital marketing inflation in the 20-40% range. The consumer is distracted, pushing up CAC more than inflation, Champine wrote in a client note.
Another reason why the analyst downgraded Etsy is the fact that she sees potential for negative near-term catalysts.
We see significant risks to expectations for sales and profitability this year, and our new estimates may prove aggressive barring an easing of inflation.
Despite these near-term challenges, the analyst remains positive on the long-term outlook for the ETSY stock.
We believe in the long-term growth potential given the differentiated offerings, brand equity, and improving search functionality Etsy offers, the analyst concluded.

The Russian market is gradually reopening after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
By 1333 GMT, the rouble was up 5.2% against the dollar at 85.10, having earlier touched 82.9525, its strongest since Feb. 25. It gained 1.9% to trade at 94.76 versus the euro, earlier clipping a Feb. 25 high of 92.10. 
In offshore trade, the rouble was weaker, hovering at 87 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform.
Two powerful drivers - Russia switching to roubles for gas export payments and exporting firms being mandated to convert 80% of their foreign currency earnings into roubles - are supporting the Russian currency, said Iskander Lutsko, chief investment strategist at ITI Capital. 
""The market now really depends on progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,"" Lutsko said of the Russian stock market, as the two sides met for face-to-face talks in Turkey and there were signs of tentative progress.
STOCKS RECOVER
Russian stocks were trading in curtailed sessions and with various restrictions, including a ban on short-selling. Non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1. Trading volumes are far lower than normal.
The dollar-denominated RTS index finished the shorter session up 7.1% at 881.6 points, but the rouble-based MOEX Russian index pared early gains to shed 0.9% to 2,408.5 points.
Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCredit Bank, said the entire capitalisation of the MOEX index is now about six times smaller than the market capitalisation of U.S. tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Flag carrier Aeroflot, one of the most volatile securities since the reopening, jumped 16.4%. Oil major Rosneft was 3.4% higher and dominant state lender Sberbank gained 3%. 
The Moscow-listed shares and depositary receipts of some companies with primary listings abroad returned to trading on Tuesday. 
Nasdaq-listed tech giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) saw its Moscow shares climb 4.6%, while depositary receipts in London-listed retailer Fix Price soared 13.2%. 
London-listed internet firm VK, one of a few companies to have flagged issues with servicing debt, saw its Moscow depositary receipts leap 72.3%, recovering to levels seen in mid February.
Moscow Exchange said it had held ""discrete auctions"" on securities of Aeroflot and VK. A discrete auction is a tool the bourse can use to try and ease extraordinary volatility and allow a base price for the security to form.
VK securities closed the session at a price of 510 roubles, up from a record low hit on Feb. 24, but still way off levels of around 2,000 roubles seen in early 2021. 
VK's flagship social network Vkontakte has set new records for user activity in the last month, in the wake of foreign platforms being blocked.
""Market participants are probably over-valuing the company after the work of rival social networks was restricted in Russia,"" said BCS analysts. 
EUROBOND TEST
Russia's finance ministry said on Tuesday it had fully paid a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2035, its third payout since unprecedented Western sanctions called Russia's ability to service foreign currency debt into question.

But Russia retaliated in what it has called an ""economic war"" with the West by offering to buy back its $2 billion Eurobonds maturing next month in roubles rather than dollars.
Yields on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds dropped to 12.68%, moving further away from last week's record high of 19.74%, which was just below the central bank's key interest rate. Yields move inversely to prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Tuesday likened himself to the rapper Eminem in seeking to throw out his 2018 agreement with the top U.S. securities regulator requiring the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive to obtain preapproval for his tweets.
In a filing in federal court in Manhattan, Musk also renewed his effort to quash a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena for details on whether he and Tesla are complying with their disclosure requirements under the 2018 consent decree.
The SEC is investigating Musk's Nov. 6, 2021, tweet asking his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake, to cover tax bills on stock options. He has since sold about $16.4 billion of his shares in the electric car company.
In Tuesday's filing, Musk said requiring Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets was an unconstitutional prior restraint on his speech, violating the First Amendment.
""The (SEC) won't let me be or let me be me so let me see; They tried to shut me down,"" Musk said, quoting from Eminem's 2002 song ""Without Me.""
Eminem's lyrics referred to the Federal Communications Commission, which had fined radio stations playing ""The Real Slim Shady,"" an Eminem song whose content it deemed offensive.
Musk also said the SEC issued its subpoena in bad faith, and could not pursue a ""fishing expedition"" to harass him.
The SEC declined to comment.
It has said Musk was not immune from scrutiny over his Tesla-related tweets, and should not be excused from the 2018 agreement because he found compliance ""less convenient than he had hoped.""
That agreement stemmed from Musk's Aug. 7, 2018, tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take Tesla private. Musk said on Tuesday that the tweet was truthful.

The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan. She last week won U.S. Senate approval to become a federal appellate judge, and may continue presiding over her existing cases.
The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865.

Western companies from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have stepped back from Russia, under pressure from customers and their governments to inflict an economic price on Moscow for waging war on its neighbour. Western sanctions on Russia have also complicated doing business there. 
""In strict compliance with international sanctions, Decathlon notes that the supply conditions are no longer met to continue its activity in Russia. Decathlon has to suspend the operation of its stores,"" it said in a statement.
Decathlon imports the bulk of the products it sells in its 60 stores in Russia. It said it would continue to support its 2,500 Russian staff, some of whom have been involved with the company since 2006.
Auchan, which has around 30,000 staff, 231 stores and e-commerce activities in Russia, where it makes 10% of its global turnover, has been singled out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for continuing operations in Russia.
The CEO of Auchan, however, told French newspaper Journal du Dimanche on Sunday the company planned to maintain its presence in Russia, in part because it feared losing assets or exposing local managers to legal troubles if it pulled out.
A spokesperson for Auchan told Reuters on Tuesday there was no change in the company's position towards Russia. The retailer sources the bulk of the products it sells in Russia locally.

Leroy Merlin, which has 45,000 employees and 113 stores in Russia, also sources most of its products locally. The company, which made 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of revenues in Russia last year - behind only France - said it was maintaining its presence in Russia for the same reasons as Auchan.

Investing.com – Dave & Buster’s (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock surged 7.7% Tuesday after the entertainment and dining chain said the current financial year has started on a strong note.
The company said comparable store sales in the first eight weeks of the new financial year were up 5.4%, compared with the same period in 2019. Walk-in comparable store sales increased 9.1%, compared to the same period two years ago, benefiting from the return to offices and people’s desire to step out after two years of the pandemic.
Traders chose to focus on the company saying that all its 142 stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico were open at the end of its fourth quarter on January 30, ignoring its miss on both sales and earnings fronts during the period.
Revenue fell by 1.2% from the fourth quarter of 2019 but nearly tripled from a year ago to top $343 million. Net income in the quarter was nearly $26 million compared to a loss a year ago and marginally higher than the 2019 period profit.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday on relief at signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, even though hostilities continue to rage on the ground. 
Russia's chief negotiator said his country had agreed to de-escalate the attacks on the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv in an effort to ""build trust."" Earlier, Mikhaylo Podolyak, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, had briefed that discussions on a ceasefire had taken place that were based on a future of armed neutrality for Ukraine, guaranteed by various countries including the U.S. and Russia, while Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that Russia had effectively achieved its aims in securing the 'liberation' of the eastern region of Donbas. 
It wasn't immediately clear whether the progress made would be acceptable to the top leadership of either country, given that Ukraine still refuses to acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea and given Vladimir Putin's previous comments on the need to restore a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. However, Russia appears to have dropped its implicit demand for regime change in Ukraine, something it styled as 'de-Nazification' even though Ukraine's President is both Jewish and democratically elected.
The news more than made up for worrying signs of inflation from the housing market, where annual house prices rose by 18.2% in the year through January, according to data released earlier. There were also fresh signs of tightness in the labor market, with the number of job openings rising again last month
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 359 points, or 1.0%, at 35,315 points, while the S&P was up 0.9% to stand less than 4% off its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3%.
Markets were mainly affected, as so often in recent weeks, through the oil channel. Peace would reduce the likelihood of extreme western action to remove Russian energy exports from world markets, the threat of which has driven oil, gas, and coal up just as inflation is running at a four-decade high in much of the world. Lower oil prices would change the outlook for inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in tightening monetary policy. As such, bond yields fell along the yield curve, bringing down the cost of capital for companies and improving the outlook for equity returns.  
Among early movers, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock rose 4.2%, helped not only by the prospect of lower fuel costs but also by the news Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam will take over as CEO from June 1, replacing long-time leader Fred Smith. Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) stock rose 21% after the market research company agreed to be bought by a Brookfield-led private equity consortium for around $16 billion including debt.
Elsewhere, Dave & Buster’s (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock rose 4.0% after the restaurant and entertainment chain said comparable sales were up 5.4% from pre-COVID times in the first eight weeks of the year - an update that more than made up for a quarterly report that missed expectations on both top and bottom lines due to various pandemic-related issues.",,,,,

In addition, the company said it now sees first-quarter revenue below the low end of its prior guidance of $118 - $120 million and EBITDA for the quarter below the low end of its previous guidance of $(15) - $(12) million. The larger loss was driven by higher than anticipated Clinical Services cost of goods sold. NeoGenomics also withdrew its 2022 annual financial guidance.
While the company said the CEO's departure was mutually agreed upon and not due to any disagreements, inappropriate action, or violation, the news took Wall Street by surprise. Two Wall Street analysts downgraded the shares following the announcement.
Stephens analyst Mason Carrico downgrades shares to Equal-weight from Overweight on ""increased near-term uncertainty"" following the CEO news, headwinds in the base business, and depressed margins. Carrico said while he may be downgrading shares near a bottom, he expects the stock to ""languish"" over the next year. He cut his price target to $16 from $34.
BofA Securities analyst Derik de Bruin cut shares to Hold from Buy with a new price target of $18 following the news. The analyst lowered FY22/23 revenue forecasts while increasing their net loss per share assumptions. After speaking with management, they indicated some incremental COVID-19 headwinds in the first quarter, and test volumes have not bounced back. Management is unsure why but sees this as more of a NEO-specific issue than an industry-wide one."
749,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 09:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - French provider of edible insects for animal and human feed Ynsect said on Tuesday it had purchased U.S. mealworm producer Jord Producers, expanding its footprint in the booming U.S. pet food market.
Ynsect breeds mealworms that produce proteins for aquaculture, livestock, pet food and fertilisers. 
The company made its first entry into the U.S. market in late 2021 through a supply deal to Pure Simple to make premium food for dogs.
The acquisition of Jord Producers, based in Nebraska, will allow it to enter the fast-growing backyard chicken feed sector, it said. 
The number of Americans having chickens in their backyards has doubled since 2018. By 2026, the U.S. market is predicted to reach approximately $400 million, according to a recent study by consultancy Arthur D. Little, cited by Ynsect. 
Pet food makers are increasingly using insects such as flies and mealworms as a sustainable source of protein, capitalising on rising pet ownership and booming demand from environmentally conscious consumers.
Farmed bugs require far less land, water and feed than livestock and they emit less greenhouse gasses.
French rival InnovaFeed signed a deal with U.S. grains merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland last month to supply insect protein to its pet food division.
Last year Ynsect agreed to take over Dutch firm Protifarm, a leader in insect ingredients for human food, marking a move into the food market amid rising demand for healthy, eco-friendly eating.
The company, which raised around $450 million from global investors, is building what it says will be the world's largest vertical farm, which uses stacked layers, in Amiens, northern France, set to open in the last quarter of 2022.

A spokesperson for Aptiv declined to comment on the production halt but said the company was following government orders and customers' production would not be impacted.
Aptiv has a number of production sites in Shanghai's Jiading district in the western part of the city. The district has not been affected so far by the city's two-stage COVID-19 lockdown, which started in the east on Monday. 
Four sources said workers at one of the sites, which makes wire harnesses, were abruptly told to head home on Tuesday. They declined to be named as the information was not public.
The affected workers were told to stay home on Wednesday and await a further notice, the sources added.
Customers of the plant include Tesla and GM's Shanghai joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp, two of the sources said. 
Tesla, GM and SAIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Wire harnesses are vital components that bundle up to 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of cables in the typical car. They are unique to each model and vehicles cannot be built without them. 
Automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have been scrambling to find alternative sources of wire harnesses and other parts as Russia's invasion of Ukraine - a key producer of harnesses - has halted assembly lines and disrupted complex supply chains.
Aptiv is one of China's largest auto wire producers and supplies almost all carmakers in China, according to the website of the Jiading district.
Besides Tesla and GM, it supplies Volkswagen's joint ventures with SAIC, as well as Ford and Toyota. Reuters could not immediately establish how extensive Aptiv's production halt was and when production was set to resume.
The production pause comes as Shanghai, home to 26 million people, tightened the first phase of its lockdown on Tuesday, with daily new cases hitting a record above 4,400. 
Shanghai's western districts are set to go under lockdown on Friday until the early hours of April 5. 

China's ""dynamic clearing"" playbook sees local authorities rapidly identify and quarantine every infected person and their close contacts, and venues where cases are found can be locked down for up to 14 days.
GM has managed to maintain production at normal levels in the face of Shanghai's lockdown by having workers sleep at the factory, sources told Reuters. Tesla on Monday suspended production for four days.

Brokerages, asset managers and financial exchanges in Lujiazui - China's answer to Wall Street - rushed to summon key personnel to offices ahead of Monday's lockdown in Shanghai, and prepared sleeping bags and basic supplies for overnight stays.
Some have also adopted two-team rotation shifts, and initiated disaster recovery centres in a financial hub that processed more than 2,500 trillion yuan ($292 trillion) of financial transactions last year.
The 20,000 people working at 285 office towers in Pudong's Lujiazui Financial City, east of the Huangpu River, include white collar workers and some service staff, according to the administration bureau of the district, also home to some non-financial institutions.
Shanghai, home to 26 million people, started a lockdown on Monday by dividing the city roughly along the Huangpu River, to allow for staggered testing. Shanghai houses China's biggest markets for stock, bond, foreign exchange and derivative trading. 
Amundi BOC Wealth Management Co said its senior executives, as well as key investment, trading and risk-management staff are working and sleeping in their offices, to ensure smooth business operations.
Meanwhile Haitong Securities Co said Chairman Zhou Jie arranged emergency on-site duty shifts at its subsidiaries in Pudong on Sunday night, and led more than 150 key staff to work in offices starting Monday. The brokerage also kicked off two-team rotation shifts between its two office areas, it said on its official website. 
HFT Investment Management, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' Chinese fund venture, also put 52 workers in key positions in offices around the clock during the lockdown period.
Elsewhere Sinolink Securities issued a notice on Sunday night, urging its staff on duty to rush back to its headquarters in Pudong before midnight, so as to ""ensure continuity of system operation and trading"", the Chinese brokerage said on its website.
An executive at a foreign bank in Shanghai, who declined to be identified, said his bank is on a hybrid working model, with some staff working and sleeping at a backup office in Puxi, in the western side of the city, while some others staying in a trading room in Pudong.
A source at another foreign bank said the lender had been using disaster recovery centres for over a week, a practice that will continue. 
The officials declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange told Reuters it kept minimum teams of staff in key positions within the bourse, while others work from home in an arrangement designed to minimise human contacts, while ensuring safety of trading.

Stocks with the highest ownership include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 51.5% of fund managers, but still below broader semis peers, which suggests there is still room for current owners to increase their exposure.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is another semi stock with high ownership (39%), while relative weighting is now at lowest levels on record. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has the same level of ownership as TXN with a relative weighting down 25% YoY.
Additionally, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO),Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) are less owned than smaller market cap peers.
""We see opportunity for expanded ownership breadth for AVGO, AMD which, despite their large ~ $200bn+ market caps are owned by only 21%/30% of funds, respectively, below peers with smaller market caps. AVGO is owned by fewer investors but with larger weighting (concentration, 1.9x, above semis average), but AMD weighting of 0.96x is well below, so presents opportunity for greater depth also. Separately MU is owned by only 14% of funds, below similar mkt cap peers, though MUs depth of ownership of 1.21x is up the most QoQ (and 2nd most YoY) within semis,"" Arya said in a client note

The deal will combine the provider of healthcare services at home, mainly for older patients dealing with chronic illness and injuries, with UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s Optum unit, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services.
Demand for home healthcare over clinic-based services has increased in the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as patients and caregivers increasingly prefer to access vital services from the safety of their homes.
The deal comes a month after the U.S. Justice Department sued to stop UnitedHealth's $8 billion acquisition of billing and payment services provider Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG), saying the deal would give the health insurer access to its competitors' data.
UnitedHealth will pay $170 for each share of LHC Group, representing an 8.12% premium to the stock's last close.
Shares of LHC climbed 7.5% and were trading just shy of the offer at $168.70 before the opening bell, while those of UNH rose marginally.
UnitedHealth expects the LHC deal to be neutral to its outlook for adjusted profit per share in 2022 and modestly add in 2023. LHC Group co-founders Keith and Ginger Myers will invest $10 million in the health insurer's stock, following the close of the deal.

Last year, health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) acquired the remaining 60% stake it did not own in home health provider Kindred at Home for $5.7 billion to expand its patient care business.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will ban the shipment to Russia of precious metals, especially gold, in response to its invasion of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.
The ban on Russia-bound precious metal reflects Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's resolve to impose further sanctions against the country, pledged at last week's meeting of leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced nations.
From April 5, Japan will ban the export of precious metals such as gold as well as other items including luxury cars, jewellery, cosmetics and liquor. 
Japan's move comes after the United States and Britain took steps to curtail transactions in gold with Russia.
Britain revised its sanctions guidance on Friday to make clear that British entities cannot help Moscow sell its gold reserves, while the U.S. Treasury Department said a day earlier that gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by U.S. authorities.
Russia-bound exports of gold would require pre-approval by Japan's finance minister, as the new rule starts to take place on April 5, government officials said.
The latest ban comes on top of curbs on high-tech exports to Russia, including semiconductors, censors and communication equipment.
Kishida has announced plans to revoke Russia's most-favoured-nation trading status, which could lead to higher tariffs on its imports, as well as a ban on certain imports from Russia.

Japan has also frozen the assets of more than 100 Russian individuals and organisations, and is considering extending financial regulations to Japan-based crypto-currency exchanges.
Tokyo has walked a fine line regarding its energy supplies from Russia, stressing the strategic importance of oil and gas projects in eastern Russia, in which the government and Japanese firms hold stakes.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates expects to significantly reduce losses in the current financial year and return to profit next year, the airline's president indicated on Tuesday.
""We are in for a good set of results, we haven't reversed it completely but we have swung it,"" Tim Clark told reporters, adding the carrier had been cash-positive since October.
""We've swung the business back to profitability, we are cash-positive again big time, we have a very strong balance sheet again which we have been rebuilding,"" Clark said.
""We are forecasting profits next year and hopefully to pay a dividend and repay some of the equity that the government has put into the business,"" he added.
The carrier's financial year runs through March. 
In June last year, Emirates got an additional $1.1 billion in state support from Dubai after the coronavirus pandemic hurt long-haul travel and triggered the airline's first annual loss in more than three decades.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai, Clark said Emirates would not take delivery of A350 passenger jets if they have surface problems similar to those reported by Qatar Airways.
""We're not going to take airplanes with degradation. I made clear ... that this has to be resolved prior to delivery to Emirates.""
Airbus is locked in a UK court dispute with Qatar Airways over the contractual and safety implications of paint and lightning protection damage on existing A350 passenger jets. 

Several airlines have reported A350 paint problems, while Qatar Airways has complained of deeper underlying issues with a layer of lightning protection attached to the paint and said these raised questions over the safety of the affected jets.
Airbus, which has acknowledged quality problems but denied any safety threat, had no immediate comment on Clark's remarks.

Investing.com – Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) stock surged by 22% in premarket trading Tuesday after the TV-ratings company agreed to be acquired by a consortium for $16 billion with freedom to go to the market for a superior proposal.
The consortium comprises Evergreen Coast Capital, private equity affiliate of Elliott Investment Management, Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU) and others.
The all-cash offer values each Nielsen share at $28 apiece, 26% higher than the stock’s Monday close of $22.21. A previous offer made by the consortium was rejected by Nielsen owing to lower valuations.
The transaction, expected to close in the second half of 2022, will also need the U.K. court approval.
A competing bidder who makes a superior proposal will bear a $102 million termination fee that is payable by Nielsen if it terminates the current transaction. The “go-shop” period expires in 45 days.
Nielsen said it will drop its share buyback proposal earlier approved by the board.
The company has been working on growing beyond its bread-and-butter TV rating business as more people shift to streaming. To cater to the clients’ need to better gauge the new audience, Nielsen now offers solutions enabling cross-platform linking and universal search. It has launched campaign measurement in 40 new markets and global expansion with leading digital publishers.
As a result, fourth-quarter revenue rose 2.5% to $894 million while adjusted profit per share jumped about 44% to 46 cents to beat estimates."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A supervisory body of Hong Kong's central bank has decided to replace a unit of  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) as manager of the territory's largest exchange-traded fund of more than $14 billion, the first such move since the vehicle was launched more than two decades ago.
State Street said in a statement on Tuesday its unit State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) - which has been running the exchange-traded fund (ETF), dubbed ""TraHK"", since 1999 - would be removed. This follows a U-turn by SSGA last year over an investment decision linked to U.S. sanctions on Chinese firms.
State Street, which remains the custodian of the fund, said Hang Seng Investment Management Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank, an affiliate of HSBC, had been selected as the new manager for TraHK.
Hang Seng Investment Management said in a separate statement the appointment was subject to regulatory approvals and the transition was expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.
The ETF, which is popular among Hong Kong retail investors and pension funds with HK$111 billion in assets as of Monday, was set up in 1998 by Hong Kong's government to offload shares it bought during the Asian financial crisis.
""TraHK underpins the retirement (and) wealth proposition for much of Hong Kong’s working population, with Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) investments accounting for approximately 17.5% of TraHK’s assets,"" Diana Cesar, CEO of Hang Seng Bank said in a statement, referring to compulsory pension savings. 
SSGA said in January 2021 it would stop buying shares in two large constituents of the Hang Seng index, citing a decision to no longer invest in securities of U.S. sanctioned entities.
But three days later SSGA said it would resume investing in stocks denied to U.S. investors under an executive order by then U.S. President Donald Trump.
The initial TraHK decision to stop investing in the banned securities sparked anger from some investors, who called for SSGA to be replaced by a manager that could buy the stocks.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in an ensuing push last year, asked a long-standing seven-member supervisory committee to initiate a review where in total seven ETF managers headquartered in different jurisdictions, including SSGA, were invited to bid for the business.
The committee cited the lower management fee proposed by Hang Seng as one of the supporting considerations to choose the local-grown manager, which has promised to reduce the current charge of 0.05% per annum to 0.022% in the first three years of handover, and another cut to 0.019% starting the fourth year.

Investing.com –  LHC Group  (NASDAQ:LHCG) stock jumped 7.4% in premarket trading Tuesday after UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) said its subsidiary Optum will buy the in-home health care services provider at $170 a share.
LHC stock closed at $157.23 Monday.
The deal values LHC at about $6 billion, including debt, The Wall Street Journal reported. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.
LHC co-founders Keith and Ginger Myers will personally invest $10 million in UnitedHealth Group stock following the close of the combination, UnitedHealth said in a release. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to UnitedHealth Group’s outlook for adjusted net earnings per share in 2022, modestly accretive in 2023, and advancing strongly in subsequent years.
Much of LHC’s home-health and hospice network is owned in partnerships with hospitals. The company claims to care for more than 500,000 patients annually.
The deal comes amid increasing demand for at-home care as patients shun nursing homes and seek lower-cost alternatives. It’s a trend accelerated by the pandemic. Players like UnitedHealth and rival Humana (NYSE:HUM) are thus keen to push into that area.
Humana last year completed its acquisition of Kindred at Home, spending about $5.7 billion for the 60% share of the company.
UnitedHealth is currently locked in an antitrust battle with the Justice Department that’s blocking its acquisition of health-technology firm Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG). The authorities argue that UnitedHealth could use it to help its insurance unit to deal with competition."

The Chinese electric vehicle maker reported 41,751 vehicle deliveries in Q4, above the consensus projection of 40,922.
The gross margin stood at 12% in the period, slightly below the analyst expectations of 12.6%.
For the first quarter, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) expects revenue in the range of 7.2 billion yuan to 7.3 billion yuan, missing the consensus estimates of 7.59 billion yuan. The company expects vehicle deliveries in the range of 33,500 to 34,000 units, short of the 38,310 consensus.
Fueled by our strong vehicle models on the market, planned new launches based on new platforms, and technology leadership, we are confident in our continued growth trajectory and structural improvement of gross margin.
Three Wall Street analysts have reflected on the company and XPEV shares following earnings.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Nick Lai (Overweight, $42):""XPeng's 4Q21 result today was a mixed bag where GPM missed on weaker sales mix but OP/ bottom line beat thanks to lower-than-expected opex. Managements tone on the analyst call was cautiously optimistic considering the company's recent price hikes (to mitigate input cost increase) and new model launches this year. We believe XPeng's stock performance will be stronger in 2H22 as we project margin to expand from 1H22 while sales volume also benefits from easing supply constraint, new capacity and new model.""
Citis Jeff Chung (Buy, $92): ""Our positive view towards its business outlook is based on: 1) our expectation that the company will gain market share in the BEV sector, given its superior NEDC range compared with peers, its leading autonomous driving technology and its quicker product launch pace (enabled by its two flexible EV platforms and a two-pronged manufacturing approach); 2) expectation of a sharp volume growth translating to greater economies of scale; and 3) all this along with battery cost reduction materially driving up margins. The company should also benefit from China's newly-launched NEV subsidy.""
BofAs Ming Hsun Lee (Buy, $50 down from $61): ""Considering price hike, we lower 2022E sales by 2% and lower target EV/sales to 5.5x (was 6.6x, in line with XPengs historical average). Our new PO is USD50/HKD194 (was USD61/HKD236). We reiterate Buy on XPeng given its robust model pipeline and leading capability in AD to win share in China EV industry.""

By Alun John and Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) -The London Metal Exchange board will see what lessons can be learned from this month's chaotic nickel trading, the chief executive of its parent company Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said on Tuesday. 
The LME suspended activity and cancelled nickel trades earlier this month due to volatility that saw prices double to more than $100,000 a tonne within hours. A spate of technical glitches after trading resumed left traders fuming. 
""In terms of the way forward of course, the LME board is responsible for understanding the full impact on the market, and what actions can be taken,"" said HKEX CEO Nicolas Aguzin, speaking to media after an HKEX investor day. 
""I'm sure the board of the LME will take the necessary steps to evaluate what are the lessons learned and how we can continue improving the market structure of the commodities market.""
HKEX acquired the LME in 2012, and Aguzin is an LME board member. 
Earlier in the day, Aguzin re-emphasised that HKEX's strategy is to focus its attention on connecting Chinese and global capital markets, and said the bourse was working on a series of initiatives to enhance the vibrancy of its markets. 
These included a new digital trading exchange named Diamond to facilitate 24 hour-a-day trading of assets benefitting from ""mega trends"" such as environmental, social, and governance concerns, though the bourse gave few specifics about the plan. 
HKEX has seen a decline in trading volumes so far this year, with an average daily turnover of HK$130.4 billion ($16.7 billion) in February compared to HK$233.9 billion a year earlier.
Aguzin attributed this, and a slowdown in IPO volumes, to a combination of China-U.S. tensions exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tightening regulatory environment for tech and platform companies, and persistent inflation concerns. 
He also acknowledged that the number of people leaving Hong Kong was affecting financial markets in the city. 
""We're seeing limited inflows of talent and an increasing number of individuals leaving the city, which has resulted in a talent war in the financial industry,"" he said. 
He added that Hong Kong had shown its resilience in the past, and that China's expanding capital markets offered a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity. 
Hong Kong has recently begun easing stringent anti-COVID measures, which business lobby groups warned were undermining the business environment in the financial hub and causing an exodus of professionals. 

Restrictions on daily life and quarantine for inbound travellers remain in place, however.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shares in  Barclays  (LON:BARC) fell as much as 6% in early trading on Tuesday, after one of its top investors offloaded a $1.2 billion chunk of stock in the lender at a discount overnight.
An unnamed investor sold 599 million shares on Monday evening, facilitated by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The shares are roughly equivalent to a 3.6% stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The sale deals a further blow to Barclays just a day after it disclosed a compliance blunder leading to an estimated 450 million pound ($589 million) loss for overselling structured products in the United States.
Barclays shares were last down 3.3% at 115.22 pence at 1004 GMT on Tuesday, after tumbling 4% on Monday.
Capital Group offloaded 399 million shares on Monday, according to Eikon data, but it was unclear whether the sale was connected to the transaction managed by Goldman Sachs.
Capital Group is one of the world's largest investment firms, and parent to the American Funds brand that is popular among millions of U.S. investors and retirement savers.
Capital Group declined to comment.
Other top Barclays shareholders with around a 3% stake in the lender include the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), according to Eikon data. 
Blackrock declined to comment when approached by Reuters on Monday, while QIA was not immediately available for comment.
QIA last week offloaded 1.2% of miner and commodity trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) for about $1.04 billion.
The Barclays sale was priced at 150 pence on Tuesday, towards the top of the target range of 147.50 pence to 150.75 pence, but this still represented a discount greater than 6% to Monday's closing price, pressuring the share price.
The sale was slightly bigger than the 575 million shares outlined on Monday evening, netting the seller 899 million pounds ($1.18 billion), a person involved in the deal told Reuters, adding the book was multiple times oversubscribed.
Barclays said on Monday it would have to delay a planned 1 billion pound share buyback because of the structured products loss, which it will have to incur as a result of buying back the securities in question at their original purchase price. 

The regulatory blunder is an early test for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the newly-appointed chief executive of Barclays, whose previous roles included heading the bank's global markets and risk operations.

The restaurant & entertainment company reported a fourth-quarter EPS of 52c, compared to the loss per share of $1.19 in the year-ago period and consensus estimates EPS of 61c.
Revenue came in at $343.1 million in the quarter, up from $116.8 million in the year-ago quarter and missing the analyst consensus of $364.6 million. The companys Q4 EBITDA stood at $80.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $87.7 million.
Food and beverage revenue was reported at $120.1 million, up from $40.2 million YoY and below the consensus projection of $132.3 million. Amusement and other revenue totaled $223 million in the period, up from $76.6 million in the year-ago quarter and short of the consensus estimates of $235.1 million.
Cost of products was reported at 16%, compared to 17.3% in the year-ago quarter and analyst expectations of 16.7%. Dave & Busters reported a total location count of 142 in the period, down 0.7% QoQ and slightly below the consensus estimates of 144.
The results showed that Q4 comparable store sales were down 2.6% compared to the same quarter in 2019, excluding 14 stores based in areas that had vaccine mandates during the quarter. Total comparable store sales declined 6.8% YoY.
The company saw its comparable sales rise by 5.4% YoY during the first eight weeks of the current Q1, while walk-in comparable store sales are up 9.1% during the same period. Special Event store sales plunged 42% during the first eight weeks from the same period last year.
Truist analyst Jake Bartlett sees a buying opportunity in PLAY shares following the pullback in pre-market trading.
""We view the pull-back in PLAY's stock following 4Q21 results (-8% after hours), as a strong buying opportunity. PLAY's 4Q21 sales missed sharply, due to an outsized impact of Omicron (special events weakness and likely pressure on staffing), but SSS have accelerated since (+5.4% QTD vs. pre-COVID vs. -6.8% in 4Q21). Additionally, 4Q21 store-level margins were stronger than expected, despite the revenue miss, suggesting that cost savings found during COVID are sustainable and highlighting PLAY's relatively low exposure to operating cost inflation,"" Bartlett said in a client note.
Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull reflected more negatively on the Hold-rated PLAY after a disappointing earnings report.
""PLAY reported disappointing sales ($343M vs. Street $365M) and earnings ($0.52, Street $0.61). We believe the sell-side comp mean is less indicative of what was embedded in revenue estimates because it appears many estimates used an average weekly sales base (i.e., 4Q20) that was too high,"" O'Cull wrote in a report.

765,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Recent proposals from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. tell us one thing: Stock splits can spark big rallies as retail traders pile in.
Tesla surged 8% Monday, adding about $84 billion in value, after saying it’s planning a second stock split in less than two years. Amazon jumped more than 5% the day after announcing a 20-for-1 split this month and the stock has been on a tear ever since.
In theory, this shouldn’t happen. A split doesn’t affect a company’s business fundamentals, and investors averse to a stock’s high price tag can simply buy fractional shares instead. Yet splits are causing day traders to pile in, fueling rallies in these companies’ shares.
Tesla was by far the most-purchased stock among Fidelity customers on Monday, according to data from the brokerage firm. Amazon’s announcement attracted “significant” retail interest and was likely the biggest factor in the stock’s outperformance during a week when the Nasdaq 100 fell almost 4%, according to Vanda Research.
“It is just a sentiment effect,” said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Retail investors perceive price differently -- and the stock is now attainable at a lower price.” 
There may be other reasons for a company like Tesla to consider increasing its outstanding shares.
“The split can make the stock look more attractive, luring new buyers into the stock to help keep the recent momentum,” said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally Invest Securities. “Perhaps this is Elon’s way of increasing retail ownership and reducing institutional ownership?”
Employee ownership and retaining human capital are more reasons. “A lower-priced stock makes it easier for employees with equity as part of their compensation to sell a more specific amount to satisfy tax liabilities and manage their personal wealth,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research said. “Once one company does it, they all have to do it since they are competing for similar talent.”
Prior to 2020, share splits had almost disappeared from U.S. stock markets with only two completed in the S&P 500 in 2019 compared with a total of 41 in 2006 and 2007, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. But Apple Inc. and Tesla helped revive the practice after splitting their stocks in 2020, with more joining the pack this year. 
In 2020, Tesla Inc.’s shares surged more than 60% from the day of the announcement to the execution date, while Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose about 30% in a similar time frame. Weekly retail purchases surged to just shy of $1 billion of Apple shares in the period leading up to its actual split, from about $150 million prior to the news, according to Vanda.
Tech Chart of the Day
The Nasdaq 100 Index’s 13% rally over the past two weeks has been far from a straightforward ride for investors. After gaining for four straight sessions following its lowest close in nearly a year, the tech-heavy benchmark has alternated between gains and losses for six straight sessions. While the current run of choppy trading is the longest since June 2021, the gauge has managed to recoup the prior day’s losses and then some following each dip.

Jiangxi Fangda Steel Group Co Ltd has submitted an application and deposit to the Henan Zhongyuan Property Rights Exchange, as part of its offer of at least 11 billion yuan ($1.73 billion) for the 80% stake, according to the Henan exchange and a statement by Anyang Iron and Steel Co Ltd.
Anyang Group, the top steelmaker in China's central Henan province with annual steel capacity of 10 million tonnes, has been planning ownership reform after China called for further consolidation of its mammoth ferrous sector. 
It signed a letter of intent with Jiangsu-based private steelmaker Shagang Group in May 2021, before the local government decided on a public listing of its 80% stake last November.
Jiangxi Fangda, which also owns Shanghai-listed Fangda Special Steel, has capacity to make around 20 million tonnes of steel products per year. 
The result of the stake transfer in Anyang Group is pending further negotiation and could lead to changes in the listed Anyang Iron and Steel's ownership, the filing said. 

China had pledged to speed up mergers and acquisitions in the steel sector and expects its top 10 steel producers to account for 60% of the country's total steel output, up from 37% in end-2020.

767,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 07:02AM ET</span>","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced yesterday after market close that its founder, chairman, and CEO Fred Smith will step down from his duty on June 1 and will take on a role of an executive chairman.
Raj Subramaniam, who currently serves as the company's President and COO, will succeed Smith as the new CEO.
Smith founded FedEx in 1973 when the company started delivering documents and smaller packages to compete with the post office. Since then, FedEx saw rapid growth and became one of the largest delivery companies in the world, providing both ground and air service. Smith pioneered overnight operations in April 1973 that paved the way for the delivery of freight anywhere.
""FedEx has changed the world by connecting people and possibilities for the last 50 years,"" said Smith.
He added he plans to focus more on global challenges such as innovation, sustainability, and public policy.
Subramaniam joined FedEx 30 years ago and initially served in the company's marketing and management operations across the U.S. and Asia. He was later promoted to Chief Marketing and Communications Officer and the top executive of FedEx Express. In 2019, he became the company's President and COO and joined its board just a year later.
For BofA analyst Ken Hoexter, this marks a historic shift given Smiths importance to the delivery industry.
""Given Mr. Smith's historic focus on growth, we believe investors will view the transition positively, as Mr. Subramaniam has focused on ways to integrate FedExs Express, Ground, and Freight segments in ways it had not tried before. As president & COO (the company's 2nd ever COO, and heir apparent since Feb. 2019), he shifted the operating principals of FedEx to compete collectively, operate collaboratively, and innovate digitally, from compete collectively, operate independently, and manage collaboratively,"" Hoexter said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker isn't surprised by the announcement.
""The initial thought the market will likely have (in our view) is whether this transition will mean any fundamental changes in FDXs operating strategy going forward. We doubt it. Mr. Subramaniam has been at FDX for a long time and has been a key player, if not a co-architect, of the current strategy and we do not see a high probability of a sudden and dramatic pivot in strategy (like combining Express and Ground as thought by some investors, for example) any time soon,"" Shanker wrote in a client note.
FedEx is set to host its first investor day in 10 years on June 28-29, just a few days after it releases F4Q results on June 23.
Shanker sees the upcoming event as a very important catalyst for both the company and FDX investors as it offers an opportunity to reset the narrative though the bar is both very low and very high at the same time.
""The succession plan was a key focus topic for the event but that is now out of the way with the twin announcements. We now wait to see what other big announcements lie in store for us at the event. Whether FDX is a $150, $225 or $300 stock in the next 12 months will come down to whether the market believes normalized EPS is $15, $20 or $25, which should become evident at the analyst day,"" Shanker added.

Investing.com – Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock traded 2.3% lower in premarket Tuesday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts downgraded it to ‘equal-weight’ with a target of $30, citing multiple headwinds as reasons for their pessimism.  
The target price is over 43% lower than the previous one. The stock closed at $26.45 Monday, up 3.8%, but is down nearly 62% in the last year.  
The analysts admitted they overestimated the company’s ability to innovate and improve its user offerings rapidly. The pace of innovation is slower than they initially expected as advertising, user, and engagement trends remain challenging, StreetInsider said quoting the analysts’ report.
The analysts continue to see US time spent per user decline from1% to 19% year-over-year over the past four quarters and believe the platform’s total US user minutes have deteriorated to 2017 levels.
In addition, analyst Brian Nowak sees further uncertainties related to the shift toward lower-monetizing creator economy video offerings like those on Facebook’s Reels and YouTube’s Shorts.
While Pinterest came out flying in the fourth quarter, brushing aside concerns over the impact on its business due to changes in Apple’s privacy rules, the company last month said the new provisions could still come to weigh on it in the future.
To counter that, the company is investing more in technology and focusing on scaling up video features like Pinterest TV and Idea Pins. It’s also boosting influencer marketing, a space dominated by YouTube, Instagram and TikTok."

Sumitomo Metal, which supplies cathode materials for the Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) EVs, said demand for nickel used in rechargeable batteries will climb to more than 410,000 tonnes in 2022 from nearly 330,000 tonnes in 2021.
Nickel is mainly used in stainless steelmaking, but is also a vital ingredient for the lithium-ion batteries used to power EVs, where demand is set to accelerate over coming years.
""Nickel demand for EVs is growing much faster than we had expected a year ago,"" Yusuke Niwa, general manager of Sumitomo Metal's nickel sales and raw materials department, told reporters.
But higher nickel prices may erode demand in the long term as companies will work to use less nickel or develop nickel-less batteries, he said. 
Sumitomo Metal also predicted that the global nickel market deficit will narrow to 68,000 tonnes this year from 135,000 tonnes in 2021 as output of nickel pig iron (NPI) in Indonesia is expected to grow to more than 1 million tonnes.

Global demand for nickel is seen increasing by 8.4% in 2022 to 2.999 million tonnes, while supply is expected to climb by 11.4% to 2.931 million tonnes.
Japan's nickel demand is projected to rise 0.2% to 170,400 tonnes, while supply is forecast to increase 1.6% to 168,800 tonnes.

Our hypothesis is on years following strong market up moves, individuals are more likely to sell equities in advance of the mid-April payment date The 2020 COVID period was a clear outlier.

Performance of crypto markets going into the US tax season will be interesting. Increased adoption and regulatory awareness has also increased scrutiny.

By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Russian airlines could be frozen out of the aircraft leasing market well beyond the Ukraine conflict, one of the industry's biggest players warned on Tuesday, blaming what executives have described as a default involving hundreds of Western jets.
Global leasing companies had until Monday to sever ties with Russian carriers under Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but executives say only a fraction of the more than 400 jets directly involved have been returned.
Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Dublin-based Avolon, the world's second-largest leasing firm, told Reuters its own risk is limited, with a net exposure of below $200 million on 10 jets still blocked in Russia after it recovered four aircraft.
But the mainly Ireland-based leasing sector, which accounts for about half of the world's airline fleet, will be in no hurry to reset relations with Russian airlines even if sanctions against Moscow are lifted, he predicted.
""From an Avolon perspective it is not material; from a sector perspective it is a problem, unquestionably,"" Slattery added.
""In terms of future appetite in a post-war scenario for further business in Russia, I think all players in our sector will think long and hard about the risks of that jurisdiction and the appetite for going back in,"" he said in an interview.
Moscow earlier this month introduced a law allowing airlines to re-register leased planes locally in a move widely seen as encouraging airlines to hold onto planes and avoid a collapse of Russia's airline sector, which relies heavily on leasing.
Until now, aircraft leased to Russia have been registered in Bermuda or Ireland under an agreement designed to provide security to leasing firms already worried about the willingness of Russian courts to uphold the rights of foreign lessors.
Avolon, controlled by Bohai Leasing, a majority-owned subsidiary of China's HNA Group, has a gross exposure of just under $400 million to Russia, Slattery said.
After deducting the value of four jets that have been recovered, as well as security and letters of credit that have been drawn down, Avolon's net exposure is below $200 million.
""Given our scale that puts it in the realm of a headache rather than a migraine,"" Slattery said.
""We believe our aircraft are all appropriately insured..., all the leases are terminated and we will continue to try to get them back,"" he added.

Russia's airline industry, the world's 11th largest, had 980 aircraft in its fleet on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, of which 777 were leased rather than owned by the carriers. 
Of these, 515 were leased from foreign firms and about 400 of those - worth up to $10 billion - were most immediately at risk from the crisis, according to aviation data firm Cirium.

Levy projects that Tesla will deliver 307k electric vehicle (EV) units in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the consensus of 313k. Tesla delivered 308k units in Q421.
Decomposing 1Q deliveries, Jan/Feb combined deliveries was likely ~130k units; for context, Jan/Feb is below the prior first-two-months record of ~138k in Oct/Nov. Assuming Jan/Feb sales of ~130k, our expectation assumes March deliveries of ~177k units, which would represent the highest-ever final month of a quarter for Tesla (prior high of ~170k in Dec21), benefiting from the continued ramp of volume in China, Levy explained in a client note.
The analyst reiterated that deliveries estimates are almost completely dictated by supply while the recent COVID-19-related challenges in China are also likely to push the risk to the downside.
Given Tesla deliveries are typically heavily weighted toward the end of the quarter, it is certainly possible that Tesla's likely quarter-end wave will be somewhat limited by the rise of COVID (albeit, the shutdown is not nationwide, thus it's unclear how much the shutdown will impact deliveries).
Despite these challenges, Levy has reiterated his Outperform rating on Tesla as he believes the long-term case for Tesla is only stronger “amid rising oil prices, EV uptake is an increased priority, and with Tesla the global leader in EV, its long-term case is amplified.""
Tesla stock price is up a further 2.7% in pre-open Tuesday after closing 8% higher yesterday on the stock split announcement.

(Reuters) - The maker of Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru will keep prices unchanged for the next six months but won't rule out future price hikes given Britain's high inflation, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
A.G. Barr, the group behind the bright orange drink Irn-Bru, raised prices last month when inflation reached a 30-year high due to global supply chain problems and higher raw material costs. Many firms have passed the costs on to customers.
""We might have to increase further, but the current price levels should suffice for the next six months,"" A.G. Barr Chief Executive Roger White said in an interview.
""Price does have a role to play. I wouldn't discount the possibility, as we are seeing higher levels of inflation,"" White said about future increases. 
The group has been implementing cost-cutting measures including using cheaper packaging and moving production closer to retail shops, he said.
His remarks came after A.G. Barr, which also sells pre-mixed cocktails under its Funkin brand, reported an 18% jump in annual profit and said it would now resume paying dividends to shareholders, having paused them during the pandemic.
The company has benefited from greater at-home consumption of food and drink during the pandemic, but there has been a ""slight reversal"" in that trend as pubs and restaurants re-opened, White said.
In light of the crisis in Ukraine, A.G. Barr won't fulfil any orders by Moscow Brewing Company, its Russian franchisee, White said, although he added that it hasn't ended the contract.
Shares in A.G. Barr were up 2.4% as of 1056 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

A.G. Barr also said sales in the early weeks of the new financial year were well ahead of the prior year and in line with expectations.

Volkswagen aims to conduct the Porsche initial public offering (IPO) in the fourth quarter of 2022, though that may change if the conflict in Ukraine drags on, Porsche SE's finance chief said.
""We cannot rule out, if the conflict lasts a longer time, that this could have potential implications on the listing,"" Johannes Lattwein told a news conference, without elaborating on how it would affect plans.
No final decision has been made on the proposed IPO, the company said.
A framework agreement for the listing proposed by Volkswagen in February includes selling 25% plus 1 ordinary share in the carmaker to Porsche SE as well as listing up to 25% of Porsche AG's preferred stock.
Some 49% of the IPO proceeds would be paid out to Volkswagen's shareholders as a special dividend.
""Porsche SE thereby supports the plans of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) to expand its financial flexibility and accelerate the technological transformation of the group,"" Porsche SE said in a statement reporting its annual results.
""Due to the leading positioning of Porsche AG in the sport and luxury segment, this attractive investment would diversify our portfolio and our dividend inflows,"" Lattwein said.
Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which is controlled by the Porsche and Piech families and holds a 31.4% equity stake in Volkswagen, has no plans to reduce its stake in the German carmaker, Poetsch said.
The IPO would also not impact the composition of the Volkswagen supervisory board.

Porsche SE reported a 2021 group result after tax of 4.6 billion euros ($5.06 billion). It forecast group results after tax in 2022 at between 4.1 billion and 6.1 billion euros, not including the impact of the possible Porsche IPO.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The copper market has solid fundamentals despite current market volatility and will maintain high prices for at least the next 12 months, Ivan Arriagada, CEO of Chile's  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO), forecast. 
In an interview with Reuters during the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago, Arriagada also said the company is still looking to develop its Twin Metals project despite the Biden administration's refusal to renew its licenses.
And although the company is on the lookout, it sees few options for copper deals on the market.
When it comes to copper prices, Arriagada said he based his forecast on the key role that copper plays in energy transition, especially with electric cars.
""In the short term, in the next 12 months, the important thing is that we have a market with solid fundamentals,"" Arriagada said. ""There is a context of relative tightness due to supply chain conditions, inflation, and all that means we expect prices to remain at levels that they have been at recently, which are good prices."" 
However, he said the world economy is entering a phase of lower growth in the midst of the Ukraine conflict and that will have to be considered going forward, particularly in 2023.
The company maintains its goal of producing 660,000-690,000 tonnes this year. This factors in the impact of a drought at its flagship Los Pelambres mine, which the company plans to offset with a desalination plant in the second half of the year.
Arriagada reiterated Antofagasta's intention to reach a production level of 900,000 tonnes by 2026, citing the company's deposits.
""We have the mining resources to sustain that projection and a plan that contemplates making those investments, if the conditions exist and we obtain the permits,"" he said.
The Antofagasta board of directors must decide whether to go ahead with a plan for a new concentrator at its Centinela mine by the end of the year during a time of political uncertainty due to a new leftist government and the drafting of a new constitution.
We hope to have ""a horizon of certainty regarding the prevailing conditions to make that investment and we therefore hope that by that time the processes that are under way will be at a degree of progress"" to decide, Arriagada added.
Additionally, a plan for a mining royalty to raise revenue for social programs is currently under way in Chile's Congress.
""In tax decisions, a balance between contribution through taxes and industry competitiveness should be maintained and we think that's something extremely important that should be weighed,"" he said.
TWIN METALS
Antofagasta suffered a setback in its Twin Metals project in the United States after the renewal of two federal licenses was suspended. Arriagada said the suspensions affected a significant part of the company's mining operations, but do not affect the rest of the company's licenses.
""We are evaluating the best action, from the legal standpoint, to reverse these decisions, which seem to us to be administrative and clearly arbitrary,"" Arriagada said.
""I hope that over the course of the next six months we'll have clarity on the best legal path to take in regard to recovering these licenses,"" he added.
The company expects to be able to implement the project by the end of the decade.
On the other hand, Arriagada said the company remains open to any attractive acquisition opportunities to increase its portfolio, but he admitted they are ""very limited.""

Arriagada noted that neighboring Peru remains a point of interest despite ongoing political turmoil and other local challenges.
""We have a team working there looking for exploration targets that could be interesting and we have a preference for that region (Americas), including Peru, and we look at our projects with a long-term perspective,"" Arriagada said.

Investing.com – FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock traded 2.6% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company said its President and Chief Operating Officer, Raj Subramaniam, will take over as President and Chief Executive Officer with effect from June 1.
Subramaniam will replace Frederick W. Smith who will now be the company’s Executive Chairman.
Prior to his current role, Subramaniam was President and CEO of FedEx Express, the world’s largest express transportation company. Subramaniam, who joined the company in 1991, is being named CEO-elect effective immediately.  
Smith founded the company in 1971 when he bought controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation Sales to give birth to a concept paper he had written at Yale University in 1965 on airfreight shippers and their challenges. FedEx was officially born two years later.  
While FedEx rode the COVID-19-led boom for quick deliveries as customers shopped for everything online, its overall growth trajectory has trailed rival UPS last few years. That was reflected in the stock prices. FedEx is down 18% in the last year while UPS (NYSE:UPS) is up almost 31% in the same period. S&P is up over 15%.
There wasn’t a clamor for Smith stepping down though, and the succession was planned, only delayed by the pandemic.
FedEx said it would keep the Chief Operating Officer role, traditionally seen as the next in line to CEO, vacant for now.",,,,,

The company was forced to suspend output at its Bergara mill, in the Basque Country, on March 16 and at its Legasa and Lesaka mills, in Navarra, on March 26 as a result of the strike, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Parts of the mills in Gijon and Aviles, in Asturias, were closed for lack of supplies, he added.
The other plants located in Zaragoza, Bilbao and Sagunto, near Valencia, were operating on Tuesday but reported a lack of raw materials and semi-processed products from the idled plants.
The strike is another blow to an energy-intensive industry that was already hit by high electricity costs that have surged in tandem with gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

ArcelorMittal had already halted output during hours of peak demand, when power prices spike, at its electric-powered steel mills in Spain to curb costs, which it cannot fully pass on to customers.
Even though the government made some concessions to truckers last week, the strike continued on Tuesday in several areas of the country.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), India's top-selling electric carmaker, said the cost of battery cells had increased by around 20% because of a global surge in raw material prices, mainly lithium, putting pressure on the company in the short-term. 
Shailesh Chandra, managing director of the passenger vehicles and electric mobility subsidiaries, told Reuters that cell prices have been rising over months and he expects them to remain high for about a year.
""Immediate impact seems to be about a 20% kind of an increase which will have short-term pressure. This should moderate within a year and then start coming down,"" he said.
Chandra did not comment on whether this would affect the company's sales or profitability but said that demand for ""green personal mobility"" was rising sharply and he expected to offset some of the costs by increasing the use of locally sourced components in its cars.
Automakers globally are facing inflationary pressures due to surging costs of nickel, cobalt and lithium that are used in making batteries - the most expensive part of an electric vehicle (EV) - as demand outstrips supply. 
This has been made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say it threatens to slow the trend of falling battery prices which could hamper the broader adoption of EVs, especially in price-sensitive markets like India.
In India's nascent EV market, electric cars make up only 1% of total car sales. High battery prices and an insufficient charging network are the main reasons why there are few takers, and why more carmakers are yet to launch electric models.
Spot prices for lithium carbonate, which is typically used to make lithium-ion batteries, surged to over $70,000 per tonne in March 2022 from about $10,000 a year earlier, according to data from industry forecaster Benchmark Market Intelligence.
""Going forward this inflationary impact is expected to continue,"" said Manish Dua, senior analyst at Benchmark. 
Tata recently raised the price of its Nexon electric SUV in India by over $300 - a 2% rise for the base model, following similar moves globally by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and China's BYD.
Even so, Tata, which has over 90% share of India's electric car market, expects sales of its electric cars to grow over four-fold this fiscal year from 4,200 units last year.
The EV maker sources lithium-ion batteries for its cars from Tata AutoComp Systems, which has a joint venture with China's Guoxuan Hi-Tech to produce them locally. 
Chandra said as battery recycling gains pace there will be access to raw materials beyond mines and that will offset some of the cost pressures. 

""Short term spikes will happen. It is good to focus on the secular long term trend which will keep going down,"" he said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and a Chinese-backed consortium risk losing their mining licences if they fail to meet a tight construction timeline for the Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea, the West African country has said. 
Guinea's government has grown increasingly impatient with the mining firms that control the giant Simandou deposit which has not been developed since Rio was first granted an exploration licence for it 25 years ago.
The ruling junta signed an agreement on Saturday with Rio Tinto and Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) under which the firms will collaborate on a 670-kilometre (416 mile) railway and a port to get Simandou's high-grade ore to market.
""The framework agreement gives Guinea a very precise calendar with significant penalties up to and including the withdrawal of the mining licence, for any mining company that does not respect its commitments,"" Guinea's presidency said in a video statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday night.
The threat to withdraw the licences has not previously been reported. Rio Tinto declined to comment on the penalties and WCS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Guinea's mines minister has said the railway and port infrastructure must be completed by the end of 2024, and commercial production must start by March 31 2025, a timeline analysts say is ambitious for a project with significant environmental and social impacts to navigate.
""The worry for investors is that this ultimatum may incentivise the developers to cut corners,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
Rio Tinto's chief executive of copper, Bold Baatar, has said the framework sets out how the project will be built to international Environmental, Social, and Governance standards. Rio Tinto declined to provide details.

Rio Tinto owns a 45.05% stake in the southern half, Blocks 3 and 4, of Simandou, with Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) holding 39.95% and Guinea's government the remaining 15%. SMB-Winning - the consortium behind WCS - won a government tender in November 2019 for Blocks 1 and 2.

The war has exacted a heavy toll with a total 2,975 civilian casualties recorded since the conflict began, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Still, despite the stock market gains, there appears little hope of a breakthrough, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty while Russia continues to make territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014.

It's not just the costs of producing goods that's going up, the price that must be paid to transport them shows no sign of easing -- shipping a 40-foot container unit by sea costs double what it did a year ago and remains six times above pre-pandemic levels, the Freightos FBX index shows. 
This will add 1.5 percentage points to 2022 inflation, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which warns that consumers will feel the full brunt of price increases only after 12 months. 
This causes ""complicated trade-offs"" for central bankers, the IMF says. 
Or maybe not. Money markets are betting policymakers will opt to stomp inflation, even at the expense of economic growth. More than 200 basis points of U.S. rate rises are priced by end-2022, which if realised, would be the most in a calendar year since 1994,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) points out. 
In any case, the gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields seems well on the way to turning negative for the first time since 2019, narrowing below 6 bps on Tuesday. 
This is the so-called curve inversion that is considered a reliable predictor of recession. Yet, the Fed has signalled it's watching other curve segments which are still steep, giving it room to tighten policy further and faster.
The question is when do stock markets start to get seriously spooked? While two-year U.S. yields rose 165 bps this quarter and the 2-10 curve has snapped in some 70 bps, world stocks have recouped some gains recently and will end the quarter with only a small loss. 
On Tuesday, Wall Street equity futures are positive and European stocks are higher, following on from Asian gains led by a 1% rise in Tokyo. 
They likely have their eyes trained on ""real"" interest rates; stripping out inflation, 10-year yields remain deeply negative while ""real"" yield curves are so far sloping upwards. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-BOJ ramps up battle to defend yield cap
-German consumer sentiment lowest since Feb 2021
-ECB President Christine Lagarde, ECB bank supervisor Elizabeth McCaul, ECB board member Peter Kazimir
-New York Fed president John Williams, Philadelphia Fed president Harker
-U.S. monthly house price index, JOLTS job openings, consumer confidence
-U.S. 7-year note auction

-Chile to raise interest rates by 200 bps to 7.5%

The Chinese coastal city, home to some of the world's busiest sea and airports, began locking down half of the city on Monday and intends to do the same to the other half for four days starting Friday in a two-stage testing exercise.
While it has kept its airports and deepwater port open, it has imposed stringent movement curbs, barring unapproved vehicles from streets and telling millions of people not to leave their homes.

China is battling its largest number of COVID-19 infections since the onset of since the country's initial outbreak receded in early 2020. This month it placed lockdowns on other manufacturing exports hubs such as Changchun and Shenzhen, which gave rise to lengthening queues outside major Chinese ports.

Although curbs in Changchun have remained in place, they have been relaxed in Shenzhen, where businesses and factories were allowed to resume operations on March 21. 
However, a survey conducted by a state newspaper found Shenzhen's ""war"" on COVID-19 has hurt up to 93% of local small and medium-sized companies, with many suffering production disruptions because of shutdowns, interruptions in supply chains, and delays in order executions.

Of the total sum, hydrogen investment platform Hy24 will inject 70 million euros through the Clean H2 Infra Fund, which it manages, and H2 Mobility's seven other existing shareholders will stump up 40 million euros.
Green hydrogen is in the spotlight in Europe, where European Union environment ministers want truck CO2 emissions cut by a third by 2030 from 2019 levels.
While battery powered vehicles have established a lead in the truck sector, fuel cell driven ones are expected in greater numbers in the long-haul segment in a fierce technology battle.
H2 Mobility's existing investors are industrial gases makers Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) and Linde (NYSE:LIN), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck and Hyundai Motor Co, utility OMV and oil companies Total and Shell (LON:RDSa).
H2 Mobility's managing director Nikolas Iwan said the money being raised will go into expanding the fuelling station network and gradually help it become profitable.
""We operate 92 stations, some can serve trucks already today, all can serve light commercial vehicles and passenger cars,"" he said.
""The next step is to create stations with more refuelling capacity to be ready for the expected ramp-up of intensive use vehicles, in particular trucks and buses, due to come from the auto manufacturers,"" he said.
Iwan said H2 Mobility aspired to break-even in 2026, once anchor customers bring more volume.

Hy24 is a joint venture between private equity firm Ardian and big energy, chemical and financial firms grouped in the FiveT Hydrogen investment platform.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Tuesday ahead of the start of another round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey this week. 
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set later Tuesday to meet in Turkey for face-to-face talks, the first direct talks between the two sides in more than two weeks.
However, despite the stock market gains, there appears little hope of a breakthrough, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty while Russia continues to make territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and some eastern territories.
Ahead of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday urged Western nations to toughen sanctions quickly against Russia, including an oil embargo, something a number of European countries have been reluctant to impose given their reliance on Russian energy supplies.
U.S. and German government officials are set to meet later this week with energy industry executives to discuss ways to boost alternative supplies for Germany, the Eurozone’s largest economy which has been reliant on Russian oil and gas.
Looking at the European economic data slate, the GfK German consumer climate index fell to -15.5 for April, down from a revised -8.5 the previous month, as the war in Ukraine and rising commodity prices weigh on sentiment.
Later in the session, the Bank of England is set to publish its latest Quarterly Bulletin, which will be studied carefully as the U.K. central bank continues to increase interest rates.
In corporate news,  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) will be in the spotlight after the French healthcare group raised its peak sales target for eczema-treatment product Dupixent to more than 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion).
Oil prices retreated Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s weakness on fears that a surge in Covid-19 cases in China will hit demand from the world’s top crude importer and ahead of the Ukraine/Russia peace talks.
The city of Shanghai, China’s financial hub, remains under a two-stage, nine-day lockdown to curb rising numbers of Covid cases.
Sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine have disrupted oil supplies from the world’s second largest crude exporter, sending prices to 14-year highs earlier this month. 
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $105.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $108.98. Both benchmark contracts lost around 7% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,922.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0987.

MILAN (Reuters) -Leading investor advisory firms have again raised concerns over the salary of UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel, with one recommending for a second straight year shareholders vote against his pay.
Orcel, former head of investment banking at Swiss bank UBS, narrowly dodged an investor revolt last year over the remuneration package that made him one of Europe's best paid bank CEOs when he took the reins at UniCredit in April.
Leading proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis again took aim at his compensation ahead of an annual general meeting on April 8, but ISS stopped short of calling for investors to reject the bank's pay policy.
Orcel received 6.7 million euros ($7.4 million) from UniCredit in 2021, including 4.8 million euros in shares as a sign-on bonus unrelated to performance.
The banker, one of Europe's best known and highest paid dealmakers, had forfeited millions in deferred pay from UBS in joining.
His variable pay, equivalent to up to twice the 2.5 million euro fixed annual pay, is from 2022 linked to targets set under the 'UniCredit Unlocked' plan Orcel unveiled in December.
While acknowledging the ""significantly improved framework"" for Orcel's remuneration, ISS said the package remained ""concerning and of particular concern is the high cap to severance payments (15 million euros or six times the fixed pay).""
Glass Lewis went further, saying it did not believe ""the company's remuneration strategy, as currently constituted, is sufficiently aligned with shareholders' best interests.""
""As such, we do not believe that this proposal merits shareholder support"", it added in a report seen by Reuters.
Addressing Glass Lewis' criticism in a letter to shareholders, UniCredit said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the firm's stance.
Orcel's pay package passed with just 54% of votes last year and was rejected by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), UniCredit's leading investor and the world's largest asset manager. 
Orcel's pay is double that of previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, who had waived his severance payment on his arrival and voluntarily taken a 40% salary cut as he prepared to axe thousands of jobs. 
UniCredit told shareholders in the letter the CEO remuneration was broadly in line with that of its main competitor Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) while Mustier's self-imposed pay cut was not relevant, reflecting his ""personal considerations at the time."" 
Glass Lewis also said it was worried UniCredit had not paid sufficient heed to the dissent shareholders expressed last year.
""While the company indicated that it engaged with shareholders, we are concerned that it failed to specifically address the results of the 2021 annual general meeting,"" it said.
UniCredit said in its letter it had reached out to 55% of its investors.
""We have completely overhauled our remuneration approach during the year, incorporating all the output from the broad engagement round,"" it said. 

In addition to linking Orcel's variable pay to performance and fully disclosing the relevant mechanisms, UniCredit said it had subjected it to claw-back clauses.
Orcel's pay is also at the heart of a court case pitting the banker against Spanish giant Santander (MC:SAN). In December a Madrid court ordered Santander to pay 51.4 million euros for dropping an offer to make him CEO, a ruling which the bank has appealed. ($1 = 0.9114 euros)

""We can't just withhold life-saving cancer drugs from Russian patients. There is international consensus that medicines are exempt from sanctions,"" Schwan told Swiss newspaper TagesAnzeiger, adding that prices being fixed in Russian roubles meant the pharmaceutical giant was currently losing money on Russian sales.
The statement echoed other pharmaceutical giants, who have said they will supply essential medicines in Russia but halt some other activities in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Roche has 800 sales staff in Russia, he said.
Speaking about his upcoming exit from the board of big bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Schwan said he had already considered resigning a year ago but it had become opportune after a twin set of scandals hammered the bank last March.
The bank was now in ""good hands"" under new Chairman Axel Lehmann, the outgoing vice-chair said. 
Asked whether larger Swiss rival UBS or a foreign bank might take over Credit Suisse since its share price had been battered, Schwan said he hoped the bank would remain independent.
""It would be a huge loss for Switzerland if there were only one major Swiss bank. That's why it's important that CS stabilises its business, rebuilds trust and seizes its opportunities,"" he said.
He said he would be willing to take on another board role in the future.

""In principle, I think it is feasible to sit on the board of a bank alongside my job as CEO at Roche,"" he said. 
""The fact that I'm stepping down now doesn't mean that I don't think it's important for an active CEO to take on such a task. We need banks, they are like the oil in the gears. And for some things we need specifically Swiss banks.""

(Reuters) -Tesla's announcement on Monday that it will seek shareholder approval to increase its share count in order to enable a stock split adds to a recent wave of megacap companies splitting their shares in a bid to attract more investors.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said in a filing it would hold a vote at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting to increase the number of authorized shares in order to enable a stock split.
A stock split by Tesla, which would have be approved by its board of directors, would be the electric car maker's second since 2020, and it would follow stock split announcements by other major U.S. companies in recent years.
In the past two years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla have split their shares, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have recently announced upcoming share splits.
Companies split their shares to make their stock prices appear less expensive and appeal to more investors. However, splitting a stock does not affect its underlying fundamentals.
Still, BofA Global Research said in recent research note that stock splits ""historically are bullish"" for companies that enact them, with their shares marking an average returns of 25% one year later versus 9% for the market overall.
Tesla's stock surged 8% on Monday, adding over $100 billion to its stock market value.
Amazon has gained about 20% since March 9, when the ecommerce heavyweight announced a stock split that will take effect on June 6. That compares to a 7% gain in the Nasdaq during the same period. During that time, Wall Street has also seen a broad rebound in megacap growth stocks following losses earlier this year, as well as volatility related to rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Tesla was the most traded stock among Fidelity's online brokerage customers on Monday, with buy and sell orders almost evenly split, suggesting retail investors are cautious about the company.

Since joining the S&P 500 in December 2020, Tesla has been one of its most heavily weighted stocks, currently accounting for over 2% of the index. It has gained about 300% since announcing its first stock split in August 2020.
Other S&P 500 companies with nominally high share prices, which analysts say could hint at a future stock split announcement, include Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), up 0.1% on Monday at $1,558, as well as Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), trading near flat at about $2,247.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose for a third day on Monday, as a sharp climb in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) overshadowed weakness in energy and bank stocks, while Russia and Ukraine were poised to hold their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks. 
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc jumped 8.03% and was the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after saying it will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split, helping to lift the consumer discretionary index 2.67% as the best-performing sector on the session. 
The S&P energy index, off 2.56%, was the worst-performing sector on the session after oil prices tumbled on the heels of a lockdown in China's financial hub, Shanghai, to curb a jump in COVID-19 infections that sparked demand worries.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) lost 2.81% and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) fell 1.75%. 
Financials were also among the weaker sectors on the session, due in part to a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgrade on U.S. banks, which cited escalating risks and the likelihood that rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have already been priced in by the market. The S&P bank index shed 0.99%. 
The sell-off in the bond market resumed on Monday, with short-dated yields hitting their highest since 2019 and the yield curve as measured by the gap between five- and 30-year yields briefly inverted for the first time since early 2006, raising concerns the Federal Reserve's more aggressive monetary policy will dent economic growth and potentially cause a recession.
""Financials ... so a lot of people bought those or own those on the basis of these will do better in a higher rate environment so I’m not surprised to see the financials back off relative to what is going on in the bond market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""Of course commodity names have rallied so high and so hot that it is not surprising to see those names back off, that is kind of what led the market down, but I still think the news for most of these commodity companies will be very, very good.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.65 points, or 0.27%, to 34,955.89, the S&P 500 gained 32.46 points, or 0.71%, to 4,575.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 185.60 points, or 1.31%, to 14,354.90.
The S&P was able to rebound from declines earlier in the session, with the benchmark index falling as much as 0.6% at one point. 
Strong economic data and gains in beaten-down growth stocks have helped Wall Street's main indexes recover in recent days even as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues and a host of Federal Reserve policymakers have made hawkish comments about the path of interest rate hikes. 
Still, analysts noted that value stocks remain cheap relative to their growth counterparts.

A senior U.S. official said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to make compromises, with Ukrainian officials also playing down the chances of a major breakthrough at the talks. 
Poly soared 52.63% after HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) said it would buy the audio and video products maker for $1.7 billion in cash. Shares of HP declined 2.74%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.23 billion shares, compared with the 14.09 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 107 new lows.

(Reuters) - Liberty Strategic Capital, a Washington D.C.-based private equity fund founded by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has acquired a controlling stake in enterprise security firm Zimperium for $525 million, both told Reuters on Monday. 
The deal is Liberty Strategic Capital's first majority stake acquisition since its launch last year. It has also led late-stage funding rounds in cybersecurity firms BlueVoyant and Cybereason. 
SoftBank Corp, which has been an investor in Zimperium since 2017, will continue as a minority owner. 
Founded in 2010, Zimperium provides mobile security solutions for iOS, Android, and Chromebooks devices. It serves enterprises across industries, including financial services and healthcare, counting JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and the U.S. Department of Defense as its customers. 
The Dallas, Texas-headquartered firm has raised over $100 million in equity and debt financing from investors including Warburg Pincus, according to PitchBook data. The business has been growing during the pandemic, with its annual recurring revenue expanding 53% last year, the company said. 
""It's been a big tailwind for us because as workers are starting to work more from home, they're starting to do more of their work on mobile devices,"" said Shridhar Mittal, chief executive at Zimperium. 
Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive who served as Treasury Secretary during the Trump administration, will chair Zimperium's board of directors. 

Mnuchin raised $2.5 billion for Liberty Strategic Capital last year and focuses on investment opportunities in the cybersecurity, payment as well as media space. 
He said he did not invest in former President Donald Trump's new media venture Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), but signed up for the wait list for the Truth Social app it launched in beta version last month. TMTG is still in the process of going public through merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp since the deal was announced in October.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -World stock markets cast aside fears of rising interest rates on Monday with the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq index rallying 1.3%, even as parts of the Treasury yield curve signaled recession risks while oil prices tumbled on fears of weaker Chinese demand.
After a choppy session where stocks oscillated between gains and losses, U.S. shares finally broke higher, with electric car marker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surging almost 8% on news that it will seek investor approval for a stock split.
But the buoyancy in stocks was foreshadowed by several signs and analyst warnings that it may not last, as global interest rates will likely climb higher this year and could drag on economic growth.
In the Treasuries market, for example, the yield curve for two- and 10-year Treasuries presaged growing recession risks on Monday, even though the curve for three-month bills and 10-year Treasuries still pointed to robust economic expansion.

The tide of rising global yields led Japan's central bank to declare on Monday a steadfast attempt to defend its 0.25% yield cap, vowing to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds for the first four days of the week. 
The announcement sent the yen reeling to a six-year low at one point. Unlike other major economies that are battling surging price pressures, inflation in Japan remains well below its 2% target.

Japan should intervene in the currency market or raise rates to defend the yen if it weakens beyond 130 to the dollar, the country's former top currency diplomat, Eisuke Sakakibara, said.
TECH STOCK RALLY COULD STALL
With some investors betting that U.S. rates could rise by 50 basis points in April, analysts warned that stocks could succumb to deeper losses in coming months.
""One of the more confounding developments during the past two weeks has been the strength of the rebound in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index at the same time interest rates soared to cycle highs,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of the global investment office at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management.
""As this and other yield curves head toward inversion, the nascent rebound in megacap tech stocks may stall."" 
Indeed, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, as measured by the gap between five and 30-year yields, inverted on Monday for the first time since early 2006, as a sell-off in the bond market resumed, with short-dated yields jumping to their highest since 2019.
Fixed-income analysts said the inverted yield curve indicated that some investors believe the Fed's policy tightening will put the brakes on economic growth. [US/]
The two-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.334%, from 2.299%, while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields retreated to 2.459%, after initially pushing above the 2.5%-marker for the first time since 2019 [US/].
Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth management firm Prime Partners, said portfolio rebalancing ahead of quarter-end helped explained strength in equities in the face of surging bond yields.
""A day of reckoning is coming because at the start of April you have earnings season and you will get a sense of the impact of rising energy prices and guidance for the future,"" he said
""I would not bet on the rally continuing in a straight line,"" Savary added.
Euro zone bonds continued their move into positive-yield territory, while money market pricing suggested investors were now anticipating 60 bps worth of rate hikes from the European Central Bank by year-end compared with 50 bps last week. 

British 10-year bond yields hit their highest levels in six years, Swiss 10-year yields and Australian three-year bond yields rose to their highest levels since 2014.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Monday dismissed long-running litigation accusing seven U.S. stock exchanges of defrauding ordinary investors by quietly allowing high-frequency traders to trade faster and at better prices.
Exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets were accused of providing high-frequency trading firms with enhanced data feeds and faster order processing, and letting them locate their servers near the exchanges' own so trading signals would be sent faster.
But in a 46-page decision, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said investors in the proposed class action could not prove they suffered harm because of the exchanges' actions, which they said violated federal securities law.
The judge said reports from the plaintiffs' expert witness, a former high-frequency trader who now consults on market structure, were ""not based on reliable methodology,"" and did not track the trading firms' use of the specialized services.
Because those reports were inadmissible, ""it follows that plaintiffs have adduced no admissible evidence that their own trades were harmed by the exchanges' challenged conduct,"" depriving them of legal standing to sue, Furman wrote.
The investors were led by the city of Providence, Rhode Island and several pension plans, including for the city of Boston. Their lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
High-frequency traders use computer algorithms to gain split-second trading advantages.
They were the subject of Michael Lewis' best-seller ""Flash Boys,"" published in March 2014. The lawsuit began the next month.
The NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc said they were pleased with the decision. Neither the other defendants nor their lawyers provided comments. BATS is now part of CBOE Global Markets Inc.

Furman had also dismissed the investors' claims in 2015, finding the exchanges absolutely immune from liability under federal law, but an appeals court overturned that finding two years later.

The Chamber, along with the Computer and Communications Industry Association and Business Roundtable, argued that the district court judge hearing the case was right to toss it out because the states had waited too long to file their case.
Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia last July dismissed the states' lawsuit against Facebook, saying they delayed in challenging the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 respectively. 
Boasberg, who also dismissed a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, allowed the agency to refile its complaint but did not do so for the states. 

The group, made up of 46 states, Guam and the District of Columbia, argued that Boasberg erred in ruling they had waited too long to file the lawsuit and asked an appeals court to reinstate the case.
The business organizations argued further that the states were wrong in arguing that Facebook broke the law with exclusionary conduct, in executing what the states called a ""buy-or-bury strategy."" The business groups' brief called this position ""dubious and dangerous.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wife of former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Roger Ng on Monday testified in her husband's defense at a U.S. trial over the looting of hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund between 2009 and 2014. 
Ng, Goldman's former chief for Malaysia, is charged with conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-corruption law. Prosecutors say he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from 1MDB, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty. He argues that some $35 million he received from Leissner, which prosecutors characterize as kickbacks from the scheme, was actually the proceeds of a legitimate business venture between the two men's wives.
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, testified on Monday that shortly after Ng began working for Leissner in the mid-2000s, she invested 48 million yuan - about $6 million at the time - at a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's wife, Judy Chan. 
Lim's testimony came on the second day of the defense's case in the trial, which began in early February. 
Lim said she and Chan had a falling out in 2011, and Chan told her to divest her share, which had appreciated substantially. In 2012, Chan told her she was ready to transfer $26 million, Lim testified. 
When asked by Ng's lawyer Marc Agnifilo if the money Chan said she would send to Lim came from 1MDB, Lim replied, ""Not at all.""
""It had to come from Judy and her family,"" Lim said. 
A lawyer for Chan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Leissner, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to similar charges, testified in February that the investment Lim made in Chan's Chinese business was a ""cover story"" that he and Ng concocted to explain the kickback payment so that the banks processing the funds would not grow suspicious.

The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history, in which U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

(https:// The move sets the stage for what is expected to be one of the marquee listings this year, even as investor interest in IPOs has waned significantly due to recent stock market volatility amid fears of aggressive rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the economic fallout of geopolitical tensions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. corporate stock buybacks are being targeted in U.S. President Joe Biden's 2023 budget plan announced on Monday, which seeks to discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stocks in order to benefit executives. 
Under the plan https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf, company executives would be required to hold on to company shares that they receive for several years after taking them, and they would be prohibited from selling shares in the years after a stock buyback.
Such legislation ""would align executives' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders, workers and the economy,"" such as investing money in growth and innovation, according to the proposal.
Corporate share repurchases, which reduce the number of shares outstanding, tend to boost a company's stock price. Executives who receive compensation in the form of stock awards and options can benefit when share repurchases cause a stock price to go up.
Biden's proposal simply starts the debate over the topic, and the implications for companies and their executives are unclear, analysts and others said.
""There's nothing in there that says I can't do all the buybacks I want"" as a company, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York. 
Also, executives are not the only people at companies who could benefit, he noted. ""What we saw last year was that a lot more people turned in their stock options that didn't have to.""
Some said the plan seemed to be a move to appeal to one political base.
""It's kind of playing to a certain political base - anti-capitalist, anti-wealth-creation,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
He added: ""I don't think it's a system that's been abused in the first place,"" and so the proposed changes seemed unnecessary to him.

Buyback levels have been rising in recent months. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earlier this month raised its 2022 buyback forecast for S&P 500 companies to $1 trillion, driven by a ""strong backlog of authorizations.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has led companies in terms of buyback levels in recent years, Silverblatt said.

The carrier has increased the number of planned new orders to 250 aircraft and also plans to increase the number of destinations to 165 from 70, al-Mohanna was reported saying. 
The acceleration in the airline's growth plans, which coincides with ambitions by Saudi Arabia to develop its airline industry and become a hub for tourism, was first reported by Bloomberg.
Flynas, part-owned by the investment firm of Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, was launched as Nas Air in 2007 with an all-Airbus fleet.
The Riyadh-based discount carrier, which competes with state-owned Saudi carrier flyadeal, ordered 80 A320neo-family jets in 2017, with purchasing options for 40 more.

In November, the airline's chief executive said flynas was in talks to exercise some or all of the 40 options, and industry sources said it had already reached an agreement that would see some of those extra planes include the long-range A321XLR model.
As of the end of February, flynas operated a partially leased fleet of 39 Airbus jets, with further 76 yet to be delivered from the manufacturer, according to Airbus data.

Investing.com – Stocks closed higher in the U.S. on Monday after a late-afternoon surge in tech helped lift all three indexes.
It was a change from earlier in the day when stocks weren’t showing any momentum and oil prices plunged. Russia’s war on Ukraine continued though there were discussions about peace talks sometime this week.
One catalyst was Tesla, which announced plans to split shares if shareholders approve.
It’s a data-heavy week coming up, with fresh information on the state of the housing and job markets, including the much-watched monthly jobs report due out Friday. The data comes as the Federal Reserve mulls whether to move more aggressively on interest rates at its May meeting.
The focus on the Fed’s action has weighed on financials and pushed the benchmark 10-year Treasury to above 2.5%. Reuters reported that one measure of the U.S. bond yield curve - the gap between five and 30-year Treasury yields - inverted for the first time since 2006 signaling rising concerns over economic growth.
Oil fell after China imposed lockdowns on Shanghai after an outbreak of Covid-19 infections there. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Energy stocks
Shares of energy stocks have fallen on new concerns regarding demand from China. Shanghai has started a two-stage lockdown to curb a further spread of the coronavirus.
The first phase is for five days, starting Monday, and is limited to Shanghai’s Pudong financial district and nearby neighborhoods. The second stage is a five-day lockdown, starting Friday, that will target Shanghai's downtown area.
The move should also put pressure on oil majors such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp. (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), and  BP PLC  ADR (NYSE:BP).
2. Tesla stock split
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be watched as it makes plans to increase the number of additional shares to enable a stock split. It joins other big companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in splitting shares.
3. Travel stocks
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian cruise shares rose sharply even as pandemic lockdowns returned to focus after Shanghai initiated its most restrictive lockdown in two years following a surge in cases. Analysts have been watching the travel sector for signs of a spring thaw.

Investing.com -- Shares of electric vehicle company Lightning eMotors Inc (NYSE:ZEV), dropped 14% after hours following its earnings report. 
The company beat analyst earnings forecasts but failed to top revenue estimates, announcing a loss per share of 17 cents on revenue of $4.2 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss per share of 20 cents on revenue of $5.25 million.
Lightning eMotors reported a record full-year revenue of $21 million, up 131% year-over-year, with record full-year sales of 146 zero-emission vehicles, a 103% rise year-over-year.
“The fourth quarter capped a transformational year for Lightning, as we strengthened the company by announcing new strategic OEM partnerships, increasing our sales pipeline, expanding our factory capacity, shipping new products, and adding strong executives to the leadership team,” said Tim Reeser, CEO of Lightning eMotors. 
Looking ahead, the company sees first-quarter revenue in the range of $5 million to $6 million, with approximately $7 million in potential Q1 revenue being pushed into future quarters due to supply constraints.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two new funds that let investors place bets on stock market gyrations are expected to launch this week, potentially filling the void left by the implosion of similar products four years ago.
The 1x Short VIX Futures ETF (SVIX) and 2x Long VIX Futures ETF (UVIX) have received regulatory approval to list and will start trading on Wednesday, said Stuart Barton, chief investment officer at Volatility Shares, the company releasing the ETFs.
The new ETFs will track the daily performance of two separate volatility futures indexes, one which rises when stock gyrations pick up and another that benefits from falling volatility.
Volatility-linked exchange traded products have a checkered track-record on Wall Street, with only eight of the 20 volatility ETFs ever launched still trading, according to Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet Research Systems.
In February 2018, a volatility-tracking note called the VelocityShare Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN went bust amid a surge in market volatility in an event which was eventually dubbed “Volmageddon,” taking with it nearly $2 billion in investor assets.
""Historically, investors of all stripes have struggled to use volatility-tracking ETFs well,"" Kashner said.
The turbulence in February 2018 also prompted several volatility products to tweak their investment objectives to reduce risk. Since then, the combined assets in volatility-linked products has about halved to $2.69 billion, Kashner said.
Still, some investors who had been hurt by the XIV blowup said they are ready to trade the new ETFs.
""There is definitely demand from the retail community for another product,"" said Seth Golden, president of investment research firm Finom Group, who experienced a sharp decline in February 2018 due to the upheaval in volatility-tracking products and derivatives when XIV collapsed, though he did not own XIV shares. 
Interest in volatility-related products has grown amid the stock market’s gyrations in recent weeks. One-month trading volume for ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF and the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, popular volatility-linked ETFs, stands at 72 million shares, up about 400% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
Volatility Shares' Barton said the new products have been designed to avoid the pitfalls that had affected older products, including the way the fund goes about buying or selling volatility futures to keep it in line with its benchmark.
The new fund’s daily valuation will be calculated from the average futures prices over the last 15 minutes of the trading day, rather than just the futures settlement price, as in the case of XIV. In theory, that would reduce the funds’ vulnerability to sophisticated investors anticipating how its rebalancing could impact futures prices, according to analysts.
XIV's vulnerability to investors trying to trade volatility futures in anticipation of the fund's rebalancing needs may have created imbalances some analysts believe led to the fund’s undoing. 
The new funds will limit their trading in volatility futures to no more than 10% of the volume during a given rebalancing period, and possibly extend the daily rebalancing period if it finds the market unusually volatile.
That would ""go a long way to addressing the XIV-type situation,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, and plans to use the new ETFs.
A debut would come in the midst of a months-long period where worries over a hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical certainty stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have kept markets choppy. 
The adoption of these products can often ""pick up sharply after market drawdowns when volatility spikes,"" said Anand Omprakash, head of derivatives quantitative strategy at Elevation Securities.
The rise of retail traders as a force in markets may also boost demand for the products, analysts said, although some may not be eager to jump into volatility funds after getting hurt in the past. 

""The audience is more limited than pre-Volmageddon, but growing again,"" Finom's Golden said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada has picked  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) as the preferred bidder to supply 88 new fighter jets, Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi said Monday, in a clear sign the U.S. company is set to win the multibillion-dollar contract.
The move indicates Canada - under pressure to boost defense spending as the war in Ukraine rages - is closer to making a decision that has dragged out for more than a decade.
""This announcement marks another important milestone in Canada's competitive process to purchase modern fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" Tassi said.
Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a decade to replace its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.
""The F-35 is in operational use by NORAD and NATO partners in missions around the globe. It has proven to be a mature, capable and interoperable aircraft and that is why we are moving to the finalization phase of this procurement,"" Defense Minister Anita Anand, speaking alongside Tassi, told reporters. 
The federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will now only hold detailed talks with Lockheed Martin. Ottawa says it hopes to award the contract this year and take first deliveries in 2025.
Defense sources had long bet on the U.S. company, given Canada belongs to the consortium that developed its F-35 jet and the fact the plane is the military's first choice. Ottawa says the contract could be worth up to C$19 billion ($15.10 billion).
""We look forward to continuing our partnership with Canadian industry to deliver and sustain the F-35 for the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" Lockheed Martin Canada Chief Executive Lorraine Ben said in a statement.
If the negotiations for some reason fail, the government will turn to Sweden's Saab, the other contender.
""While we maintain our position that Saab presented the best offer for the Future Fighter Capability Project, we respect the decision of the government of Canada,"" the Swedish company said in a statement, adding that it would continue to collaborate with Canada in current and future programs.
Canada though has a long history of using U.S. military equipment and, unlike Sweden, belongs to both NATO and NORAD, the North American defense organization.
Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 as too expensive but has shifted his position.

The obvious alternative would have been Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co but it fell out of favor after taking trade action against Canadian rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc and was excluded from the competition last December.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams are set to meet in Turkey this week, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling independent Russian reporters that he would be willing to accept permanent neutrality as a basis for peace, as long as it was guaranteed by third parties.
Meanwhile, the White House has rowed back on President Joe Biden's weekend remarks calling for the departure of Vladimir Putin as Russian president, saying he had not been calling for regime change.
Away from Eastern Europe, investors will continue to focus on the strength of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s plans for upcoming interest rate hikes.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will also be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the retail giant is stopping cigarette sales in some U.S. stores.
Oil prices slumped Monday on fears of reduced demand from China, the world’s largest crude importer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted the country’s officials to instigate a two-stage lockdown at its financial hub of Shanghai.
All firms and factories in Shanghai would suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely in a two-stage lockdown, closing half the city in turns, over nine days. Public transport, including ride-hailing services, will also be suspended.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) faces an estimated 450 million pound ($592 million) loss and regulatory scrutiny for exceeding a U.S. limit on sales of structured products, some of which have surged in popularity since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Barclays also said on Monday that it will have to delay a planned 1 billion pound share buyback as of the loss, which it will have to incur as a result of buying back the securities in question at their original purchase price.
Shares in Barclays closed down 4% after the bank said it had oversold billions of pounds worth of the securities over a period of about a year, overshooting a $20.8 billion limit agreed with United States regulators by $15.2 billion.
The major regulatory blunder is an early embarrassment for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the newly-appointed chief executive of Barclays, whose previous roles included heading up the bank's global markets and risk operations.
Analysts at Shore Capital said in a note that Barclays appeared to be ""tripping over its shoelaces"".
The wider investment bank had previously proved a stellar performer for Barclays over recent years, helping it to post a record annual profit for 2021.
While the current share buyback has only been delayed, the error could reduce future capital distributions to shareholders by the bank, the Shore Capital analysts said.
In a further blow after the London market close, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) note seen by Reuters showed that the U.S. investment bank had been instructed by one of Barclays' top investors to sell a significant chunk of stock in the bank.
The target price range for the sale of 575 million Barclays' shares was 6.1-8.1% lower than the closing price, a factor which is likely to put further pressure on the stock price when it opens on Tuesday.
VOLATILITY BETS
The products involved include two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to crude oil and market volatility, a source familiar with the matter said. Barclays suspended sales and issuance of both this month.
Before sales were suspended, the so-called VXX product had surged in popularity as investors placed bets on volatility as the Ukraine crisis roiled global markets, with the number of shares changing hands daily doubling to 71 million in a month.
Barclays said at the time that capacity issues were to blame and the actions were not linked to the crisis in Ukraine.
The bank said on Monday its best estimate was that the loss on the affected securities would amount to 450 million pounds, cutting its core capital ratio to the middle of its 13-14% target range. The loss estimate did not include tax. 
Barclays said it would delay its share buyback until the second quarter of the year as a result.
It said that it had commissioned an independent review, while regulators were conducting inquiries and requesting information from the bank.

Barclays said the securities were registered for sale in August 2019, adding that it would file a new registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. pressure on Huawei Technologies has served to strengthen the resolve of the Chinese telecoms giant, finance chief Meng Wanzhou said on Monday after its first set of results since her return from nearly three years' detention in Canada.
The daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei played a central role in the company's tussle with the United States, having been detained in Canada in 2018 over alleged attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.
The United States then imposed a series of trade restrictions on the company throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns. This impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses. 
Meng was allowed to return to China in September after agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end a bank fraud case.
""Over the past few years our teams have undertaken a lot of pressure, and along this process we have become more united and our strategy has become clearer,"" she told reporters in her first public appearance at a company event, adding that Huawei had become more capable of dealing with uncertainty.

STEEP REVENUE DROP
Washington's sanctions have continued to weigh heavily on Huawei's business. 
Full-year revenue tumbled 29% last year to 636.8 billion yuan ($100 billion). Net profit jumped by a record 76% to 113.7 billion yuan, but that was mainly thanks to the sale of its Honor handset division and server businesses under U.S. pressure. 
Meng attributed the revenue drop to the impact of U.S sanctions on the smartphone business, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and slowing demand for 5G base stations in China were also contributing factors. 
Guo Ping, Huawei's current rotating chairman, said the company hopes to find a solution to sustain its smartphone division and will ramp up investment in research seeking microchip ""breakthroughs"" after losing access to certain advanced technologies because of U.S. sanctions.
Though Guo did not directly answer repeated questions on whether Huawei planned to build its own chip manufacturing facility, he highlighted artificial intelligence (AI), Wifi6 connectivity, green energy, automotive and cloud computing as key areas for R&D and new business opportunities.
Asked if Huawei would be affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia, Guo said the company is evaluating related policies, adding that it has no plans to take its mobile operating system Harmony OS overseas. 

Many observers have questioned whether Chinese companies such as Huawei can fill the void left by overseas companies that have exited Russia in protest over the conflict in Ukraine.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut losses Monday as a Tesla-led surge in growth stocks offsetting weakness in cyclical stocks amid further cues from the bond market pointing to a potential recession.
The S&P 500 added 0.72%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.27%, or 94 points, the Nasdaq surged 1.3%.
Consumer discretionary was pushed higher by an 8% surge in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the electric automaker said it planned to split its stock to pave the way to pay dividends to shareholders.
The rally in Tesla comes just days ahead of the EV automaker’s update on first-quarter deliveries.
“We believe by the end of 2022 Tesla will now have the capacity/run rate for overall ~2 million units annually from roughly 1 million in 2021 with Berlin and Austin green-lighted to start production,” Wedbush said in a note.

The bond market was quick to price in the potential impact on global growth at a time when investors fear the Federal Reserve’s hawkish path to curb inflation threatens to tip the economy into recession. The five-year Treasury yield briefly rose above the 30-year yield for the first time since 2006.
Bank stocks were sharply lower as a flattening yield tightens net interest margin, limiting the ability to profit from lending. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), and M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) were down about 2%.

The support of Germany's Union Investment, which is a top-20 shareholder, for CEO Werner Baumann to see out his contract to 2024 comes after Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Singapore state investor Temasek, another large shareholder, was pushing for Baumann's removal. 
Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, said Temasek had concerns about Bayer’s operating performance under Baumann and the company’s lack of succession planning.
Janne Werning, Union Investment's head of capital markets and stewardship, said in a statement he was satisfied for Baumann to step down as planned in two years because, while Bayer's 2018 takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) was an unnecessary financial risk, the CEO should stay on to oversee recent positive changes.
""Initial progress is visible and to bring forward his departure by cancellation of his contract would only sow chaos,"" Werning said.
He cited improvement at the Crop Science division, driven by higher produce prices, and a recent slew of drug development transactions as among promising signs.
In 2020, Baumann's contract was extended until 2024. He said at the time he was initially offered a longer term but that he had opted for a shorter duration due to personal plans.
Bayer's executive board won clear votes of confidence from shareholders at last year's annual general meeting (AGM) and in 2020, but suffered a rebuke in 2019 over the handling of lawsuits related to Monsanto's weedkiller Roundup, which has cost Bayer billions of dollars to settle.

Another shareholder, Swiss investment manager Alatus Capital SA, this month filed a motion for Bayer's AGM scheduled for April 29, to vote against ratifying the actions of the executive board.
Bayer responded at the time by saying the motion was unjustified because the operating business was developing positively and progress had been made in the Roundup litigation.

Credit Suisse was asked to hand over documents related to the financing of yachts and private jets owned by potentially sanctioned individuals, according to a letter sent by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Reform to the bank's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, on Monday. 
The probe comes after the Financial Times reported earlier this month that Credit Suisse had asked hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents relating to its richest clients' yachts and private jets, in an attempt to stop information leaking about loans to oligarchs who were later sanctioned.
The letter was sent by U.S. representatives Carolyn Maloney and Stephen Lynch. Maloney chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee and Lynch is chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security. The letter expressed concern over the timing of the bank's instruction to destroy the documents as it coincided with Switzerland's statement that it would join other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia. 
Credit Suisse on Monday declined to comment on the probe. It referred back to a statement made earlier this month in response to the FT's report.
In that statement, it said that the request had been made to ensure investors complied with a nondisclosure agreement and was ""in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions - with which we are fully compliant.""
Credit Suisse has been asked to comply with the committee's request by April 11 and will need to send documents starting from January 2017 to present day, according to the letter.
The probe is another headache for Gottstein as he looks to get the bank back on track following a challenging 2021. Last year, the bank's chairman, Antonio Horta-Osorio, resigned after an internal investigation revealed he breached COVID-19 rules, lost billions of dollars from the collapse of investment fund Archegos Capital Management and was tarnished by its involvement with now-defunct financier Greensill Capital. 

Credit Suisse stopped pursuing new business in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Swiss bank said on Monday in an internal document seen by Reuters. 
Prominent U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) last week asked more than 30 financial services trade groups for information on what steps their members have taken to end business relationships in Russia.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Major Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) shareholders will vote against a motion to clear some board members of responsibility over possible payment of bribes to militant organisations in Iraq, deepening a crisis at the Swedish group that has knocked a quarter off its market value. 
Shareholders, including Cevian Capital, Swedbank Robur and Norway's wealth fund, plan to vote against discharging the board members of liability at Ericsson's annual general meeting on Tuesday.
The shareholder vote is likely to be close to a 10% threshold that would give investors the right to sue board members in the future under Swedish company law.
Ericsson has been under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Justice and from shareholders for not properly disclosing that its 2019 investigation had found the company may have paid militant organisations in Iraq.
""We still lack the information necessary to make an informed judgment of what went wrong, why, and who should be held responsible,"" Cevian said. ""Given the lack of information and the magnitude of the damage, we have no choice but to hold the entire board accountable."" 
Cevian owns just under 5% shares in Ericsson. 
Investor AB along with Primecap Management, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and AB Industrivärden are also among major investors in the company, Ericsson's website said.
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it would vote against granting a discharge to five of the company's board members, including Chief Executive Borje Ekholm. 
""When voting on a proposal to discharge the board of responsibilities, we will consider whether any information raises reasonable doubt about the board's actions,"" said the fund, which has around a 1.9% stake based on Refinitiv data. 
Fund manager Swedbank Robur, which has a 3.9% stake, said: ""We will not grant discharge of liability for the board members and CEO.""
It also said it still had confidence in the board and CEO, and would vote for the Nomination Committee's proposal to appoint them.
Swedish business daily Dagens Industri cited fund managers Nordea Funds and Lansforsakringar Fondforvaltning, with a 1.1% stake and a 0.3% stake respectively, as saying they would vote against discharge from liability for the board. 
Fund manager Avanza Fonder, which has less than 1% of Ericsson, said it would vote against discharge from liability for Ekholm and board members who are part of Ericsson's Audit and Compliance Committee.
""We ... want to let our dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency in the serious breaches identified in Ericsson be known,"" Avanza Fonder CEO Jesper Bonnivier said.
Sweden's shareholders association, representing small shareholders, told Reuters it would also vote against.
Under the Swedish Companies Act, a company or shareholders can sue board members or the CEO if a group representing at least a 10% stake in the company votes against ratifying acts of the CEO in the past year.
Telecom gear maker Ericsson said: ""We are awaiting the result of the vote at tomorrow’s AGM and will comment further then.""
'CHALLENGING SITUATION'
Investor AB, Ericsson's largest shareholder in terms of both capital and votes, and Industrivarden said they planned to vote in favour of discharge of liabilities.
Investor AB, backed by the Wallenberg family, said it had continued full confidence in Ericsson's board and CEO.
""It is important that the company's Board and Management feel they have our support in this challenging situation,"" Investor AB CEO Johan Forssell said in a statement. 
It is rare for shareholders in big Swedish companies not to grant discharge of liability, and any such move would be likely to raise pressure for a boardroom overhaul. 
In 2014, a scandal over telecoms company Telia Company' , then called TeliaSonera, business dealings in Uzbekistan pushed shareholders to vote against discharging former CEO Lars Nyberg from personal liability in 2014.
Ekholm, who had served as CEO of Investor AB, took over as CEO of Ericsson in 2016. He oversaw a turnaround of the company and in 2019 settled a U.S. government probe for alleged payment of bribes from at least 2000 to 2016 in countries including China, Vietnam and Djibouti.
In the same year, Ericsson investigated allegation of bribes in Iraq but chose to not disclose the findings to shareholders. It released details in February this year after media enquiries, sparking the current tension.
""Unquestionably Borje has done a good job of turning around the company, but this scandal clearly puts a dark cloud over his efforts,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. 

The Ericsson board, including Chairman Ronnie Leten, has also been backing Ekholm, after proxy firms, including Glass Lewis, had recommended shareholders vote to remove him following the disclosure and a sharp fall in the company's share price.
Ericsson shares closed 1% higher on Monday.

BERLIN/MILAN (Reuters) -ProSiebenSat.1 said on Monday that MediaForEurope (MFE) had rejected the offer of a seat on the supervisory board of the German broadcaster, suggesting that no compromise has been reached with its top investor ahead of a May shareholder vote.
MFE, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has called for closer cooperation with Munich-based ProSieben, in which it has a voting stake of more than 25%.
The Milan-listed group has also asked ProSieben to engage in talks over strategy, focusing on its core TV business.
ProSieben said in December that it was extending CEO Rainer Beaujean's contract until 2027, and the supervisory board intended to propose Andreas Wiele, a former Axel Springer executive board member, as its new chairman.
MFE was not given advance notice of this plan and it was not involved either in the decision to propose former RTL boss Bert Habets and Rolf Nonnenmacher for other two seats that are to be reallocated at ProSieben's annual general meeting on May 5.
ProSieben said in a statement on Monday that its supervisory board unanimously approved the proposals, which were the result of a comprehensive selection process initiated in mid-2021. 
It said it had also offered MFE the opportunity to propose its own candidate, in return for supporting the supervisory board candidates. 
""MFE-MediaForEurope rejected this proposal, which the supervisory board very much regrets"", it said.
MFE does not have any supervisory board representatives but has reserved the right to present rival candidates by April 20.
""MFE has absolutely no interest in controversy. Our position will be presented at the appropriate time... and in the interests of the company and all its shareholders"", a spokesperson for MFE said.
A source familiar with the matter said MFE's own board of directors could be updated on the developments at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday.

Formerly known as Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), MFE sees building a continental TV champion as the answer to challenges posed by streaming giants and online advertising platforms.
For its part, German TV group ProSieben has been pursuing a standalone strategy, while investing in tech businesses, such as e-commerce operations and online dating platform ParshipMeet.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split in the form of a dividend, the electric-car maker said on Monday, sending its shares up about 5%.
The plan came as the company suspended its Shanghai factory amid COVID-19-related lockdown measures and its artificial intelligence head took a sabbatical as the company aims to achieve full self-driving capability this year. 
The proposal, first announced on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), has been approved by its board and shareholders will vote on it at an annual meeting. The stock split, if approved, would be the latest after a five-for-one split in August 2020 that made Tesla shares cheaper for its employees and investors.
Following a pandemic-induced rally in the technology shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), too, have in the recent past split their shares to make them more affordable.

Tesla debuted at $17 per share in 2010. Following its 2020 5-for-1 stock split it is trading above $1,000, equivalent to over $5,000 on a pre-stock split basis. 
Since the stock split in 2020, they have surged 128%, boosting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion and making it the biggest U.S. automaker by that measure.
""This (stock split) could further fuel the bubble in Tesla's stock that has been brewing over the past two years,"" said David Trainer, chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs.
Tesla has delivered nearly a million electric cars annually, while ramping up production by setting up new factories in Austin and Berlin amid COVID-19-related disruptions and increasing competition. 
Tesla on Monday notified its suppliers and workers that its Shanghai factory in China will be closed for four days as the financial hub said it would lock down in two stages to carry out mass COVID-19 testing.
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Monday that he had ""supposedly"" tested positive for COVID-19, a few days after he attended a car delivery event at the company's new Berlin factory. 
""We think Berlin ramping, and both the MiniCar and India are on the horizon, we would agree with the timing,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said, hinting that companies usually execute stock splits when good news is ahead.

Musk also said on Sunday Tesla's artificial intelligence chief Andrej Karpathy was on a fourth-month sabbatical, at a critical time that Musk wants to achieve full self-driving capability and roll out a humanoid robot prototype this year. 
""Especially excited to get focused time to re-sharpen my technical edge and train some neural nets!"" Karparthy tweeted.

""Though I already miss all the robots and GPU/Dojo clusters and looking forward to having them at my fingertips again,"" he said, referring to Tesla's AI chip Dojo.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion boasts a 4.6% pay raise for troops and the largest research and development budget in history, as Russian aggression in Ukraine spurs demands for more military spending.
Biden's request earmarks $773 billion for the Pentagon, and eclipses the budget requests by former President Donald Trump. An additional $40 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $813 billion, up from $778 billion last year.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven recent support for greater defense spending among Democrats and Republicans who see a growing national security and foreign policy threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The budget increases funds for the Pentagon's European Deterrence Initiative by $360 million to a total of $4.2 billion. 
At the same time, the budget slows the Department of Defense's purchasing of the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, after Air Force leaders complained that technological improvements to the jet's hardware were too slow. 
Budget talks between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the White House coalesced around the $773 billion early on, defense officials said. Reuters first reported the figure in February.
Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.
Only 61 F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) were requested by the Pentagon, down from a request of 85 last year, though experts believe Congress will increase that figure during the budget process. 
The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). 
The 2023 fiscal budget, which starts on Oct. 1, boasts the Pentagon's largest research and development budget ever, with $130 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia. 

Some of that investment is funded by retiring equipment like Littoral Combat Ships that are expensive to operate, and older planes like A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies. 
The national defense budget request crafted during Trump's final year in office was for $752.9 billion. Congress then increased that amount by $25 billion, ultimately landing at $778 billion for fiscal 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday proposed expanding the definition of broker-dealers and mandating that Principal Trading Firms (PTFs) must register with the agency in a bid to enhance market resiliency and help level the playing field.
The Wall Street regulator said its proposal, which is subject to public consultation, aims to expand the definition of a dealer as ""one that engages in a routine pattern of buying and selling securities that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants,"" which would capture a range of activities it sees as critical to the agency's monitoring of systemic risk.
""In recent years, we've seen a number of high-profile events in markets with significant participation by PTFs. Tremors in the Treasuries markets in 2014, 2019, and at the beginning of the COVID crisis in 2020 demonstrate the importance of the SEC's oversight of dealers,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.
Monday's proposal specifies that broker dealers who routinely make comparable purchases and sales of the same or substantially similar securities in a day must register with the regulator. 
Dealers who ""routinely express trading interests that are at or near the best available prices on both sides of the market and that are communicated and represented in a way that makes them accessible to other market participants"" must also be registered, the SEC said, in addition to mandating that a dealer must register with the agency if she earns revenue primarily from capturing bid-ask spreads, by buying at the bid and selling at the offer.
The regulator also seeks to scrutinize dealers who capture any incentives offered by trading venues to liquidity-supplying trading interests.

Regulators have long argued that high-frequency trading, a computerized strategy that can move billions of dollars in fractions of a second, carries risks in the U.S. government bond market that threaten the ability of the market to function, as well as the ability of investors to fairly value assets.
The SEC, as the U.S. market's regulator, should require that such trading firms comply with capital and record-keeping rules and be subject to periodic exams, much like equities and corporate bond markets, Gensler has argued.

By Chen Aizhu, Julie Zhu and Muyu Xu
(Reuters) - China's state-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.
The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions. 
Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.
But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.
Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multi-billion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.""
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. 
The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said.
The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment. 
The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about ""whether there are internal meetings or not"".
""China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,"" it said in a faxed statement. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Global oil majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its ""special operation"" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.
TALKS ON HOLD
Sinopec, formally China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) and Chemical Corp, has suspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the new gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said.
The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest petrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec and 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024.
""The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by building another one and were in the middle of site selection,"" said the source.
Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been sanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires with ties to Putin.
Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions.
The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the sources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key lenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank and European credit agencies.
""It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome the difficulties in financing,"" said a Beijing-based industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Sibur said it continues to cooperate with Sinopec including working jointly on implementing the Amur plant. It denied that there was a plan to team up with Sinopec for a project similar to the Amur Gas Chemical Complex in east Siberia.
""Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the project's construction management, including equipment supplies, work with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working on the issues of project financing,"" Sibur told Reuters by email.
Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture with Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S. sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the wake of the sanctions.
Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered a preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to create a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China as well as distributing natural gas in China.

Novatek did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the agreement with Sinopec.
Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were among the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector, taking minority stakes in major export project Arctic LNG 2 in 2019 and Yamal LNG in 2014.

Investing.com -- Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE) said Monday it is closing its main e-commerce business, Shopee, in India. 
The closing down of the operation comes just months after its launch in October, with the company putting it down to ""market uncertainties"" rather than political factors.
The move follows last month's decision by India to ban Sea's Free Fire game due to hostility towards Chinese-owned firms which has seen it ban hundreds of Chinese apps in the last couple of years.
Sea is based in Singapore, but its founders are Chinese-born. It is also part-owned by the Chinese social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which is its biggest shareholder.
Shopee said it will stop all operations in India on Tuesday. The company intends to process orders placed before March 29, while also providing after-sales support services.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock traded 4.3% lower Monday after Piper Sandler cut its target by 42% to $29 with analyst Michael S. Lavery citing growing competitive intensity and pessimism around the U.S. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) partnership as reasons for his somber outlook.
Lavery earlier had a target of $50 for the stock with a ‘neutral’ rating, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst points out that Beyond Meat is still burning cash “with no clear path to positive EBITDA.”
The lowered target reflects lower estimates for 2022 and 2023 sales, in addition to the lowered EV/sales multiple to reflect the company’s growth, profitability, and balance sheet.
The analyst also shared key findings from Piper’s survey, which showed that 31% of respondents said they would try plant-based meat if it were cheaper than animal meat.
According to the analyst, the company remains committed to lowering prices below that of animal protein (despite current inflation) by 2024, which will likely drive prices down more than it will lift volumes.
Beyond Meat had reported disappointing fourth-quarter numbers in February. In the fourth quarter ended December 31, the company’s net loss more than tripled to over $80 million on revenue of about $101 million.
Sales to U.S. grocers, convenience stores, and other retailers declined by almost a fifth in the fourth quarter. The company attributed this to softer demand, fewer shipping days, increased discounting, and “to a lesser extent, loss of market share.” President and CEO Ethan Brown called it a “temporary disruption.”"

The Authority for Consumers and Markets said its fines against the company in the long-running dispute now total 50 million euros ($55 million), the maximum possible under its current order.
It said Apple had submitted a new proposal for complying with the order on Sunday - a move the watchdog said it welcomed but that came too late to avoid the fine.
Apple's practice of requiring developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. 
Although the Dutch case is limited to dating apps in the Netherlands, it could set a precedent for the U.S. company, which has denied wrongdoing. The ACM has been levying weekly fines against the company in the dispute since January.
The ACM said on Monday that Apple's new compliance proposal was concrete enough that it expects be able to make a finding ""as soon as possible"" as to whether the company has complied with its order. It said it would consider the proposal and consult with dating app makers such as Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH).
Depending on the outcome, the agency said it might still move to impose further periodic fines ""with possibly higher penalties"" to encourage the company to comply.

Under new rules agreed last week between the European Commission, EU governments and EU lawmakers, Apple will be required to open up its App Store to alternative payments once the legislation comes into force in October.

The Russian market is gradually reopening after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russian stocks and bonds resumed trading in full on Monday, albeit for a curtailed timeframe and with various restrictions, including a ban on short-selling, still in place. Non-residents are barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
By 1530 GMT, the rouble gained 7.7% to 89.10 to the dollar, its strongest level since March 1.
The rouble has gained support from conditions of continuing capital controls and the absence of serious sanctions tightening, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest. 
But the rouble was weaker on the EBS electronic platform, hovering at 96 to the dollar.

As of Monday, Russia has not started spending the fund's money on stocks purchases, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said, according to Interfax.

Dominant lender Sberbank shed 3.9%, gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) fell 3.6% and oil major Rosneft slid 1.9%. 
Yields on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds were at 13.62%, down from last week's record high of 19.74%, which is just below the central bank's key interest rate, but still at levels last seen in March 2015.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The crisis at Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp may have a silver lining for new boss Taro Shimada, allowing him to keep - at least for now - businesses pivotal to his digital strategy that predecessors had planned to sell.
Investors last week voted down management's plan to spin off Toshiba's devices unit with nearly 60% opposition, as well as a rival shareholder proposal to solicit buyout offers. That left the troubled 146-year-old conglomerate without a clear immediate direction.
But it could give Shimada, a former aircraft designer and Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) executive, leeway for his plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware.
It also allows him to hang onto equipment maker Toshiba Tec Corp, which was considered ""non core"" in the now-rejected spin-off. Shimada has praised some businesses at Toshiba Tec for marrying digital to hardware and sources say he didn't want to sell it.
It's unclear if Shimada will be able to appease the hedge funds that own around 30% of Toshiba and are impatient for a private equity buyout. But as Thursday's vote shows, they don't have enough support to completely call the shots.
The outcome of the vote gives Shimada ""carte blanche"" to show he can deliver, said veteran Japan analyst Jesper Koll of Monex Group.
""For the first time in over a decade, you've got a CEO at Toshiba who actually is a technologist, who understands technology, who has hands-on experience,"" he said.
Big manufacturers are increasingly pushing into higher-margin digital services. Shimada's former employer, Siemens, wants to expand its customer base through digital services that improve factories, buildings and train systems.
Shimada says he's the first Toshiba head to understand digital. He was brought in as chief strategy officer for digital in 2018 by then CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, also a company outsider, who wooed him over ramen noodles in Tokyo's Shimbashi district.
Kurumatani stepped down last year amid a governance scandal and shareholder opposition. Toshiba later said the former boss violated ethical standards. Shimada became the third CEO in about a year when he took over this month from Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains board chairman.
CONSTANT TURMOIL
Toshiba has been in turmoil since a 2015 accounting scandal and the later bankruptcy of U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Overseas investors injected $5.4 billion and saved it from delisting, but that brought on hedge funds as shareholders. 
Four years of dealing with foreign activist hedge funds - and their varied demands for buybacks, board reshuffles and a resumption of buyout talks - has left management distracted, sources say. 
The firm's stock market value has fallen to around $18 billion, half of an early 2000s peak.
Shimada says Toshiba can no longer sell just hardware and needs to add digital services to improve both products and margins.
He repeated that message ""over and over"" at internal meetings when he first joined, he told Reuters in an interview two years ago.
""I'm trying to show what digital transformation means,"" he said in the interview. 
Meanwhile, rival Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd has been transforming itself for a decade already, selling off low-growth businesses and investing in its digital and services platform. Last year it bought U.S. software firm GlobalLogic for $9.6 billion including debt.
Toshiba's operating profit margin was 3.42% in the last financial year, less than half of Hitachi's 9.38%, according to Refinitiv.
SCEPTICAL
Investors remain sceptical of the company's ability to mount a turnaround on its own.
While Toshiba is an ""incredible company with incredible technology inside"" it has become ""less than the sum of its parts,"" said Brian Heywood, CEO of Taiyo Pacific Partners, which doesn't own Toshiba shares. 
The company ""hasn't defined how its parts go together,"" Heywood said.
Shimada cites Toshiba Tec's ""Smart Receipt"" app, which works with its point-of-sales systems, as one digitalisation example.
The app replaces paper receipts with electronic ones and sends coupons to users' phones. Retailers get data for advertising and promotions.
Shimada declined to comment this month when asked about the classification, which was part of a plan since rejected, of Toshiba Tec as ""non core"". He did say the business was ""extremely good."" The company commands about half of the domestic market for point-of-sales systems.
He also sees potential for a cybersecurity subscription service based on quantum computing that protects users from advanced cyberattacks.

Shimada hasn't publicly stated his stance on a potential private equity buyout that hedge fund shareholders have been calling for.
If that happens, he could still pursue his strategy - provided existing management were allowed to stay on.

(Reuters) - The U.S. advertising market will grow in 2022 but only by half as much as it did in 2021, according to an industry forecast released on Monday that cited both last year's record growth from the COVID-19 recovery and the economic harm from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Media intelligence firm MAGNA, a unit of Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG), lowered its full-year growth forecast by one percentage point to 11.5% compared to its 12.6% forecast before the invasion little over a month ago.
The 11.5% growth represents $320 billion in 2022, MAGNA said, as compared with 25% growth in 2021. 
The strength of the advertising industry typically mirrors the economy, as brands may spend more to market products to consumers in a strong economy and cut spending during tougher times.
The assault on Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" is rekindling economic uncertainty with high oil and gas prices and concerns about the global supply chain, the report said. 
""It’s still very early to assess the full impact of the Ukraine crisis,"" said Vincent Letang, executive vice president of global market intelligence at MAGNA.

Political advertising for the U.S. midterm elections in November could be higher than previously expected. One reason may be that campaigns are raising more money to fund digital ads on top of local TV commercials in order to reach voters online, Letang said. 
MAGNA now expects political advertising to grow by 41% compared to the last U.S. midterms in 2018, up from its previous forecast of 31%.

Investing.com – Uber Inc (NYSE:UBER) stock recouped all its losses in the session and was up 0.8% at 11:10 ET Monday as traders turned their attention to Saturday’s news of the ride-hailing app securing a 30-month license to operate in London.
The ride-hailing service had been engaged in a dispute with regulators over the past five years over safety issues and had lost its license to operate twice over that period.
It was in 2019 when Uber lost its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time. A legal battle ensued and a year later, the company was granted an 18-month license. The U.S. company first lost its license in 2017.
Transport for London now finds Uber to be a fit and proper person and has granted a license with conditions, a Reuters report quoted the authority’s spokesperson as saying.
Uber had previously claimed that it has assuaged safety concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.
The firm also struck a deal with Britain's GMB union last year, allowing it to represent up to 70,000 drivers.
Earlier this month, Uber raised its current-quarter guidance, driven by a “significant” improvement in February demand for mobility.
The company is now expecting its basic operating income on an adjusted basis to come in between $130 million and $150 million in the first quarter. This range was earlier $100 million to $130 million.
Uber said it expects a sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA for both Mobility and Delivery segments.  
The company had, in February, reported its second operating profit for a quarter while its food delivery business delivered its maiden profit at a basic operating level. The company also reported the most active users in its history.
According to the company’s forecast then, revenue this quarter was seen at $26 billion.

London-listed Polymetal, which has a free float of 75.2%, is not subject to any Western sanctions imposed on Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine. However, its shares are down 78% amid a global sell-off of Russia-related stocks since the ""operation"" began on Feb. 24.
Polymetal did not provide any further detail in its comment.

Citing two people familiar with discussions, the report added that investors would have the option to retain holdings in both companies, or to sell their shares in the Russian business. 
Polymetal produced 1.7 million troy ounces of gold equivalent - a mix of gold and other metals - in 2021, of which 558,000 ounces were produced by its two mines in Kazakhstan.

AMSTERDAM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Brewing giants Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) said on Monday they would quit Russia, joining an exodus of Western companies as pressure grows on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international companies to turn their backs on the Russian market after the launch last month of what Moscow termed a ""special military operation"" against its neighbour.
For Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to Russia, the exit would result in a ""substantial non-cash impairment charge"" this year, it said without providing further details. 
The company holds a 27% share of the local market through its ownership of the country's biggest brewer, Baltika. 
""We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia, which we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment,"" Carlsberg said. ""Upon completion we will have no presence in Russia.""
The company's shares, which have fallen by roughly a quarter since the start of the invasion, traded 4.2% higher on Monday, heading for their best day since November 2020. 
Heineken, the third largest brewer in Russia, earlier said it was aiming for an ""orderly transfer"" of its local business, which accounts for just 2% of total sales, reducing its operations during a transition period to minimise the risk of nationalisation.
The Dutch brewer expects to book related charges of around 400 million euros ($438 million) and said it would guarantee the salaries of its 1,800 employees in Russia until the end of the year. 
""We have concluded that Heineken's ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it would not profit from any transfer of ownership.
Its shares were up 0.3% by 1423 GMT.
Carlsberg last year generated 10% of its total revenue and 6% of its operating profit in Russia, where it has eight breweries and 8,400 employees. It took full control of Baltika in 2008 but has faced sluggish sales amid a sanction-hit economy and regulations to curb alcohol abuse. 
""The announcement that Carlsberg will leave Russia should help to clear the air and removes the overhang risk,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note.
The Danish brewer's non-current assets in Russia stood at 19.2 billion Danish crowns ($2.83 billion) at the end of 2021, amounting to around 15% of total assets or 44% of its total equity, its annual report showed.
Russia's second largest brewer is a joint venture owned by Turkey's Anadolu Efes and Belgium's InBev.
InBev said earlier in March it would stop selling Bud beer in Russia and forego profits from the joint venture, which has 11 breweries and 3,500 employees in the country.

Cirina, who was head of Austria and the CEE countries at the insurer, has been proposed for the top job by a leading Generali investor in a power struggle which will be put to a shareholder vote on April 29.
""The decision has been taken due to violations of his duty of loyalty and material breach of other personal obligations under his contract of employment,"" Generali said in a statement.
There was no immediate comment from Cirina who presented his camp's alternative plans for the insurer at a news conference in Milan on Friday, alongside Claudio Costamagna, the rebel shareholder's candidate to chair the group.
Italian unions said on Monday they were concerned that cost-cutting targets for Generali proposed by the two men could present serious problems for the sustainability of employment at a company of national importance.
Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali, wants to replace Frenchman Donnet, who has been CEO since 2016, and install Cirina in his place.
The Generali board has proposed Donnet for a third term, with backing from the group's single biggest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
'AWAKENING THE LION'
Caltagirone's team set out their stall on Friday with a plan dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"", a reference to Generali's nickname ""The Lion of Trieste"", which features on its logo. They want to boost earnings growth, cut costs, and do bigger M&A deals.
The challengers aim to lift earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8% and would make the group a best-in-class according to analysts. The rebels also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Generali shares rose 4% to their highest level in more than a decade on Monday, as the shareholder battle stoked buying.

Berenberg said in a note that victory by a tight margin for the current management would be the best outcome for investors, adding that this would result in it over-delivering on Generali's growth rate target of 6-8% of its earnings per share.
""We believe the reelection of the existing management team is the most likely outcome, as this team has established a strong track record in the past six years,"" it added.

Investing.com – Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 6% Monday after Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo said the cryptocurrency exchange is in talks to acquire 2TM, owner of Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s largest crypto brokerage.
According to the report, negotiations between Coinbase and 2TM have been on since last year and an agreement could be announced late next month.
Brazil’s crypto unicorn 2TM would give Coinbase the leverage needed to secure a market leader position in Latin America. The holding company behind Mercado Bitcoin, Meubank, MB Digital Assets, Bitrust, Blockchain Academy, and MezaPro was valued at roughly $2.2 billion in the latest Series B funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank, according to Bloomberg.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Commission advisers on Monday proposed an expansion of the bloc's sustainable finance rules to better grade activities such as gas-fired power plants that are not yet environmentally friendly. 
Whether and how to include gas in the European Union's flagship 'taxonomy', a list of green activities that will help the bloc reach its climate goals, has spurred intense lobbying over the last year.
After the Commission proposed defining gas as 'green' using more generous emissions thresholds than those originally suggested by the expert advisers, a number of European countries and politicians said they would oppose it.
To help solve the issue, the advisers proposed expanding the scope of the taxonomy using a traffic light system to include an intermediate, or 'amber', category for activities that were not yet sustainable, but which could become so over time.
They also backed creating a 'red' category for activities causing significant environmental harm that need to urgently transition or be wound down, as well as another for activities that have little direct impact on the environment.
""It's really important to be clear about what are these transitions that are needed, in order to make sure that the capital markets can engage and finance can flow for them,"" said Nancy Saich, Chief Climate Change Expert at the European Investment Bank and member of the expert advisory group. 
By broadening the role of the taxonomy, companies would be better able to access finance to fund their transition to a low-carbon economy, while investors would get more transparency about what they were funding at a portfolio level.

""One piece of a jigsaw does not give a full picture,"" said Sebastien Godinot, Senior Economist at the WWF European Policy Office.
""We need the taxonomy to contain different categories and cover all key sectors to clarify where we are now and accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy.""

This is the second pullback for Shopee this month, just several weeks after it exited the market in France and after India banned Seas Free Fire app. The ban wiped off $16 billion of Seas market value in a single day, prompting some investors to offload the company's shares.
Shopee said the pullback comes as a result of global market uncertainties and that the company will do its best to make the process as smooth as possible.
A few weeks ago, Sea said it expects Shopee's revenue growth to decline to roughly 76% in 2022, after seeing an outstanding 157% growth last year, due to weaker engagements and online purchases.
Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Goodridge sees the decision as a clear positive for SE as we have struggled to make the underlying unit economics work in the India market.
""We view this as a positive announcement for two key reasons: 1) Management has continued to demonstrate a flexible capital allocation process, where now the risk return on entering India is no longer attractive; and 2) it should help to control expanding ecommerce losses ... we have always struggled to make the unit economics for Shopee India work “ this is due to the very competitive landscape, Shopee's very low Average Order Value, and relatively high logistics costs. In our note Sea Ltd: Shopee Poland + Shopee India = More Upside, we highlighted that for Shopee to win ~5% GMV market it would cost up to ~US$900m in annual EBITDA losses. Hence, SE's no longer pursuing this strategy is a clear positive, in our view,"" Goodridge said in a client note.
The analyst finds the current companys market valuation as attractive.
UBS analyst Navin Killa also reflected positively on SEs decision, saying it may signal an improving discipline in cash burn.
""We believe the exit should be viewed positively by the market: 1) this supports management's commentary during FY21 earnings call that the company would take a more calibrated approach towards investments especially on international opportunities ex-ASEAN and Taiwan (with Brazil as the key focus); and 2) it removes the potential of high cash burn from competing with an ultra-competitive Indian e-commerce market with global and local giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Flipkart and JioMart,"" Killa wrote in a memo.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which also has a factory on the east side of the river, has suspended production for four days after it was unable to put in such a system, sources told Reuters on Monday.
Volkswagen Group China said its operations in Anting, Shanghai, were unaffected by the lockdown, adding that it is monitoring the situation day by day. 

Anting is in the west of Shanghai, where lockdown is scheduled to start on April 1. 
Volkswagen operations in the northeastern city of Changchun, however, remain suspended. Its production there has been halted since March 14 because of a COVID-19 lockdown.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, with news of a stock split by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) supporting a market that was otherwise burdened by rising bond yields and signs of an inflation-driven slowdown in consumer spending. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GM), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 156 points, or 0.5%, at 34,705 points. The broader S&P 500, however, was down less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
The most eye-catching early move was by Tesla stock, which gained 6.0% to its highest in over two months after the electric vehicle maker said it intends to split its stock, a move that typically makes it more attractive to small investors. To what extent that still holds in an age where electronic brokerages routinely offer fractional stocks isn't entirely clear. The news was, in any case, offset by the fact that Tesla's factory in Shanghai is set to remain shut this week due to rolling lockdowns imposed across the city of 25 million people. The factory currently produces just under 10,000 vehicles per week.
Over the last two weeks, stocks have made up more than all the losses they suffered in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - and then some. That's despite a sharp rise in bond yields that threatens to raise capital costs for the economy at large. A string of Federal Reserve officials last week hinted that they would have to accelerate their plans for raising interest rates in order to get inflation back under control.
Bond markets remained under pressure early Monday in New York, with short-dated yields continuing to rise, although longer-maturity yields eased on the back of growing confidence that the Fed won't fall any further behind the curve on inflation.
Inflation was behind one of the other main pieces of news from the weekend: the Japanese newspaper The Nikkei reported that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to cut production of its iPhone SE, AirPods and other hardware in response to weakening demand for products whose prices have always carried a substantial premium. Apple was, last week, reported to be looking at introducing subscription plans for hardware, another move that suggested that customers are starting to balk at high prices. 
Elsewhere, Poly (NYSE:POLY) stock rose 50% after HP (NYSE:HPQ) agreed to buy the maker of working-from-home apps in a deal worth $3.1 billion, including debt. 
Oil and gas stocks retreated as crude prices came off their recent highs in response to the news of Shanghai's lockdowns, which will ban private cars from the streets while they last. The lockdowns, while not as severe as those seen in China at the start of the pandemic, are emblematic of what is now a countrywide struggle with the less dangerous but more transmissible strains of COVID-19 that have developed since the first wave of the virus in Wuhan two years ago.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia and soaring energy costs are unlikely to get trillions of euros in state aid that businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic received because the impact is smaller, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager last week loosened state aid rules allowing firms to get up to 400,000 euros ($438,520) in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs after thousands of companies from airlines to automakers reported disruptions to their supply chains.
She told Reuters in an interview there was a big difference between the current situation caused by sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic when more businesses were hit by national lockdowns, and that would limit the amount of aid handed out this time.
""It's really early days, but I wouldn't think so,"" Vestager said, when asked whether European Union governments would end up again pumping trillions of euros into sanctions-hit companies.
""Because you don't have sort of this blanket state intervention in how the market works, you know, having the states coming in, the governments coming in and basically just telling everyone to hibernate,"" she said.
Vestager has so far approved more than 3 trillion euros ($3.29 trillion) in aid for pandemic-hit companies under relaxed rules adopted two years ago.
She reiterated that those rules will not be extended.
""The main part of the pandemic temporary framework is (for) that to end by mid year,"" she said.

Michaeli believes both Ford and GM will be able to maintain their 2022 EBIT guidance, based on the recent pricing data points. However, the analyst sees a greater risk at Ford due to the carmakers high dependence on stronger Q2-Q4 production and Europe exposure.
Even though the NT space remains fluid, Citi believes that certain mid-term implications could benefit pickup trucks and reinforce the earnings power for LT, as well as boost its SoP potential.
Michaeli maintained GM as the top pick, slightly lowering the price target from $100 to $95. The analyst also maintained its Neutral rating on Ford, slashing the target to $18 from $23.
The slashed PT for Ford reflects the estimate changes and lower target multiples that reflect risk tied to a more back-half loaded 2022 outlook plus incremental risk in Europe.
""While we do see relatively more NT risk at Ford given these factors, we are becoming more constructive on the longer-term story particularly after the companys updates from early March. To that, we still see LT upside potential above $30 on SoP,"" Michaeli said in a client note.

Tesla's share price fell nearly 38% from November highs to hit a multi-month low last month. Since the February 23 low, Tesla stock price has soared over 32% to return trading above the $1,000 handle.
Moreover, Tesla shares are up a further 6.5% in pre-open Monday on an announced stock split.
Sacconaghi noted that TSLA has been remarkably resilient amid a market pullback that hit growth stocks the most.
""Tesla's EPS estimates have climbed 30%, while traditional auto OEMs have fallen 8% - accordingly, on a relative basis, valuation have converged by ~ 40%. The same is true among other EV markers, where relative valuations have fallen by about 30% vs. traditional auto OEMs. So is the recent valuation change reflective of the broader market rotation, or are investors getting more comfortable with traditional auto OEMs future prospects and ability to compete in an EV world? The data supports the former, but there may be some modest fundamental compression in relative valuations as well,"" the analyst said in a client note.
Still, Tesla is valued at around $1.1 trillion by the market today, while Sacconaghi reminds investors that the14 largest traditional auto OEMs (who sell 99% of all cars, including 2% that are electric) have a collective market cap of $0.9T.
Hence, Tesla's market cap concentration (86% of the EV space, and 49% of the automotive space appears at odds with the fragmented and global nature of the auto market.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) shares rose on Monday as Italy's biggest telecoms company confirmed CVC's interest in taking a stake in its enterprise service arm, while it is also weighing a takeover approach for the group by KKR.
The CVC move comes as newly-appointed TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to split TIM's service business from its network operations as part of a broader strategy to revamp the former phone monopoly.
TIM said CVC proposed setting up an entity including connectivity operations for big corporate clients as well cloud, cybersecurity and IoT services, in which the European private equity firm would take a minority stake, confirming what sources told Reuters on Saturday..
TIM added in statement that its talks with U.S. fund KKR to assess the ""attractiveness, actuality and deliverability"" of its 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) approach for the group as a whole were ongoing.
Shares in TIM were up 3% on Monday at 0.34 euro after the stock hit a record low of 0.22 earlier this month. The price remains well below the 0.505 euro price at which the KKR approach was pitched late last year.
BOARD MEETING
The TIM board will have a first look at the CVC proposal at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday and also assess the state of play with the KKR approach.
KKR submitted its non-binding takeover proposal for TIM in November, having already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network last year.
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group ""untapped value"".
TIM, which is grappling with fierce competition in its domestic market, was hit by multiple downgrades by rating agencies this month after it unveiled a record annual loss and a weak outlook. 
Last week KKR said it remained interested in taking over TIM but also wants to discuss the phone group's own plans to combine its fixed line assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber.
While TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) billed KKR's proposal as too low, state lender CDP is advocating a tie-up of TIM's fixed network assets with those of Open Fiber to avoid a costly duplication of investment to upgrade the national network.

CDP, which owns a 10% holding in TIM, controls a 60% stake in the smaller rival fiber optic firm.
Sources have also said a compromise with KKR could be possible, whereby TIM seeks to deepen existing cooperation with the U.S. fund, involving it in its plans to split off its fixed network infrastructure and merge it with that of Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9106 euros)

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A deal between EU countries and EU lawmakers that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be agreed next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.
EU countries and EU lawmakers are now thrashing out the details, with debate over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.
""There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we're lucky, it may be possible,"" Vestager told Reuters in an interview.
Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation.
Vestager said there would be no extension as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.
""Well, actually both I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,"" she said.
""And since both the prohibitions and the obligations are things that come from established case law, I don't think any of them are sort of big surprises.""

Asked whether the DMA would cover non-U.S. tech giants, Vestager said: ""It's likely but I don't know.""
Observers said booking.com and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) may fall under the new rules.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's regulator is considering changes to stock market rules to increase competition for orders and improve deals for retail investors, according to its top official Gary Gensler and industry executives. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scrutinizing the practice of payment-for-order-flow (PFOF), in which wholesale market-markers pay brokers like TD Ameritrade, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets and E*Trade to route retail customer orders to them instead of to exchanges. The SEC review could lead to the biggest shake-up of U.S. equity market rules in over a decade.
Robinhood makes around 75% of its revenue from PFOF. The trading app and others say the practice on average gives retail investors a fractionally better deal than exchanges, allowing them to drop commissions and democratize investing.
Critics say payment for order flow can create conflicts of interest, and also encourages brokers to add video game-like bells and whistles to their apps and websites that prompt investors to trade more, which boosts the broker's profit but is rarely the best investment strategy. Britain, Canada and Australia have banned PFOF and Gensler suggested in August that the SEC could go that route. 
PFOF drew new scrutiny last year when an army of retail investors went on a buying spree of ""meme stocks"" like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that had shorted the shares. Many purchased the shares using commission-free brokers like Robinhood that accept PFOF from a few powerful market-makers.
The largest, Citadel Securities, says it controls 35% to 40% of all U.S. retail order flow. Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) controls about 25%, according to an analysis of SEC data by BestEx Research.
The SEC is exploring whether retail brokers are sending PFOF customer orders to the wholesaler paying them the most, rather than the venue that offers the best deal.
""When one party is paying a platform for the order flow, that can be in conflict with a retail customer getting best execution,"" SEC chair Gensler said in an interview. ""They're not getting order-by-order competition.""
Some brokers, like Fidelity, say they can get good stock prices for customers and offer free stock trading without accepting PFOF. 
A Robinhood spokeswoman pointed to a study by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors who found Robinhood customers enjoyed more than $8 billion in price improvements from 2020-2021 thanks to PFOF.
A spokesperson for TD Ameritrade said the current market structure delivers ""great outcomes"" for investors and the company supports efforts to make it even better. 
A PFOF ban is on the table, Gensler told Reuters, but he said the practice is also just a symptom of a broader problem: exchanges are not competing on an equal footing with the off-exchange market, where around 40%-50% of trading takes place.
The national benchmark for measuring the best deal is flawed because it does not include these off-exchange trades, he added. 
""Here's the focus around new market structure rules: How might we promote a more level playing field?,"" Gensler said. 
The SEC is also mulling making it easier for exchanges to compete with market-makers for orders by allowing exchanges to offer sub-penny pricing, and by changing the definition of ""best execution,"" said Gensler and other industry executives. 
Several executives said they doubted the SEC would actually ban PFOF. Virtu Financial CEO Doug Cifu said his firm would be one of many to challenge such a move in court.
""PFOF and rebates have really fostered incredible innovation and competition in the marketplace,"" Cifu told Reuters, adding that if the SEC bans the practice ""they are looking at a very long fight."" 
He and other industry executives said the SEC should enhance retail brokers' disclosures so small investors are better informed on the pros and cons of PFOF. Gensler said the SEC was also reviewing disclosures. 
""As long as it is transparent and disclosed, I don't see a conflict,"" said Kirsten Wegner, CEO of the Modern Markets Initiative which represents automated trading firms.
COMPETITIVE BOOST
Investor advocates support better disclosures and also want to boost exchanges' competitiveness to improve the reliability of the national pricing benchmark, known as the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). 
Current ""best execution"" rules require retail brokers to route customer orders to a venue offering the best price displayed on the exchange, or better, and market-makers typically improve on the best price by a fraction of a cent.
Exchanges cannot offer sub-penny quotes, but the SEC is considering allowing it. It is also mulling a rule, similar to one in Canada, requiring retail brokers to execute orders on an exchange unless the off-exchange price is significantly better, said Dave Lauer, CEO of financial platform Urvin Finance, and one other industry source with knowledge of the SEC's thinking.
Wholesalers provide a 15% improvement on the NBBO spread, but moving retail flow to exchanges would narrow NBBO spreads by 25%, according to research by Hitesh Mittal, CEO of BestEx Research. 
""Institutional investors and market makers would better compete with exchanges for retail flow by narrowing the bid offer spread,"" he said. 

Ty Gellasch, executive director of investor trade Healthy Markets who has also discussed the issue with the SEC, said he expects the agency to clarify that ""best execution"" requires brokers to obtain the best available price rather than a fractional price improvement. 
""I expect it will say to the industry: 'you have to give the customers the best prices,'"" he said.

Investing.com – Meituan stock (HK:3690) closed nearly 12% higher in Hong Kong trading Monday after its fourth-quarter revenue came in ahead of estimates.
The company followed its results with a positive commentary, saying it aimed to improve profitability by cutting back on the financial incentives that it provides to users.
“Despite obvious top-down challenges (Omicron, macro), Meituan management struck a confident tone on Friday’s calls, noting that activity levels tended to recover quickly after lockdowns ended (e.g., citing evidence in Shenzhen in recent days),” Bloomberg quoted Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu as writing in a note.
Meituan “pointed to plans for a meaty cut in food-delivery user incentives this year, and focusing on mid- and high-frequency users as drivers of business growth,” Zhu wrote in the note.
Meituan, whose services also include restaurant reviews and bike-sharing, said revenue rose to 49.52 billion yuan ($7.78 billion) in the final three months of 2021, up about 31%.
Heavy capex, including in its community e-commerce unit Meituan Select, more than doubled Meituan’s quarterly loss to 5.34 billion yuan with CEO Wang Xing telling analysts that he expects its operating loss to narrow in 2022.
Meituan is among the several Chinese tech platforms battling the government’s heightened scrutiny of their trade practices. Authorities have called upon food delivery firms to pay more to their drivers and cap the commission they charge restaurants.
According to Reuters, the company has committed to lowering the commission charged to some merchants.
Meituan's food delivery-related cost, which includes paying delivery riders, rose over 38% to 68.18 billion yuan.

Revenue at the group, which owns U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork processor, grew 6.7% in 2021 to $27.29 billion, according to a company filing. 
Profit before biological fair value adjustments rose after low hog prices reduced product costs in China while higher sales and a reduction in COVID-19 related expenses in the U.S. outweighed an increase in raw material costs, the company said. 
WH Group reported a 1.3% rise in the sales of packaged meats, its core business, to 3.32 million tonnes in 2021.
Sales volume in China, however, dropped by 1.6% in a consumer market lacking growth momentum. 
Hog prices in China plunged last year as farmers rebuilt herds after an epidemic of African swine fever but COVID-19 outbreaks dampened demand. 
WH Group told reporters that Chinese hog prices would remain low in the first half of 2022 before rising in the second half. Most analysts expect prices to remain low this year.
Rising commodity prices and production costs would remain a challenge it said, with its import and export business also affected by the pandemic - one executive noted longer shipment cycles and customs processes and higher costs. 
WH Group's China business Shuanghui Development reported a 22.2% fall in net profit to 4.87 billion yuan ($764.69 million) on lower hog and meat prices, and said profit from frozen products and pork imports had dropped considerably. 
Shuanghui was recently forced to apologise after a local media investigation uncovered food safety issues at one of its plants.

WH Group last year removed executive director Wan Hongjian, chairman Wan Long's son, citing untrue allegations he made against the company.

(Reuters) - SpaceX has ended production of new Crew Dragon astronaut capsules, a company executive told Reuters, as Elon Musk's space transportation company heaps resources on its next-generation spaceship program. 
Capping the fleet at four Crew Dragons adds more urgency to the development of the astronaut capsule's eventual successor, Starship, SpaceX's moon and Mars rocket. Starship's debut launch has been delayed for months by engine development hurdles and regulatory reviews.
It also poses new challenges as the company learns how to maintain a fleet and quickly fix unexpected problems without holding up a busy schedule of astronaut missions. 
""We are finishing our final (capsule), but we still are manufacturing components, because we'll be refurbishing,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters, confirming the plan to end Crew Dragon manufacturing.
She added that SpaceX would retain the capability to build more capsules if a need arises in the future, but contended that ""fleet management is key.""
Musk's business model is underpinned by reusable spacecraft, so it was inevitable the company would cease production at some point. But the timing was not known, nor was his strategy of using the existing fleet for its full backlog of missions. 
Crew Dragon has flown five crews of government and private astronauts to space since 2020, when it flew its first pair of NASA astronauts and became the U.S. space agency's primary ride for getting humans to and from the International Space Station.
After each flight, the capsules undergo refurbishment at SpaceX facilities in Florida, which the company calls ""Dragonland.""
""There's lifetime cycle issues, where once you start using it the third, fourth, fifth time, you start finding different things,"" said retired NASA astronaut and former SpaceX executive Garrett Reisman, who now consults for the company on human spaceflight matters. 
""SpaceX is really good about identifying these issues quickly and then acting quickly to fix them,"" Reisman added, pointing to an investigation in 2021 in which SpaceX discovered and fixed within months a toilet leak aboard a Crew Dragon capsule that had flown humans twice. 
NASA has given SpaceX some $3.5 billion to help develop and subsequently use Crew Dragon for six flights to the space station. It added three more missions to fill in for delays with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's Starliner capsule.
SpaceX has flown four crews of astronauts to the space station under its NASA contract at roughly $255 million per flight. The company carried out a fully private mission last year with four passengers, including a billionaire entrepreneur who funded the flight, for a three-day trip in Earth orbit.
At least four more private astronaut missions on Crew Dragon are planned with Houston-based space station builder and spaceflight manager Axiom Space, with the first so-called Ax-1 mission scheduled for April carrying four entrepreneurs to the space station to conduct scientific research.
Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, has focused intensely in recent years on the company's hasty development of a re-usable Starship, the centerpiece of Musk's aim to eventually colonize Mars. 
Like Crew Dragon, SpaceX's workhorse reusable rocket, the Falcon 9, and its more powerful variant Falcon Heavy are also refurbished after each flight, and not every component is able to fly to space more than once.

""The goal is to get more and more like aircraft operations, where you can take the vehicle after it lands, fill it back up with gas and oxygen, and go again very rapidly,"" Reisman said.
""Starship, if it achieves its design objectives, would be able to affordably replace everything that Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon can do.""

The analyst is bearish on key fundamentals, while the growing competitive intensity and pessimism around the US McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) partnership have also contributed to Lavery moving to Underweight. He reminds investors that BYND is still burning cash with no clear path to positive EBITDA.
It remains committed to lowering prices below that of animal protein (despite current inflation) by 2024, which likely drives prices down more than it lifts volumes. A nationwide MCD launch the headline impact we had anticipated, as skepticism around its in-market performance likely overshadows the news itself (and an LTO looks more likely than a permanent item), Lavery said in a client note.
The lowered price target reflects lower 2022E and 2023E sales, in addition to the lowered EV/Sales multiple to reflect the company's growth, profitability, and balance sheet.
The analyst also shared key findings from Pipers survey, which showed that 31% of respondents said they would try plant-based meat if it were cheaper than animal meat.
With Beyond's historical ~45% repeat rate, this would imply ~15% volume lift. We would also expect a small lift in increased consumption by current users, but that plus the lift from new consumers would still not be enough to offset the large price cuts, resulting in a potentially large net sales decline, the analyst concludes.
Beyond Meat stock price closed at $48.63 on Friday.

(Reuters) - TPG Inc said on Monday its fourth-quarter after-tax distributable earnings rose 34% year-on-year, driven by strong asset sales across its portfolio of private equity, impact investment, growth equity, and real estate assets.
The performance of many private equity firms were boosted by a record-breaking year of deal-making in 2021, buoyed by buoyant public markets, the availability of cheap capital owing to low interest rates, and economic recovery from COVID-19 pandemic.
TPG's peers Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc all reported record fourth quarter earnings as the firms sold off assets for top dollar last year.
The Forth Worth, Texas-based firm said its after-tax distributable earnings, which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to $137 million from a $102 million a year earlier. 
Its after-tax distributable earnings slightly exceeded the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $133 million for the fourth quarter, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
TPG said it generated $7 billion from asset divestments across its portfolio in the quarter and spent $8 billion for new acquisitions, mostly in its private equity and real estate businesses. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, TPG reported a 46% drop in net income to $326 million, owing to a slowdown in revenue from capital allocation activities. TPG said it ended the quarter with $114 billion in assets under management and $28.4 billion in unspent capital. 
Buyout firms face a more challenging year in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates to combat inflation and is expected to begin unwinding its bond-buying program, thus ending the era of easy financing for leveraged buyouts. 
TPG said it still expects to capitalize on opportunities to invest in the current climate, particularly among growth-oriented companies that are shelving or postposting plans to go public amid a slowdown in stock market valuations.
""The IPO and SPAC markets are essentially shut down right now, particularly across the growth investing landscape, and we think it creates more opportunity for us because they are competitors to private equity as companies look for sources of capital,"" TPG Chief Executive Officer Jon Winkelried said in an interview.

""We're looking to be capital partners with really interesting strong companies but in the private markets.""
TPG made its stock market debut in January after raising $1.1 billion from an initial public offering that valued the firm at $9 billion.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - As Rio de Janeiro residents sheltered at home last year during the deadliest phase of Brazil's COVID-19 outbreak, police detective Gabriel Ferrando said he got a tip that something suspicious was upending local internet service.
Access had vanished across broad swaths of Morro da Formiga, or Ant Hill, a tough neighborhood on the city's north side. When Ferrando quizzed a technician from broadband provider TIM SA tasked with fixing the outage, the worker, whom he declined to name, said armed men had chased him away with a warning not to return.
Turns out a new internet provider had claimed this turf: a company whose investors at one time included an accused drug and arms trafficker with alleged ties to Brazil's notorious Red Command crime syndicate, according to Ferrando, court documents filed by authorities and business registration records viewed by Reuters. Using stolen equipment, some of it pilfered from TIM, the newcomers soon had their own internet service up and running, Ferrando said. Residents could sign up with the new firm, he said - or do without. 
TIM, a unit of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA, declined to comment, referring all inquiries to Brazil's telecom industry association Conexis. In a statement, the group called on the nation's law enforcement to act to protect legitimate operators.
Ferrando, a veteran of Rio's top organized crime unit, is trying to do just that. In a sealed report documenting months of investigation, he asked Rio state prosecutors in February to pursue charges against the purported pirates. The prosecutors' office did not respond to a request for comment. No charges have been filed. 
Morro da Formiga isn't the only community reporting troubles. Reuters interviewed nearly two dozen telecom industry executives, law enforcement officials, technicians, academics and internet customers in Brazil, and reviewed thousands of pages of court filings submitted by police.
The people and documents described an audacious takeover of internet service in dozens of neighborhoods in Brazil's major cities by companies associated with alleged criminals unafraid to use force and intimidation to push out rivals. The result, these sources said, is that tens of thousands of Brazilians now depend on unreliable, second-rate broadband networks estimated by industry and law enforcement officials to be generating millions of dollars annually for purported crooks.
Bootleg providers can be unresponsive when service crashes and impatient when a bill is missed, some customers told Reuters. In Rio's working-class Campo Grande neighborhood, a resident described how someone knocks on his door monthly to collect 35 reais ($6.80) - in cash.
There's ""pressure to pay on the day that they choose with no delay,"" said the customer, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. 
It's a reliable revenue stream made all the more lucrative by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced families online for school, work and shopping. In 2020 alone, the proportion of Brazilian households with an internet connection grew by more than 12 percentage points to 83%, according to the most recent data available from Cetic.br, an information technology organization.
Pirates are plundering equipment and infrastructure, too, much of it re-purposed for their makeshift networks, authorities and telecom executives said. Theft and destruction of telecommunications gear rose 34% in 2020 from 2019, representing about 1 billion reais ($194 million) in direct annual losses, according to Feninfra, an industry group whose members include installers and repair workers. It said that figure rose another 16% in the first half of 2021. 
THE ALLEGED SCHEME
Brazil's telecom industry is not alone in its struggles. Crime groups for years have controlled distribution of cooking gas, jugs of drinking water and other basics in many low-income urban neighborhoods.
But by building their own broadband networks, Brazil's criminals are raising their sophistication, according to more than 20 technicians, industry representatives and law enforcement officials interviewed by Reuters. They said the scheme typically works like this:
First, thieves steal or vandalize equipment belonging to traditional broadband operators. When repair teams arrive, they are menaced by armed men who warn them not to come back. Last year in Rio alone, no-go zones rose to 105 locations for  Oi  SA (OTC:OIBRQ), one of Brazil's largest internet providers. That figure has quadrupled since 2019, according to data supplied by the company.
Shortly after service is interrupted, telecom companies associated with organized crime groups set up their own networks, piggybacking on existing infrastructure. In some cases, these outfits are run directly by members of drug trafficking gangs including the Red Command or the Pure Third Command, one of its main rivals. Others are run by militias – a type of criminal outfit composed of retired and off-duty cops. In other cases, they are operated by businessmen who pay kickbacks to gangsters to clear out the competition.
Often the interlopers receive help from crooked employees of major providers who sell them expertise and pilfered gear, according to Rio state prosecutor Antonio Pessanha. He told Reuters he's investigating criminal activity in the telecom sector in and around Rio city, the state's capital.
In one recent case, an employee of Claro, the local unit of Mexico's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) SAB de CV, offered to sell company equipment to organized crime associates, according to a recorded phone call that Pessanha said his office obtained through a court-approved wiretap. He did not specify what criminal organization the people in the call were allegedly affiliated with, nor did he identify the Claro employee or the other participants. The investigation is ongoing, and Reuters was not provided access to the recording.
Claro declined to comment on the alleged incident. 
NEW PLAYER IN ANT HILL
In Morro da Formiga, detective Ferrando said he began receiving anonymous tips from some of its roughly 5,000 residents in the first half of 2021 who said broadband services provided by major operators had stopped working.
One company dominates there now, Ferrando said, a firm named JPConnect Servicos de Telecomunicacoes. It was established in 2019, according to corporate registration documents filed with the Rio government and seen by Reuters.
Those records show that until late last year JPConnect was part-owned by an individual named Paulo Cesar Souza dos Santos Jr., whom authorities allege is a member of Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, Rio's largest organized criminal group. In 2011, Rio state prosecutors indicted dos Santos for drug and weapons trafficking, according to court records viewed by Reuters. He was later acquitted. 
Dos Santos transferred his 50% stake in JPConnect in September 2021 to another investor, Alexandre Rodrigues de Almeida, according to the registration documents. 
In January, police officers searched JPConnect's headquarters in Morro da Formiga, according to Ferrando. He said the cops found equipment belonging to TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil (NYSE:VIV) SA, the local unit of Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) SA. All of those companies declined to comment on Ferrando's allegations.
The JPConnect investigation hasn't been previously reported. Authorities haven't filed charges in the case. Reuters could not reach officials at JPConnect. The company's registered telephone number is not functioning. 
Dos Santos and Almeida declined to comment through their lawyer. Their attorney, Eberthe Vieira de Souza Gomes, said JPConnect operates legally and had gained market share by offering a quality product. He said dos Santos has no connection to any criminal organization, pointing out that his client was acquitted of all charges related to his 2011 indictment. Reuters confirmed dos Santos' acquittal via Rio state court documents. Those documents did not specify the year of his acquittal.
TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil referred questions to Conexis, the telecom trade association. In an interview, Marcos Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), the group's president, described a litany of woes facing Brazil's industry generally, including vandalism, theft, threats to employees and hijacking of service areas by players with suspected ties to the underworld.
Authorities must ""inhibit this type of criminal action,"" Ferrari said.
In greater Rio there are several other broadband operators under investigation for allegedly rough tactics and links to purported criminals, authorities said.
Among them is Net&Com, which made headlines in March 2021 when Rio police raided its downtown headquarters as part of a broader probe into an alleged drug ring. Police have publicly stated that they are investigating the firm for allegedly paying criminals associated with the Red Command to help them take over the telecoms market in poor neighborhoods throughout metropolitan Rio.
More than three dozen people, including purported members of the Red Command, last year were charged with drug and weapons trafficking and conspiracy, according to court documents filed by Rio prosecutors and viewed by Reuters. They are currently on trial and have maintained their innocence.
In documents laying out the government's case, authorities alleged the ring also profited by accepting kickbacks from Net&Com to chase telecom competitors out of neighborhoods where the company now operates. Net&Com and its executives have not been charged.
Pedro Santiago, a lawyer for Net&Com, said the company was an upstanding operator that had been the ""victim of a witch hunt."" Santiago said he had reviewed many hours of police wiretaps and that these showed no link between the firm and any criminal elements.
Police dispute that characterization in court documents seen by Reuters, citing as evidence allegedly stolen equipment and conversations among co-conspirators mentioning the alleged role of Net&Com.

Pessanha, the Rio state prosecutor, said the investigation continues.
""The new gold for the criminal underworld,"" he said, ""is the internet.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nearly 60% of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shareholders voted last week against a plan to spin off its devices business, a breakdown of the vote showed.
A separate call from activist shareholder 3D Investment Partners for a private equity buyout was rejected by just short of 55% of shareholders who voted. Both proposals needed 50% of the vote to pass at last Thursday's extraordinary meeting.
With the two competing proposals both voted down, the Japanese conglomerate is left to seek alternatives, potentially focusing on new CEO Taro Shimada's plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware.

There was widespread opposition to the management-backed plan to spin off the devices business, including from Toshiba's three biggest shareholders and proxy shareholder advisory firms.
The proposal from 3D, Toshiba's second-biggest shareholder with a stake of more than 7%, had the backing of other activist shareholders but proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had advised against it.

The company plans to produce 20% fewer iPhone SEs - or about 2 million to 3 million units - next quarter than originally planned, the report said. It added that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also reduced 2022 orders for AirPods by more than 10 million units.
Apple, whose shares were down about 2% in premarket trading, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The news of weaker demand mirrors forecasts from analysts who have warned that COVID-19 lockdowns in Chinese cities and a surge in inflation due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand this year.
Apple, in particular, faces challenges from the lack of a design upgrade for the latest SE and a $30 increase in its price from the 2020 model, analysts have said. 
Ming-Chi Kuo at TF International Securities on Monday slashed his shipment estimate for iPhone SE this year to between 15 million and 20 million units, from 25 million to 30 million units previously.

""It looks very similar to the iPhone SE (2020), a second refurbishment of the iPhone 8, and it is even less likely to arouse consumer demand,"" Taiwan-based Isaiah Research analyst Eddie Han said, cutting his forecast sales for the model by 5 million units. 
Apple is expected to launch a brand new iPhone lineup later this year, but analysts say it was too early to forecast any impact on the upcoming range.

The Cupertino, California-based company plans to reduce output of iPhone SEs by about 20% next quarter compared with its original plan because of signs that consumer-electronics demand is being hurt by the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, Nikkei reported, citing unidentified people. The company told multiple suppliers it was lowering production orders by 2 million to 3 million units for the quarter, according to the report.
Apple this month updated its iPhone SE line for the first time since 2020 and added 5G network support, possibly in an effort to persuade consumers with older iPhones to upgrade and lure Android users.

The company has notified its workers and suppliers of the move, the people said. 
It initially attempted to create a closed loop to continue production and called workers in on Sunday, one of the sources said. However, it allowed them to leave that evening after it decided it did not have enough provisions for them, the source added. 
Tesla declined to comment on whether production had been suspended. In a statement to Reuters it said that it always strived to fulfil its epidemic prevention responsibilities and that it believed Shanghai's COVID-19 measures helped lay the foundation for the city's future development. 
Shanghai said on Sunday it would lock down the city in two stages to carry out COVID-19 testing over nine days. 
Authorities said they would divide Shanghai in two for the exercise, using the Huangpu River that passes through the city as a guide. 
The Tesla factory is in the Lingang district of Pudong new area, which is part of Shanghai's first lockdown stage. Its lockdown started early on Monday and is scheduled to last until Friday morning.
Tesla had already in mid-March suspended production at the Shanghai factory for two days after the city rolled out strict movement controls and carried out mass testing.

Its Shanghai factory produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub to Germany and Japan. It delivered 56,515 vehicles in February, including 33,315 for export, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
That amounts to an average of about 2,018 vehicles a day.

The suit, made to the European Union's General Court, was filed on March 23, a Hyundai spokesperson said.
Hyundai argued that regulators in other regions had accepted the shipbuilding industry was a market controlled by shipowners' orders and preferences, not market share, and so the proposed takeover did not hurt competition, the spokesperson said.

Investing.com – Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock traded 1.8% lower in premarket Monday on reports the company could cut the output of its iPhone and AirPods devices as the Ukraine crisis and looming inflation weigh on demand for consumer electronics.
According to a report in The Nikkei, the company plans to make about 20% fewer iPhone SEs next quarter, or lower production orders by about 2 million to 3 million units than originally planned, due to weaker-than-expected demand, Nikkei said.
The world’s most valued company has also reduced orders for its AirPods wireless headphones by more than 10 million units for the current year as lukewarm demand calls for trimming of inventories, the newspaper said.
The earlier 4G iPhone SE accounted for 12% of total iPhone sales from its launch in the second quarter of 2020 until the end of 2021, with Japan being the biggest market after the U.S., according to data and intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.
The report said the company has also asked suppliers to make a couple of million fewer units of the entire iPhone 13 range than previously planned, attributing this to seasonal demand.",,,

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Bill Gates-backed Heliogen has secured funding from top Australian oil and gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum for a full-scale trial of its concentrated-solar-power (CSP) technology ahead of a planned push into Australia.
Aiming to invest $5 billion in new-energy products by 2030, Woodside has also agreed to buy a stake in Heliogen, the two companies said on Monday. They did not state the size of Woodside's planned stake or the price.
Technologies such as Heliogen's use mirrors to concentrate solar energy from a large area, creating intense heat for industrial processes or generating electricity.
Heliogen, now valued at $968 million, went public in January, positioning it to begin making mirrors and other equipment for its modules. Gates was an early investor in the company.
Woodside will fund Heliogen's first full-scale, 5 megawatt module at a site in the Mojave desert. The U.S. government is contributing $39 million to cover the undisclosed cost.
""As soon as we finish this first demonstration in California, we want a blitz in Australia as fast as possible,"" Heliogen founder and chief executive Bill Gross told Reuters in an interview, giving no timeframe for completing the trial.
Woodside could potentially use Heliogen's CSP for its own operations and to produce hydrogen for export, Gross said. It could also market the modules to Australian mining companies and other remote energy users.
""Our collaboration with Heliogen on this innovative technology supports our commitment to building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio,"" Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said.
Gross estimated a mine would need between 100 and 1,000 of the 5 megawatt modules.
""If we build it at that scale, it will be cheaper than the fossil fuel they (the mines) burn, and, of course, it'll have no CO2 emissions,"" he said.
Heliogen's system uses thousands of mirrors controlled by smart software to precisely reflect sunlight to a 2.5 metre-diameter receiver on a tower, generating temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees C (1,800 degrees F).

Air heated by the receiver is stored in rocks or sand in an insulated tank. The heat can be used in industries such as those making cement or steel or to drive a turbine to generate electricity, which can then be used to power an electrolyser to make hydrogen.
The system costs less than rival CSP technology as it is smaller and quicker to build, Gross said. Each mirror is as big as a flat-screen TV, rather than a tennis court.

(Reuters) -Canadian vaccine maker Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine, approved last month in Canada, is facing limited growth in the near-term after the World Health Organization said it would not review the vaccine because the company is partly owned by U.S.-Swiss tobacco company Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), health experts say.
The WHO said at a briefing this month and in a follow-up statement to Reuters that it has not accepted an application for the vaccine because of its 2005 public health treaty requiring no involvement with any company that produces or promotes tobacco-based products.
Canada, which has provided millions of dollars in development funding to the company and has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses, defended its authorization of the vaccine, saying it needs a domestic bio-manufacturing industry to prepare for future pandemics. 
Health Canada said it believes it is in compliance with the WHO tobacco treaty.
The WHO tobacco treaty ""does not preclude the Government of Canada from working with Medicago on vaccine development and procurement to ensure that a ready and effective supply of vaccines is available for its population,"" a Health Canada spokesperson told Reuters.
Experts say a WHO authorization is key because the vaccine can then be part of the COVAX global vaccine program for low- and middle-income countries. While much of the developed world has already been vaccinated, Africa is still in desperate need of vaccines. WHO's approval can also stand in for countries that do not have their own drug regulatory agencies. 
The company has also pitched the platform as easily adaptable for new vaccines should there be a next pandemic. It is developing flu vaccines on the platform as well.
""I think that the WHO standards are going to pose a barrier to the uptake of the vaccine,"" said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Medicago would now need to approach European and U.S. regulators as well as any other individual countries one by one to attain approvals, a more difficult but not impossible barrier to use, Adalja said.
GLOBAL CUSTOMER BASE 
Medicago said it is in discussions with other potential customers worldwide.
The company has started the filing process for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Medicago Chief Executive Officer Takashi Nagao said in an emailed statement. 
The company has also started an early-to-mid stage study of the shot in Japan, and plans to file for regulatory approval in the spring, Nagao said.
It said it has not received an official communication from the WHO, but believed the decision was linked to its minority shareholder and not the safety and efficacy profile of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Swiss-American tobacco giant Philip Morris owns a 21% stake in the Quebec company. Japan's Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a unit of Mitsubishi Chemical Holding Corp, owns the rest of Medicago. 
Canadian health group Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control this week called on Canada to demand that Medicago replace Philip Morris as a stakeholder due to its tobacco business. Philip Morris has had a stake in the company since 2008.
A Philip Morris spokesperson said that the WHO's position was in opposition to its own call to accelerate vaccinations around the world. 
""Emergency use authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine has absolutely nothing to do with tobacco control,"" the spokesperson said. ""WHO policies should focus on accelerating medical progress and innovation."" 

Medicago’s Covifenz is the only authorized COVID-19 vaccine that is plant-based. To make the vaccine, the company uses nicotiana benthamiana, a cousin of the tobacco plant, as small bioreactors, growing non-infectious virus like particles that mimic the coronavirus. It is given with a boosting compound from British drugmaker  Glaxosmithkline  (LON:GSK). 
The United States and Europe, which already have several vaccines cleared for use, may still want Medicago's shot because of its plant-based technology, which would be useful to create a vaccine against the next problematic pathogen, according to Prashant Yadav, lecturer and supply chain expert at Harvard Medical School.

Investing.com – Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stock traded 2.7% higher Monday in Frankfurt after reports that Singapore’s Temasek, a long-term investor, is calling for the removal of Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann.
Temasek has had longstanding concerns about Bayer’s operating performance under Baumann and the company’s lack of succession planning, grievances the state investor has communicated to the company, Bloomberg said.
According to the report, among the options Temasek is considering ahead of the shareholder meeting next month are requesting a no-confidence vote in Baumann or voting against ratifying the performance of the management. Either step would significantly raise pressure on Bayer’s board to rejig the leadership.
Temasek’s activist-type approach is rare for the firm. It built a roughly 4% stake in the German company in 2018, helping Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) complete the controversial $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON). The deal, championed by Baumann, has cost the company billions of dollars in litigation amid charges that Monsanto’s product Roundup causes cancer.
Swiss investor Alatus has already objected to ratifying the performance of Baumann and his management team at Bayer’s April 29 meeting, pointing to a significant loss in market value during his tenure. Bayer shares have lost 39% since the Monsanto deal closed but are up 29% so far this year, according to Bloomberg.
Alatus, whose letter has been posted on Bayer’s website, said the company has failed to lay out a strategy that produces long-term growth for the crop science and pharmaceutical divisions. It also called for allowing shareholders to vote on members of Bayer’s management team individually at the meeting, rather than collectively.
Investor frustration with leadership could also trigger Bayer to revisit calls to break itself up into agriculture, pharmaceutical, and consumer healthcare units."

(Reuters) -Britain's Ted Baker said on Monday it had rejected two unsolicited takeover proposals from private-equity firm Sycamore Partners Management as they significantly undervalued the fashion retailer.
The company said the back-to-back proposals from New York-based Sycamore failed to ""compensate shareholders for the significant upside that can be delivered by Ted Baker as a listed company"".
Takeover interest in British companies is at its highest in years as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain's exit from the European Union have led to a steep drop in valuations. 
Sycamore had raised its proposal for Ted Baker to 137.5 pence per share on March 22, valuing the retailer at 253.8 million pounds ($333.65 million), after its initial proposal of 130 pence per share was turned down by the British group.
The revised proposal represents a premium of nearly 40% over Ted Baker's closing price on March 17, when the Sycamore approach was first reported. 
Sycamore, which has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed company, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Ted Baker's shares were down 3.3% at 122 pence as of 0930 GMT after the upmarket retailer disclosed the proposals. 
""It’s unsurprising that management’s not keen to give up the reins after a few difficult years,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""We’re finally starting to see some green shoots from the group’s turnaround efforts now that formal occasions are back on the social calendar."" 
Ted Baker is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it aims to boost savings and strengthen its online presence.
The group had faced setbacks, including profit warnings, management changes and an accounting scandal, since founder Ray Kelvin stepped down in 2019 amid misconduct allegations, which he denies. 
The coronavirus crisis compounded difficulties, as lockdowns and restrictions hammered retail operations and forced the company to cut hundreds of jobs.

The group's shares, which traded as high as 30 pounds in 2015, have since crashed to trade at 1.26 pounds as of Friday's close.

Investing.com --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) shares fell 3.7% by mid-morning in London on Monday after the U.K. bank warned it would take a hit to earnings due to having issued too many structured notes.
The bank said it expects a net charge against earnings of 450 million pounds ($590 million), and a drop of nearly 30 basis points in its core tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength closely tracked by regulators and investors.
Barclays also said it would delay the launch of its 1 billion pound share buyback as a result. It had announced that plan on February 23rd.
Structured notes are complex debt products that banks often tailor to meet the specific needs of certain fixed-income clients. Because of their complexity, regulators, buyers and the banks' risk management departments all have an incentive to keep the amount of such debt under firm limits.
In 2019, Barclays had tried to limit its issuance to $5 billion, but ended up registering $20.8 billion in maximum aggregate offering terms as of August 2019.
A statement by Barclays didn't explain how the error had happened, nor why it has taken nearly three years to uncover it."

(Reuters) - AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron said the movie-theater chain would embark on more ""transformational"" deals to capitalize on the interest of retail investors following its bet on a troubled gold and silver mine operator. 
AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment for a 22% stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp about two weeks ago, an unusual deal for a company operating more than 900 theaters worldwide that raised eyebrows among market observers. 
AMC's investment called upon a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" it raised in 2021 by selling its shares in the open market, in part on the back of retail investors who turned it into a popular 'meme' stock. 
Aron said in a phone interview from a limousine in Los Angeles en route to the Academy Awards on Sunday that AMC's investment in Hycroft had done well from the start. AMC bought Hycroft shares at $1.07, and they were trading at $1.32 last week.
""I'd like to think there will be more third-party external M&A announcements going forward where AMC can reach for the stars and intriguing investments that have potentially attractive returns,"" Aron told Reuters. 
AMC's stock in mid-March had fallen to around $14 but rebounded to more than $20 following the Hycroft investment.
Hycroft, which was on the verge of bankruptcy prior to a cash infusion from AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott, said on Friday it had subsequently raised nearly $195 million through open-market stock sales as other investors followed Aron's lead.
Aron said he expects AMC's investment, which includes shares and warrants, to be ""lucrative."" The deal was disclosed March 15, the day after Aron's tour of the company's mining operations in Northern Nevada outside Winnemucca, not far from the site of the annual Burning Man arts and music festival. 
Some analysts questioned AMC's investment, expressing concern that the bet is far afield from the company's core competency and wondering whether the money could be better spent repaying the chain's debt, which exceeded $5 billion at the end of 2021.
""TRANSFORMATIONAL M&A""
Aron defended the bet on Hycroft in the Reuters interview, arguing that it drew on AMC's own experience skirting bankruptcy less than two years ago, and pointing out that it had the support of retail investors. 
""Transformational M&A is mandatory. Our shareholder base has given us capital to deploy with the clear expectation that we are ... going to do exciting things with the money they entrusted to us,"" Aron said.
He added that the nearly $28 million investment was small relative to AMC's total cash, and that the company would still strengthen and expand its core business. He cited AMC's recent acquisition of former Arclight and Pacific cinema locations, and said the company had plans to add more premium screens at existing theaters and retire some of its debt. 
Aron said Hycroft is a company with solid assets that faced a liquidity crisis that reminded him of AMC's dire straits not long ago. Sprott's involvement buoyed Aron's confidence, he said.
""While the Hycroft investment is pretty far from home, it does rely on a core competency of our company to understand balance sheets, and raising cash, and solving liquidity problems,"" Aron said. 
SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK
New deals will not necessarily be so out of the mainstream for AMC, Aron said, pointing to the company's recent decision to launch a co-branded credit card and its move to sell branded popcorn at retail establishments. 
The common denominator, he said, will be feedback from shareholders. He now tweets nearly once a day and follows about 2,500 AMC retail investors on the social-media website. 
Aron's tweets have been read more than 200 million times since April, he said. He added he has also hosted sneak previews of films for some of these investors, and expects to do perhaps a dozen more of them this year. On earnings calls, AMC now takes questions from retail investors in addition to securities analysts. 

That's a shift from the traditional conference calls and road shows that companies have relied upon for communicating with institutional shareholders. 
""What's different is not the need to communicate with shareholders. What's different is who the shareholders are,"" Aron said.

“Recessions don’t typically start ahead of the curve inverting, and the lead-lag could be very substantial, as long as 2 years,” the strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. “Further, over this timeframe equities tended to beat bonds handsomely,” they said, adding that the peak in equity markets historically takes place around a year after the inversion.
U.S. stocks are on course for their best month this year, braving the war in Ukraine and the prospect of more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation. While a spike in commodity prices has raised concerns about the economic outlook, exacerbating the steepest bond rout of the modern era, equities have so far remained largely immune to recession jitters. 
“Recessions only started on average 16 months after the inversion in the spread, and never before,” JPMorgan strategists said. As the 10-year-2-year curve “is not outright inverted at present, the clock has not started ticking yet,” and “equities still offer supportive risk-reward over the medium term,” according to the note.
A growing number of money managers are betting equity indexes have already largely priced in bearish bond moves, while all signs suggest the U.S. economy remains in decent health. Some contrarian buy signals are now emerging. Bank of America’s Bull & Bear Indicator is flashing buy on equities for the first time since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.
To be sure, not everyone is so sanguine.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists led by Michael Wilson said Monday that headwinds to growth from the Fed’s policy shift, high inflation and the war in Ukraine “are not priced.” The equity risk premium should be higher, they said, downgrading U.S. financials to neutral from overweight.
