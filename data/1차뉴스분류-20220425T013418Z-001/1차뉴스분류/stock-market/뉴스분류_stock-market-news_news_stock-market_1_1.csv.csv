SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal judge has ruled that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's 2018 tweets about having secured financing to take the company private were false, according to court filings by Tesla investors suing the billionaire over the tweets.
The filing said that the court ruled April 1 that Musk's 2018 tweets were ""false and misleading."" The court ""held that he recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity,"" it said.
Investors in the electric car maker asked in the filing, submitted on Friday, for U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen to block the celebrity entrepreneur from his ""public campaign to present a contradictory and false narrative regarding"" his 2018 tweets.
Musk on Thursday claimed that funding actually had been secured to take Tesla private in 2018. He settled with U.S. securities regulators over what the agency found to be false statements, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them. 
That April 1 decision was not listed on the court docket.
The issues will be at the center of a May jury trial in which the investors are seeking damages over the tweets. 
Musk ""has used his fame and notoriety to sway public opinion in his favor, waging battle in the press having been defeated in the courtroom,"" the filing said. 
Musk’s latest comments risk confusing potential jurors and prejudicing a jury decision on the amount of damages owed by Musk, it said. 
Musk is trying to nullify his settlement with the SEC, accusing the agency of harassing him with investigations. 

Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla, on Saturday again asserted that it was true that Musk was considering taking Tesla private in 2018 and had financing for that move. “All that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light, all to the detriment of free speech,” he said. 
The case is In re Tesla Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-04865.

Bild am Sonntag, in an interview published on Sunday, asked her to name the key points of a planned sixth round of sanctions.
""We are looking further at the banking sector, especially Sberbank, which accounts for 37% of the Russian banking sector. And, of course, there are energy issues,"" she said. 
The EU has so far spared Russia's largest bank from previous sanctions rounds because it, along with Gazprombank, is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries have been buying despite the conflict in Ukraine.
She also said that the EU was working on ""clever mechanisms"" so that oil could also be included in the next sanctions.

""What should not happen is that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin collects even higher prices on other markets for supplies that would otherwise go to the EU,"" she was quoted as saying.
""The top priority is to shrink Putin's revenues,"" she said.

Deripaska, founder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal, has been sanctioned by the United States, European Union and Britain. He has previously called for peace.
A Reuters witness saw the 73-metre (239.5 foot) yacht Clio arrive off the coast of Gocek in the Aegean coastal province of Mugla on Saturday. The Cayman Islands-flagged vessel remains in a bay off Gocek.
The arrival of Clio in Turkish waters comes after two superyachts linked to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who made a surprise appearance at Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Istanbul this month, docked in Turkish ports.
World governments are seeking to isolate President Vladimir Putin and his allies over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"".
NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and mediates in the conflict. It has supported Kyiv, but also opposed sanctions on Moscow, including measures against Russian billionaires.

Ankara relies heavily on Russian energy imports and tourists and has emerged as a safe haven for Russians fleeing sanctions, and many have invested in Turkish property.
On Friday, a Ukrainian diplomat said Ukraine is working with Turkey for more support and understands - though it is not happy with - the reality of Ankara's parallel ties to Moscow.

3,2022-04-16T21:47:15+0000,,,,,"In a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit.The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so.Tesla's stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized.The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.Damages from the shareholders' class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class.The shareholders' attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter — in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted.This information was revealed in a request the shareholders' lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14.The request for the temporary restraining order alludes to an earlier ruling by Judge Chen that is currently under seal because it refers to evidence that Musk's team regarded as confidential. ""We anticipate the order will be published soon,"" Adam Apton of Levi & Korsinsky, lead counsel for the class of Tesla shareholders, told CNBC by email.At the TED conference on Thursday, Musk called financial regulators in the SEC's San Francisco office ""bastards.""Musk also said, ""The SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that's like having a gun to your child's head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.""It's not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time.Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion.Musk's attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: ""Nothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that's left some half decade later is random plaintiffs' lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech."" Spiro gave the same statement to Bloomberg, which first reported on new developments in the shareholders' class action.A trial date is currently set for May 31, 2022, in a San Francisco federal court, but that could change.Levi & Korsinsky's Apton told CNBC, ""We look forward to proving the rest of our case at trial and recovering damages on behalf of the class.""",

The company also said it will not apply to list its shares on any other stock exchange before the delisting of its American Depositary Shares from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was complete. 
It added that it will continue to explore appropriate measures that include exploring a potential listing on another internationally recognized exchange, it said. 
Didi announced in December that it would delist from the NYSE and pursue a listing in Hong Kong after it ran foul of Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO last year.
Chinese regulators had urged the firm to put its listing on hold while a cybersecurity review of its data practices was conducted, sources have told Reuters. 
Days after it went ahead, the country's powerful cyberspace watchdog ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi and told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.
China's securities regulator, in a statement noting Didi's Saturday announcement, said the decision was one that the company had made independently and had nothing to do with other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks or ongoing efforts between Chinese regulators and their U.S. counterparts to resolve an audit dispute affecting U.S.-listed Chinese firms.

NYC-based BlackRock Inc., which is the world’s top asset management firm with around $9.5 trillion in total assets under management (AUM) as of 30 September 2021 according to ADV Ratings, has invested in stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial Ltd.
On 26 September 2018, Circle announced that 26 September 2018 announced that it was launching its “USD Coin” ($USDC for short), which is a regulated fully collateralized dollar-backed cryptocurrency that was originally announced on 16 May 2018. This stablecoin is based on an open source fiat stablecoin framework developed and governed by the CENTRE project. Circle said back then that “individuals and institutions” could enroll its dollar tokenization service to “deposit US dollars from bank accounts, convert those dollars into tokens usable everywhere the internet reaches (subject to the token’s compliance controls), and redeem USDC tokens and cash out to bank accounts.”
In a press release issued on April 12, Circle said that it had “entered into an agreement for a $400M funding round with investments from BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP and Fin Capital” and that “the funding round is expected to close in the second quarter.”









The press release went on to say that “in addition to its corporate strategic investment and role as a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves, BlackRock has entered into a broader strategic partnership with Circle, which includes exploring capital market applications for USDC.” It also mentioned that this new funding “promotes Circle’s continued strategic growth as demand for dollar digital currency and related financial services continues to scale globally.”
Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder and CEO of Circle, had this to say about this new partnership:
“USDC is one of the fastest growing dollar digital currencies with over $50 billion in circulation. Dollar digital currencies like USDC are fueling a global economic transformation, and Circle’s technology infrastructure sits at the center of that change. This funding round will drive the next evolution of Circle’s growth… It’s particularly gratifying to add BlackRock as a strategic investor in the company. We look forward to developing our partnership.“

Scientists worldwide are racing to study upgraded injections against Omicron, as data indicated that antibodies elicited by vaccines based on older strains show weaker activity to neutralise the highly transmissible variant. 
The two candidates from units of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one from Sinovac contain inactivated or ""killed"" coronavirus and are similar to vaccines that the companies are supplying in China and overseas, the companies said in statements.
The Sinopharm candidates will be tested as boosters in adults who have already received two or three vaccine doses, CNBG said. It did not specify which vaccine products the trial participants would have received before taking the experimental booster, or how many subjects would be recruited. 
Sinovac said it will push forward studies in its existing CoronaVac vaccine's protection against emerging variants. 

A Chinese study https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271215v1.full.pdf showed that a fourth dose of BBIBP-CorV, an existing Sinopharm COVID vaccine, did not significantly lift antibody levels against Omicron when administered six months after a third booster dose to a regular two-dose regimen.
While the fourth dose restored antibody levels to around the peaks that followed the third dose, researchers said new vaccines would offer a better alternative as future boosters.

8,2022-04-16T13:16:39+0000,"In late February, Kristi Cassidy logged onto Reddit and made a call to action to people who sell their goods on Etsy. A day earlier, Etsy had announced it was hiking fees by 30%. For Cassidy, a seller of gothic wedding dresses on the e-commerce platform since 2006, the decision felt like an insult to small businesses who kept the site humming throughout the pandemic by selling their goods. ""I wonder, what would happen if on April 11, so many sellers put their shops on vacation mode that Etsy starts [freaking out],"" Cassidy wrote. ""And then they have no choice but to negotiate with us.""Cassidy's Reddit post kicked off a weeklong Etsy seller strike that began on Monday. Thousands of Etsy sellers are putting their digital shops in ""vacation mode"" to protest the fee increase. An online petition outlining their demands had well over 77,000 signatures as of Thursday evening. Etsy has 5.3 million active sellers on its platform, according to the company's website.The fee increase comes on the heels of a tremendous growth period for Etsy. The company was a big winner during the Covid pandemic, as consumers cut trips to the store and flocked to online retailers. Etsy sellers generated gross merchandise sales of $12.2 billion in 2021, compared with $5 billion in 2019. Etsy, which is known for its handmade and personalized goods, initially saw an influx of shoppers looking for face masks. Now, Etsy is trying to keep them coming back to the site, while competing with other e-commerce players like Amazon and eBay.Etsy told investors in February that additional revenue from the fee increase will be reinvested back into various initiatives at the company.Raina Moskowitz, Etsy's chief operating officer, said the company is ""committed"" to supporting sellers and helping them grow their businesses.""We are always receptive to seller feedback and, in fact, the new fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in areas outlined in the petition, including marketing, customer support, and removing listings that don't meet our policies,"" Moskowitz said in a statement.Investors and analysts who track the company applauded the fee increase and other recent changes. Guggenheim analyst Seth Sigman acknowledged sellers are likely bearing the brunt of higher costs, but that the changes should ultimately benefit ""everyone on the platform"" longterm.""We appreciate the concerns of the sellers. This is their livelihood,"" said Sigman, who recommends buying Etsy shares. ""But the offset is the company is using this as a lever to reinvest back into the business. Our view is that it should ultimately lead to stronger market share gains.""
Cassidy and other Etsy sellers interviewed by CNBC said they remain skeptical of whether the fee increase will translate to improvements on the platform. The company last raised transaction fees in 2018 from 3.5% to 5%, and the payoff has been minimal, Cassidy said.On top of transaction fees, Etsy sellers also have to pay listing fees, payment processing fees and shipping fees. As part of the company's Offsite Ads program, Etsy sellers are also charged an additional fee between 12% to 15% anytime shoppers make a purchase after clicking on an ad for their product.""The recent transaction fee increase, along with the [other fees], has made it harder for smaller creators to turn a profit and make their business sustainable,"" said Marie Hart, who sells pins, charms and art on her Etsy shop.As part of the weeklong strike, Etsy sellers are urging the company to cancel the fee increase, allow them to opt out of the Offsite Ads and end a recently launched program, called Star Seller, which they say puts undue pressures sellers. 
""As a small indie creator who designs and handmakes my merchandise and apparel, I'm losing hours of labor and money using Etsy,"" said Soudabeh Rouhandeh, who runs art and apparel shop Sudibear. Some veteran Etsy sellers are also calling on the company to crack down on resellers, which they say have sullied the marketplace.Since Alex Kittle became an Etsy seller in 2010, she said she's noticed an influx of mass-market goods and dropshippers. The shift feels disconnected from Etsy's origins as a platform for showcasing handcrafted, one-of-a-kind wares that are often made to order, she said. ""For the most part, I've found it a fun and eclectic community, with both friendly sellers and buyers, and a great place to reach my kind of customers (who are often a little nerdy or alternative in their tastes),"" Kittle said in an email. ""In the past few years, it's expanded to include larger businesses, dropshippers, resellers, and even scammy shops."" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman told sellers in February the company expects to dedicate more resources this year to removing listings that violate its policies. In 2021, Etsy spent $40 million on expanding the teams and technology focused on marketplace safety, the company said.Nicole Lewis, who has sold handmade crayons on Etsy for 15 years, said she doesn't agree with the premise of the strike. Etsy connected CNBC with sellers who did not participate in the strike.Lewis said she doesn't blame Etsy for hiking transaction fees, and that many of the recent changes are a necessary part of growing the marketplace.""I think a lot of the OG sellers that are upset with Etsy still see it as the Etsy of 2004, 2005, 2006,"" Lewis said. ""It's not that anymore and it can't be. Not in the world we're living in today, when there's so many people out there looking to sell their work and we compete with Amazon.""
Cassidy said she didn't expect the seller strike to take off like it did.But after connecting with sellers through the strike and realizing they shared many similar concerns, she and other Etsy sellers began to consider whether they should form a union.""The crazy thing is, I didn't even realize just how many people there were out there that agreed with me,"" Cassidy said. ""It's been this huge, eye-opening experience just to see how much all the other people that are on this platform trying to make a living with me agree and how much my customers support me.""Etsy sellers aren't employees of the company, but they're hoping that by joining together, they can better advocate for changes at the online marketplace. A number of Etsy sellers have joined a Discord server where they intend to map out organizing plans, Cassidy said.While Lewis didn't participate in the strike, she said she supports the idea of a seller union. ""I honestly think it's a smart idea because people just want to be heard and acknowledged,"" she said.Representatives from Etsy didn't respond to a request for comment on sellers' plans to unionize.Cassidy said she was inspired to organize Etsy sellers after witnessing the recent union victories among Starbucks baristas and at an Amazon warehouse.Worker activism has surged across the country since the start of the pandemic. The tightening labor market in the U.S. further galvanized support for unionization, and workers have seized the moment to demand higher pay and better benefits from their employers.Since the strike kicked off, Cassidy said she's been contacted by labor groups who've raised the topic of organizing sellers. Any next steps will boil down to what the seller community wants, she added.""We haven't been sure what to call it,"" Cassidy said. ""Is it union? Is it handmade slash vintage solidarity? What do we call this thing? What that looks like, we don't really know, because we're kind of navigating uncharted territory.""",,,,,

10,"Apr. 16, 2022, 06:45 AM EDT","The organizing campaign at Starbucks has succeeded in unionizing nearly 20 of the coffee chain’s U.S. stores so far, a historic breakthrough for the labor movement. But the union effort is now in the early stages of an even heavier lift: negotiating a first contract.Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize. From the perspective of the union, Workers United, securing solid gains in a collective bargaining agreement could turbocharge an already hot organizing drive, and bring many more of Starbucks’ 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores into the fold.

Both sides are now girding for what’s likely to be a bruising fight at the negotiating table, one that could ultimately determine the future of unions inside Starbucks. “Developing a contract that meets or exceeds what we already offer to our partners is going to be difficult for them to do,” predicted Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesperson. “These contracts don’t start at the baseline of the benefits that our partners get. That is the full-stop rule. The contract negotiations start at zero.”(After this story ran, Borges said he misspoke about contract talks “start[ing] at zero.” He said he meant to convey that “collective bargaining involves lots of variables, and nobody can predict the outcome.”)Starbucks has already hinted at some of the hardball tactics that might lay ahead. CEO Howard Schultz suggested in a recent company forum that Starbucks could roll out new benefits that would apply everywhere but the unionized locations, since those stores are now negotiating their own work terms. “People who might be voting for a union don’t really understand,” Schultz said, according to The Wall Street Journal.

“Starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal, since that would only encourage more workers to organize.”One of the challenges for the union is consolidating its leverage against the company. The campaign, known as Starbucks Workers United, has been organizing the chain store by store, filing for elections at locations where union support is high. The company has pushed for larger elections that would encompass an entire market — like Buffalo, New York, which is home to the first store to unionize — but the National Labor Relations Board has rejected that argument and sided with the union.The union’s store-by-store strategy is vastly more manageable than trying to unionize Starbucks nationally or market by market. But it technically leaves the union negotiating a contract for every store that joins.Michelle Eisen, a union leader and barista at the first store to unionize, said the campaign views each Starbucks as distinct, and that applying the same exact contract to every outpost “would go against what we said we’ve wanted from the beginning.” Eisen said the union hopes to achieve what might be called a national framework for a union contract ― one that includes basic guarantees across union Starbucks stores, but allows individual shops to address their own concerns. “There are aspects of the company that are consistent in these stores, but there are a lot of aspects that are not,” she said. 

Michelle Eisen, fourth from right, speaks to members of the union campaign. Via Associated PressEisen said she works at a small walk-in location, known as a cafe in company parlance, and that her store operates differently from a drive-thru store like the one in Mesa, Arizona, that recently unionized. Some contract language for one might not make sense for the other. “We have to find the elements of stores that are consistent and that becomes a national framework ― but allowing for fluidity within the contracts that can cater to each individual store as well,” Eisen said.Starbucks’ Borges said the company has no interest in hammering out national standards of any kind, no matter how many stores decide to unionize.“From our perspective, the law and the NLRB granted the union their argument that each individual store is its own unit,” Borges said. “So now we move forward with individual contracts for each of those stores.”Securing a first contract can be notoriously difficult in the U.S., in part because employers face no meaningful penalties for dragging out the process. It’s a common strategy for companies to bargain “in bad faith” and make no real progress at the table, in hopes union support will dwindle over time and perhaps the union will even be decertified, or purged from the workplace.If only a handful of stores ultimately unionize, it would be easier for Starbucks to stifle the campaign. But the union has filed for elections at more than 200 stores, and so far they have lost only two of the more than 20 vote counts that have already occurred (the results have not been certified for some of them). At this pace, the union is likely to gain more leverage at the bargaining table and more public support. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other,” said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “So we know that the workers that are already at the bargaining table at one store are going to try to get a broad understanding of what the workers everywhere want as they establish their demands.”Borges assured the company would bargain in good faith: “We’re going to be respectful, we’re going to honor the process.” But achieving a contract could realistically take years, and will ultimately depend on the company’s willingness to reach one. “It’s clear that this is a very worker-led organizing drive, and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other.”- Rebecca Givan, Rutgers UniversityStarbucks has deployed dozens of lawyers from the union-avoidance law firm Littler Mendelson to slow the pace of union elections, and has dispatched Starbucks managers to persuade workers to vote against the union. But Givan said fighting a union effort at each store becomes less tenable as the campaign grows.“It will be hard to maintain that strategy at potentially dozens of bargaining tables, especially when workers are fully aligned and in coordination with each other,” she said.

Starbucks has also fired a number of known union supporters. The company maintains that these terminations were all for legitimate reasons, but labor board officials have already determined that seven firings in Memphis were in response to union activism and therefore illegal. Bloomberg recently reported that the labor board will pursue a case against Starbucks if it doesn’t agree to a settlement.As workers speak out about the company’s handling of the union campaign, Starbucks could face a backlash from consumers that affects its bottom line. The stakes could be even higher in an ugly contract fight if the union enlists labor-friendly politicians and other high-profile supporters willing to criticize the company.Sharon Block, a labor law professor at Harvard University and former official in the Biden White House, said the brand dynamic is “hard to quantify,” but reputable considerations must figure into Starbucks’ calculus. “I imagine it weighs on their decision-making,” she said. “It isn’t just about doing the [financial] math.”If workers can successfully organize hundreds of stores, there may be a point in which Starbucks finds it in the company’s interest to acknowledge itself as a union employer and bargain accordingly, rather than continue to wage a battle at every store where a union petition pops up. Eisen said she thinks about that prospect often, and wonders how much organizing it would take to get there. She said unionizing a single store takes much longer than one might expect. She believes public support for the campaign might matter more in the end than how many stores wind up in the union’s column. “We get stronger, obviously, with every petition that’s filed and every store that wins,” she said. “The hope is that if the company is really who they’ve professed to be for the last 50 years, that there’s still room for them to make changes and get onboard and become the corporation that truly is progressive and leads by example.”Related...The Starbucks Union Campaign Has Won 16 Elections And Lost Just OneStarbucks Union Notches Another Victory With Eighth StoreThe Labor Board Is Withering Away, And That's Bad News For The Labor Mo",,,,,

It received requests for information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and received a subpoena from a Department of Justice grand jury, the maker of ""Call of Duty"" said in an amended proxy filing. 
The requests ""appear to relate to their respective investigations into trading by third parties – including persons known to Activision Blizzard's CEO – in securities prior to the announcement of the proposed transaction,"" it said. 
Microsoft in January agreed to acquire Activision for $95 a share, or $68.7 billion in total, in the biggest video-gaming industry deal in history.
The company did not name the parties, nor say whether the grand jury subpoena was directed at any employee. 
The filing did not disclose when it received the subpoena or the SEC request for information. 
Media moguls Barry Diller and David Geffen, and investor Alexander von Furstenberg, acquired share options after von Furstenberg met with Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and days before it disclosed the sale to Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. 
""Activision Blizzard has informed these authorities that it intends to be fully cooperative with these investigations,"" the company said. 

Diller told Reuters last month that none of the three had any knowledge about a potential acquisition and had acted on the belief that Activision was undervalued and had the potential for going private or being acquired. 
The amended proxy filing that included the information on its cooperation with the SEC and DOJ came after shareholders sued the company alleging omissions to a preliminary proxy on the sale.

A gamified educational platform from Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) lets people earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by learning about blockchain technology in general and Stellar ($XLM) Network in particular.
Stellar is “an open-source network for currencies and payments”, and it “makes it possible to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money—dollars, pesos, bitcoin, pretty much anything.” Stellar “relies on blockchain to keep the network in sync, but the end-user experience is more like cash—Stellar is much faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than typical blockchain-based systems.” 
Stellar network, which was launched in 2014, has “a native digital currency, the lumen, that’s required in small amounts for initializing accounts and making transactions.” 
Here is one use case for Stellar:
“You can create a digital representation of a U.S. dollar—on Stellar you’d call this a “dollar token”—and you can tell the world that whenever someone deposits a traditional dollar with you, you’ll issue them one of your new tokens. When someone brings that “dollar token” back to you, you promise to redeem it in turn for one of the regular dollars in that deposit account. 
“Essentially, you set up a 1:1 relationship between your digital token and a traditional dollar. Every one of your tokens out in the world is backed by an equivalent deposit. So while people hold the tokens, they can treat them just like traditional money, because they know that they’re exchangeable for traditional money in the end.“
The original Stellar Quest platform, which was created by SDF ecosystem evangelist Tyler van der Hoeven and launched in October 2020, was aimed at developers and it featured live challenges (such as creating and funding a Stellar account). For completing each challenge, you would get awarded a badge and some $XLM tokens.












According to a blog post published by SDF on April 11, Stellar Quest Learn won’t function much differently than the existing Stellar Quest site,” and “you’ll still be able to play quests at any time, in any order.” With Stellar Quest Learn, “you can go at your own pace,” and finishing each quest “earns you a unique, fresh NFT badge (coming soon!) that you’ll be able to display, or boast about, in your Stellar Quest profile.” Five quests are available now, and SDF plans to “add new sets regularly.”
Users of Stellar Quest Learn earn NFTs by “completing modular quests that leverage Stellar’s API and SDKs”. They unlock and receive NFTs after each quest that they complete. They are also able to display their NFT badges in their Stellar Quest profile.
The SDF blog post went on to say that the existing Stellar Quest Live, “where quests are live and timed events that are hosted periodically,” will still be around:
“We will continue to host live events periodically as a separate and supplemental experience to Learn. Face-off against other developers to solve new and unique timed challenges on the Stellar network.“
As before, $XLM rewards will be available for completing live quest events.
In other words, the original Stellar Quest has been “split into two main components: Stellar Quest Live and Stellar Quest Learn.”

13,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 09:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A jury in Denver, Colorado, acquitted dialysis provider DaVita (NYSE:DVA) and its former CEO Kent Thiry on Friday of charges that they conspired with competitors not to hire each other's employees.
The Justice Department had alleged in the case that both DaVita and Surgical Care Affiliates LLC required senior-level employees who sought to work for them to notify their current employers that they were job-hunting.
""The jury affirmed that this case should never have been brought,"" Thiry said in a statement. ""I want to thank the community that provided so much support through this difficult time.""
In a statement, DaVita said: ""(We) are grateful to put this matter behind us. We remain committed to operating with integrity and upholding the highest standards of law."" 
While enforcers have traditionally focused on prices and innovation in enforcing antitrust law, the Biden administration has shifted its emphasis somewhat to put more focus on illegal agreements that might push down wages.
Friday's decision comes after DaVita and Thiry had an alleged anti-poaching agreement with Surgical Care Affiliates LLC, now part of UnitedHealthcare, from 2012 to 2017 that sought to prevent each company from wooing away senior-level employees, the Justice Department said last year. 
SCA was charged in early 2021. Trial has been set for early next year.
The department also alleged that DaVita struck agreements with two other companies, Hazel Health Inc and Radiology Partners, to not hire DaVita employees.

The jury acquitted the company and its former CEO on all three counts, a spokeswoman for Thiry said.
Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department, said in a statement that he was disappointed in the outcome, but respects the jury's decision and remains committed to enforcing the antitrust laws in the labor markets.

""We are going to make promises that we will keep, promises that are real and going to solve the problems that exist in your stores,"" Schulz said in the video released to Reuters on Friday. 
Schultz, who returned to lead the company for the third time last month, is in the midst of dealing with a growing union drive at U.S. cafes.
He added that he plans to focus on issues raised by employees in their ""co-creation sessions"" such as need for more training, need for guaranteed hours, problems with ice machines breaking, maintenance and repairs not coming in a timely manner. 
""I have realized there have been many short term decisions that have had an adverse affect. We are going to reverse that,"" the CEO who has been practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987 said. 
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. Starbucks locations have asked the NLRB for union elections since August, with at least 10 locations voting in favor of the Workers United union. 

Last month, a federal labor board accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to unionize their store. 
The same day, a group of investors with $3.4 trillion under management urged the company to stop sending anti-union communications to its employees and to adopt a neutral policy towards unions.

(Reuters) -The New York Times sued an anti-immigration author for the cost of defending itself against defamation in the first lawsuit of its kind under New York's recently expanded ""anti-SLAPP"" law to protect critical speech.
The company is seeking unspecified fees spent fending off a 2020 lawsuit by Peter Brimelow, according to the company's lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday. 
Brimelow had sued the company over five articles published between January 2019 and May 2020 that described him as being ""white nationalist"" and his VDARE.com website as being ""animated by race hatred.""
Brimelow said the lawsuit does not have merit. ""This lawsuit, like the five articles at issue in the original litigation, is but another effort to raise the stakes against dissident (but desperately needed) voices,"" he said in an email.
The Times said in a statement it was the first anti-SLAPP case by the company which it called an important step in protecting itself from defamation claims.
One of the five articles that Brimelow alleged was defamatory was originally published by Reuters and republished by the Times. Brimelow did not name Reuters in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit by Brimelow, who has said he thinks the United States is a white nation, was dismissed in December 2020 soon after New York expanded its anti-SLAPP law, which is meant to deter lawsuits that are designed to punish defendants for speaking out on public issues.
SLAPP stands for ""Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation"" and then-Governor Andrew Cuomo said the expanded law would protect free speech by preventing wealthy interests from using the court to bully their opponents.
The Times lawsuit is the first in which a defendant in a SLAPP case turned around and sued the plaintiffs after getting the case dismissed, according to Daniel Novack, an attorney who specializes in media law. 

The anti-SLAPP law has also been embraced by defendants in the original litigation. 
Fox News argued a $2 billion defamation lawsuit by the Smartmatic voting systems company violated the law and former President Donald Trump tried unsuccessfully to use the law to sue E. Jean Carroll, a writer who said he raped her in the 1990s.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) adopted a 'poison pill' on Friday to limit Elon Musk's ability to raise his stake in the social media platform, as a buyout firm emerged to challenge his $43 billion bid for the company.
Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused private equity firm that had more than $103 billion in assets under management as of the end of December, has informed Twitter that it is exploring the possibility of putting together a bid, people familiar with the matter said.
It is not clear how much Thoma Bravo would be prepared to offer and there is no certainty that such a rival bid will materialize, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A Thoma Bravo spokesperson declined to comment while Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Thoma Bravo was considering a bid for Twitter.
Twitter said on Friday it adopted a poison pill that would dilute anyone amassing a stake in the company of more than 15% by selling more shares to other shareholders at a discount. Known formally as a shareholder rights plan, the poison pill will be in place for 364 days.
The move would not bar Musk from taking his offer directly to Twitter shareholders by launching a tender offer. While the poison pill would prevent most Twitter shareholders from selling their shares, the tender offer would allow them to register their support or disapproval of Musk's offer.
""It is a predictable defensive measure for the board to go down that will not be viewed positively by shareholders given the potential dilution and acquisition unfriendly move,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted on Friday.
Thoma Bravo's interest raises the specter of more private equity firms vying for Twitter. The global private equity industry is sitting on about $1.8 trillion in dry powder, according to data provider Preqin. Unlike major technology conglomerates, most buyout firms would not face antitrust restrictions in acquiring Twitter.
It remains possible that a private equity firm will boost Musk's bid by partnering with him rather than challenging him. Musk's criticism of Twitter's reliance on advertising for most of its revenue, however, has made some private equity firms apprehensive about teaming up with him, industry sources said. This is because a strong cash flow makes financing a leveraged buyout much easier. 
Silver Lake, a private equity firm with more than $90 billion in assets under management, would be a natural partner for Musk because it offered financing for his $72-billion bid for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc four years ago, which Musk subsequently abandoned. Silver Lake co-chief executive Egon Durban also sits on Twitter's board.
But Durban did not recuse himself on Thursday when Twitter's board met to discuss Musk's offer for the first time, people familiar with the matter said, in a sign that Silver Lake has not sought to team up with Musk or make a bid of its own thus far. 
It remains possible that Silver Lake will choose to become involved as a buyer. A Silver Lake spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
' BEST  (NYSE:BEST) AND FINAL OFFER'
Twitter has more than $6 billion of cash on its balance sheet and its annual cash flow is close to $700 million, providing some comfort to banks considering whether should provide debt for a deal. Still, a leveraged buyout for Twitter could be the biggest of all time, potentially requiring several buyout firms and other major institutional investors to team up. 
Musk is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $265 billion. He has however drawn a line on how much he is willing to pay. He informed Twitter on Wednesday that his $54.20-per-share all-cash bid for the company was his ""best and final offer"", and that he would reconsider his position as a Twitter shareholder if it was rejected. Musk owns more than 9% of Twitter, making him the largest shareholder after mutual fund giant Vanguard.
Musk tweeted on Thursday that Twitter's shareholders should have a say on his offer and posted a poll on Twitter in which most users agreed with him. Twitter's board is still assessing Musk's offer and would only put it to the company's shareholders for a vote if it approves it. Twitter shares fell on Thursday, indicating that most investors expect the company's board to reject Musk's bid as inadequate and thin on financing details.

Twitter's board is expected to take several more days to assess Musk's bid and draft its response, the sources familiar with the matter said. An outcome over the weekend is unlikely, the sources added.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has been advising Twitter's board on its deliberations. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the board had tapped JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Co Inc as a second financial adviser. 
 
"
17,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 03:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan (the ""Rights Plan""). The Board adopted the Rights Plan following an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire Twitter.
The Rights Plan is intended to enable all shareholders to realize the full value of their investment in Twitter. The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
The Rights Plan does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders.
The Rights Plan is similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies in comparable circumstances. Under the Rights Plan, the rights will become exercisable if an entity, person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Twitter's outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board. In the event that the rights become exercisable due to the triggering ownership threshold being crossed, each right will entitle its holder (other than the person, entity or group triggering the Rights Plan, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, additional shares of common stock having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the right.
The Rights Plan will expire on April 14, 2023.
Additional information regarding the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by Twitter with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."

(Reuters) - Elon Musk, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)'s newest big shareholder, could alter the course of the social media company as management battles a set of proxy proposals focused on topics from civil rights to politics at its upcoming annual meeting, shareholder activists and corporate governance experts said.
Whatever the outcome of Musk's $43 billion bid to buy Twitter outright announced Thursday, investors with opposing political views described the billionaire entrepreneur as likely to work to undo some of the restrictions on content that Twitter has imposed as it attempts to promote free speech while combating hate speech and false information.
Even if he fails to buy Twitter, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, who recently disclosed a 9.6% stake, is seen as likely to vote in ways that could shake up the company at its virtual May 25 meeting, said people who follow corporate governance issues.
""Given where Musk has positioned himself relative to the strategy of Twitter and given he wants to be something of a disrupter, I don’t see him voting with management very often,"" said Brian Bueno of Farient Advisors, a corporate governance and executive pay consulting firm.
Musk said his offer price of $54.20 per share was meant to promote open discourse. At the virtual meeting, he will control the second-largest stake after Vanguard Group, enough to give either investor a kingmaker role in close contests.
Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how he might vote at Twitter.
Musk's star power will likely draw much attention to event, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ""He's a well-known individual in the middle of all this, so it will increase the interest in voting and could have a big impact,"" Elson said.
Although Twitter on Friday adopted a shareholder rights plan to defend itself against Musk, Elson said its impact on the voting might only be to make proxy advisers, which tend to frown on such so-called ""poison pills,"" more skeptical of management.
FIVE HOT-TICKET ITEMS 
Twitter faces five shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, dealing with topics drawing much investor attention.
Two are from conservative groups, one asking Twitter to report on its impact on civil rights and the other on its lobbying activities. Scott Shepard, a fellow at the right-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research think tank, one of the sponsors, called Musk's offer ""terrific"" for shareholders. 
Shepard said he hoped Musk would turn Twitter away from censorship, and his group has criticized the company for steps like banning the account of former U.S. President Donald Trump after the storming of the U.S. Capitol due to the risk of further incitement of violence.
“Twitter under Musk will be what it should been -- both from a civic and a value standpoint -- all along"" Shepard said via email.
Taking a dimmer view is Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Benton, founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which focuses on social and environmental matters and filed a resolution critical of non-disclosure agreements for employees. 
""Missteps, in pushing for his (Musk's) own unfettered speech, risk destroying the appeal of the platform for millions who need to feel safe before they can speak up,” Benton said.
A fourth proposal filed by overseers of New York State's pension fund, who declined to comment, calls on Twitter to report on its electoral spending.
A fifth proposal was filed by Arjuna Capital, calling on Twitter to nominate at least one board member with a background in human or civil rights. Arjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she would expect Musk to back the proposal as it is in line with his free speech concerns.

But she called Musk's buyout bid ""troubling"" as a further consolidation of power on social media, where good governance is essential.
""We don’t need Twitter run by another social media emperor. We need it run by experts,"" Lamb said. (This story refiles to correct typographical error in paragraph 17)

MANCHESTER (Reuters) -Bahrain-domiciled asset manager Investcorp has entered into exclusive talks to purchase Serie A club AC Milan, sources said on Friday, in what would be the first takeover of a top Italian team by Middle East investors. 
One source close to the talks told Reuters the deal to buy the seven-times European champions from current owner Elliott Management Corporation was near to completion.
A potential valuation for the club would be in the region of 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) including debt, the sources said. 
Investcorp manages over $42 billion in assets with business lines including private equity, real estate, absolute return investments, infrastructure, credit management, and strategic capital. 
Investcorp and Elliott, which took over Milan in 2018, would not comment when contacted by Reuters. 
An AC Milan spokesperson said only that ""AC Milan remains focused on improving its performance on the pitch and to develop the club.""
A second source briefed with the matter confirmed talks between Elliott and Investcorp over a potential sale.
Milan have won Italy's top flight league title 18 times but not since 2011. The club has struggled to recreate the glory years enjoyed under the ownership of Silvio Berlusconi and his Fininvest group.
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE PEDIGREE
The club won Champions League titles in 2003 and 2007 after Berlusconi was able to bring in some of the biggest names globally such as Brazilian Kaka and Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko.
Berlusconi sold the club to Chinese investor Li Yonghong in 2017 for 740 million euros, including debts, before Elliott later took control.
Milan are currently top of the table, two points clear of city rivals Inter Milan but having played a game more.
The club reported a loss of 96.4 million euros ($104.18 million) for the year ending June 30, compared with a record 194.6 million loss the previous year.
Elliott has never formally put the club up for sale but a source with knowledge of the situation said it had received interest from investors.
Elsewhere in Italy's Serie A, Inter Milan are owned by Chinese company Suning Holdings Group, while American company The Friedkin Group own AS Roma. 
Fiorentina and Atalanta are also American-owned.
While not present in Italian football, Middle Eastern investors control several other top European clubs, with Qatari Sports Investments owning Paris St Germain and Manchester City held by the Abu Dhabi United Group.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund took a majority stake in Premier League club Newcastle United in October.
Investcorp Holdings is domiciled in the Kingdom of Bahrain as a Bahrain Shareholding Company but delisted from the Bahrain bourse last year.

The company, whose executive chairman is Mohammed Alardhi, has offices in New York, London, Switzerland, Riyadh, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Mumbai, Beijing and Singapore.

23,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 11:55AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Fears of being targeted by Western sanctions are deterring Russian brokerages from helping Sberbank by hosting its clients' accounts with foreign stocks holdings, three financial market sources told Reuters.
The United States imposed full blocking sanctions on Russia's largest lender Sberbank and the country's top private bank Alfa Bank last week, exerting pressure on Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
The U.S. Treasury has put deadline for termination of transactions with Sberbank and Alfa Bank at April 12 and May 5, respectively. The banks said the penalties would not have a significant impact on their operations.
Russia has experienced a boom in private investments on the stock market since the onset of COVID-19. Last year, the number of citizens with brokerage accounts neared 17 million, as people looked for ways to make money amid a record number of domestic share floatings and low deposit rates.
Sberbank, VTB and Alfa Bank, Russia's biggest banks, were also top brokerage houses before the latest sanctions, which left their clients holding foreign stocks with the need to park their funds with smaller domestic players. 
Sberbank, which had to decide on transferring accounts with foreign stocks by the end of Tuesday, told its clients to contact the bank about the issue.
""We have taken action so you can manage your assets without restraints,"" Sberbank said on its website, without elaborating to where the accounts were transferred. 
Many Russian brokerage firms not targeted by Western sanctions said they were not taking trading accounts with foreign stocks from Sberbank, leaving its clients and the market unclear about their fate.
""The market situation is unique. No one is willing to take sanction risks as the aftermath is unclear... (The transfer of Sberbank clients) could be seen as help to the sanctioned bank in solving its business issues,"" said a financial market source who asked not to be named.
Sberbank did not disclose the name of the depository or brokerage that it was negotiating with and did not reply to a request from Reuters for comment.
""No one wants to see a massive inflow (of clients), primarily due to sanctions,"" another person from a Moscow-based brokerage told Reuters.
Fears of sanctions intensified as Alfa Bank took a hit from severe sanctions after it obtained clients from Russia's second-largest lender VTB, which was among the first banks hit by Western sanctions this year. 
A third source at a Russian brokerage said companies were reluctant to deal with sanctioned banks ""after the Alfa case.""
""Banks are trying to transfer their clients to empty brokerage firms with a licence but with no infrastructure,"" the source said.
Some media reports suggested Sberbank at some point was considering transferring clients to Aton and BCS brokerages. The two firms quickly issued statements saying they were not involved in the deal.
Finam brokerage, Tinkoff Bank, Rosselkhozbank, Freedom Finance said Alfa Bank and Sberbank had not asked them to take their brokerage accounts.

Otkritie Bank, hit by wider Western sanctions, and Gazprombank, under UK sanctions, did not reply to Reuters request for comment.
Alfa Bank told Reuters it was looking for a brokerage that would obtain its clients' accounts so they can continue trading freely, but a decision on what firm can do that has not been made yet.

Circle Internet Financial, the global internet finance firm behind the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin standard, has recently begun a $400 million investment round with support from BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital.
With the latest investment round, Circle is looking to explore new inroads in the traditional financial sphere, where USDC, its stablecoin, may be utilized to integrate crypto with traditional financial instruments. While the invested figure is not yet final, the funding round will continue up to Q2 of 2022, with Circle working towards a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) merger, which would take the firm's valuation to roughly $9 million (USD).
BlackRock, in partnership with Circle, has resolved to servee as the primary asset manager for USDC cash reserves, with a broader partnership that would explore market applications of the USDC stablecoin, as well as pooling for technical expertise and industry knowledge.

“Dollar digital currencies like USDC are fueling a global economic transformation, and Circle’s technology infrastructure sits at the center of that change. This funding round will drive the next evolution of Circle’s growth. It’s particularly gratifying to add BlackRock as a strategic investor in the company. We look forward to developing our partnership.” shares Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.

The crypto industry has reached a key juncture, where traditional finance is starting to take notice of crypto assets and the potential for blockchain technology. The latest investment round by Circle only cements this trend, with crypto assets slowly but surely gaining mainstream adoption.
Circle is currently pursuing an application to operate as a bank in the U.S. The new funding is set to bolster Circle's presence in both the crypto space and the traditional financial space, where access to banking products will be of great importance as the global economy shifts to digital currencies.
Circle's USDC is the second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin by market capitalization and is available on major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Huobi Global. The USDC standard is an open source initiative that Circle launched in partnership with several crypto firms in September 2018, with its protocol built on top of the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.
Circle's USDC stablecoin currently has over $50.2 billion worth of circulation, with roughly $3.4 billion in average daily trading volume. Circle's previous funding round went up to $440 million, closed in May 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said he would nominate former Treasury official Michael Barr to be the Federal Reserve's Wall Street cop, replacing Sarah Bloom Raskin, who withdrew in March after failing to win support from moderate Democrats.
Currently a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, Barr was a central figure at the Treasury under President Barack Obama when Congress passed sweeping reforms following the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Here is the regulatory agenda that Barr will have to tackle if he wins Senate approval:
DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Randal Quarles, the previous Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, led a review of post-crisis regulations, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks, and they want the Fed to revisit some of those changes.
Among the most contentious were revisions to the ""Volcker Rule"" curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual ""stress tests"" based on subjective concerns.
Barr will have to decide carefully which of these he believes he can reverse, given such changes are likely to be contentious and time-consuming.
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported. 
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether the Fed pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
Fed officials may end up treading more carefully than progressives had hoped, as Raskin's nomination was ultimately sunk by concerns she would push too aggressively on climate risk.
BANK M&A
The Fed's position on bank M&A is expected to become tougher under a new supervision chief. Progressive Democrats generally oppose bank tie-ups, arguing that they reduce competition and hurt consumers, and many deals were delayed after Quarles stepped down from the supervision role in October.
Some pending deals have been approved following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, but the industry is still waiting for the Fed and the Justice Department to decide on a potential new policy for bank deals. If confirmed, Barr is expected to lead the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups. 
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
The Fed is also expected to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
It's exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up bank capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules, which promote lending in lower-income communities.

The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the CRA can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
Barr would likely have to be in place before the Fed could sign off on the changes.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russian companies and global banks including BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could profit if Moscow moves to de-list Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The potential windfall is due to the fees that bank issuers of depositary receipts can contractually charge investors when they cancel the product. 
It is unclear how much companies and banks could make or if banks will charge the fees and risk angering investors who say it would be unfair given the extraordinary circumstances which have been triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, the fees could potentially translate into hundreds of millions of dollars according to Reuters' calculations based on fee data provided by the sources.
Assailed by Western sanctions, Moscow is preparing to de-list Russian company depositary receipts from foreign exchanges and convert them into local Russian securities in a bid to reduce foreigners' control over these companies.
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. They allow investors to dabble in overseas stocks in their own geography and time zone.
There are more than 30 depositary receipts on Russian companies including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Rosneft, Lukoil and Norilsk Nickel issued by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan, among others, trading on U.S. and European markets. 
Under standard agreements, depositary receipts can be canceled by the issuer or the investor. When that happens, the investor typically gets cash from the sale of the underlying shares, although they have the right to take custody of the shares instead. 
Banks charge an administration fee, typically around $0.05 per receipt, which may be shared with the companies, two sources said. 
If Moscow de-lists Russian depositary receipts, banks will have to cancel the products. Banks could still charge the fees, even though their hand was forced, according to three sources. 
For example, an investor in Rosneft with 150 million depositary receipts representing the same number of shares in the company could be on the hook for $7.5 million in cancellation fees, according to Reuters' calculations. 
Sweeping Western sanctions could make it challenging for banks to transfer the cash to some companies. 
Regardless, some investors say the fees should not apply. One global asset manager told Reuters that if Russia passes the de-listing law there should be no fees as investors would have no choice in the matter. The other two sources, however, say banks still have to cover their costs.
BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. Russian companies did not respond to a Reuters emails seeking comment.
MARKET FREEZE
As Western sanctions pummeled Russian stocks from late February, the Moscow exchange closed and the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring shares out of their custody accounts. It also barred foreigners from selling Russian shares. 
The restrictions made it nearly impossible for banks to cancel receipts when asked by investors anxious to slash their Russia exposure. 
With curbs on custodians recently lifted, BNY Mellon, Citi and JPMorgan have resumed processing cancellations. But because the foreign banks still can't sell the shares, investors have to take custody of them instead. To do that, investors need an account in Russia, which many don't have.
As a result, a lot of investors are likely to hold onto the receipts for the time being, according to three people. 
Many investors are worried, however, about the de-listing bill which Russia is preparing. 

Aside from the potential cancellation fees, investors are worried about what will happen if they can't open a local custody account.
In a note to clients, JPMorgan said clients may be able to open a Russian account under some unspecified circumstances if the new law is passed.

The Russian President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sergei Katyrin has proposed a new cross-border cryptocurrency settlement for import-export payments, with the intention of boosting relations with African nations.
In a report by Russian news agency TASS, Sergei Katyrin sent a letter to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin that included a set of proposals for developing cooperation with African countries. 

""It seems appropriate to instruct the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, together with the Central Bank, to ensure the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements with African states (as agreed) on the use of national currencies and cryptocurrencies in mutual settlements and payments. To work out the issue of establishing a specialized export-import bank, as well as a trust fund to support export activities of small and medium-sized businesses in African countries,"" the letter noted. 

The President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry also brought up the possibility of two industry and trade departments establishing trade missions in African states as well as creating free trade zones and encouraging investment.
Katyrin also stressed the impact of the “negative transformation of trade and economic relations on the part of the collective west” and how cooperation with other nations, in this case, African nations, “ is of particular importance for the future development of Russia”.
With large-scale sanctions being imposed upon Russia following their attack on Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing restrictions on their ability to trade internationally. 
Ukraine legalized cryptocurrency in March, and has received large donations from the crypto community after Ukrainian President Zelenskyy signed the Virtual Assets Bill. 
Russia has also moved to allow opening up cryptocurrency payments including BTC, for energy exports, with a proposal presented by Russian State Duma Deputy and Energy Committee Chairman Pavel Zavalny at a press conference at the end of March.
The recent recommendations by Russia’s commerce executive are an indication of Russia’s intention to continue to pursue cryptocurrencies,  turning to African nations to facilitate the continuation of international trade.

""The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,"" the company said in a press release.Twitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.Musk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter's CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board.

30,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Several buyers of Russian gas have agreed to switch to payments in roubles, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday.
""We expect the decision (to switch to roubles) from other importers,"" he added, in comments published in the ministry's in-house magazine. He did not disclose the identities of customers who had already switched.
President Vladimir Putin said last month that buyers of Russian gas from ""unfriendly"" countries should pay in roubles, a move rejected by European Union authorities under the bloc's sanctions regime against Moscow.
Putin has warned Europe it risked having gas supplies cut unless it pays in the Russian currency as he seeks to retaliate over the sanctions, imposed over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
In March, he proposed that energy buyers open accounts at Gazprombank, where payments in euros or dollars would be converted to roubles.

Armenia made several payments for supplies of Russian natural gas in roubles, its Economy Minister Vagan Kerobyan said in an interview with Russian media outlet RBC on Friday.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday that Hungary planned to pay for Russian gas in euros through Gazprombank.

The Shanghai factory, located in the Pudong district east of the city's Huangpu River, suspended production on March 28 after the city started rolling out lockdown measures to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases that were later implemented city-wide.
The plan for resuming production has the blessing of local authorities but could still be subject to change depending on how the epidemic situation develops in the city, said the people, who declined to be named as the matter is private.
One of people said the U.S. carmaker planned to start with one shift and would gradually ramp up. 
Tesla and the Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The latest stoppage was the longest since the factory started production in late 2019 and has led to an output loss of more than 50,000 units, according to calculations based on internal output plans seen by Reuters.

Ongoing production at the plant could be impacted by difficulties in procuring auto parts, however, as logistics in the city and surrounding areas have been severely disrupted by China's COVID curbs. 
He Xiaopeng, the chief executive officer of Chinese electric-car maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), said on Thursday that automakers in China may have to suspend production in May if suppliers in Shangahi and surrounding areas were not able to resume work.

Just 9 days ahead of a runoff that will determine who will lead the European Union's second-largest economy for the next five years, opinion polls show Macron is only slightly ahead of Le Pen in a contest that could potentially go either way.
The 2021 compensation package for Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares adds up to around 19 million euros ($20.5 million), plus a stock package worth some additional 32 million euros and long-term compensation of about 25 million euros.
""We're talking about astronomical sums here ... we should put a cap on these, this could work if we act at a European level,"" Macron told franceinfo radio.
""People can't have purchasing power problems, difficulties and anxiety in their lives and see sums like this,"" Macron said, adding that otherwise ""society going to blow up"".
Le Pen echoed his comments. 
""Of course it is shocking. It's even more shocking when it's a CEO who has put the company in difficulty and gets considerable sums,"" she told BFM television, suggesting one way to offset such remuneration was to develop staff shareholdings. 
The company said in a statement that it does not comment on politicians' positions and said the group had gone from near bankruptcy to a leading position under Tavares' leadership.
It added that it had paid out as much to staff as to shareholders - 1.9 billion euros - and said that Tavares' pay was 90% variable depending on company performance and lower than at rivals GM and Ford.

Just over 52% of the company's shareholders voted on Wednesday against the compensation package in a consultative vote.

LONDON (Reuters) - Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said Russia may be in default because it tried to service its dollar bonds in roubles, which would be one of the starkest consequences to date of Moscow's exclusion from the Western financial system since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia's first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, though the Kremlin says the West is forcing a default by imposing crippling sanctions.
Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds - maturing in 2022 and 2042 - in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the securities.
Russia ""therefore may be considered a default under Moody's definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period,"" Moody's said in a statement on Thursday.
""The bond contracts have no provision for repayment in any other currency other than dollars.""
Moody's said that while some Russian eurobonds issued after 2018 allow payments in roubles under some conditions, those issued before 2018 - such as those maturing in 2022 and 2042 - do not. 
""Moody's view is that investors did not obtain the foreign-currency contractual promise on the payment due date,"" Moody's said.
The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier this month that if Russia is forced into a default, it will take legal action.
Before Putin's Feb. 24 order for what he casts as a special military operation in Ukraine, Russia was rated as investment grade. But its sovereign bonds have become a target in what the Kremlin says is an economic war waged by the United States. 
Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.
In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world's biggest foreign debt piles.
This time, Russia has the money but can't pay because the reserves - the world's fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada. 
DEFAULT 
As Russia could not and would not borrow right now, a default would be largely symbolic, marking the tumultuous finale to its post-Cold War attempt to integrate into the West's financial architecture.
While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt.
The U.S. Treasury this month halted Russia's ability to use foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions to pay its debt.
The Kremlin says the West has already defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its reserves, and that it wants a new system to replace the Bretton Woods financial architecture established by the Western powers in 1944.

S&P earlier this month lowered Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders.
Russia's economy is heading for the worst contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, with soaring inflation and capital flight.

SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shipments of some Apple products, as well as Dell and Lenovo laptops are likely to face delays if China's COVID-19 lockdowns persist, analysts said, as curbs force assemblers to shut down and closed-loop arrangements get harder to maintain. 
China's race to stop the spread of COVID-19 has jammed highways and ports, stranded workers and left countless factories awaiting government approval to reopen - disruptions that are rippling through global supply chains.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Pegatron Corp said this week it would suspend its plants in Shanghai and Kunshan, where according to supply chain experts it produces the iPhone 13, the iPhone SE series, and other legacy models.
Quanta Computer Inc, which produces some three-quarters of Apple's Macbooks globally, also shut operations, which could impact delivers more severely, analysts said.
The final impact on Apple's supply chain is uncertain and depends on factors including how long lockdowns persist. 
The company may also consider re-routing production out of Shanghai and Kunshan to factories elsewhere, such as Shenzhen, which currently is not under lockdown, analysts said.
""Apple may consider transferring the orders from Pegatron to Foxconn, but we expect the volume may be limited due to the logistics issue and the difficulty of equipment adjustment,"" said Taipei-based Eddie Han, a senior analyst at Isaiah Research. Foxconn is the trade name of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd .
As a worst-case scenario, Pegatron may fall behind on 6 million to 10 million iPhone units if the lockdowns last two months and Apple cannot reroute orders, Han said.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
The chief executives of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc have flagged huge economic costs if factories in Shanghai cannot resume production soon.
Shanghai is approaching its third week of lockdown and has shown no sign of a wide re-opening.
Forrest Chen, research manager at Trendforce told Reuters that if lockdowns lift in a few weeks, there is still a chance to recover.
However, ""if the lockdown lasts longer than two months, there is already no way to recover. At that point, after lockdown lifts, there would be a shortage for end-users,"" he said.
Some suppliers may be able to re-route production.
Unimicron Technology Corp, which makes printed circuit boards for companies including Apple, told Reuters the impact of the Kunshan lockdown so far has been minor and that it can rely on other plants in the Hubei province and Taiwan to support production.
But logistics and transport remain a nationwide issue, as cities across China enact measures.
One factory owner in Kunshan told Reuters that the district government had announced protocol for re-opening but provided no date for implementation. 

Laptop makers may also suffer, including Compal Electronics Inc, a Taiwan-based company that makes PCs for Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) Ltd from its plants in Kunshan. Chen estimates that roughly 50% of Compal's laptop production is located in Kunshan.
Compal told Reuters on Friday that it had not halted production in Kunshan. Dell and Lenovo did not respond to emails seeking comment.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Italian confectionary giant Ferrero said it will stop sourcing palm oil from Sime Darby Plantation after the United States found the Malaysian planter used forced labour, in a reputational blow for the palm producer and for Malaysia. 
Labour practices across the Southeast Asian country have come under scrutiny in the past two years, with six companies including Sime Darby banned by U.S. customs over forced labour allegations.
Palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil, is a key ingredient in Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread, giving the iconic products their smooth texture and shelf life.
""On 6th April, we have requested all our direct suppliers to stop supplying Ferrero with palm oil and palm kernel oil sourced indirectly from Sime Darby, until further notice,"" Ferrero told Reuters by email. 
""Ferrero will comply with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's decision,"" it said.
Although Ferrero buys relatively little of the edible oil from Sime Darby, its move - following similar halts by Cargill Inc,  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) and  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) - could hurt Sime Darby's standing as a leader in sustainably produced palm oil.
Sime Darby told Reuters it has taken steps in the area of human rights and that all its stakeholders who are committed to sustainability can be assured of its commitment and leadership in the industry. Ferrero is not a customer, it added. 
""We are also in regular communication with all key stakeholders, particularly customers who have their own commitments,"" it said. 
Sime Darby's shares were down 4% on Friday afternoon, weaker than the main Malaysian stock index, which was 0.3% lower.
""It's very critical that Sime move fast to further alleviate any concern following the departure of some of these key customers,"" said Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CGS-CIMB Research, adding that other buyers could also suspend purchases as the labour concerns drag on. 
Ferrero, responding to queries this week from Reuters about suppliers receiving its requests to stop buying from Sime Darby, said it does not buy directly from the Malaysian firm, which it said supplies 0.25% of its palm oil volumes.
MORE HALTS
Following a 2020 decision to ban imports due to the presence of ""forced labour indicators"" at Sime Darby, U.S. customs said in January it had sufficient evidence of forced labour and that the firm's goods were subject to seizure.
Ferrero said its products and brands in the United States had stopped sourcing from Sime Darby in January 2021. 
Sime Darby has promised ""sweeping changes"" to its governance and some labour practices following the U.S. finding. 
Palm oil is one of the cheapest and fastest-growing vegetable oils, used in products from food to cosmetics to biodiesel. But the industry has faced scrutiny over the years for widespread deforestation in Southeast Asia and exploitation of migrant workers.
Migrant workers from countries like Indonesia, India and Bangladesh account for around 80% of the palm oil labour force in Malaysia, the world's biggest producer of the commodity after neighbouring Indonesia.
Ferrero says it uses only certified sustainable palm oil. It sources 85% of its palm oil from Malaysia, which traditionally has a better reputation for sustainability than Indonesia. 
U.S. commodities trading giant Cargill, in a move not previously reported, said in March it had suspended purchases from Sime Darby pending more information on the firm's measures to address the labour allegations.
Cargill said on its website that Sime Darby had taken ""very constructive and potentially transformative"" steps, but it needed more information to determine whether the planter was meeting the trader's sustainability standards.
Sime Darby said its supply of bulk products to Cargill in India has been taken up by other customers. ""We value all our customers and are certainly in discussions with Cargill,"" it said. 

Cargill declined to say how much palm oil it sources from Sime Darby. 
Last year, U.S. food company General Mills said it has issued global ""no buy orders"" on Sime Darby while chocolate maker Hershey asked suppliers to ensure no Sime Darby oil enters its global operations.

Sales in the world's biggest auto market plunged in March as COVID curbs took their toll.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was among the automakers feeling the pain of limits on production.
The U.S. automaker has suspended production at its Shanghai plant since March 28, leading to an output loss of more than 40,000 units, according to Reuters calculations. The manufacturing hub in Shanghai makes 10,000 Model Ys and 6,000 Model 3s per week, said a person familiar with the matter.
Nio (NYSE:NIO) also suspended production at its Hefei factory - even though there were no local-level curbs - because suppliers from other areas had stopped work.

Carmakers with production facilities in China's northeastern provinces are resuming production as those places emerge from lockdowns.

About 54,000 cars with the engine have been sold in Japan since October 2020 and are for the market only, the spokesperson said, declining to comment on the number of cars affected by the shipment suspension.
Subaru has not decided whether to recall the cars and it would likely take 2-1/2 months before shipment is resumed, the spokesperson said. The company will continue to produce and ship models that do not use the CB18 engine, the spokesperson said.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk on Thursday stepped up criticism of the U.S. securities regulator, calling Securities and Exchange Commission officials ""bastards"" for bringing fraud charges against him over his 2018 tweets regarding taking the company private. 
On the day he made major news by unveiling a $43 billion cash takeover offer for social media company  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Musk aired his grievances toward the SEC during remarks at the TED Conference in Vancouver.
Musk, the world's richest person according to a Forbes tally, said funding to take his electrical car company private was actually secured at the time he posted his tweets, but the agency ""pursued the active public investigation nonetheless.""
""So I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards,"" Musk told the audience.
Musk said he felt forced to settle with the SEC because banks threatened to cease providing capital if he did not do so, which would have made Tesla bankrupt immediately. 
""So that's like having a gun to your child's head,"" Musk said.
""I was forced to admit that I lied to save Tesla's life and that's the only reason,"" Musk added.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines - and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman - to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by posting on Twitter that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The SEC said at the time his funding tweets ""lacked an adequate basis in fact."" 
A related consent decree also required Musk to obtain pre-clearance from Tesla lawyers for tweets and other public statements that could be material to Tesla.
A spokesperson for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Musk rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board last Saturday after disclosing his current more than 9% stake. He was required to have disclosed that he held a stake exceeding 5 percent in Twitter and is expected to invite regulatory scrutiny for missing a deadline to disclose such a stake and filing the wrong form, according to securities experts.

On launching his Twitter takeover bid, Musk said he made the offer because he believes ""it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech."" Musk said he believes Twitter's algorithm should be open-source and suggested the code behind it should be available on Github, a Microsoft-owned platform for sharing code for software development. 
Asked if he had the financing to do the deal, Musk said: ""I have sufficient assets. I can do it if possible."" He did not offer details.

(Reuters) - Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter sparked concerns among Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors and analysts that the electric carmaker could suffer as the chief executive becomes distracted by his takeover play and the possible sales of Tesla shares to fund the deal.
The billionaire entrepreneur, who also heads rocket company SpaceX, targeted  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday with a $43 billion takeover offer.
The idea of Musk working to close that deal, possibly by selling even more of his Tesla stake, and then overseeing yet another company has Tesla observers worried.
""Elon is distracted. He's got a lot of things going on. He's involved in a lot of different endeavors,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which owns shares in Tesla. ""This is a one to three months headwind to Tesla's stock.""
Shares of Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, fell more than 9% since he disclosed his more than 9% stake in Twitter last Monday. On Thursday, Tesla's stock fell 3.7%. 
While Musk has talked about potential changes he would like to see Twitter make, Tesla faces its own challenges - the need to boost production at new assembly plants in Berlin and Texas, analysts said. Meanwhile, Tesla's Shanghai factory - its largest - has been idled by the COVID-19 crackdown in China.
""Musk is Tesla, and investors don't want to see Tesla lose that leadership edge,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said. 
And investors have Musk's own words prior to this foray on which they base their fears. Last year, he said he worked seven days a week - ""crazy hours"" - splitting time between Tesla and SpaceX. He also leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and tunneling venture the Boring Company.
Another worry is how Musk will finance a potential deal for Twitter, which would include stock sales and massive loans, analysts said. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said Musk, who holds over a 9% stake in Twitter, would need $39 billion to complete the deal and the sale of more Tesla shares could pressure the stock further.
Tesla executives may pledge their company stock as collateral for loans, but the maximum loan does not exceed 25% of the total value of the pledged stock, according to company policy. 
This means that he could borrow $42.5 billion by pledging all of his shares worth $170 billion. But he already pledged over half of his Tesla shares as collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness, according to a Tesla filing last year. 
Musk said on Thursday he has the assets to buy Twitter, but has not provided details. 

The fortunes of the world's richest person consists largely of stocks at Tesla, and Space X. He sold over $16 billion Tesla shares late last year, $11 billion of which he said would be paid in taxes.
""He is potentially setting himself up for a huge liability down the road,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO saying the social media company needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech.
""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" Musk, already San Francisco-based Twitter's second-largest shareholder, said at a TED Talk in Vancouver when asked about his bid. 
Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public.
Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.
After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: ""It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.""
Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said.
Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday. 
Investors were not convinced. 
Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the ""largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,"" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it.
Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his ""best and final offer"" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.
""This is not a way to sort of make money,"" Musk said during the TED Talk.
""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk added.

Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said ""No"".
After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's U.S. Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""
In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.
White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Musk's offer for Twitter, saying that market regulators operate independently from political leadership.
Twitter employees, some of whom were panicked over Musk's impact on its ability to moderate content, attended an all-hands meeting on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source.
Musk said U.S. investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he ""had sufficient assets,"" without saying more. 
CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares.
Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation. 
'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'
Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.
Founded just two years after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users.
""The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
GRAPHIC: Twitter's stock market value https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkdxwkpx/Pasted%20image%201649950835786.png 
Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said. 
Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. 
""If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle – but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal – unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC.
Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter.
""It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.

Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company.
Asked if there was a ""Plan B"" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: ""There is.""

(Reuters) -Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal sought to reassure employees during an all-hands meeting on Thursday that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by news of Elon Musk's offer to buy the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
As Agrawal took questions from staff that were posted on the company's Slack messaging service, he encouraged employees to remain focused and told them ""we as employees control what happens,"" said the source, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The meeting came after news broke that the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive officer had offered to buy the social media company for $43 billion.
Agrawal told staff that the board was continuing to review Musk's offer, but that he was limited in what he could share with the employees.
In one section of the question and answer session, one employee asked how the company arrived to the decision to offer Musk a board seat. 
""Are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to the board?"" according to a section of the meeting heard by Reuters.
Agrawal responded that the board was acting in the best interest of shareholders. 
""I have a strong point of view that people who are critical of our service, their voice is something that we must emphasize so that we can learn and get better,"" he said. 
Another employee submitted a question asking Agrawal to address how he viewed Musk's definition of free speech and whether it aligned with how Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) approaches the concept. 
Agrawal did not directly address the question, saying much of the company's work was focused on continuously improving ""the health of conversation"" on Twitter.

Earlier in the Q&A, Agrawal said he believed ""Twitter stands for way more than one human, any human.""
A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -BMW Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said companies must be careful not to become too dependent on a select few countries by focusing only on electric vehicles, adding that there was still a market for combustion engine cars.
""When you look at the technology coming out, the EV push, we must be careful because at the same time, you increase dependency on very few countries,"" Zipse said at a roundtable in New York, highlighting that the supply of raw materials for batteries was controlled mostly by China.
""If someone cannot buy an EV for some reason but needs a car, would you rather propose he continues to drive his old car forever? If you are not selling combustion engines anymore, someone else will,"" said Zipse.
He has long advocated against all-out bans on combustion engine car sales in the face of rising pressure from regulators on the auto industry to curb its carbon emissions and environmental impact.
Offering more fuel-efficient combustion engine cars was key both from a profit perspective and an environmental perspective, Zipse argued, pointing to gaps in charging infrastructure and the high price of electric vehicles.

Companies also needed to plan for energy prices and raw materials to remain high by being more efficient in their production and stepping up recycling efforts to keep costs down, he said.
""We have a peak now, they might not stay at the peak, but they will not go back to former prices,"" he said. ""How much energy you need and use, and circularity, is important - for environmental reasons but even more for economic reasons.""

The company is testing at least nine Mac models with four different M2-based chips - the successors to the current M1 line - with third-party apps in its App store, according to the logs which were corroborated by people familiar with the matter, the report said.
Apple is also testing a Mac mini with an M1 Pro chip, the same processor used in the entry-level 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, the report added.
In March, Apple introduced a faster chip for a new desktop, a high point in Apple's move to power its devices with microprocessors designed in house.

Last year, Apple announced two new MacBook Pro models that run on more powerful in-house chips, furthering its break from previous supplier  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).

The trials that Nektar stopped included those involving a combination of its drug bempegaldesleukin with Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co's cancer drug Opdivo as well Merck & Co Inc's cancer drug Keytruda. 
Nektar and Bristol Myers were testing the combination therapy through an agreement signed in 2020, while the one with Keytruda involved a partnership entered with privately owned SFJ Pharmaceuticals last year. 
Nektar and Bristol Myers last month discontinued two late-stage studies testing their combination therapy in melanoma patients after one of the trials failed to meet its main goals.

On Thursday, Nektar and Bristol said the combination of drugs failed to meet goals in another late-stage study in patients with renal cell carcinoma, as well as in a study testing the therapy in urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.
With Nektar now halting multiple trials of its key drug, the company said it expects to announce a new strategic plan to rein in spending to meet its cash runway goals.

(Reuters) - ""My offer is my best and final offer.""
Elon Musk's $43 billion bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) takes a page out of Warren Buffett's take-it-or-leave-it playbook. But investment bankers, investors and analysts said he needed a blowout bid and more details on his financing for this strategy to work. They added that Musk's track record of reversing his positions also weighs against him.
Buffett is known for clinching large deals through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, such as the $11.6 billion deal to buy property and casualty reinsurer Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp and his $37 billion acquisition of aerospace equipment maker Precision Castparts Corp, by making only one offer and refusing to negotiate. 
These offers were viewed as fair by their acquisition targets and were backed by committed financing from Berkshire Hathaway. Musk's bid, on the other hand, was deemed too low by the market and too thin on financing details. 
In 2018, Musk, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of luxury electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, tweeted that there was ""funding secured"" for a $72 billion deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. He and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that he defrauded investors.
""Warren has demonstrated over 40 acquisitions in 60 years that when he says something, he does it. His word has enormous value. With Elon, I wouldn't trust him, ... there's no reliability there,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor at George Washington University who has written extensively on Buffett.
Musk and Buffett did not respond to requests for comment.
Musk's cash offer of $54.20 a share, which values the company at $43 billion, represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public. But it is lower than where Twitter shares were trading as recently as November. For most of 2021, the shares traded at more than $60.
Uninvolved investment bankers say the closest comparison would be  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s offer for Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc, which the payments firm withdrew last October after a negative investor response to its interest. The offer valued Pinterest at 17.4 times sales. By comparison, Musk's offer values Twitter at only 8.6 times sales.
Twitter shares ended trading on Thursday at $45.08, a 1.75% drop since Musk unveiled his $54.20 per share offer, reflecting wide investor skepticism that a deal will happen.
""I don't think the Twitter board will have a really hard time saying no to this deal. It's not an excessive premium and it's not excessively valued now,"" said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for merger arbitrage at Kellner Capital.
A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
FINANCING DETAILS THIN 
Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla shares last year, about 10% of his stake in the electric car maker, partly to settle a tax obligation. 
It's not clear how much of that Musk now has available for a Twitter bid, and it's possible that he could sell more Tesla shares or borrow against them. He provided no details about his financing in a regulatory filing on Thursday. 
A leveraged buyout is typically 60% to 80% financed with debt, so Musk would likely have to come up with an equity check of at least $10 billion. He could get partners, such as private equity firms, to help fund his contribution. 
Another question is banks' willingness to provide debt for the deal given the uncertainty of how Twitter would be run if owned by Musk. He has criticized Twitter's current management but he has not disclosed who the replacement would be. He has also spoken against Twitter's relying on advertising, despite its comprising the majority of its revenue.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is Musk's lead bank working on the bid.
Musk said in the offer letter that he would reconsider his position as a shareholder if Twitter rejects his offer. Later on Thursday, however, he hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid whereby he would bypass Twitter's board. 
He tweeted that Twitter shareholders should get to vote on the deal and posted a poll asking for Twitter users' opinion on the subject. Typically, a company will put a deal to a shareholder vote only once its board of directors has approved it.

If Musk is willing to make another offer despite calling his first bid ""best and final,"" analysts said his chances for a deal would improve significantly, given his resources as the world's richest man.
""The board could see a case to reject the first offer and explore options for a higher price,"" Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), wrote on Thursday.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Oreo-maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestle and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) face pushback from workers in Ukraine and eastern Europe angered by the companies' decisions to maintain some business in Russia, according to internal corporate communications reviewed by Reuters and interviews with six workers.
The emerging employee activism comes on top of Ukraine's repeated appeals to Western companies to go beyond current sanctions and cut all commercial ties with Russia, with the mayor of Kviv calling such payments to Moscow ""bloody money"".
To be sure, the employees speaking out, or even resigning in some cases, over the companies' response to Russia's invasion are mainly based in Ukraine, Poland or Eastern Europe and are a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of workers the food makers employ.
An internal memo seen by Reuters shows Nestle has seen an unspecified number of Ukraine employees quit and others bullied on social media for remaining with a company doing business with Russia.
Roughly 130 employees at Mondelez in the Baltics region encompassing Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia sent a petition in March to CEO Dirk Van de Put to stop all business in Russia, an action not previously reported.
One Ukraine employee of Mondelez interviewed by Reuters expressed shock and dismay that their company was still promoting ""The Batman"" Oreo cookies in Russia and offering chances to win up to 500,000 roubles ($6,000) on an Oreo website. https://oreo.ru
The website showed cinema tickets and hats being awarded as recently as Wednesday https://oreo.ru/Home/WinnersList to winners whose phone numbers start with the Russian country code.
Another website promoting Milka chocolates https://promo.milka.ru offered Russian residents up to 20% cash back on purchases and prizes in a promotion that started March 15, three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.
""The Batman"" movie was pulled from release in Russia one week before it was scheduled to reach theatres. 
Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) Inc, which owns the movie studio that made ""The Batman"", communicated the move to its partners, such as Mondelez, but had no influence over whether ""The Batman""-branded product is removed from shelves, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mondelez did not respond directly to questions about the ""The Batman"" Oreos or Milka promotions but said it has no advertising on air in Russia. The company said it would suspend advertising media spending March 9.
Consumer goods companies, including Unilever (NYSE:UL) and P&G, have said they are continuing business in Russia because some of their items are necessities, like diapers or milk, that everyday Russians need. They also are supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. 
Nestle, PepsiCo and Mondelez, three of the world's biggest packaged food makers by market capitalization, have not disclosed which brands are still sold in Russia, or what they consider to be essential. 
The Mondelez petition said workers ""strongly oppose"" the company's decision to remain in Russia, according to screenshots of an internal social media posting shared with Reuters by an employee. The employee declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
""Each Russian ruble paid to the state budget in the form of taxes and salaries (helps the) aggressor supply its army and kill even more Ukrainian people, among which there are children, women, elderly people,"" the employee petition states, according to the screenshots. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory and denies targeting civilians.
Mondelez European President Vinzenz Gruber responded to the post, saying that ""our culture (at Mondelez) includes everyone who shares our values and calls for peace,"" according to the screenshot.
""We stand by our colleagues and not by their governments/country decisions,"" Gruber wrote.
""We appreciate that our employees are speaking up and are sharing their voice on this heartbreaking and senseless war,"" Chicago-based Mondelez said in a statement. ""We have heard a range of different voices from colleagues around the world, and our leaders are in active dialogue with their teams as we manage day-to-day operations."" 
'MENTALLY BROKEN'
In addition to 19 posts on internal corporate message boards, one worker at PepsiCo, two at Mondelez and three at Nestle separately told Reuters that they want to see their employers take a stronger stand against Russia. 
""Our grandparents told us terrible stories"" about Russian actions in Poland during World War Two, said Patrycja Stas, 40, a manager at Pepsi in Warsaw. ""I see the same thing is repeating in Ukraine, and it is extremely depressing."" 
Stas told Reuters she is leaving her job for reasons independent of the war but said that Pepsi's ongoing business in Russia showed her she made the right decision. 
Although Pepsi suspended sales of soda in Russia, it continues to sell what it calls ""daily essentials,"" including snacks and dairy products. Pepsi declined to comment. 
The company, which had more than 3,100 employees in Ukraine, is using its headquarters in Poland to offer shelter to those leaving Ukraine.
The head of Nestle's European business, Marco Settembri, in an internal email seen by Reuters said in March that he was ""saddened to hear that employees are resigning"" and ""deeply concerned to hear of employees being bullied and threatened"" on social media. The memo was sent to the head of Nestle's business services center in Lviv, Ukraine, as well as other executives including the company's head of human resources and head of crisis management. 
Nestle had roughly 5,800 employees in Ukraine at the start of the war, but a significant number have now left the country, a Nestle spokesperson said.
Sofia Vashchenko, a manager who for nearly eight years worked in web content at Nestle in Lviv, Ukraine, before quitting this month, said in a post on LinkedIn that her team of about 20 people was ""mentally broken"" after listening to a Europe-wide webcast where Nestle's Settembri said the company would continue to support colleagues in Russia in response to a question about the company's operations there.
""People who are in the middle of a war with the Russian military don't want to hear that,"" she said last week in an interview.
Nestle initially only halted its advertising and capital investments in Russia, drawing anger from both its own employees and Ukraine officials over selling KitKat bars to Moscow.
Some Lviv-based employees sent Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider an open letter on Nestle's internal messaging board, seen by Reuters, in March saying ""our people feel betrayed"" by the company's continued operations in Russia. 
Later that month, Nestle said it was halting the sale of a wide range of its brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik.
Nestle is still selling essentials, such as baby food, in Russia but said it was donating profits to charity. The three employees interviewed by Reuters want greater transparency about what items the company considers essential.
""We have been focused on the safety and security of our Ukrainian colleagues and doing all we can to support them and their families,"" a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that it has been giving people advance salary payments, one-off payments to support relocations and offering people jobs in other Nestle operating companies.
In response to a question about reports of Ukrainian employees refusing to speak with Russian colleagues, Nestle told Reuters that it ""immediately organized for all activities serving Nestle Russia to be handled out of Russia directly,"" a move that separated employees there from those in Ukraine.
""Of course I don't want to work with people in Russia. We don't know who is OK with the war,"" Lviv-based Nestle employee Mariana said on Tuesday. She asked that her last name not be used because she is not authorized to talk with the media. 

""In (my team) we've stopped working with Russia and never want to work with them again.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday at the end of a holiday-shortened week as bond yields resumed their uphill climb and investors contended with mixed earnings and economic data. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes posted weekly losses ahead of the Good Friday holiday.
""It’s a combination of continued worries still there,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's a mixed bag earning season so far, and that, coupled with high inflation and the hawkish Fed have led to selling ahead of the holiday weekend."" 
Rising 10-year Treasury yields pressured growth stocks, dragging the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq deeply into negative territory, while the Dow posted a more modest loss.[US/]
""The higher yields pressure higher growth stocks as their net present value ... takes a hit when yields go higher,"" Detrick said. 
A quartet of large U.S. banks shifted the first quarter reporting season into overdrive, with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co all posting results.
While all four beat Street estimates, they also reported steep profit declines. Their share price reaction was mixed, and were last moving in the range of up 1.6% (Citigroup) to down by 4.5% (Wells Fargo). The broader S&P 500 Finance index fell 1.0%.
""There’s some concerns this earnings season,"" Detrick added. ""Expectations are the lowest since the recovery started and it's got investors cautious of how companies will step up to the earnings altar in the comings weeks.""
A host of economic data showed spiking gasoline prices helped retail sales beat consensus and prompted the largest jump in import prices in nearly 11 years.
The data falls in lockstep with other recent indicators, which appear to cement aggressive inflation-curbing actions from the Federal Reserve in the coming months, including a series of 50 basis point interest rate hikes.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chairman Elon Musk offered to take  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) private with a $41 billion cash offer. The social media company's shares oscillated throughout the session but closed down 1.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.36 points, or 0.33%, to 34,451.23, the S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.21%, to 4,392.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51 points, or 2.14%, to 13,351.08.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, tech shares fared the worst, sliding 2.5%.
The first-quarter reporting season is still in its infancy, with 34 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported.
Analysts now expect aggregate annual S&P 500 earnings growth of 6.3%, less optimistic than the 7.5% growth projected at the beginning of the year.
Thursday marked the monthly expiration for options contracts, an occurrence that has in the recent past helped amplify stock market gyrations as investors make adjustments to account for millions of expiring options contracts on stocks, ETFs and indexes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 218 new lows.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras on Thursday formally elected Jose Mauro Coelho as its chief executive for a one-year term, ending weeks of turmoil in which the government struggled to fill the top position.
Coelho, a government technocrat, pledged to maintain the company's current pricing policy, a controversial topic that ultimately helped bring down his two predecessors.
The oil giant pegs its fuel prices to international crude prices rather than subsidising fuel for Brazilians.
This is an election year and many Brazilians have demanded that Petrobras limit price increases for gasoline and diesel, which have soared recently, hurting President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity.
""Market prices are a necessary condition to create a competitive business environment, attract investment and new players, expand the country's infrastructure, and secure supply,"" the new CEO said during his inaugural speech.
He also said the company would keep divesting from mature, smaller oilfields and refineries, while focusing on the pre-salt and deepwater fields.
Coelho was Bolsonaro's second pick to replace retired army general Joaquim Silva e Luna, who was ousted in March after disagreeing with the far-right leader on the firm's fuel pricing policy.
Bolsonaro initially tapped well-known academic and energy consultant Adriano Pires for the role, but he ended up turning it down as he could not reconcile his consulting job with Petrobras' command, paving the way for Coelho's nomination.
Coelho previously served as the secretary of oil, gas and biofuels at Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry.
NEW BOARD
Coelho's election came right after the company voted him onto its board earlier in the day, as under Petrobras' statutes the chief executive is required to be on the board.
A new composition for the 11-strong board was also approved at the Petrobras annual shareholder meeting, which began on Wednesday afternoon and concluded early on Thursday, expanding minority shareholder footprint.
Since the government tapped Coelho, his ascent was widely expected. The rest of the board was a more contentious issue.
The government, which holds a controlling stake in the company, held seven seats going into the meeting while market investors had three representatives and company workers had one.
But market shareholders successfully increased their representation to four at the meeting, a list provided by the company showed, including billionaire businessman Jose Joao Abdalla Filho. As a result, the government is now down to six representatives.

Analysts at Itau BBA said the meeting was an important milestone in returning Petrobras to its day-to-day business after weeks of turmoil, ""as well as to bringing more balance to the composition of the board and strengthening the company’s governance.""
Brazil-traded preferred shares in Petrobras were down 0.8% at 31.40 reais in afternoon trading, in line with a 0.7% drop in the broader Bovespa stock index.

CAMERON, Louisiana (Reuters) - Top U.S. liquefied natural gas producer Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) on Thursday said surging U.S. natural gas prices reflect past underinvestment followed by ""a demand shock"" as Europe seeks to wean itself from Russian gas, and that high prices will spur more production that will benefit consumers. 
Gas traded at the main U.S. hub hit $7.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtus) on Thursday, up 96% this year to a 13-year high on record demand. Those prices has companies that consume lots of natural gas calling for curbs on new LNG plants. 
""What we are going through now is a demand shock to the industry that came after a relatively long period of underinvestment,"" Executive Vice President Anatol Feygin said in an interview at Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal. 
""We think the resource is there and our ability to attract that resource and bring it into the right markets will ultimately result in a more attractive domestic gas price,"" he added.
Feygin said its existing Louisiana and Texas operations, which together can supply up to 45 million tonnes per year, have ample unused space that could allow for future expansions. 
The spike in LNG demand from Europe, as buyers steer clear of Russian gas over its invasion of Ukraine, has not changed Cheniere's focus on its Asia markets, he said. 
""Ultimately the driver of growth for energy demand, for natural gas and LNG, we think is going to continue to be Asia. The plurality of those long-term, 20 plus year agreements have been with Asian counterparties,” Feygin said.

Cheniere's success has encouraged rivals to propose several new plants along the U.S. Gulf coast. Competition from lower-cost projects has not changed Cheniere's strategy, he said. 
LNG buyers looking to strike deals with new and untested firms are ""taking risks of that project developer being able to perform,"" he said. ""We compete in a differentiated space.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a stable of businesses ranging from electric cars to private rocket ships, iconoclastic billionaire Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world by building a fortune firmly planted in 21st century technology. With an all-cash $43 billion offer to buy  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Musk may soon emulate the tycoons of the past by controlling a media platform that contributed to his rise to fame. 
Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), revealed the takeover bid in a regulatory filing made public on Thursday and said he would take Twitter private.
Owning Twitter would be the next evolution of a polarizing figure. Musk has earned Wall Street's admiration and ire by combining the free-flowing obsessions of aerospace visionary Howard Hughes (NYSE:HHC) with an intense focus on revolutionizing auto production reminiscent of Henry Ford into a new model of a billionaire who is as likely to take on short-sellers as he is to shoot a red luxury sports car into orbit, as he did in 2018. 
""Whatever your feelings on Musk, he would certainly shake things up, with the only question as to whether he would make things worse or improve them,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
Musk, 50, has a $273.6 billion fortune estimated by Forbes that makes him the wealthiest person in the world, worth $92.3 billion more than runner-up Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother and South African father and later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997. 
He did not invent rockets or electric cars, nor did he found Tesla, which he has led from 2008. But his insight that Tesla's electric cars should be high-performance machines with sophisticated, smartphone-style software revolutionized the global auto business, prompting established companies to try to catch up while spurring new, all-electric competitors such as startup Rivian. 
While many initially expected Tesla to fail - which it almost did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and in 2017-2018 when it stumbled through what Musk called ""manufacturing hell"" in the launch of its high-volume Model 3 sedan - the company began turning quarterly profits in 2020. 
Wall Street has underscored Tesla's achievement by lifting the company's market capitalization to more than $1 trillion - more than all three Detroit automakers plus  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, combined - and making it the fourth-largest company in the benchmark S&P 500 index, the backbone of millions of Americans' retirement savings plans. 
At the same time, his company SpaceX, led day to day by President Gwynne Shotwell, has upended space launch industry incumbents by developing rockets capable of putting satellites into space and returning to Earth for re-use.
Perhaps more than any other person, Musk has helped bring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with Tesla holding about $2 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and the company among the few to accept dogecoin as payment. 
Musk has run through a trail of subordinates who could not keep pace or got fed up with his relentless demands. Even his largest shareholders have appeared to lose patience with him at times. Noted stock picker Cathie Wood, whose outsized position in Tesla powered her ARK Innovation ETF to the best performance of any U.S. fund in 2020, suggested at a conference on Tuesday that she is put off by Musk's ""antics"" and has little contact with him personally. 
Labor advocates have criticized Musk for hostility toward unions. Musk has also clashed with former business associates, state and federal regulators, and Wall Street figures such as short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. Chanos came under fire from Musk for suggesting that Musk's production estimates for Tesla and his tunnel business The Boring Company were unattainable. 
""What bothers me is not so much the personal stuff and the personal attacks. I'm used to that. It's the willingness to say things that I think he knows are a stretch, to be polite,"" Chanos told CNBC in 2018. 
Reuters, too, has faced his ire, with Musk tweeting in 2018 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1014800936198213633 that a reporter misled the public about Model 3 production and ""followed that up with mean tweet to me"" on his birthday.
GLOBAL REACH
Twitter helped Musk become a household name. He has 81 million followers and built a pop culture following large enough to help him earn a spot hosting the venerable U.S. comedy TV show ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2021. 
A Twitter takeover would add Musk to the long line of U.S. business tycoons who solidified their fortunes with media properties, ranging from William Randolph Hearst in the late 19th century to Jack Welch's 1986 decision to buy the parent company of broadcast network NBC while he was chief executive of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). 
Musk has used Twitter to go after short-sellers large and small. He also has posted everything from Dad jokes to polls on what he should do with his unrealized gains from Tesla's surging stock price. 

His Twitter content has been the source of an ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the agency requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said he defrauded investors, though the settlement included no admission by Musk or an indication of innocence. Musk has since accused the SEC of ""unrelenting harassment."" 
""Twitter has been intertwined with Musk's global reach, which is why he feels so passionately about the platform,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""But for the Twitter board this is a living nightmare because unless they want to eat lawsuits for breakfast they have to find another bidder.""

(Reuters) - Automaker Stellantis has signed a multiyear deal to use Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s next-generation connected-car technology in its vehicle lineup, the companies said on Thursday.
Fourteen Stellantis brands, including Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat and Jeep, will use Qualcomm's vehicle cockpit and 5G telematics technology starting in 2024 with the Maserati brand being the first out the gate, said the companies, which did not disclose the deal value.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a statement the collaboration helps the company more closely manage the complete electronics supply chain. 
Qualcomm general manager of automotive, Nakul Duggal, told Reuters more automakers are working directly with chip makers rather than just relying on their other suppliers to act as a go-between.
“If you go back even a couple of years, it was quite uncommon for (automakers) to make a decision like this,"" Duggal said. ""This is now becoming much more common.""
He added Qualcomm’s recent acquisition of self-driving tech software company Arriver gives its so-called ""digital chassis"" the ability to offer a full set of driver assistance and self-driving capabilities in addition to cockpit and telematic technology. But the deal with Stellantis this time does not include that newer offering.
Qualcomm said that since it first unveiled its driver assistance and self-driving system - called Snapdragon Ride - in 2020, its automotive business deal pipeline has increased to $13 billion last year from $3 billion in 2017.

In a statement the two companies said the in-car communication and infotainment systems for Stellantis is being designed and engineered together with tech giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Taiwanese manufacturing company Foxconn. 
(The story is updated to correct spelling of Qualcomm automotive general manager's last name to Duggal)

LONDON (Reuters) - Crypto entrepreneur Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Estavi made headlines in March 2021 when he paid $2.9 million for an NFT of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) boss Jack Dorsey's first tweet. But his efforts to re-sell it have run aground, with a top bid of just $6,800 as of Thursday.
The initial purchase was at the time among the most expensive sales of a non-fungible token, or NFT, and came amid a flurry of interest in the niche crypto assets which have since generated billions of dollars in sales.
Estavi put the tweet up for resale on the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea last week, initially asking for $48 million.
That price tag was removed after offers in the first week were in the low hundreds of dollars. As of Thursday, the highest bid was 2.2 of the cryptocurrency ether - equivalent to around $6,800.
""My offer to sell was high and not everyone could afford it,"" Estavi, who was recently freed from jail in Iran, told Reuters via Twitter direct message, adding that he was no longer sure if he would sell the NFT.
""It's important to me who wants to buy it, I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not think everyone deserves this NFT,"" Estavi said. 
NFTs are a form of crypto asset which can record the ownership of a digital file such as an image, video or text.
There is no guarantee of an NFT's value and the market is rife with scams, fraud, counterfeits and market manipulation.
But Estavi was confident in the value of his purchase.
""This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world,"" he said.
""VICTIM OF CRYPTO""
Estavi, who lives in Malaysia, said he had been arrested last May during a trip to Iran and held in solitary confinement until he was freed in February. Iranian state media reported in May 2021 that he was accused of ""disrupting the country's economic system"".
Estavi said he had been arrested because of the growth of his crypto exchange, Bridge Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and described himself as a ""victim of crypto"". 
Reuters was unable to independently verify these details. 
""I need the support of the cryptocurrency community,"" Estavi told Reuters. 

While announcing the NFT sale in a tweet on April 6, he pledged to give 50% of the proceeds - which he expected to be at least $25 million - to charity.
He said the rest would go to support Bridge Oracle.

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks finished lower while bond yields and the dollar rose on Thursday as investors worried about the potential for aggressive U.S. policy tightening as other central banks around the world moved to reduce support. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped, following two days of declines, after a flurry of U.S. economic data such as retail sales and jobless claims and the European Central Bank's announcement of less aggressive than expected tightening plans. 
New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Reserve should reasonably consider raising interest rates by a half percentage point at its next meeting in May, which was seen as a further sign that even more cautious policymakers are on board with bigger rate hikes. 
This was after the ECB said it plans to cut bond purchases - known as quantitative easing - this quarter, then end them at some point in the third quarter.
Investors also eyed hefty rate hikes by New Zealand's central bank and the Bank of Canada, and a surprise rate hike by the Bank of Korea as well as policy tightening by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
These moves all exacerbated bond yield increases and stock price declines, according to Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones who also noted that Thursday's data showed the Fed's need to act fast.
""All systems are go for the Fed to move pretty aggressively,"" said Mahajan. ""Generally it's a global battle to fight inflationary pressures.""
U.S. stocks had gained on Wednesday on hopes that price increases could be peaking. But Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut, saw Thursday's trading action as a sign that there was little conviction behind those hopes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.36 points, or 0.33%, to 34,451.23 while the S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.21%, to 4,392.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51 points, or 2.14%, to 13,351.08.
After the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.67% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71%.
""Today's probably the right reaction,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""Until inflation is under control, it's not under control. There's too much uncertainty.""
Samana also pointed to the tone of the ECB's comments about threats to growth heading in the wrong direction will risks to inflation are ""to the upside.""
Meanwhile in forex, the euro plunged to a two-year low against the dollar as comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde were viewed as a sign that the bank was in no rush to raise interest rates.
The dollar index rose 0.524%, with the euro down 0.52% to $1.0828.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.21% versus the greenback at 125.94 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3076, down 0.30% on the day. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 36/32 in price to yield 2.8275%, from 2.689% late on Wednesday.
Along with the moves by Seoul and Singapore, New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points on Wednesday, the biggest hike in over two decades. The Bank of Canada also raised rates by the same level, making its biggest single move in more than two decades and flagging more hikes to come.

Investing.com -- The Dow stumbled Thursday to close our the shortened U.S. trading week with a loss as mostly better-than-expected quarterly results from major Wall Street banks failed to spark a revival amid a sea of red in tech. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.33%, or 113 points lower, the S&P 500 fell 1.22%, the Nasdaq slipped 2.1%.
Major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. But  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell more than 4% after reporting a decline in quarterly report.
The fall in bank stocks comes in the wake of rising Treasury yields, which tend to boost the margins on loans made by banks, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lean aggressive on monetary policy tightening to curb inflation pressures.
The pace of the surge in yields has placed growth sectors of the market in the crosshairs, with big tech leading the decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were down more than 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) failed to hold onto its gains as many doubt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk’s $54.20 a share offer to take the social media company private will succeed.
“In our view, the deal does not get done at this level, and Twitter's Board will not view this offer, or Mr. Musk leading a change in the company as in the best interest of the company or shareholders,” Wedbush said in a note..
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Group, a major Dow component, ended the day in the red despite better-than-expected quarterly results and an increase in full-year guidance.
Energy sidestepped the selloff, underpinned by rising oil prices on fears about tightening global supplies as Russia and Ukraine look set to engage in a massive land battle in Eastern Ukraine.
On the economic front, investors digested a weaker picture as data showed initial jobless claims rose more than expected, while the latest retail sales report flagged the impact of red-hot inflation on the consumer.
Still economists remain sanguine on the strength of the consumer, citing excess savings built up during the pandemic.  
“[W]e remain quite constructive on the outlook, because of the combination of excess savings and robust wage growth, particularly in the bottom half of the income distribution” {{Jefferies said in a note.}}

GDANSK (Reuters) - Polish video game maker CD Projekt said on Thursday it would release an expansion of its flagship ""Cyberpunk 2077"" game next year, after announcing full-year net profit that topped expectations.
The studio also behind the Witcher franchise said its full-year net profit reached 208.9 million zlotys ($48.7 million), compared with 194 million expected by analysts.
Cyberpunk, which took eight years to make and cost 1.2 billion zlotys, was one of the most anticipated games of 2020, but after a bug-ridden start it was kept off  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation Store for six months.
The company's revenue came in at 888.2 million zlotys, driven by Cyberpunk sales, but was 58% down from the record 2020 figure it reported in the game's debut year.
""We think the (profit) beat may have been driven by solid sales of CP77 and Witcher titles, as gamer engagement appears to be improving across the industry,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a note.
Still, the planned 2023 release of the Cyberpunk expansion after a delay to ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" version for next-generation consoles announced on Wednesday, may further worsen sentiment around the stock, they said.
CD Projekt had said it had taken work on the version back in-house and postponed the release, previously planned for the second quarter, though it said on Thursday there was no ""monumental"" delay.
The Polish company has been working on fixing Cyberpunk ever since its launch, and has released eight updates so far.
It said it had sold more than 18 million copies of the game so far, compared with more than 13.7 million it earlier said it had sold in its debut year.
""We are now satisfied with the game and encouraged by the gamers' reception of its next-gen console edition, which launched this February,"" Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said in a statement.
Cyberpunk is rated an average 6.5 out of 10 on review aggregator website Metacritic for its version on PlayStation 5, compared with a 3.7 score for the older generation version.

CD Projekt also said it had so far sold more than 65 million copies of its medieval fantasy The Witcher franchise, including more than 40 million copies of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc could lose as much as $3 billion from its Russia exposures, $2 billion less than previously forecast, the bank said on Thursday while reporting a nearly halving of its first-quarter profit. 
The bank said it had reduced its total exposure to Russia since December by $2 billion to $7.8 billion and that it would now lose no more than $3 billion in a severely adverse scenario, down from the nearly $5 billion estimated last month.
The disclosure came as Citi - the most global of the U.S. banks - added $1.9 billion to its reserves in the quarter to prepare for losses from direct exposures in Russia and the economic impact of the Ukraine war.
That pushed credit costs to $755 million, a contrast with the $2.1 billion benefit a year ago when it freed up loss reserves built during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The turn was a key factor in driving net income down 46% from a year earlier.
Still, the resulting earnings per share of $2.02 per share beat the $1.55 estimate from analysts who had feared worse.
Citi shares rose on the report and were up 1.4% in afternoon trading.
""This was in line with our hopes for what we would see,"" said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management and a long-time investor in the bank who said he was ""pleasantly surprised.""
The reduced Russia exposure was a plus. ""They appear to have navigated and managed down their risk,"" Kaser said. 
Revenue fell 2% to $19.2 billion, less than some analysts had expected. 
A key factor was a 43% slump in investment banking revenue as last year's rush of deals involving blank-check companies tapered off, drying up underwriting fees. Equity underwriting revenue plunged 78%.
Revenue from Treasury and Trade Solutions - Citi's crown jewel business - rose 18% due to higher net interest income and fee growth.
""While the geopolitical and macro environment has become more volatile, we are executing the strategy we announced at our recent Investor Day,"" Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said in the results announcement.
Fraser later told analysts she had personally felt the added challenge of the pandemic when she had what she called ""a brief encounter with COVID."" 
Fraser is leading an overhaul of Citi, which lags the financial performance of peers and has to carry out orders from U.S. banking regulators to fix its risk and compliance systems.
Her push has, however, driven up costs, with expenses rising 10% in the quarter excluding those for divestitures of the Asia consumer business.
BUYBACKS
Citi has been using excess capital to buy back shares. Unlike other big banks, its stock trades at a discount to its net worth, making buybacks attractive.
The bank returned $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1 billion in dividends, and its share count was 6% lower than a year earlier.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects to do a ""modest"" level of buybacks in the second quarter that would be less than the $3 billion in the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters after the bank posted results. 
The first quarter repurchases came as Citi's capital account was hurt by unrealized losses on securities as a result of the recent rise in interest rates. 
Its Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio fell to 11.4% from 12.2% in December. The bank expects to have the ratio back up to 12% by year-end as earnings add to its capital, Mason said.
Citi needs about $7 billion of capital to meet that goal and expects about $4 billion to come as it closes previously announced sales of consumer banking businesses in Asia, Mason told analysts.
A similar, but worse, capital ratio decline was reported by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday, deepening concerns among investors that bank buybacks would be constrained this year.

Citigroup expects additional capital to come from the sales of its consumer businesses outside of the United States.
In Mexico, the bank is finding ""significant interest"" from potential buyers of its Citibanamex franchise, Fraser told analysts. It could still take ""a few quarters"" to dispose of the asset, she said.

64,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc is in early talks with possible buyers of its Mexico consumer banking business Citibanamex, executives said on Thursday, while cautioning that the sale process would be complex and could take a few quarters to complete.
Citi disclosed in January that it was looking for a buyer for the unit, Mexico's No. 3 consumer bank, which has struggled to trim costs to become more competitive with rivals like Spain's BBVA (BME:BBVA) and Santander (BME:SAN). 
Analysts have estimated that the bank, which Citi bought for $12.5 billion in 2001, could fetch between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Citi Chief Executive Jane Fraser told analysts that the bank was ""attracting a lot of attention"" in the talks with buyers, calling the sale a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""
Various potential bidders for the business have already surfaced, including Mexico's Grupo Financiero Banorte as well as Santander. 

Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters that recent geopolitical events could make the franchise more appealing to others than when Citi first announced its intention to sell.
Mason and Fraser both said the exit process was complex and could still include an initial public offering, with the CEO adding that it was unclear whether a deal would be completed this year or next.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Thursday as a wave of mostly better-than-expected quarterly results from major Wall Street banks failed to lift investor sentiment as tech stocks resumed their trend lower.
The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%, or 101 points lower, the Nasdaq slipped 1.4%.
Major Wall Street banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported first-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. But  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell more than 5% after reporting a decline in quarterly report.
The fall in bank stocks comes in the wake of rising Treasury yields, which tend to boost the margins on lending for banks, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lean aggressive on monetary policy tightening to curb inflation pressures.
The pace of the surge in yields has placed growth sectors of the market in the crosshairs, with big tech leading the decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 2%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were down more than 1%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) turned negative as many doubt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk’s $54.20 a share offer to take the social media company private will succeed.
“In our view, the deal does not get done at this level, and Twitter's Board will not view this offer, or Mr. Musk leading a change in the company as in the best interest of the company or shareholders,” Wedbush said in a note..
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Group, a major Dow component, was up 0.5% after cutting intraday losses following better-than-expected quarterly results and an increase in full-year guidance.
Energy, up about 1%, attempted to cushion the broader decline, underpinned by rising oil prices on fears about tightening global supplies as Russia and Ukraine look set to engage in a massive land battle in Eastern Ukraine.
On the economic front, investors digested a weaker picture as data showed initial jobless claims rose more than expected, while the latest retail sales report flagged the impact of red-hot inflation on the consumer.
Still economists remain sanguine on the strength of the consumer, citing excess savings built up during the pandemic.  
“[W]e remain quite constructive on the outlook, because of the combination of excess savings and robust wage growth, particularly in the bottom half of the income distribution” {{Jefferies said in a note.}}

Investing.com --  Redfin  Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN) stock tumbled 4% Thursday after it told investors that early-stage homebuying demand continues to falter this spring. 
New listings fell 7% from the previous year, according to the company's latest report. 
""At the same time, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate shot up to 5% and the median asking price climbed to $397,747, sending the typical homebuyer’s monthly payment up 35% year over year to an all-time high of $2,288,"" the technology-powered real estate brokerage explained.
Redfin pointed to ""key early indicators"" that show a softening of demand, including fewer Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""homes for sale,"" Redfin's seasonally adjusted Homebuyer Demand Index has declined 3% in the past four weeks compared to a 5% rise in the previous year, and mortgage purchase applications falling 6% year-on-year.
""There really is a limit to homebuyer demand, even though the market over the past few years has made it seem endless,” said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather. 
“The sharp increase in mortgage rates is pushing more homebuyers out of the market, but it also appears to be discouraging some homeowners from selling. With demand and supply both slipping, the market isn’t likely to flip from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market anytime soon.”
A Redfin real estate agent in Boston was quoted as saying that every recent offer has faced multiple other offers, but some people have finally had enough and are pulling out as they become less willing to make a risky offer.

(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co posted a 21% drop in first-quarter profit but beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, as the release of funds set aside to cover potential pandemic-related loan losses cushioned a decline in mortgage lending. 
The fourth-largest U.S. lender posted a $3.67 billion profit, or 88 cents per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of 80 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. Total revenue fell 5% to $17.59 billion, compared with estimates of $17.8 billion.
Shares in the bank fell more than 3%. Analysts said that reflected investor worries that the bank's profits were flattered by the release $1.1 billion in reserves it set aside for pandemic-related losses that did not materialize, while the bank also failed to meet expectations on reducing expenses.
""Total revenue was slightly below expectations, with mixed results,"" wrote Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.
Big U.S. banks are unveiling first quarter results as the Federal Reserve moves to hike interest rates to tame surging inflation and as the conflict in Ukraine is causing volatility and uncertainty in the broader global economy. That could start to dampen consumer spending and loan growth, analysts said. 
So far, however, the American consumer remains healthy and is spending, and inflation is not currently a credit risk, said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo. 
Consumer spending has been rising for months as the United States emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and many make up for lost time traveling, shopping and dining out.
""People come into this in a pretty healthy position to deal with any potential challenges,"" he said on a conference call. ""Inflation is definitely having an impact on people. But so far that hasn't translated into any real stress from a credit perspective,"" said Santomassimo. 
Those factors, along with 3% loan growth and Fed rate hikes, led the bank to raise its guidance for full-year net interest income (NII) to around 15% from 8% last quarter. NII, a closely-watched measure of how much money banks make from lending, rose 5% during the quarter. 
Wells Fargo leans heavily on revenue from its consumer and corporate banking business, as it does not have a large capital markets division compared with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM).
Overall average loans grew 3%, boosted by credit card and auto lending, which rose 6% and 10% respectively. Debit card purchase volumes were up 6%, while credit card point-of-sale volumes grew 33%. Mortgage loans, however, fell 33% from a year ago on lower originations and gains from home sales.
""They had some headwinds from mortgage banking. But loan growth was broad based - in consumer and commercial - and asset quality remains pristine,"" said John Mackerey, senior vice president in DBRS Morningstar's global financial institutions group.
The bank's non-interest expenses fell 1% on headcount cuts and real estate divestitures. While that was in line with Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf's plan to save about $10 billion annually over the long term, analysts were expecting more progress and noted the bank incurred charges related to remediating consumers for past sales practice misconduct. 

That may have dented investors' confidence that the bank can move beyond its scandals and be released from a Federal Reserve asset cap which restricts its loan growth, wrote Sanders. 
""While today was a fresh reminder that WFC still has a lot of work to, we expected some setbacks along the way in the long-term turnaround story we see at the company,"" Sanders added.

(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s Mobileye (F:0ME) has tapped investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead preparations for the initial public offering of the self-driving car unit, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
The stock market flotation, which is set to launch later this year, could value Mobileye at as much as $50 billion, the sources said, cautioning that the timing, valuation and size of the IPO are subject to market conditions.
The amount to be raised in the IPO could not be learned and the sources requested anonymity because details of the IPO preparations are confidential. 
Representatives for Intel and Mobileye did not respond to requests for comment. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Mobileye's preparation is coming at a tough time for the IPO market. Stock market volatility triggered by a sell-off in technology stocks and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced several high-profile firms, including GoPuff and Chobani, to postpone their plans to go public this year. 
The IPO freeze followed a record-breaking 2021 in which more than $300 billion was raised through flotations. 
Only 21 companies, excluding listings of special purpose acquisition companies, have been listed on U.S. exchanges this year so far, according to Dealogic. Other major IPO hopefuls preparing for a listing this year include SoftBank-owned chip designed Arm and social media platform Reddit. 
Intel bought Mobileye for about $15.3 billion in 2017. The Israeli company uses a camera-based system with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance in driverless cars. Founded in 1999, Mobileye plans to eventually build its own lidar sensor to help its cars map out a three-dimensional view of the road. 
Mobileye, which counts BMW, Audi, Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and General Motors (NYSE:GM) as its clients, has been a bright spot for Intel, which faces stiff competition in the chip-making segment from rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.

The decision to list Mobileye is part of Intel's broader strategy under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger to turn around its core business. Intel expects to receive the majority of the proceeds from the share sale and use some of the funds to build more Intel chip plants, Gelsinger said in December.
Intel has said it will retain a majority stake in Mobileye after the IPO.

(Reuters) -A third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech produced significant protection against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in healthy children ages 5 to 11, the companies said on Thursday.
Blood serum analysis of 30 pediatric participants who received a booster dose in a study showed a 36-fold increase in Omicron neutralizing antibodies, the drugmakers said.
Neutralizing antibodies against the original version of the virus for which the vaccine was designed rose six-fold following the booster shot.
The companies said they plan to apply for U.S. emergency use authorization of a booster dose for the age group in coming days, with additional submissions to global regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency to follow.
The mid- to late-stage study was testing the safety and immunogenicity of a 10-microgram booster dose in 140 healthy children aged 5 through 11 years. Adults receive a 30-microgram does of the vaccine.
It is unclear how much demand there is for a third vaccine dose in the age group. Just 28% of children in the age group - around 8 million - are fully vaccinated, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Health experts called the data ""promising"" but cautioned that the study size was very small and said there was need for more data to understand the extent to which this booster prevents severe illness and hospitalization in children, and how it will fare against future variants.
""So overall, (the data) is very positive. But it also raises a number of questions. How durable will the response be? How well will it hold up to the future variants?,"" said Dr. Anna Bershteyn of NYU Langone Health.
There has been some scepticism on need for boosters in younger children given the reduced risk of severe infection and hospitalization in the age group.
Still, Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General Hospital for Children, said many parents have been asking for them.
""What we keep finding with the pandemic is that when we make available vaccines and boosters, even when they don't offer perfect protection against infection, they often are very protective against severe illness and hospitalization,"" Hadland told Reuters.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration authorized a third dose of the vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 and those aged 5 through 11 who are immunocompromised.
The agency at the time said it will weigh boosters for 5- to 11-year olds after more children have received two doses.

The New York state probe will focus on major companies that supply oil to the state, and refineries that turn crude into gasoline and independent operators of pipelines and terminals, the representative said, confirming a report on CNN https://cnn.it/3xsQixl.
The investigation will examine the state's entire supply chain, the representative said. 
Crude prices have hit 14-year highs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent U.S. sanctions on Moscow, including a U.S. ban on Russian energy imports.

U.S. President Joe Biden last month accused U.S. oil companies of enjoying record profits while Americans pay high gasoline prices. He called for increased output and service to benefit consumers instead of investors, and announced a record release of crude oil from strategic reserves.
Oil executives defended themselves https://reut.rs/37SerTz in the U.S. Congress last week from charges by lawmakers that they were gouging Americans with high fuel prices, saying they were boosting energy output and no one company sets the price of gasoline.

""With rate hikes expected to start some time after the end of asset purchases, this sequence provides the ECB flexibility and optionality for the coming months depending on economic developments,"" said Adrien Pichoud, chief economist at Syz Bank.
ECB President Christine Lagarde said the bank will only start raising interest rates ""some time"" after it has ended its net asset purchases. Money markets trimmed their rate hike bets, pricing in about 65 bps of rate hikes by year-end from 70 bps earlier. [IRPR]
The ECB is facing a tough policy trade-off that is far more complex than in other developed markets, said Anna Stupnytska, global macro economist at Fidelity International.
""As the growth shock becomes more evident, the ECB's focus will likely shift away from high inflation towards trying to limit economic and market distress... Contrary to market pricing, we do not expect the ECB to hike rates until the fourth quarter of this year or early 2023,"" Stupnytska said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Devin Nunes, the former California congressman and an ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, cannot revive his defamation lawsuit against CNN over reports he was involved in efforts to uncover damaging Ukraine-related information about Joe Biden.
In a 2-1 decision on Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Nunes failed to seek a correction fast enough, or show he deserved ""special damages"" for economic loss.
Circuit Judge William Nardini said the trial judge ""did not err"" in finding that Nunes did not comply with applicable California law governing retractions, and thus his $435 million lawsuit should be dismissed with prejudice.
CNN is a unit of Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) Inc.
A lawyer for Nunes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNN's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Nunes sued over a Nov. 22, 2019 article that said Lev Parnas, a then-indicted associate of former Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, was willing to testify before Congress that Nunes met in 2018 with a former Ukrainian prosecutor to discuss ""digging up dirt"" on Biden, a Democrat and now U.S. president.
The former Republican congressman also objected to a broadcast of CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" where the reporter and host Chris Cuomo discussed his alleged role in ""looking for dirt"" on Biden and his son Hunter.
Nunes denied the accusations, said his reputation was damaged, and branded CNN ""the mother of fake news.""
Circuit Judge Steven Menashi dissented from Thursday's decision, saying the laws of New York, where the reporter and Cuomo worked, governed Nunes' claims.
Trump appointed all three judges on the appeals court panel.
Nunes has sued several news organizations in recent years.
On April 1, another federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of Nunes' $250 million lawsuit claiming the Washington Post defamed him by implying he lied to Trump about who attended a Feb. 2020 intelligence briefing concerning Russia.

Nunes left Congress in December to become chief executive of the social media venture Trump Media & Technology Group.
Parnas is awaiting sentencing after being convicted in October on campaign finance charges.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Volkswagen on Thursday warned that it had started to feel the impact of the war in Ukraine on supply chains and raw materials prices in the first quarter, with the longer-term effects on its business difficult to predict. 
The company indicated an 8.5 billion euro ($9.27 billion)operating profit for the first three months of the year, but noted that 3.5 billion euros of that was attributable to commodity hedges amid soaring raw material prices.
Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) shares were 2.1% lower at 147.9 euros by 1054 GMT.
Its operating return on sales jumped to 13.5% in the first quarter, according to the preliminary figures, from 7.7% in the same period of 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic and semiconductor shortages were weighing heavily on results.
A spokesperson said in March that the company had long-term measures in place with suppliers to secure raw materials, including an ""extensive and forward-looking purchasing and hedging program for important precious metals"".
Nonetheless, Volkswagen warned at its annual results conference last month that the outbreak of war in Ukraine called its annual forecast of an 8-13% boost to revenue with a 5-10% increase in deliveries into question.
Volkswagen Group deliveries were down 21.9% in January to March, totalling just over 1.89 million vehicles, with brand deliveries down 25.6%. Still, deliveries of all-electric vehicles grew 65% to 99,100, with the biggest increase in China. 
Carmakers have prioritised their electric line-ups amid a shortage of semiconductors as a way to boost revenue and remain on track to meet tightening European climate regulations.
BMW reported last week that its deliveries in the first quarter had fallen 6.2% while Mercedes-Benz saw a drop of 15% from last year. 

Volkswagen is due to publish first-quarter results on May 4.

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group Inc on Thursday modestly raised its 2022 profit forecast, saying demand for healthcare procedures deferred during the pandemic was approaching normal levels but had not increased as feared.
Shares of the largest U.S. health insurer rose as much as 3% to touch a record high of $553.29 in early trading before slipping back to $542.86, up 1%.
While the company has seen pressure on earnings from costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment, some of that was offset by people avoiding non-urgent care during the pandemic.
And some U.S. hospitals were again compelled to defer elective surgeries during the record Omicron-fueled surge in COVID-19 in the first quarter. Cases have since dropped sharply from a pandemic peak in January.
Demand for certain procedures, such as cancer screenings, have picked up pace, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) said. However, emergency department and pediatric visits, which add to the health insurer's costs, were trending below normal levels, it said.
""What we haven't seen though is an expectation we had that incidence rates might come up because of missed treatments over the earlier period,"" Chief Financial Officer John Rex told analysts on a conference call.
UnitedHealth raised both ends of its 2022 profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects adjusted earnings of $21.20 to $21.70 per share.
Revenue at its Optum unit rose nearly 19% in the first quarter, with much of the boost coming from its medical services, the company said, adding that it was focused on improving value-based care offerings - under which healthcare providers are paid based on their value to patients - and expanding digital care and at-home services. 
""The continued strength of the OptumHealth business with the ongoing transition to value-based care probably was the most noteworthy trend,"" said Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback. 
UnitedHealth said its acquisition of home and healthcare services provider  LHC Group  (NASDAQ:LHCG) for about $5.4 billion would eventually add to its growth, but did not provide details.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) outperformed rival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in M&A advisory and its traders fared better than expectations, helping the investment banking powerhouse beat first-quarter profit estimates by a wide margin.
The bank's dealmakers nearly doubled advisory revenue even as Russia's invasion of Ukraine unsettled equity markets and forced companies to hold off on dealmaking and stock market listings.
The war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", and the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, however, boosted volatility in markets, helping the bank clock in a smaller-than-expected 6% fall in trading revenue.
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said inflationary pressures, tightening of monetary policy and the invasion of Ukraine ""injected significant uncertainty into the markets.""
Like other Wall Street banks, Morgan Stanley's underwriting business also took a hit, with revenue at its equity underwriting business falling nearly 83% percent from a year ago when it generated handsome fees from a spate of high-profile IPOs.
According to Refinitiv data, equity underwriting deal volumes fell 80% in the first quarter for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two most dominant financial advisers on initial public offerings (IPOs) globally.
""Results from Morgan Stanley were pretty good, in my opinion, reflecting considerable resiliency given the geopolitical events and substantial volatility in equity, fixed income and commodities markets,"" said James P. Shanahan, senior equity research analyst, North American financials, at Edward Jones.
Morgan Stanley also reported a steep decline in fixed income underwriting revenue, hurt by lower bond issuances.
Return on tangible equity, a closely-watched metric for profitability that measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit, was 19.8% during the quarter. The figure was well above the bank's two-year target of between 14% and 16%.
The bank's shares rose 3.2% in morning trading, after falling more than 11% this year.
DEAL BOOST
Morgan Stanley's dealmakers brought in $944 million in advisory revenues in the quarter, compared with $480 million a year ago, helped by the completion of deals that were initiated last year.
By contrast, Goldman Sachs' revenue from advising on deal remained largely unchanged at $1.13 billion in the first quarter.
Morgan Stanley's Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said investment banking pipelines remained healthy, but cautioned that macro economic uncertainties could delay deal closings.
Overall investment banking revenue slumped 38% to $1.76 billion. The unit consists of the bank's advisory, equity underwriting and fixed income underwriting businesses.
Morgan Stanley's profit fell 11% to $3.54 billion, or $2.02 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of $1.68 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Total expenses fell to $4.83 billion from $5.3 billion a year earlier.
Net revenue fell 6% in the quarter to $14.8 billion, but beat estimates of $14.27 billion.

(Reuters) - WhatsApp is testing a new feature called Communities to organize groups in larger structures that could be used by workplaces or schools, the messaging service owned by Meta Platforms said on Thursday.
WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the feature would bring together groups, which are capped at 256 users, under bigger umbrellas where administrators could send alerts to a community of thousands. 
""This is really oriented at the communities you're already a part of in your life that are doing private communication,"" said Cathcart in an interview with Reuters, citing Salesforce-owned Slack or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams as comparable types of communication.
He said there were no current plans to charge for the new feature, which is being beta tested with a small number of global communities, but did not rule out offering ""premium features to enterprise"" in the future.
The messaging service, which is end-to-end encrypted and has about 2 billion users, said the Communities feature would also be end-to-end encrypted. 
WhatsApp has grappled with abuses including bulk messaging and the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Cathcart said users would not be able to search for different Communities on WhatsApp and that it would use anti-abuse tools and safeguards like forwarding limits for the new feature.
WhatsApp said there would also be changes to its Groups feature before the launch of Communities. It said it was adding the ability for group administrators to remove problematic messages from everyone's chat, introducing voice calling for up to 32 people, increasing file sharing to 2 gigabytes and adding emoji reactions to messages. 

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that Communities would be rolled out over the coming months. He said Meta would be building community messaging features for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Messenger and Instagram.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - People on the streets of Berlin have waved Ukrainian flags in demonstrations of support since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. But those who drove to the rallies did so largely in cars powered by oil from Russia, which provides most of the fuel to the German capital.
Just over a third of Germany's crude oil came from Russia last year, official data shows. Until the invasion of Ukraine in February, the dependence of Europe's largest economy on cheap energy from Russia – in part, a legacy of the Cold War – was not viewed as problematic by the authorities. 
Now, German politicians say it may threaten the country’s security and want to wean Germany off Russian oil.
A Russian-owned refinery at Schwedt, a 90-minute drive from Berlin, has become a focus of the debate. 
Nine out of 10 cars in the capital and the surrounding state of Brandenberg are powered by its fuel, and 50% of the electricity it generates is fed into the state grid. ""We drive Berlin and Brandenburg,"" the refinery says on its website.
The refinery, PCK Schwedt, is majority-owned and operated by Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. All the oil it refines comes from Russia. 
The refinery was thrust into the political spotlight on the eve of the war by Rosneft's plan to increase its stake substantially, a request that Germany’s government has placed under review amid concerns that its energy reliance on Russia has grown too acute.
""It now turns out to have been a mistake to give a Russian state-owned company such a responsibility for the economy,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of the Greens party, told reporters in late March, when asked about the future of the Schwedt refinery.
A spokesperson for PCK Schwedt did not respond to a request for comment about officials’ concerns over fuel security. 
The refinery’s capacity of 233,000 barrels per day amounts to about one-tenth of Germany's pre-pandemic consumption. The nearby Leuna refinery, owned by France's TotalEnergies and with a similar capacity, also relies on the same pipeline from Russia for most of its oil. [L2N2W50OH]

Calls for the 27-nation European Union to impose an outright oil embargo on Russia have gained impetus in recent weeks, after images of civilian killings in Ukraine prompted the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into alleged war crimes. 
Moscow, which calls its campaign a ""special operation,"" says it has not targeted civilians. 
EU governments said on Monday the bloc's executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude but diplomats said Germany - which has already reduced its consumption of Russian oil and gas - was not actively supporting an immediate embargo. 
Ukraine's president has said Moscow is making so much money from oil exports that it does not need to take peace talks seriously and has called on Germany to cut its energy ties with Russia quickly.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Opinion polls over the past few weeks show less than half of Germans want to halt the import of Russian oil and gas. Several Berliners buying petrol on a recent morning questioned whether an embargo would hurt Russia.
""It's a conflict of conscience: of course we want to help the Ukrainians but even if we were to accept higher prices, would it actually help them?"" said Melanie Barthel, 29.
Berlin's mayor, Franziska Giffey, told German newspaper Handesblatt on April 7 she was worried that such a large share of eastern Germany's fuel supply depended on the Schwedt refinery. 
Referring to Schwedt, Giffey told the newspaper there may be cases where nationalisation ""is unavoidable."" She did not respond to a request for further comment. 
Asked about the debate in Germany over whether to halt Russian fuel supplies, Rosneft said in a statement to Reuters it has owned assets there for more than 10 years and has invested 4 billion euros in modernization during that time, helping to lower fuel prices for consumers and to guarantee German energy security. 
Rosneft said that any illegal seizure of its assets would be a gross violation of private property rights and would destabilize the investment climate in Germany, jeopardizing the interests of foreign investors.
FROM FRIENDSHIP TO THREAT
The PCK Schwedt refinery, like Berlin itself, used to be the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. It was built in the 1960s to process Russian oil shipped to satellite states of the former Soviet Union. 
The oil is pumped through one of the world’s longest pipelines. Its name, ""Druzhba"", means friendship: Moscow built it to supply its import-dependent allies.
Refineries in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic also rely on Russian oil.
Graphic: Which country most depends on Russian diesel imports? - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/GERMANY-OIL/znpneqbydvl/chart.png
After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Western oil companies bought into Schwedt, but Rosneft owns 54% of the plant and controls it. 
In March, Germany's Economy Ministry said it was reviewing a plan for Rosneft to purchase Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC's stake in the refinery, which would leave the Russian oil giant holding nearly 92%.
""The Russian attack changed our whole security evaluation,"" a German government source told Reuters. ""In this context, Rosneft's control was considered a possible threat.""
The review, a confidential process, comes under a foreign trade law designed to protect German security, technology and intellectual property from non-European Union investors. 
People familiar with the situation could not say how long the Schwedt review would take or what Germany would do if it concluded Rosneft's role is a security threat. 
Shell said in a statement to Reuters it had been clear about its intent for a phased withdrawal from Russian hydrocarbons following the invasion, and was in discussions with governments about how to maintain supplies to consumers. 
""Ultimately, it is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made,"" the statement said. 
Habeck, the Economy Minister, told reporters this month the government was working flat out to resolve the refinery’s situation in order to achieve ""oil independence from Russia"".
The German government took temporary control of another Russian energy business on April 4: it put Russian gas giant Gazprom’s local unit - Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Germania - under the control of the regulator after Gazprom attempted to sell its subsidiary to two other Russian companies. 
Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment. 
The stalled sale leaves Shell in a quandary. A senior Shell source told Reuters it would be surprising if the German regulator approved the disposal of its stake in Schwedt to Rosneft: ""We will have to figure out what to do next, but for now there isn't much we can do,"" said the source.
The remaining shares in the refinery are owned by Italian oil and gas company Eni SpA, which said it had been looking to sell them before the invasion. After Russia invaded, Eni, like many oil companies, said it would not sign new supply deals with Russia.
ALTERNATIVES
For Germany, replacing Russian oil will be a mammoth task. Germany imports oil through other pipelines, including one from Italy, but Russia is by far its largest supplier. The second biggest, the United States, delivered just 13% of its total imports.
In addition to Schwedt, Rosneft owns minority stakes in two other German refineries and supplies them with some crude, although they also purchase oil from elsewhere. 
Finding alternative supplies for PCK Schwedt will be a challenge, industry experts say. 
The refinery was built to process Russian urals crude via the Druzhba pipeline and the only other duct supplying it - from the Baltic Sea port of Rostock - can transport just a fraction of the oil it needs.
The Baltic ports receive oil imports from other producers - such as Saudi Arabia and the United States - but Schwedt would have to compete for that as eastern European refineries hunt for alternatives to Russian crude. 

Rosneft said in a statement that shifting to alternative crude supplies at Schwedt would increase costs considerably and would raise fuel prices for German consumers.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank's Chief Executive Bharat Masrani on Thursday criticized the Canadian Liberal government's planned tax on banks and called for policymakers to ensure Canada plays a ""meaningful role"" in supporting energy security.
Canada plans to raise corporate taxes for the most profitable banks and insurers to 16.5% from 15% on all taxable income over C$100 million ($79.6 million), and imposed a one-time 15% tax on income over C$1 billion.
The proposal, first floated as a campaign promise by the Liberals in August, was detailed in last week's federal budget. The proposal had already drawn the ire of bank executives and investors even before the budget announcement.
In his prepared remarks to the bank's annual shareholder meeting, Masrani said the government's decision to single out the banking sector was not good tax policy and could lead to ""unintended consequences"".
""One of our greatest advantages is that we have among the strongest and most stable financial systems in the world,"" he said. ""We must extend our leadership on the world stage as a global banking centre.""
Masrani also called for Canada to play a ""meaningful role"" to support energy security across North America and globally, saying a transition to a low-carbon future will take years.
TD and other Canadian banks have been criticized by climate-conscious investors for their continued support of fossil fuel companies. Up for a vote at the meeting is a shareholder proposal calling for the bank to stop financing new fossil fuel supplies by the end of this year, which the board of directors recommended investors vote against. 

""Without a reliable and responsible energy supply to meet current and future demand, progress may stall, with devastating economic and social consequences,"" he said. ""The pressure on energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine is a clear example of the risks.""

Investing.com -- Shares of telehealth company  Teladoc Inc  (NYSE:TDOC) are down just over 3% in early Thursday trading.
The slide comes despite Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan reiterating an Overweight rating and $104 price target.

Teladoc acquired Livongo in August 2020 in a deal worth $18.5 billion.
""We counted 71.8K Livongo app downloads in 1Q22. This is up 56% vs. the 46.2K downloads recorded in 4Q21, but down (21)% y/y from 1Q21 when we recorded 91.0K downloads,"" wrote Tassan.

""The accelerating monthly downloads observed in 1Q22 are not consistent with patterns observed in 1Q21 or 1Q20, and suggest that FY22 will indeed be a seasonal anomaly with respect to both Chronic Condition enrollment and revenue growth.""

Market reaction:
Euro zone bond yields fell after the policy statement, with German two-year bond yields falling more than 10 bps on the day. 
The euro slipped into negative territory, down 0.8%
Money markets also trimmed expectations of rate hikes by the end of the year. 
Here is a summary of analyst comments:
ANNA STUPNYTSKA, GLOBAL MACRO ECONOMIST, FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL:
""Recession in Europe is already our base case, but its magnitude and duration crucially depend on the nature of further sanctions on Russia. As a full energy embargo is becoming more likely, so is the worst-case recession scenario. 
We believe as the growth shock becomes more evident in the data over the next few weeks, the ECB's focus will likely shift away from high inflation towards trying to limit economic and market distress as the invasion of Ukraine and its consequences continues to ripple through the system. 
Contrary to market pricing, we do not expect the ECB to hike rates until Q4 this year or early 2023.""
CARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO AT ING:
""Interest rates remain unchanged, and there was no new hint at the future path of rates. To probably tackle the recent debate on how the ECB could deal with widening bonds spreads and rumours about a new asset purchase programme, the ECB stressed that the reinvestments of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme could be used to tackle market fragmentation.""
""Europe is different and the ECB is different. Instead of any panic reaction, the ECB continues with its very gradual normalisation, which in our view is bringing an end to net asset purchases over the summer and an end to the era of negative interest rates before the end of the year.""
KENNETH BROUX, FX STRATEGIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, LONDON:
""The knee-jerk pullback in the euro/dollar suggests some were positioned for something more hawkish from the European Central Bank.""
MARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS:
""It was a more dovish press conference than markets were expecting. Inflation has overshot their projections and we should get an upward revisions in June, and they are comfortable in winding down QE.""
But beyond that, they are not ready to push policy further.
A big part of the press conference was focused on the deteriorating outlook and the hit to confidence triggered by the war in Ukraine. There's also concern about a tightening in monetary conditions, so there is a sense that markets are tightening policy in the absence of the ECB doing it and that could choke off the recovery.""
STEVE RYDER, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AVIVA INVESTORS GLOBAL SOVEREIGN BOND FUND:
""Downside risks to growth are increasing and uncertainty around Ukraine and the impact on inflation will continue to weigh on confidence. With markets already pricing a significant degree of rate normalisation we see the rate outlook from here as much more balanced.""
STUART COLE, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON

""We have had confirmation that the asset purchase programme will end in Q3. That leaves open the possibility of an interest rate rise being delivered before year-end and accordingly market expectations of a first hike coming in December are likely to firm.
""But they are also keeping open the possibility of providing more support if needed, noting that the PEPP can be restarted in the event of another COVID crisis - and you can probably add to that if the economic fallout from the Ukraine war turns out to be worse than anticipated.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Benetton family and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) have proposed a 58 billion euro ($63 billion) buyout offer for Atlantia, to take it private and stave off rival interest for the airport and motorway operator. 
Highlighting the appeal of the infrastructure sector, the deal would be this year's second-biggest M&A transaction globally after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). 
Alessandro Benetton, chairman of the family holding company Edizione since January, said one of the aims was to preserve the integrity of Atlantia and its Italian identity, adding they had found in Blackstone a long-term co-investor and partner.
Edizione owns a third of Atlantia.
The bid heralds a new phase for Atlantia which is selling its domestic motorway unit to draw a line under a political dispute sparked by a deadly bridge collapse in 2018.
The sale, which will cut Atlantia's end-2021 debt of 38.6 billion euros, will bring 8 billion euros into its coffers. Net of debt the offer values the group at 19 billion euros.
""The gargantuan Benetton and Blackstone-led Atlantia deal redefines how investors will think about infrastructure investments due to its sheer size alone,"" said Wylie Fernyhough, senior private equity analyst at PitchBook. 
The Benettons and Blackstone said on Thursday they would offer 23 euros per share, a premium of 24.4% to the share price on April 5, before speculation about the offer fuelled gains.
The premium rises when taking into account that investors who tender their shares will still receive a proposed dividend of 0.74 euros a share.
Blackstone, which is also part of a consortium led by Italy's state-owned lender CDP expected to complete the purchase of Atlantia's domestic motorway business next month, said it believed in the strength of the Italian economy and the future opportunities it would offer.
Shares in Atlantia, which have gained almost a fifth over the past 10 days, rose 4.4% to 22.85 euros each on Thursday.
Analysts said the bid's price appeared adequate and, with shares aligned to it, deemed a counterbid unlikely for the moment.
The Benettons last week said they were in talks with Blackstone after they rejected an approach by investment funds Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield to acquire Atlantia and hand its motorway concessions to Florentino Perez's Spanish construction group ACS. 
GIP, Brookfield and ACS were not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
NEW CHAPTER
The Benettons and Blackstone are set to spend up to 12.7 billion euros, financed partly with 8.2 billion euros in debt.
""The deal illustrates the depth of private markets and how attractive infrastructure assets have become in this inflationary environment,"" Fernyhough said.
Atlantia's delisting would open a new chapter for the company after the threat of being stripped of its motorway concession put its business at risk, while the death of 43 people in the bridge disaster tarnished its reputation.
Atlantia runs five airports and nearly 10,000 kilometres of motorway around the world.
With 33% of Atlantia already in the hands of the Benettons, the bid targets 66.9% of the group's share capital and is conditional on reaching a 90% acceptance threshold.
""There is a good chance of reaching the targeted ... threshold,"" Bestinver analyst Marco Opipari said.
UKRAINE CLAUSE
The offer is also subject to a clause that would allow bidders to walk away in the event of major unfavourable circumstances arising, including in relation to the Ukraine conflict.
""The material adverse change condition ... specifically carves in potential developments in Russia/Ukraine,"" vice president Alastair Mankin at Cowen investment bank said.
Under Italian rules, Atlantia will be allowed to give its opinion on the bid only once market regulators approve the offer's prospectus and the document is officially published. 
Edizione will have 65% of the investment vehicle launching the offer for Atlantia, with the U.S. company holding the rest.
Italian banking foundation CRT, a long-time investor in Atlantia, is expected to tender its full 4.5% stake under the offer, reinvesting the proceeds into the bid's vehicle if the offer goes through.
Alessandro Benetton on Thursday said the proposed deal was open to other current investors in Atlantia, suggesting that relevant shareholders who decide to join the offer could in turn get a stake in the delisted Atlantia.
Other investors in the group include Singapore's sovereign fund GIC, with a 8.3% stake, and HSBC Holding, with a 5% stake, according to Atlantia's website. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), UBS, UniCredit are acting as financial advisers for the Benettons and Blackstone. Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici, Legance, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP are legal advisers.

“We believe North America demand remains very strong, particularly in digital channels, and Nike's inventory levels are lean.

2) The market underestimates Nike's ability to improve gross margin by better utilizing inventory; and

The fee raise is set to come into effect on April 28 and will apply to apparel as well as non-apparel items, the company said.
The move comes a few months after Amazon hiked fees in January due to rising costs including higher hourly wages, hiring expenses, and construction of new warehouses. The e-commerce giant claims it hiked fees only to offset permanent costs and to remain competitive with other fulfillment services providers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS).
“In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as COVID-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges,” Amazon said.
Inflation rose 8.5% in March, reaching the fastest rate in over 40 years, while gas prices are up 48% over the past 12 months.
Sellers paid $103 billion in fees to Amazon in 2021, accounting for roughly 22% of its revenue.
The surcharge will affect items ordered prior to April 28 but shipped and delivered after that date, Amazon said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak shared his 3 takeaways from the report:
UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley is positive on the news.
“We think Amazon’s fuel and inflation surcharge on FBA fees adds ~$2.5B in incremental offsets to higher fuel prices, and more important, underscores its commitment to driving margin improvement in 2H 2022, in our view. We think investors had, appropriately, started to worry about the margin story this year with rising fuel prices and, now, the threat of unionization (which could spur more wage hikes). This move, in our view, bolsters the margin story considerably, particularly given how unprecedented the move is coming from Amazon,” Walmsley said in a client note.

(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 43% drop in profit but beat Wall Street expectations on Friday, as strong performances in its wealth management and trading businesses partly offset a slump in equity underwriting as stock market listings dried up.
Wall Street banks have come under pressure amid a slump in dealmaking globally, but volatility fueled by concerns around interest rate hikes and the economic fallout of the Ukraine war helped Goldman's trading desks smash expectations.
The bank's global markets segment reported net revenue of $7.87 billion, a 4% jump from last year when accommodative monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve led to bumper levels of trading activity. The robust performance was driven by a 21% rise in fixed income revenue, the bank said.
The Wall Street bank has also been taking measures under Chief Executive David Solomon to diversify its revenue stream and earn more from predictable sources like consumer banking, wealth and asset management. 
Consumer and wealth management recorded a 21% jump in net revenues to $2.10 billion, helped by higher management fees and credit card balances.
Investment banking revenue, however, dropped 36% to $2.41 billion, as fees from advising on stock market listings and debt underwriting declined against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. 
""It was a turbulent quarter dominated by the devastating invasion of Ukraine,"" Solomon said. Goldman was the first major U.S. bank to retreat from Russia.
""The rapidly evolving market environment had a significant effect on client activity as risk intermediation came to the fore and equity issuance came to a near standstill,"" Solomon added.
Goldman's revenue from advising on deal remained largely unchanged at $1.13 billion, in sharp contrast to rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), whose revenue from the business doubled. 
With the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning to wean the economy off pandemic-era support, dealmaking slowed in the quarter and cast a pall over some of Goldman's most lucrative businesses. 
Goldman also cut operating expenses by 18% in the quarter, chiefly due to lower spending on compensation and benefits.

The bank posted profit applicable to common shareholders of $3.83 billion, or $10.76 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected $8.89 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total net revenue fell to $12.93 billion in the quarter, down nearly 27% from last year.

WDC stock is downgraded to Neutral from Positive with a $50.00 per share price target, down from $80.00. On the other hand, STX shares are cut to Negative from Neutral with a PT of $65.00, down from $93.00.
Hosseini expects quarterly cloud spending to peak in the second half of this year, followed by weaker demand into 2023.
“On the NAND/SSD side, we expect blended ASPs to rebound in June/Sep quarters, following a shallow correction in 2HCY21 and flattish trend in the Mar-Q. However, with the overall Cloud/Enterprise demand waning into YE22, we expect NAND ASPs to flatten out and actually decline again by YE22. Enterprise SSD is estimated to account for 38% of the overall NAND bit demand, followed by 25% attributed to Client SSD, and 20% to smartphones. All in all, we are updating estimates, with our overall CY23 EPS estimates for both STX and WDC 30%+ below the current consensus,” Hosseini said in a client note.
While the analyst takes into consideration that both STX and WDC are down 28% YTD, he still sees a downside risk, especially for the former, given “the extent of deceleration in Cloud capex spend by YE22 and into 2023, and its impact.”
Despite a relatively stronger Nearline shipment in 2HCY22, we believe the 30% downside risk to CY23 is the biggest overhang that cannot be avoided,” the analyst concluded.

Barrick said gold output was lower at its Carlin and Cortez mines due to depletion of stockpiled higher grade underground ore after the mechanical mill failure at a roaster facility, which processes the gold ore, in the second quarter last year.
The Carlin and Cortez mines are part of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Corp. 
The company, which is scheduled to release its first-quarter results on May 4, said the average market price for gold in the quarter was $1,877 per ounce, up from $1,795 per ounce in the prior quarter.
Barrick said it expects the company's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for gold, a key industry metric, to be 19% to 21% higher from the fourth quarter, while AISC for copper is expected to be 1% to 3% lower. 
Miners have been hit hard by a pandemic-led rise in expenses as they implement prevention measures to ensure the safety of workers and surrounding communities, with supply-chain issues due to global restrictions on movement adding to their woes.
Barrick said its gold production in 2022 is expected to increase through the year, while copper production is expected to be higher in the second half.
The company's copper production during the quarter was 101 million pounds, down 19.84% from the previous quarter, hurt by lower output at its Lumwana mine, while total preliminary gold production was down 17.7% at 990 million ounces. 

Analysts on an average expected gold production of 1.025 million ounces, according to Refinitiv IBES.
U.S.-listed shares of the company, which have gained nearly 34% so far this year, were down 0.9% in premarket trading.

BBBY reported 4Q EPS of -$0.92 on -12% comps, a big miss compared to the Street consensus of $0.13 on -8.3% comps.
Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández downgraded BBBY stock to Underperform from Market Perform with a $15.00 per share price target, down from $18.00. The analyst believes BBBY shares are overvalued by the market as they don’t reflect “weakening financial performance.”
Fernández adds that BBBY faces “a more challenging US consumer backdrop and ongoing supply chain challenges in 2022.”
“Both the 4Q21 result and 1Q22 quarter-to-date sales trend came in well below expectations, resulting in a significant downward revision to our 2022-2023 sales and earnings estimates and further eroding confidence in the turnaround. While the management team has made progress on rolling out private label brands and remodeling stores, there have been execution missteps around marketing and promotions. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond's legacy supply chain infrastructure limits the ability to move inventory around quickly and efficiently and offset the financial impact during a period of disruption. All in, the company's performance gap vs. home furnishings peers continues to widen,” Fernández said in a client note.
BofA analyst Jason Haas cut the price target to $8.00 per share from $9.50 on the Sell-rated BBBY stock after “meaningfully cutting our estimates following BBBY’s disappointing 4Q results and outlook.”
“We’re increasingly concerned by BBBY’s leverage and cash burn,” the analyst added.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs) analyst Kate McShane reiterated a Sell rating and slashed the price target by 50% to $7.00 amid “the ongoing weakness in quarter-to-date comp trends that is expected to remain till at least 1H and continuously challenged store comps.”

111,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has extended by three months its review of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)'s application for the full approval of its COVID-19 antibody therapy, the U.S. drugmaker said on Thursday.
Before making its decision, the health agency wants to look at additional data submitted by Regeneron on using the antibody cocktail as a preventive treatment.
The FDA has not asked for any extra studies to complete its review and will now decide on the drug by July 13, Regeneron said.
Regeneron's ""cocktail"" of two monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, had received an emergency use authorization in the United States in late 2020 to treat patients who were 12 years and older with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
The therapy, called REGEN-COV, was later also authorized in the country for the prevention of COVID-19 in certain people exposed to an infected individual, or who were at high risk of such exposure.

However, data showed that REGEN-COV and a rival monoclonal antibody drug from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) were unlikely to be effective against the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant. That led the U.S. FDA to revise the emergency use authorizations for both therapies to limit their use.
Regeneron is collaborating with Roche, which is primarily responsible for the development and distribution of the treatment outside the United States.

The analyst argues that IBM offers a shelter for investors looking to “hide” amid growing macro risks. He reminds investors that IBM is negatively correlated with PMIs and historical late-cycle outperformance.
“While a recession isn't yet the base case, our US Economics team sees rising risk of a US recession and forecasts decelerating PMIs, indicative of a late cycle when IT Hardware stocks typically underperform the S&P 500. What's more, our recent AlphaWise CIO Survey and VAR checks suggest hardware budgets are about to be cut as companies maneuver geopolitical uncertainty and rising costs,” Woodring said in a client note.
Woodring reiterates that the IBM upgrade is a relative call as the company is well-positioned to “weather macro storm.”
“IBM is likely to outperform in a scenario of IT hardware budget cuts, with over half of revenue derived from more defensive recurring revenue streams and only 20% of IBM's revenue directly tied to hardware and related OS revenue. In fact, IBM shares have historically been negatively correlated with PMIs and shares typically outperform our IT Hardware coverage late cycle on a combination of lower earnings risk and far less multiple compression. These factors combined with the fact that IBM will be entering mainframe and ELA cycles in 2H give us confidence the business is positioned to outperform through the rest of this year,” the analyst added.
BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan is also bullish on IBM although he lowered estimates ahead of the company’s Q1 earnings report that is due next Tuesday.
“Investors are looking for IBM to report consistent quarters of revenue beats, which we believe is achievable (provided no macroeconomic shock to global economies). Reiterate Buy on expectations that the company will achieve its mid-term rev/FCF targets,” Mohan wrote in a memo.
IBM stock price is up nearly 2% in pre-open Thursday.

Investing.com -- Earnings from three of the U.S.'s biggest retail lenders all exceeded expectations in the first quarter, offering some reassurance for the coming earnings season after a disappointing lead from bellwether JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said adjusted earnings per share were 88c in the quarter, some 10c higher than forecast, while PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) beat expectations by over 20% and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) beat by 5%. 
However, initial reactions to the announcement were negative, as participants focused instead on the fact that Wells Fargo's revenue - arguably a better reflection of ongoing trends in its everyday business, fell short of expectations at $17.59 billion. Analysts had expected on average $17.8 billion. Both figures were down from an exceptional first quarter a year ago. 
Wall Street's blue-bloods also managed to deliver a positive surprise: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs both reported annual declines in profit, but both banks' numbers came in ahead of expectations.
Goldman's (NYSE:GS) earnings per share fell 43% on the year to $10.76, while revenue fell by just over a quarter to $12.93 billion. For  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the decline in earnings was a gentler 7%, while revenue fell 6% to $14.8 billion. For both banks, somewhat better-than-expected trading results helped to offset a sharp decline in revenue from dealmaking.  
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), meanwhile, also reported a 44% drop in earnings but it, too, performed better than expected, thanks largely to its consumer lending and credit cards business.
“We like where this business is headed,"" Citi CEO Jane Fraser said. She acknowledged however that the bank's efforts to scoop up more wealth management mandates from the ultra-rich around the world had suffered due to ""geopolitics"".
On Wednesday, JPMorgan stock had finished at a 52-week low after it reportedmp a 42% year-on-year drop in net profit. While that had been largely expected, the reality of cooling financial markets and a warning about future uncertainties from CEO Jamie Dimon both weighed heavily on the stock's performance. 
As with Dimon, Wells's CEO Charlie Scharf warned that the Federal Reserve's planned monetary policy tightening and the Ukraine war represented substantial risks to the outlook. 
""Our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers’ financial position, but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth,"" Scharf said in a statement. He added that he expected a rise in credit losses from their current level, which are low by historical comparison. The bank released a net $1.1 billion in provisions for credit losses in the quarter as the risks related to the pandemic faded.

Mercedes’s concept electric vehicle drove from Sindelfingen in Germany through Switzerland and Italy to the French commune Cassis, completing a more than 1,000 kilometer (621 miles) ride and laying the groundwork for long-distance electric vehicle travel.
The car’s lightweight chassis and aerodynamic profile allowed the new Mercedes to complete the trip on a single charge, even though the car’s battery is half the size of Mercedes’s EQS flagship EV.
The new Vision EQXX “is the most efficient Mercedes ever built,” said Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) has appointed a new manager to oversee a $2 billion Asian high yield fund, the Swiss bank said in a statement, after a five-month hiatus in top leadership at the fund that was hit hard by China's property sector debt crisis.
Raymond Lin Gui will join UBS' asset management arm in Hong Kong on May 2, as head of portfolio management for Asia fixed income, according to the statement on Thursday. 
Gui, who previously worked as co-chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at Hong Kong-based Income Partners Asset Management, will be the lead manager of the Asian High Yield fund, the statement said.
He will report to Hayden Briscoe, head of global emerging markets and Asia pacific fixed income.
Gui's predecessor, Singapore-based Ross Dilkes, left UBS late last year. The Asian High Yield fund lost around 18% in 2021, according to its factsheet, mainly dented by a market rout in China's embattled property companies.
At the end of 2021, the fund held large positions in dollar-denominated bonds issued by several troubled Chinese developers, including China Evergrande Group, Kaisa Group and Sunac China, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the development. 
The three developers have missed payment deadlines on some of their debt and their shares have been suspended from trading in Hong Kong. 
The UBS fund has lost another 16% so far this year, with more than 30% of the portfolio exposed to the Asia real estate sector at the end of February, according to its factsheet.

Assets under the fund have tumbled by more than $1 billion since the beginning of this year.
Gui will work with Smit Rastogi, who has been at UBS for more than five years and was appointed as co-portfolio manager for the fund in January this year, said the statement.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country’s anti-graft watchdog, was involved in the investigation that sought to understand the links between Jack Ma’s fintech giant and state-backed banks and companies.
The agency was one of the regulators that sent queries to state enterprises in February as a part of Beijing's investigation of the former head of the Hangzhou party, Zhou Jiangyong.
Earlier this week, China’s prosecutors charged Jiangyong, accusing him of receiving substantial bribes.
While state-owned banks and companies involved in the investigation have sent their reports on their relationship with Ant, there has not been any action from the regulators yet, according to the report by Bloomberg.
A few months ago, state media released a documentary that showed Jiangyong leveraging his relationship with Chinese tech companies to support his younger brother’s business. One of the companies received an investment from a firm managed by Ant Group.
CCDI’s investigation of Ant comes as a part of Xi Jinping’s unrivaled battle against graft within the Communist Party. Beijing has recently encouraged the CCDI to investigate officials in the financial industry, a probe that has resulted in ensnaring numerous executives in the sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The owner of Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo on Thursday flagged a big profit drop in China due to COVID-19 restrictions, while its chief executive sounded alarm about the weakening yen's potential to drive up costs.
Fast Retailing is a rare bellwether for both global retailers in China, its biggest foreign market, and consumer demand in Japan, where it has carved out a dominant position by offering casual clothing to famously price-conscious shoppers. 
It and other multi-national retailers are now being forced to deal with lockdown measures in China. Fast Retailing has 863 stores on the mainland and almost 90 outlets in Shanghai, where strict measures, introduced in late March, remain in place to contain the country's worst outbreak of the pandemic.
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which each have dozens of outlets in Shanghai, have also been impacted as has production for retailers such as H&M, and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Fast Retailing said it expects revenue declines and a large drop in profit in its Greater China segment in the second half and for the whole of fiscal 2022 due to COVID restrictions.
Sales in the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, were hit in March, as up to 133 stores were temporarily shut.
It has more Uniqlo stores in China than in Japan. It opened a flagship store in Beijing in November, and plans to open in 100 locations in the country each year.
Separately, luxury brand Hermes said it had a strong start of the year in China until the beginning of March and is confident stores closed in Shanghai will reopen quickly.
'NO MERIT'
But the weakening yen and higher costs have forced Fast Retailing to consider price rises, a major shift for a company that has long competed on price. 
""There's absolutely no merit to a weak yen,"" Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai told reporters.
""Japan is engaged in the business of importing raw materials from all over the world, processing them, adding value to them, and selling them. In this context, there is no advantage if the value of a country's currency weakens.""
The yen has been hammered this year, falling to the weakest level in almost 20 years against the dollar. For many Japanese companies that manufacture offshore - like Fast Retailing - the weak yen is less of a benefit than for traditional exporters.
The company reported a record half-year profit on Thursday, buoyed by sales growth in North America, Europe, and other parts of Asia, while revenue and profit declined in Japan and China.
Operating profit climbed 18% to 189 billion yen ($1.51 billion) in the six months through February from a year earlier.
The company maintained its full-year profit forecast at 270 billion yen. That compares with a consensus forecast for annual profit to total 278 billion yen, according to a Refinitiv poll of 11 analysts.
The Ukraine crisis has created another headwind, leading the company to close its 50 stores in Russia, after it initially resisted calls to exit the market along with other major brands.

Prior to the earnings release, shares in Fast Retailing closed up 2.1%, versus a 1.2% gain in the broader market. But they have fallen nearly 9% so far this year.

Investing.com -- Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) stock fell in morning trading in Europe on Thursday after the world's second-biggest carmaker said deliveries slumped 31% in March due to Russia's war in Ukraine and ongoing problems in its supply chain.
It also warned of a potential financial hit from volatility in ""unpredictable"" commodity markets, saying that developments there could have ""significant impacts on the valuation of hedging operations.""
The warning comes a day after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) admitted it had lost $120 million due to the price spike in nickel on the London Metals Exchange. Prices for other battery metals and copper have also been volatile so far this year. However, VW didn't give any further details of its exposures. 
Volkswagen preferred stock fell 1.6% on the news, making it one of the worst performers in the benchmark DAX index on the day. 
At a group level, deliveries were down 31% on the year in March at 655,800. 
The idling of its plant in Kaluga, Russia, and the interruption of supplies of wire harnesses from facilities in Ukraine due to the war led to deliveries falling 43% in eastern Europe and 24% in western Europe, its biggest market. Sales were hurt most at its mass-market brand, as the company prioritized its higher-margin Porsche and Audi businesses for scarce inputs. 
However, its operations in China also appeared to be heavily disrupted, against a backdrop of spreading lockdowns of industrial and logistics facilities to stop the Covid-19 virus. Sales in China fell 37% to 217,800 and appear under threat for the foreseeable future, after President Xi Jinping on Wednesday reaffirmed the country's commitment to its aggressive ""Dynamic Clearing"" policy for fighting the coronavirus.

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Thursday projected that by 2030 at least three quarters of its investments in companies and governments will be tied to issuers with a scientific target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, up from 25% currently.
It was the first time BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager with $9.6 trillion in assets, has said how its portfolio could look in 2030 as far as emissions are concerned, but it remains an expectation rather than a firm target.
The forecast covers emissions tied to 77% of its total assets at the end of September 2021, some $9.5 trillion, but excludes those such as municipal bonds for which there is currently no reliable data.
Setting a 2030 goal is a central requirement for members of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI), a sector-wide group of money managers aiming to get to net-zero emissions across their assets. BlackRock joined the NZAMI in March 2021 
In Thursday's statement BlackRock avoided using the word ""target"", though, reiterating instead that the pace of change would be determined by the scale of decarbonisation in the real economy and clients' investment decisions.
""As the transition proceeds and issuers and asset owners continue to position themselves in front of it, we anticipate that by 2030, at least 75% of BlackRock corporate and sovereign assets managed on behalf of clients will be invested in issuers with science-based targets or equivalent,"" the statement said.
However, Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment manager at non-profit Reclaim Finance, said BlackRock needed to use its financial muscle to ensure companies make the cuts in emissions needed to ensure the world hits its climate goal.
""The world's largest asset manager cannot get away with vaguely defined commitments. It must act with urgency, especially with respect to the fossil fuel expansionists in BlackRock's portfolio that are leading us to climate catastrophe,"" she said in a statement.
The bulk of BlackRock's assets are in funds that track stock and other indexes, often containing high-emitting companies such as those in the oil and gas sector, although it is launching new climate-aligned products for clients that want to shift.
""BlackRock's role in the transition is as a fiduciary to our clients. Our role is to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities, not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy,"" it said.
Key to that change would be concerted policy action from governments as well as technological advances to help hard-to-abate sectors decarbonise, it added.

""Our clients' portfolios – which reflect the global economy – cannot reach net zero without sustained and consistent government policy, accelerated technological breakthroughs, and substantial adaptation in corporate business models,"" it said.
""These portfolios will reflect the regulatory and legislative choices governments make to balance the need for reliable and affordable energy, and orderly decarbonisation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boosting enforcement of antidiscrimination and antitrust laws, raising the federal mininum wage and higher unionization rates could substantially boost U.S. economic growth, a new report by President Joe Biden's top economic advisers concludes.
The annual Economic Report, prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers, argues for restoring the public sector as a partner in long-run growth, and adoption of policies aimed at curbing the disproportionate market power of companies and employers that limits economic equality.
“The government has a role to play in reducing inequality,” Cecilia Rouse, who chairs the council, told Reuters, stressing that ending lingering disparities in the U.S. labor market and racial wealth gaps would ""absolutely"" boost U.S. growth and competitiveness after years of weak progress.
“The real point is that these imperfections in the market have real economic costs in terms of our GDP growth,"" she said, citing research https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-economic-gains-from-equity by San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, which concluded that systemic disparities cost the U.S. economy nearly $23 trillion over the 30-year period from 1990-2019, and providing more equitable access to labor markets would add $790 billion to the U.S. economy annually.
Biden welcomed the report in a statement, and vowed to continue working to deliver ""more equitable growth"" and expand the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.
The report delves deeply into the impact of non-competitive labor markets, the market power of employers and monopolies in maintaining inequality in wages, and unfair hiring practices that ultimately curtail economic growth for all.
""The costs of ignoring these structural forces are increased inequality and reduced economic growth and output,"" the report concluded, citing inefficient labor market outcomes, misallocated talent, suppressed innovation and reduced incentives for investment in human capital.
It noted that nearly 20% of U.S. workers reported being bound by noncompete agreements that limited an employee's ability to join or start up a competing firm, and said employer market power was responsible for keeping wages 15% below where they would be in a perfectly competitive market.

It said government actions could curtail these market forces through increased enforcement of current labor protection and antidiscrimination laws, support for greater unionization, which can lead to higher wages, and raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, where it has been fixed since 2009.
It also underscored the beneficial impact of providing affordable childcare and early childhood education, as well as paid family and medical leave, and a child tax credit - all measures included in Biden's ill-fated $1.7 trillion Build Back Better spending package that floundered in Congress last year.

PARIS (Reuters) -Sales at Birkin bag maker Hermes beat estimates in the first quarter, lifted by strong appetite for its luxury accessories, particularly in the United States and Europe, as the sector powers through turbulence from the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.
Hermes, which also sells silk scarves and porcelain tableware, had a strong start of the year in China until the beginning of March, when restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus prompted some store closures, including three in Shanghai, Executive Vice President for Finance Eric du Halgouet told journalists in a call.
“We are confident and hope that these stores in Shanghai will reopen quickly – in any case the fundamentals are excellent in China,"" he said. 
The French luxury group said revenues at constant exchange rates came rose 27% to 2.8 billion euros ($3.06 billion) in the three months to March, ahead of a consensus forecast of 15%organic growth.
The results confirm ""the year is off with a bang,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein.
Hermes shares rose as much as 4.5% and traded up 1.3% at 0900 GMT. 
All divisions clocked double-digit growth, including the leather goods and saddlery activity known for its Birkin and Kelly handbags, which accounts for nearly half of annual sales and reported 15.8% sales growth.
Other divisions grew even more, with ready-to-wear and accessories division up 44% and sales of watches up 62%.
Hermes is in close contact with its 60 employees in Russia, continuing to pay their salaries while providing training and psychological support, du Halgouet said. Some have relocated to countries nearby.
The group last month said it was suspending commercial operations in Russia, closing its three stores in Moscow and putting plans to open one in St. Petersburg on hold. All exports to the country have been halted and Hermes is complying with rules banning sales to sanctioned oligarchs, the executive added. 
Production of leather goods, which is based in France, has normalized after COVID-related disruptions at the start of the year, and production of other goods, including porcelain and silk has also increased since January, the finance chief said.
At the end of last year, Hermes missed market forecasts - a rare instance of underperforming rivals - as self-imposed production caps kept the group from meeting demand for its prized handbags.

Hermes limits volume growth in its leather goods production to 6% to 7% annually, preferring to have long waiting lists for its products rather than speed up production.

""The gargantuan Benetton and Blackstone-led Atlantia deal redefines how investors will think about infrastructure investments due to its sheer size alone.

""The price of 23.74 euros, which includes the dividend, is at a premium of 28% compared with the share price of Atlantia before speculations over possible bids began. I think it is adequate and there is a good chance of reaching the targeted 90% acceptance threshold.
""Potential counter-offers are unlikely because any rival consortium would be in a position of significant disadvantage.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp plans to launch a sport utility vehicle version of its Crown sedan for Japan, China and North America, three people said, revamping a car that has been a showpiece of Japan's market for nearly seven decades.
The SUV - which will come in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full-electric models - marks an attempt to bring the 67-year-old Crown more in line with market trends as consumers shy away from sedans, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
Sales of the hybrid are expected from the summer of 2023 and will include exports to China and North America, while the plug-in hybrid is intended for the domestic market, they said. 
The electric model is due to launch in early 2024 and the automaker has yet to finalise export plans, two of the people said.
As part of the overhaul, Toyota will also roll out a fully remodelled sedan version of the Crown from this summer, the people said. 
Both the SUV and the sedan will be manufactured at factories in Toyota City, Japan. 
A Toyota spokesperson declined to comment.
Largely sold in the domestic market for much of its history, the Crown was the first passenger car developed and built entirely in Japan, marking a pivotal moment in the country's rise to become a global automaking giant.
It was also the first car Toyota exported to the United States, in 1958. Two years later Toyota was forced to suspend exports as the Crown engine wasn't capable of speeds needed on American freeways.
Toyota sold more than 200,000 of the sedans in 1990 at the height of Japan's economic boom, but by last year domestic annual sales had dwindled to 21,000.

The Crown revamp also comes as Toyota - like other Japanese automakers - looks to shed the perception it has been slow to embrace battery electric vehicles.
The carmaker said last year it would invest around $70 billion to electrify its automobiles by 2030.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish telecom provider Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said on Thursday it would likely be fined by U.S. regulators for its handling of a bribery investigation in Iraq and reported a slide in quarterly earnings due to its suspension of business in Russia.
The company disclosed in February that an internal investigation had found it may have made payments to the Islamic State militant group in Iraq - misconduct it said ""started at least back in 2011"".
Shares in Ericsson tumbled 7% in early Thursday trade, bringing the stock's losses since news of the scandal broke to around 30%.
The U.S. Department of Justice could take a range of actions, it said. These ""may likely include additional monetary payments,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in a statement, adding that the company could not reliably estimate the size of the fine. 
Ericsson reported an 11% drop in adjusted operating earnings for the first quarter to 4.7 billion Swedish crowns ($500 million). It was hurt by a $95 million provision for its indefinite suspension of business in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.
Ongoing patent litigation with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a delay in the renewal of a 1 billion crown annual software contract to the current quarter also weighed on the results.
But revenue rose 11% to 55.1 billion crowns on higher demand for 5G telecom equipment, beating estimates of 53.36 billion crowns.
A fine would come on top of a $1 billion fine paid to the DOJ in 2019 to settle bribery cases in several countries. At the time, Ericsson also agreed to supervision by the regulators for three years.
""A fine is, in our view, the best Ericsson can hope for, as much worse scenarios have been discussed in the market recently,"" said Mads Rosendal, analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research.
Market speculation about possible penalties has ranged from sanctions on the company to a ban on selling in the United States to legal action being taken against top Ericsson executives.
In a public rebuke for the scandal, last week shareholders representing more than 10% of Ericsson shares voted against discharging board members of liability for the previous year. That means Ekholm and other board members could be held personally liable for their actions.
Ericsson has also been spending heavily to boost inventory for critical parts in the face of a global chip shortage.

""We do see that certain vital components need extra attention... we have decided to invest in buffer inventory for some of those vital components,"" Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander said.

The European Central Bank will be in the spotlight Thursday, as its policymakers meet to decide the path of monetary policy against a backdrop of record-high inflation as well as concerns about a war-related recession.
As it stands the ECB plans to end its emergency bond buying at some point in the third quarter, with interest rates going up ""some time"" after that. However, many of the central bank's peers have already started tightening policy, and investors will be looking to see if the central bank provides a clearer schedule for unwinding its extraordinary stimulus.
European markets had received a positive handover from Wall Street Thursday, as falling U.S. Treasury yields helped interest-sensitive growth stocks close substantially higher. 
Still, any gains are likely to be limited as geopolitical risks cap market optimism. Ukraine warned on Wednesday of an expected substantial Russian assault in the east of the country, while U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance.
In the corporate sector, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock slumped over 8% after the Swedish telecoms gear maker said its earnings fell in the first quarter and warned of further hits due to its withdrawal from Russia and a fresh U.S. fine for sanctions-busting.

Dunelm (LON:DNLM) stock rose 2.5% after the British homeware retailer reported strong sales growth in the third quarter, helped by the reopening of stores after coronavirus curbs were eased.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, handing back some of the week’s substantial gains after the release of a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories.
Data released Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. oil stocks rose more than 9 million barrels last week, substantially more than expected, even as U.S. gasoline stocks fell 3.6 million barrels.
Still, both benchmarks are well over 7% higher over the course of the week as worries over tightening global supply continue to weigh on sentiment.

After a hectic period, traders (and reporters) will be looking forward to the long Easter weekend but they must first get through what promises to be an eventful Thursday. 
Already in Asia, the normally staid Bank of Korea delivered a surprise rate hike -- despite not having a governor in place -- and warned inflation could top 4%, up from its February forecast of 3.1%. 
It also cut economic growth forecasts, part of a pattern where most central banks are acting against inflation, even at the cost of growth. Canada and New Zealand on Wednesday delivered half-point rate rises, while later on Thursday, the European Central Bank may set out a date to end bond purchases, even as high energy prices threaten recession. 
Despite data pointing to soaring inflation, bond yields have taken a tumble in recent days on fear that central banks' inflation battle will drag economies into a slowdown, or even recession.
Markets were unnerved by Wednesday's downbeat message from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s straight-talking CEO Jamie Dimon about ""storm clouds on the horizon"" for the economy. His bank also posted a 42% profit slump in the first quarter. 
Q1 earnings were always going to be a bit of a let-down after the post-COVID bounceback in early-2020, but JPM's 30%-70% fee declines from dealmaking, equity and investment banking still had the capacity to shock, as did the $1 billion it set aside against loan losses.
With share buybacks now in question, JPM shares fell 3%.
Investors clearly fear similar messages from other banks reporting on Thursday. Watch Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), tipped to see a 32% revenue decline in Q1. Given Goldman has beaten forecasts in each one of the past eight quarters, anything worse could weigh heavily on shares already down 16% this year.
So, want to see where the profits are? The world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor posted a 45% jump in Q1 net profit, benefiting from the global chip crunch. 
Meanwhile, falling Treasury yields are lifting stock markets; European and U.S. equities look set to follow Asia higher. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-Singapore tightens monetary policy for third time in six months
- Fed speakers: Philadelphia President Patrick Harker, Cleveland President Loretta Mester
-U.S. retail sales March/weekly jobless/University of Michigan inflation expectations

""The resolution of these matters could result in a range of actions by DOJ, and may likely include additional monetary payments, the magnitude of which cannot at this time be reliably estimated."" Ekholm said. 
Ekholm's admission accompanied news of an 8% drop in net profit in the first quarter to 2.9 billion Swedish kronor ($308 million), well below expectations for 4.8 billion kronor. That was despite an 11% rise in sales to 55.1 billion kronor. The results included a 900 million kronor charge that the company announced earlier this week as it suspended its business in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Around one-third of that charge will hit cash flow, with the rest coming as non-cash impacts.
Before the invasion, Russia had been a key growth market for the Swedish company, but it already faced substantial costs in relocating manufacturing production to the country under the requirements of a law that was scheduled to come into force next year.
The company's quarterly update wasn't without its positive elements. Gross margin was roughly stable at 42.3%, while it also reported strong demand for its Cradlepoint wireless product for enterprises, thanks to the rollout of 5G services in the U.S. However, its margin before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) remained stuck at 11%, well short of its medium-term target of 15%-18%. Ekholm said the company expects to need ""2-3 years"" to reach that target.
Ericsson stock had lost some 34% of its value in response to the disclosure of the Iraq issue in February, but has since retraced one-third of those losses.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) was seeking to understand the influence of Ma's fintech empire and the extent of its transactions with state banks and enterprises, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Ant did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters, while CCDI could not be immediately reached.
An affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Ant has been subjected to a sweeping restructuring by China, which derailed its $37 billion initial public offering in late 2020.

Bloomberg reported the anti-corruption watchdog was involved in queries sent to state firms in February about their exposure to Ant, as part of its investigation of former Communist Party Secretary of the technology hub of Hangzhou, Zhou Jiangyong, who was later expelled from the party.
The Financial Times reported in January that Hangzhou-based Ant was connected to the corruption case involving Zhou Jiangyong.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Thursday, helped by a positive close on Wall Street overnight but with investors cautiously awaiting a key policy-setting meeting from the European Central Bank.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.2%.
European markets are set to receive a positive handover from Wall Street Thursday, as falling U.S. Treasury yields helped interest-sensitive growth stocks close substantially higher. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index jumped over 2% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 1%.
However, most focus Thursday will be on the European Central Bank meeting later in the session, with the policymakers having to cope with record-high inflation as well as concerns about a war-related recession.
As it stands the ECB plans to end its emergency bond buying at some point in the third quarter, with interest rates going up ""some time"" after that. However, many of the central bank's peers have already started tightening policy, and investors will be looking to see if the central bank provides a clearer schedule for unwinding its extraordinary stimulus.
Any gains Thursday are likely to be limited as geopolitical risks cap market optimism. Ukraine warned on Wednesday of an expected ramped up Russian assault in the east of the country, while U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance.
In corporate news, Publicis (PA:PUBP) is likely to be in the spotlight after the world's third-biggest advertising group beat market expectations in the first quarter but stuck to its full-year outlook on Thursday, citing economic uncertainties.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, handing back some of the week’s substantial gains after the release of a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories.
Data released Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. oil stocks rose more than 9 million barrels last week, substantially more than expected, even if U.S. gasoline stocks fell 3.6 million barrels.
Still, both benchmarks are well over 7% higher over the course of the week as worries over tightening global supply continue to weigh on sentiment.
The International Energy Agency on Wednesday warned that from May onwards roughly 3 million barrels per day of Russian oil could be shut-in due to sanctions or voluntary embargoes.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $103.05 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $107.99. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,974.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.0917.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd said it will shut down a service that allowed Chinese gamers to access overseas platforms to play unapproved foreign games, in a sign of tightening compliance as Chinese regulators more closely scrutinize the industry.
The country's largest social and gaming firm said late on Wednesday it will on May 31 update its games speed booster mobile and desktop apps to new versions that would only support games operating in China. The new versions will no longer allow users to access foreign games.
Tencent first launched the apps in 2018. Such apps, which other companies like NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc also offer, act as network acceleration tools that help users boost their internet speeds.
Unlike most countries, gamers in China are only allowed to play titles approved by the government and are not allowed to play with foreigners on foreign servers. While such foreign games are not explicitly blocked by online curbs, local internet speeds are generally too slow for gamers to access them. 
As such, many gamers in China used such apps in practice to access unapproved foreign games such as Grand Theft Auto or Nintendo Co Ltd (TYO:7974)'s smash-hit Animal Crossing. The apps also over the years became grey-area channels for foreign game developers to reach users in the world's largest gaming market. 
Tencent declined to provide further comment on why it had decided to make changes to the app.
The move was greeted by Chinese gamers with dismay but also many said it was not surprising.

""This is expected given the direction things are going. It is harder to be a gamer in China by the day,"" a Chinese internet user wrote on microblogging site Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). 
The move comes days after China lifted a nine-month freeze on gaming licences. During this period gaming companies including Tencent made major adjustments to their business practices to comply with regulatory requests.

Home to ad agencies Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, the French company posted net revenue of 2.80 billion euros ($3.05 billion), up 10.5% organically, against a 6.3% increase forecast by analysts in a consensus compiled by Publicis.
""We started the year very strongly, both financially and commercially,"" Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun said in a statement as he shared his confidence in coming in at the upper end of an unchanged 4%-5% full-year organic growth target.
""These good results should not conceal the macroeconomic uncertainties the world is facing today,"" he however told journalists in a call. ""We have to remain agile.""
While the beat should have led Publicis to upgrade its objectives, the group expressed reservations on the consequences the global health situation, the conflict in Ukraine and the rise in raw materials and energy prices could have.
Publicis also needs to navigate a shift in sector trends as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google is looking to phase out use of what it described as privacy-invasive cookies.
Because the coming disappearance of third-party cookies raises the complexity of digital media, our role with customers becomes all the more essential, the group wrote in an email to Reuters, emphasising the competitive advantage of its data company Epsilon.
The latter's CORE ID solution does not depend on third-party cookies but relies on advertisers' ""first-party"" data, allowing their activation on publishers' sites directly.

In a cookie-less future, we believe Epsilon will actually grow its market share, Publicis noted.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Russian companies and global banks including BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could profit if Moscow moves to de-list Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
The potential windfall is due to the fees that bank issuers of depositary receipts can contractually charge investors when they cancel the product. 
It is unclear how much companies and banks could make or if banks will charge the fees and risk angering investors who say it would be unfair given the extraordinary circumstances which have been triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, the fees could potentially translate into hundreds of millions of dollars according to Reuters' calculations based on fee data provided by the sources.
Assailed by Western sanctions, Moscow is preparing to de-list Russian company depositary receipts from foreign exchanges and convert them into local Russian securities in a bid to reduce foreigners' control over these companies.
Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. They allow investors to dabble in overseas stocks in their own geography and time zone.
There are more than 30 depositary receipts on Russian companies including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Rosneft, Lukoil and Norilsk Nickel issued by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan, among others, trading on U.S. and European markets. 
Under standard agreements, depositary receipts can be canceled by the issuer or the investor. When that happens, the investor typically gets cash from the sale of the underlying shares, although they have the right to take custody of the shares instead. 
Banks charge an administration fee, typically around $0.05 per receipt, which may be shared with the companies, two sources said. 
If Moscow de-lists Russian depositary receipts, banks will have to cancel the products. Banks could still charge the fees, even though their hand was forced, according to three sources. 
For example, an investor in Rosneft with 150 million depositary receipts representing the same number of shares in the company could be on the hook for $7.5 million in cancellation fees, according to Reuters' calculations. 
Sweeping Western sanctions could make it challenging for banks to transfer the cash to some companies. 
Regardless, some investors say the fees should not apply. One global asset manager told Reuters that if Russia passes the de-listing law there should be no fees as investors would have no choice in the matter. The other two sources, however, say banks still have to cover their costs.
BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment. Russian companies did not respond to a Reuters emails seeking comment.
MARKET FREEZE
As Western sanctions pummeled Russian stocks from late February, the Moscow exchange closed and the Russian central bank banned foreigners from transferring shares out of their custody accounts. It also barred foreigners from selling Russian shares. 
The restrictions made it nearly impossible for banks to cancel receipts when asked by investors anxious to slash their Russia exposure. 
With curbs on custodians recently lifted, BNY Mellon, Citi and JPMorgan have resumed processing cancellations. But because the foreign banks still can't sell the shares, investors have to take custody of them instead. To do that, investors need an account in Russia, which many don't have.
As a result, a lot of investors are likely to hold onto the receipts for the time being, according to three people. 
Many investors are worried, however, about the de-listing bill which Russia is preparing. 

Aside from the potential cancellation fees, investors are worried about what will happen if they can't open a local custody account.
In a note to clients, JPMorgan said clients may be able to open a Russian account under some unspecified circumstances if the new law is passed.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund on Thursday signed two agreements to invest in toll roads on the islands of Sumatra and Java worth more than 39 trillion rupiah ($2.72 billion), President Joko Widodo said.
The Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) signed a heads of agreement with state construction firm Hutama Karya to invest in three parts of the Trans Sumatra toll road, said Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who also attended the signing ceremony in Jakarta. 
INA also signed a confirmation on the start of a transaction with Waskita Toll Road, a unit of another state-owned construction firm, Waskita Karya , for two parts of the Trans Java toll road, she said. 
The signings are INA's first concrete steps since forming a toll road fund last year of up to $3.75 billion, with Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), APG Asset Management (APG) and a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) as co-investors.
The signings and INA's good governance would create greater trust in infrastructure financing in Southeast Asia's largest economy, from both domestic and international investors, Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said. 
""I think this kind of financing scheme we will continue to develop,"" he said. ""God willing, bigger investors will come to Indonesia via the INA and not just (investing in) toll roads but also big projects that will affect the economy.""
INA's chief executive Ridha Wirakusumah said other projects that the fund is considering to invest in this year include sea ports, geothermal and healthcare projects.
The wealth fund's assets under management amounted to nearly $6 billion, but it aims to grow the figure to between $15 billion to $20 billion within three years supported by help from co-investors, the CEO told Reuters last month.

Unlike many other sovereign wealth funds, which manage excess oil revenues or foreign exchange reserves, the INA seeks foreign funds as co-investors to finance the country's economic development.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, as China hinted that it would loosen monetary policy further and the bond market dialed back bets on aggressive interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.12% by 11:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.05%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.45%, with employment data showing that the employment change was 17,900, the full employment change was 20,500, and the unemployment rate was 4% in March 2022.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.31%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.66% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.35%.
The People’s Bank of China is expected to cut the one-year policy loans interest rate on Friday, the second time it would be doing so in 2022 to date. The central bank could also lower the reserve requirement ratio soon, as the lockdowns to curb the country's latest COVID-19 outbreak impact the economy.
An upward trend in shorter maturity U.S. Treasuries could also indicate that investors are readjusting their bets on how fast the Fed will tighten monetary policy. Tuesday’s consumer price index data spurred cautious optimism that inflation is peaking, although producer price index (PPI) data released a day later reminded investors not to jump too quickly to conclusions.
The PPI rose 11.2% year-on-year and 1.4% month-on-month, while the core PPI rose 9.2% year-on-year and 1% month-on-month, in March.
Oil traded near the $104 mark as concerns about tight supply continue. Commodity-driven inflation, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine precipitated by Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, continues to impact the economy and investor sentiment.
Inflation and the conflict were creating “significant” challenges, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, with the firm among the first big U.S. banks reporting earnings for the first quarter of 2022.
“Fed rate hike expectations will get tested in the coming months” partly on geopolitical risks, OANDA senior market analyst Ed Moya said in a note.
The European Union warned its member states that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand that “unfriendly countries” pay for Russian gas in rubles would violate sanctions. Putin has threatened to halt gas supplies to buyers who do not comply with the request. For its part, the U.S. is looking to provide a new $800 million package of military assistance to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea hiked its interest rate to 1.5% as it handed down its latest policy decision. The European Central Bank will hand its own policy decision, while in the U.S. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak, later in the day.
U.S. data, including retail sales and University of Michigan consumer sentiment, is also due later in the day. Australia, Hong Kong, and the U.S. are among the markets closed for a holiday on Friday."
149,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 10:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks rose as expectations grew that the central bank may cut its key policy interest rate on Friday, boosting sentiment among investors who are waiting on authorities to take more steps to revive growth.
The CSI 300 Index rose as much as 1.3%, with consumer stocks leading the advance. The onshore yuan rose 0.05% to 6.3643 per dollar, while the 10-year government bond yields were steady. 
Bets for easing have risen as China’s largest Covid-19 outbreak in two years worsens the growth outlook and saps investor sentiment already hurt by persistent regulatory headwinds and rising global borrowing costs. Still, investors say unless China loosens grips on its tight Covid-19 containment policy, a rate cut by itself won’t be enough to turn the tide on stocks.  
READ: Xi Says China Must Stick to Covid Zero Even as Costs Mount
The negative overhang from “persistent fears” of consumers and businesses to borrow implies that cuts to interest rates will not be enough to trigger a significant rally, according to Kelvin Wong, an analyst at CMC Markets (Singapore). “The best-case scenario is some sort of stabilization in the equity market because of the rate cuts.”
Fifteen of the 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the People’s Bank of China will lower the interest rate on one-year policy loans on Friday -- 11 of them forecast a 10 basis-point reduction to 2.75% and four expect a 5-point drop. The rest see no change.
The PBOC is also likely to reduce the reserve requirement ratio -- the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve -- in the coming days after the State Council, China’s cabinet, hinted strongly of a cut on Wednesday, saying it would lower the ratio “at an appropriate time.”
‘Limited Boost’
Even with Thursday’s gains, the benchmark is on course for a second week of losses. Traders have been debating whether the market have hit the bottom after a sweeping set of promises from authorities in mid-March saw shares stage a dramatic rebound following a historic rout.
“This will help the market from being utterly disheartened by the lack of monetary easing action, but I think it will give only a limited boost,” said Wang Zhuo, fund manager at Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management Co. “I would like to see how much of a cut, and whether a rate cut follows, before becoming more upbeat, but at least its a small comfort.”
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index advanced as much as 0.8%, while a gauge on Chinese tech stocks rose more than 1%.

(Reuters) -A federal judge said on Wednesday Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was liable to a Black elevator operator who said the electric car company ignored racial abuse at the factory where he worked, but reduced a nearly $137 million jury award to $15 million.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco ruled after jurors last October found that Tesla subjected Owen Diaz to a hostile environment at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California by allowing and failing to stop the racism he faced.
Diaz, who worked at the plant for nine months in 2015 and 2016, said other employees used racist slurs when speaking to him, and scrawled swastikas and slurs including the ""N-word"" on bathroom walls. He also said one supervisor drew a racist caricature near his workstation.
In a 43-page decision, Orrick said the evidence amply supported the jury's finding Tesla liable for the ""profound"" emotional harm Diaz suffered and the ""often inadequate"" disciplinary steps the company took.
But the judge reduced Diaz's compensatory damages to $1.5 million from the ""excessive"" $6.9 million that the jury awarded, and lowered punitive damages to $13.5 million from the ""unconstitutionally large"" $130 million jury award.
Bernard Alexander, a lawyer for Diaz, in an interview said his client plans to appeal the lowered damages award.
""We're pleased that the court upheld the jury's finding that Tesla's conduct was absolutely reprehensible,"" Alexander said.
""The award of $15 million is substantial but does not come close to reflecting the harm caused to Mr. Diaz, or the reprehensibility of Tesla's conduct,"" he added.
Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The company had sought to limit compensatory and punitive damages to $300,000 each.
Led by billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla faces similar claims in other lawsuits.
In one such case, California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged in February that Black workers at the Fremont plant endured constant harassment, but saw their complaints ignored.
Tesla previously called that lawsuit misguided, and said it has adopted policies to prevent and punish racist conduct.
Compensatory damages are meant to cover actual losses, while punitive damages are meant to punish and deter violations. 
Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, punitive damages typically should be less than 10 times compensatory damages.

Legal experts had called Diaz's original $137 million award one of the largest for a single plaintiff alleging workplace discrimination.
The case is Diaz v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-06748.

(Reuters) - Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) Corp said on Wednesday that its Peruvian mine remains closed after six weeks of a standoff with protesters, accusing Peru's government of failing to intervene to guarantee security for its 1,300 workers and their families.
A recent deal aimed at ending protests at the Cuajone copper mine required the company to withdraw complaints against protest leaders, amid a continuing blockade of its railway to transport minerals and supplies, the company said in a statement. Production has been suspended since Feb. 28.
Peru's Energy Ministry said in a separate statement that it had also reached an agreement with Southern Copper to start talks to find common ground with local communities.
""If we closed for a year, the government would stop receiving more than 3.1 billion soles ($830 million) in taxes and royalties, and 8,000 direct and indirect jobs would be lost. That's what we want to avoid,"" the Southern Copper statement added.
Peru is facing a wave of protests from indigenous communities that accuse mining firms of not providing enough jobs and money to impoverished locals.
Central bank official Adrian Armas said last week that protests hitting copper mines such as MMG's Las Bambas and Southern Copper's Cuajone are weighing down the economy.
Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer and mining is a key source of tax revenue.
Protests hit several mining companies in Peru when leftist President Pedro Castillo took office last July after winning the election with support from the country's impoverished mining regions.

Speaking as the carmaker celebrated the successful test drive of its EQXX prototype vehicle over more than 1,000 km from Sindelfingen in Germany to the Cote d'Azur on a single charge, CTO Markus Schaefer said efficient design was key to maximising an electric car's range.
""First we optimise efficiency, and then we can see how many battery modules we put in the car,"" Schaefer said at a media roundtable, adding that customers should be able to decide the size of the battery they want based on their needs.
Carmakers from Mercedes-Benz to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to China's Nio (NYSE:NIO) are in a neck-to-neck race to produce higher range cars that dispel consumer anxiety over the lack of widespread charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
Mercedes unveiled its Vision EQXX prototype, boasting a 1,000 km-range with a battery half the volume of its flagship EQS model, in January, promising that some of the car's components would make their way into series vehicles in 2-3 years time.
The car spent 8.7 kilowatt hours of energy per 100 km on its 11-and-a-half hour drive to France, Mercedes-Benz said, about twice as efficient as Mercedes models on the market and Tesla's longest-range car on offer, the Model S 60.

Mercedes' EQS has the highest range on the market as of yet, according to car comparison portal carwow, with 768 km, followed by Tesla's Model S Long Range with up to 652 km.
""There'll be a further increase for some time before a fall, which will happen once charging infrastructure is as available as petrol stations,"" Schaefer said, although he declined to state what range Mercedes was targeting in future models.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Advanced hackers have shown they can take control of an array of devices that help run power stations and manufacturing plants, the U.S. government said in an alert https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a on Wednesday, warning of the potential for cyber spies to harm critical infrastructure.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other government agencies issued a joint advisory saying the hackers' malicious software could affect a type of device called programmable logic controllers made by Schneider Electric (EPA:SCHN) and OMRON Corp.
OMRON did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A Schneider spokesperson confirmed it had worked with U.S. officials to defend against the hackers, calling it ""an instance of successful collaboration to deter threats on critical infrastructure before they occur.""
The controllers are common across a variety of industries - from gas to food production plants - but Robert Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, which helped uncover the malware, said researchers believed the hackers' intended targets were liquefied natural gas and electric facilities. 
In its alert, the Cybersecurity Agency urged critical infrastructure organizations, ""especially Energy Sector organizations,"" to implement a series of recommendations aimed at blocking and detecting the cyber weapon, named Pipedream. 
Although the government warning was vague - it did not say which hackers were behind the malware or if it had actually been used - it sent concern coursing across the industry.
In a sign of how seriously the discovery was being taken, CISA said it was making its announcement alongside the Energy Department, the National Security Agency and the FBI.
Programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, are embedded in a huge number of plants and factories and any interference with their operation has the potential to cause harm, from shutdowns to blackouts to chemical leaks, wrecked equipment or even explosions. 
Lee said the tool developed by the mystery hackers was ""highly capable"" and had likely been in the works for several years.
""It is as dangerous as people are making it out to be,"" Lee said in an interview.
Western cybersecurity officials are already on edge over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the deployment of malware aimed at causing electrical outages.
Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos' vice president of threat intelligence, said Pipedream could be understood as a ""toolbox"" of different hacking tools. Each component offers a different way to subvert normal controls, giving the hackers a variety of options to launch attacks. 

For example, Caltagirone said that one of the tools within Pipedream would have allowed the attackers to damage Schneider Electric's PLC in such a way that it would need to be entirely replaced. 
""Because of existing supply chain challenges it could take longer to get replacement controllers after such an attack,"" Caltagirone said. ""What this means is a liquefied natural gas facility might be out of commission for months.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - San Francisco police were left scratching their heads after they pulled over a car earlier this month for driving without headlights at night and found no one inside.
In what otherwise would have been a great April Fools' Day joke, San Francisco police officers pulled over a driverless car operated by General Motor Co's Cruise unit on April 1 and found no one behind the wheel. The resulting video footage has gone viral online.
The two officers, who were not identified, pulled the car over and were puzzled by the lack of humans inside, according to a video posted on Instagram that has been viewed almost 80,000 times. 
""Ain’t nobody in it. This is crazy,"" said one of the officers, who tried to open the vehicle door before walking back to his cruiser. The car subsequently drove through the intersection and stopped again in the next block as bystanders laughed.
The video illustrated what Cruise Chief Executive Kyle Vogt previously said was one of the biggest challenges for autonomous vehicles - how to interact with humans. 
Cruise, which blamed human error for the lack of headlights, said it works closely with the police on how to interact with its vehicles and has a dedicated phone number for police to call. Once the officer was clear of the vehicle, Cruise said the car relocated to the nearest safe location.
Cruise is operating a small number of vehicles to give full driverless rides to the public free of charge at night in San Francisco. The company is seeking the last regulatory approval required to launch commercial driverless service in the densely populated city.
Ironically, Cruise CEO Vogt last month had said a scenario where a police officer pulls over a driverless car has to go smoothly.
""You are kind of papering over all the weird stuff that can happen when there's no driver,"" he said at a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) conference. 
The San Francisco police department said the officers were able to make contact with the vehicle's remote operator and a maintenance team took control. Cruise was lucky in another respect.
""No citation was issued during the traffic stop,"" the police department said. 
Social media had fun with the incident.
""Insane that no citation was issued,"" Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user Theodectes said. ""Why was this driverless car behaving as if it was completely drunk?""

""IT WAS DRIVING WITHOUT ITS HEADLIGHTS!!! Cops weren't confused, they we're probably questioning why cutting edge technology somehow can't turn its own lights on,"" Albino Guidedog said on YouTube.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) showed assets under management back below $10 trillion, hurt by the market rout in the first quarter, and cautioned that fees could come under pressure over the rest of the year because of volatile markets.
Still, BlackRock posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit as the world's largest asset manager benefited from investors continuing to pour money into its various index-traded and active funds.
""Our clients are trying to understand the implications of the rapidly changing investment environment,"" said Laurence D. Fink, chairman and chief executive, who pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as creating ""a supply shock in commodities that is further increasing inflation."" 
Adjusted profit rose to $1.46 billion, or $9.52 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.2 billion, or $8.04 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $8.75 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The New York-based firm ended the quarter with $9.57 trillion in assets under management. While that was up from $9.01 trillion a year earlier it was down from its record $10 trillion in the fourth quarter 2021. 
The quarterly drop occurred mainly due to the sell-off in equities and fixed income markets, although there were also some outflows in retail fixed income and cash management. That was driven by redemptions from offshore prime and U.S. government money market funds, BlackRock said, in line with the broader money market fund industry. 
As investors anticipate that the U.S. Federal Reserve will aggressively hike rates to combat sky-high inflation, bond yields have shot higher and the yield curve has inverted, which many see as an omen for a pending recession. 
""Across the board, you're seeing portfolios are being navigated around fixed income,"" Fink said, adding that clients ""are reevaluating where they should be across the yield curve."" 
Flows into the asset manager's funds remained positive, attracting total net flows of $86 billion in the first quarter, down from $172 billion a year earlier, primarily due to seasonal cash management outflows of $27 billion.
BlackRock predicted recent market volatility could result in lower performance fees from liquid alternatives and long-only products during the remainder of the year, according to Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin.
Despite the results beat, BlackRock's shares closed down marginally at $715.74. They fell nearly 17% in the first quarter.

""The risk for this year is that visibility is low, and there's a lot of uncertainty and that's a negative for the stock,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA, adding over the longer term, there still remains several positive growth catalysts at the firm. 
Total revenue rose about 7% to $4.69 billion, helped by higher investment advisory and administration fees. That compared with estimates of $4.73 billion.

Investing.com -- The Dow closed higher Wednesday as tech and consumer discretionary stocks chalked up gains to offset a stumble in financials after JPMorgan kicked off the quarterly earnings season with underwhelming results. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%, or 344 points, the S&P 500 rose 1%, and the Nasdaq added 2%.
Technology was in the ascendency, supported by rising megacap stocks, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), both up more than 2% leading the charge as Treasury yields slipped for a second-straight day.
Chip stocks were also doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after New Street Research upgraded the chipmaker to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock $280 from $255, citing the strength of its data center business.
Sentiment in the sector was also boosted by Bloomberg data showing that investors have been piling into chip stocks. Investor inflows into semiconductor ETFs jumped to $6.8 billion, topping the $5.2 billion of inflows seen in all of 2021.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the sectors leading the broader market higher, underpinned by a rally in travel-related stocks including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and Carnival (NYSE:CCL), after better than feared results from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) pointed to strong travel demand. 
Delta forecast a return to profit in the second quarter after reporting a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss.
Financials, however, bucked the trend higher, ending the day marginally lower amid pressure from a 3% decline in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
JPMorgan reported first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates owing to higher than expected provisions for bad debt, with the bank citing “higher probabilities of downside risk.”
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:NYSE:WFC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:NYSE:MS), which all report on Thursday, ended mixed. 
Asset management firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) reported quarterly results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, supported by a jump in assets under management.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) cut intraday losses to trade about 1% lower after posting a surprise quarterly loss as rising shipping costs weighed. 
Energy stocks were boosted by ongoing climb in the oil prices after The International Energy Agency forecast a slight deficit in supplies this year amid weaker demand and the impact of sanctions on Russia oil.
The forecast of a deficit comes in the wake of the weekly data showing U.S. crude stockpiles rose by a more than expected 9.4 million barrels last week.
APA (NASDAQ:APA),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and Hess (NYSE:HES) were among the biggest gainers in the sector.

Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) cast a note of positivity on the travel sector, saying huge demand for travel is helping it offset rising fuel costs. That is expected to bode well for other airlines, as well as hotels and other travel and leisure stocks.

SpiceJet, which currently operates 11 MAX aircraft and has 144 pilots to fly them, said the pilots have been restricted from operating the jets until they undergo retraining to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) satisfaction.
Indian media reported that the restrictions were imposed after flaws were discovered at a simulator facility near Delhi where they had received training for the Boeing jet.
The pilots continue to remain available for other Boeing 737 aircraft and the restriction does not impact MAX operations, a SpiceJet spokesperson said.
The airline is Boeing's biggest customer in the South Asian nation for MAX planes. 
""We are working closely with all parties involved including our supplier and the DGCA to ensure the maintenance and operation of this specific device complies with all regulatory requirements,"" Boeing said in a statement.
""We are committed to ensuring our customers receive high quality simulation experiences in accordance with all regulations.""

The government has cancelled the work permit of Jean-Christian Bergeron, who has led the company for three years, the Nation said.
Bergeron did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment and Rubis Energie's offices in France were closed. Reuters reached out to the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, which is charged with immigration, but it had closed by the time of publishing this report.
Kenya's fuel crisis that has led to long queues at service stations has put pressure on government officials to clamp down on rising domestic prices.
Rubis Energy Kenya is owned by Rubis Energie, a subsidiary of the Rubis Group which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange, following the full acquisition of both KenolKobil and Gulf Energy Holdings in 2019. 
Andrew Kamau, Principal Secretary at Kenya's ministry of petroleum and mining did not answer his phone when Reuters tried to reach him.
Quoting senior government sources, The Nation said Rubis was among several fuel distributors accused of ""having some queer shortages and rationed sales.""

On Tuesday, the Energy and Petroleum regulatory Authority (EPRA) said it would crack down on fuel companies ""giving priority to export loadings while the local market was left to suffer intermittent supply.""
Kenya's government last week said it would pay subsidy arrears to petrol retailers to allay fears of potential fuel shortages and forestall a crisis. Frustrated motorists have been queuing in long lines at petrol stations for days due to the biting shortages.

(Reuters) -Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares on Wednesday took a bullish stance on the U.S. market despite rising fears of a downturn, as the carmaker's shareholders voted against the 2021 compensation package for top executives.
Speaking at the carmaker's annual shareholders' meeting, Tavares said Stellantis was confirming its forecast for double-digit operating income margin this year, and added that expected sales in North America, especially in its highly profitable U.S. business, should rise 3%.
The company, whose brands include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat, Opel and Maserati, reported an above-target adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8% last year, with a record 16.3% in North America, where it sells highly-profitable Jeep and Ram pickup truck models.
Despite these results, just over 52% of Stellantis shareholders voted at the meeting against the 2021 executive remuneration report for senior managers, including Tavares. 
However, the vote will not affect planned compensations for last year, based on legislation in the Netherlands, where Stellantis is based.
""Today's vote on remunerations is only consultative, so the remuneration report for 2021 will be implemented,"" a source close to the matter told Reuters.
Chairman John Elkann said Stellantis would take into account the shareholder vote, which he described as a recommendation.
""It is our conviction as a board that in a meritocracy, rewarding on the basis of performance criteria is a fundamental element of our policy,"" Elkann told shareholders. ""We will take on this vote which is, again, a recommendation"".
French state investor BPIFrance, which owns a 6.15% stake in Stellantis, was among those who voted against the 2021 pay package, which added up to around 19 million euros ($20.6 million), plus a stock package worth some additional 32 million euros and long-term compensation of about 25 million euros.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tavares' package was ""excessive"" but added that France could not cap executive pay on its own for fear of losing top corporate talent.
""This salary is excessive and must lead us to think about the level of CEO pay compared to staff salaries, but we must do it on a European level because otherwise we will lose all the good CEOs who are able to deliver strong results,"" he said on France 5 television. 
Stellantis said later on Wednesday it was taking note of the feedback resulting from the advisory vote on the remuneration report and would explain in the 2022 remuneration report how this vote has been taken into account.
Tavares also said the company expected sales to be up or stable in all of its major markets in 2022 and reiterated a forecast for a positive cash flow at the end of this year.

Light vehicle sales fell 17% in the United States in the first quarter, as a global chip shortage and the Ukraine crisis squeezed inventories and rising prices pushed less affluent buyers out of the market.

""From the point of view of consumer demand, it should be a good year. We have a return to the bars... The World Cup will take place for the first time in the summer,"" said Jereissati Neto on the second day of presentations to analysts and investors. He did not disclose any specific forecast.

Chief Financial Officer Lucas Lira said the business is permeated by ""macro challenges and volatility throughout this year,"" but added, ""after two years of demand pressures, there is the need from consumers to reconnect."" The CEO said that rising inflation has a bigger impact on the company's most popular brands, while the higher priced ones have been ""very resilient in recent years.""
Popular brands in Brazil include Brahma and Skol, while Stella Artois is one of the company's premium beers.

Litt's investment firm Land & Buildings notified the U.S. warehouse-focused real estate investment trust in a letter on Tuesday that he had withdrawn his director nominations, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
A Land & Buildings spokesperson did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of the nominations. 
Litt had nominated himself and Donna Brandin, a former chief financial officer of Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), as director candidates to LXP's eight member board in December.
The move comes after the company said on April 8 that it ""determined to suspend"" its review process, citing macroeconomic, geopolitical and financing conditions. LXP's stock price has dropped 14% since the announcement.
LXP began its review process in early February, after Litt, whose hedge fund invests roughly $500 million, told the company that he would be willing to pay $16 a share in cash, without offering details on how he would finance a potential bid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global investor optimism lifted shares on Wednesday despite blurry inflation forecasts as bank earnings and oil supply concerns boosted trading sentiment.
The Japanese yen weakened past the 126 yen per dollar mark on Wednesday for the first time since 2002, while the euro was pinned at a one-month low as investors bought the U.S. currency after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials.
The prospect of fast and aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes and growing market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep rates ultra-low in the near term have fueled the Japanese currency's declines against the dollar.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields fell - and data on inflation did not dissuade investors from believing that inflation may have peaked.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.03% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.79%.
Equity markets have suffered from hawkish moves from the world's top central banks in response to inflation, analysts said.
But data on Wednesday showed no let-up for Britain after inflation hit a 30-year high of 7%, although this came a day after a lower-than-expected U.S. print had given some traders cause to hope policy would be tightened more slowly.
""Another month, another jump in inflation figures around the world,"" said Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at asset manager Janus Henderson.
""The increase in prices further ratchets up the pressure on the Bank of England to respond to dampen the squeeze on real incomes. However, fading growth forecasts show the danger to the economy from tightening too quickly or too far.""
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.74%, the S&P 500 gained 0.89% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.75%.
Investors, poised for lackluster earning results from the largest U.S. banks, have been eyeing investment banking revenue, which has stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. In the first quarter, the total value of pending and completed deals fell to its lowest since the second quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv data.
Overnight in Asia, much weaker-than-expected import data from China weighed on the outlook, but added to views that Beijing could ease policy further, helping MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.89% higher.
Japan also posted weak machinery orders data, although its stocks closed higher on the U.S. inflation data that had shown consumer prices rose by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as war in Ukraine boosted the cost of gasoline to record highs, although underlying inflation pressures moderated.
OIL, GOLD FIRMER 
After the prior day's fall, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose on Wednesday and was last down 5.3 basis points to 2.674%, compared to an over three-year peak of 2.836%, before the inflation data. 
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 5.5 basis points at 2.334%. 
""The most important issue this year is how the Federal Reserve is going to respond to the rising levels of inflation,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Short-term interest rate expectations have jumped and long-term interest rates have moved higher.""
In the euro zone, meanwhile, a key gauge of long-term inflation briefly breached 2.4% on Wednesday, above the European Central Bank's 2% target ahead of its next meeting on Thursday. 
In response, bond yields in the bloc climbed, with Germany's 10-year yield at 0.810%.
Oil prices rose after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that on-and-off peace talks with Ukraine had hit a dead end, fuelling supply worries, with U.S. crude recently rose 3.51% to $104.13 per barrel.
Brent was at $108.64, up 3.82% on the day.
Gold bounced off its lows to add 0.6% to $1,978.03 an ounce. 
In currency markets, the euro was last up 0.52% to $1.0882. The U.S. dollar soared to a nearly 20-year high against a sluggish yen on Wednesday, as aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve contrasted sharply with the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.
The greenback rose as high as 126.32 yen, its strongest level since June 2002. However, the dollar index last fell 0.455%, with the euro up 0.53% to $1.0883. (FRX) 
The New Zealand dollar was down 1.1% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised interest rates by 50 basis points -- its most aggressive hike in over two decades -- but tempered its rate outlook. 

Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point - its biggest single move in more than two decades - and promised more hikes to fight soaring inflation that is being driven in part by the war in Ukraine.
The central bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to 1% from 0.5%. It also said it would allow government bonds it amassed during the COVID-19 pandemic to roll off as they mature from April 25, beginning what is known as quantitative tightening.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, which agreed last month to be acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, was sued on Wednesday by a shareholder who accused the insurance company of making inadequate and misleading disclosures about the $11.6 billion takeover.
In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the plaintiff Shiva Stein said Alleghany failed in a proxy statement to adequately explain the financial basis for the ""fairness opinion"" issued by its bankers at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which assessed whether the deal was fair to shareholders.
Absent additional disclosures, ""plaintiff will be unable to make a fully-informed decision regarding whether to vote in favor of the proposed transaction, and she is thus threatened with irreparable harm,"" the complaint said.
Stein wants to block Berkshire from buying New York-based Alleghany unless more disclosures are made, and also seeks unspecified damages. The New Jersey resident has not argued that the takeover price is too low.
Alleghany did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to a similar request. Berkshire is not a defendant.
Shareholders like Stein often sue to block corporate mergers when they find the terms unfair or the disclosures too sparse.
On April 1, Stein sued Mandiant Inc to block the cybersecurity company's $5.4 billion takeover by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, also citing an alleged lack of disclosures to support a Goldman fairness opinion.
Berkshire agreed on March 21 to pay $848.02 per share for Alleghany, a 25% premium.
Goldman's fairness opinion called that price ""fair from a financial point of view"" to Alleghany shareholders.

The purchase would expand Berkshire's large portfolio of insurers, including Geico and General Re. It would also reunite Buffett with Alleghany Chief Executive Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008.
The case is Stein v  Alleghany Corp  et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03057.

It is Amazon's first such surcharge and follows months of higher wage and labor-related expenses that have chipped away at the online retailer's profit.
Effective April 28, Amazon will charge an average 24 cents more per unit it stores and ships through its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service. The surcharge, which is not permanent, is ""a mechanism broadly used across supply chain providers,"" Amazon wrote in a message to merchants, which it shared with Reuters.
""We have experienced significant cost increases and absorbed them, wherever possible, to reduce the impact on our selling partners,"" the message said. ""In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as COVID-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges.""

So far, Amazon has only announced a surcharge in the United States, its biggest market. While sellers can avoid the higher cost by shipping goods to customers directly, many rely on FBA for eligibility in Amazon's fast-delivery club Prime.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 climbed Wednesday, as strength in tech helped offset weakness in financials after JPMorgan kicked off the quarterly earnings season.
The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%, or 258 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.8%.
Technology stocks were in the ascendency as investors swooped into big tech, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) leading the charge up more than 1% as Treasury yields slipped for a second-straight day.
Chip stocks were also doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after New Street Research upgraded the chipmaker to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock $280 from $255, citing the strength of its data center business.
Sentiment in the sector was also boosted by Bloomberg data showing that investors have been piling into chip stocks. Investor inflows into semiconductor ETFs jumped to $6.8 billion, topping the $5.2 billion of inflows seen in all of 2021.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the sectors leading the broader market higher, underpinned by a rally in travel-related stocks including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), and Carnival (NYSE:CCL), after better than feared results from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) pointed to strong travel demand. 
Delta forecast a return to profit in the second quarter after reporting a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss.
Financials, however, bucked the trend higher, weighed down by a more than 3% decline in JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) after first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates owing to higher than expected provisions for bad debt, citing “higher probabilities of downside risk.”
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:NYSE:WFC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:NYSE:MS), which all report on Thursday, were mostly in the red as investors appear to be pricing in higher credit loss provisions.
Asset management firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) reported quarterly results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, supported by a jump in assets under management.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) cut intraday losses to trade about 1% lower after posting a surprise quarterly loss as rising shipping costs weighed. 
Energy stocks were boosted by ongoing climb in the oil prices after The International Energy Agency forecast a slight deficit in supplies this year amid weaker demand and the impact of sanctions on Russia oil.
The forecast of a deficit comes in the wake of the weekly data showing U.S. crude stockpiles rose by a more than expected 9.4 million barrels last week.
APA (NASDAQ:APA),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and Hess (NYSE:HES) were among the biggest gainers in the sector.",,,

MILAN (Reuters) -Iliad is considering buying into  Telecom Italia  (BIT:TLIT)'s (TIM) domestic consumer services operations as part of the French phone group's push to strengthen its Italian business, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Iliad is weighing the investment as TIM works on a turnaround plan centred around a split of the debt-laden former phone monopoly's wholesale fixed network from its services business.
Iliad targets in particular the domestic consumer service unit TIM would create as part of its reorganisation process. 
Such a unit would include TIM's fixed and mobile consumer businesses, which last year accounted for 73% of its 9.9 billion euro ($11 billion) domestic service revenue. It would also include mobile frequencies.
TIM and Iliad declined to comment.
Founded by French billionaire Xavier Niel, Iliad launched low cost mobile services in Italy in 2018, intensifying already ferocious price competition in the country's crowded telecoms market.
Top executives at Iliad have repeatedly stated the group's interest in an Italian peer if anything came up for sale. 
One of the sources said Iliad had informed TIM's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) of its interest in the consumer business. A spokesperson for Vivendi said the French media group had not had any contact with Iliad.
A third source close to the matter said TIM had not received any proposal from Iliad so far.
The French group has shifted its focus to TIM after a failed approach for Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s Italian operations in February.
At the time Iliad teamed with Apax Partners to submit an 11.25 billion euro non-binding bid which the British operator swiftly rejected.
Apax, which is looking at a potential investment into TIM's services business, is not working with Iliad at present, a fourth source familiar with the situation said, dismissing reports in some Italian newspapers of the pair teaming up again.
TIM has been drawing the attention of investment funds as it looks to unlock value by carving out assets.
Last week it effectively blocked a takeover approach by KKR, but the U.S. fund could still play a role in the spin-off of TIM's network in which it is an investor.
The spin-off would facilitate a mooted merger of TIM's network assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber, with state lender CDP in control.
CDP is TIM's second-biggest investor after Vivendi. The French media group would shift its focus on TIM's services business, which has already attracted interest from investment fund CVC. 
""With the odds of a KKR bid now virtually at zero, the breakup scenario seems to involve more and more options given the string of potential interested parties for certain portions of TIM's business"", broker Banca Akros said in a note.

Akros said TIM's consumer services business could be worth around 4 billion euros.

Last month, Ford confirmed the final EPA-estimated battery range for F-150 Lightning. The truck's range on a single charge is between 230 miles and 320 miles, depending on trim level and battery pack.
The automaker will mark the launch with an event at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, where the electric truck is assembled.
Pricing for the electric F-150 starts at just under $40,000 for the work truck version, excluding destination charges. The base MSRP for the Platinum model is $90,874. These prices do not take into consideration federal incentives for electric vehicle buyers.
However, if you haven't already pre-ordered, Ford isn't even letting you put your name on the list at the moment. Ford had previously said the F-150 Lightning would begin deliveries sometime this spring and stopped taking deposits on the truck in December after receiving 200,000 reservations ahead of launch.
The American automaker has already taken steps to prevent dealers from jacking up prices and to keep buyers from quickly reselling them to the highest bidder, but the supply will likely be tight. Ford is already making moves to double the annual production capacity of the Lightning to 150,000 units per year, a target it expects to reach sometime next year.

Nexo said the card, available in selected European countries initially, allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets such as bitcoin, which are used as collateral to back the credit granted.
Most traditional credit cards are unsecured and have a set credit limit.
The card is linked to a Nexo-provided, crypto-backed credit line and can be used at 92 million merchants worldwide where Mastercard is accepted, allowing investors to spend up to 90% of the fiat value of their crypto assets, Nexo said.
""The card requires no minimum repayments, monthly, or inactivity fees. There are no FX fees for up to 20,000 euros per month,"" Nexo said.
There are no restrictions on how much a customer can spend or withdraw from the open credit line and interest is only paid on the amount of credit actually used. Interest remains at 0% for customers who maintain a loan-to-value ratio of 20% or below.

""Mastercard recognizes that digital assets are revolutionizing the financial landscape,"" said Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s head of crypto and blockchain products and partnerships.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc on Wednesday forecast returning to profit in the current quarter, after posting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, on the back of a booming travel demand, sending its shares higher.
The company said robust consumer demand not only translated into a ""solid"" profit in March, but is also allowing it to offset soaring fuel costs with higher fares.
As a result, Delta said it expects to post a ""meaningful"" profit this year. In the quarter through June, it estimates to generate an adjusted operating margin in the range of 12% to 14% and ""strong"" free cash flow. Company revenue in the quarter is forecast to increase by about 14-18 points from a quarter ago.
""The demand environment that we have today is at a historic high,"" Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian told Reuters in an interview. ""The last five weeks have been the strongest period of bookings that Delta has ever seen in our history.""
After a speed bump caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, travel demand has roared back. U.S. passenger traffic has been averaging about 89% of the pre-pandemic levels since mid-February, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.
The Atlanta-based carrier said its domestic consumer revenues are above 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel has accelerated with the reopening of offices.
Delta's shares were up 4.6% at $40.39 in mid-day trade.
SOARING COSTS, HIGHER FARES
A run-up in fuel costs and rising wages, however, are also driving up industry's operating expenses. Jet fuel prices in North America have gone up by more than 30% in the past month, since Western countries slapped sanctions on Russian exports.
Delta's fuel bill in the March quarter was 33% higher than a quarter ago and is projected to increase by at least 15% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to end-June.
Fuel is the airline industry's second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. carriers do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. Instead, they typically look to offset fuel costs with higher fares.
Airline fares were up about 24% year-on-year in March, among the biggest contributors to a jump in U.S. consumer prices. Delta's average fares are up about 33% from a year ago, according to data from Cowen.
Some analysts are concerned that rising fares and higher inflation could dent travel spending. But Delta said higher fares have not impacted consumer demand, thus far. It expects the demand to stay strong even in the fall. 
""Right now, I'm optimistic that our consumers will be in a very good place to continue to travel,"" Bastian said.
Yet, the company is mindful of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and plans to be disciplined in ramping up capacity.

Its capacity in the June quarter is estimated to inch up to about 84% of the 2019 level. Bastian said the carrier is not expected to be at full capacity this year.
Adjusted loss for the first quarter came in at $1.23 per share, smaller than $1.27 per share estimated by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.

(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned of economic uncertainties arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation, after first-quarter profits at the largest U.S. bank slumped 42%. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) had reported record profit during the first quarter last year, benefiting from a dealmaking boom after the Federal Reserve pumped liquidity into capital markets to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This year, however, investment banking revenues declined as companies delayed takeovers and stock market listings amid a surge of volatility in equity markets. The bank also set aside $902 million to cover potential loan losses. 
JPMorgan is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy and its lackluster results set the tone for first-quarter earnings from Wall Street banks as the Fed looks to rein in inflation and the trading bonanza banks enjoyed during the pandemic tapers off.
""Inflation and Ukraine are powerful forces that threaten the economy,"" Dimon said on a call with media, underscoring a change in his bullish outlook for the U.S. economy. 
""The Fed needs to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible.""
Pressed on whether the U.S. could face a recession, Dimon said: ""I am not predicting a recession. Is it possible? Absolutely.""
JPMorgan shares were down 2.8% in afternoon trading. Other bank stocks also fell.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were both down 0.9%. 
JPMorgan's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to 11.9% from 13.1% in December. That could hamper its ability to buy back shares, analysts said.
The bank will buy back less stock this year than in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told analysts.
Questioned by analysts about the broader outlook for the current year, Dimon said there were ""storm clouds on the horizon,"" including the war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
""Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them,"" he said.
Dimon's tone on the economy was less optimistic than in the past and that weighed on the stock, said Christopher Marinac, research director at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""Jamie is one of those people who will tell you what you need to hear, not necessarily what you want to hear,"" he said. ""A lot of people want to hear that everything is fine and he's not telling you that.""
INCREASED VOLATILITY
Trading was better than anticipated, analysts said, but still down 3% on a record quarter last year. 
Dimon warned of increased volatility ahead, which bankers have said could be good for Wall Street trading desks.
""There is almost no chance you won’t have volatile markets, that can be good or bad. But I think people should be prepared for that,"" he said.
JPMorgan reported a 28% drop in investment banking revenue for the first quarter, dragging net revenue down 5% to $30.72 billion. The fall also reflected markdowns related to Russia-linked derivatives. 
Investment banking fees plunged 32% to $2.01 billion, driven by a 69% decline in equity underwriting fees. The number of deals where JPMorgan acted as a bookrunner declined 39% compared with last year.
UP AGAINST INFLATION
The big U.S. banks are reporting results at a time of surging inflation, which could lead the Fed to hike interest rates more aggressively this year.
While that can benefit big lenders by increasing what they earn from loans, rapid rate hikes could slow the economy and scupper a nascent recovery from the pandemic.
Net interest income from JPMorgan's core banking businesses, excluding the markets business, increased 9% from a year earlier. That figure is expected to be more than $53 billion for 2022, the bank said, roughly in line with its February guidance. 
JPMorgan reiterated its full-year expenses would increase nearly 10%.

Markets revenue came in stronger than had some had feared, falling 3% to $8.8 billion, with fixed income trading down only 1% compared to exceptionally strong levels last year.
Other large U.S. banks including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will report results on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An April 2023 jury trial has been scheduled in Dominion Voting Systems Inc's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit accusing Fox News of trying to boost its ratings by falsely claiming the voting machine company rigged the 2020 U.S. presidential election against former President Donald Trump.
In a short written order issued on Friday, Delaware state court judge Eric Davis said he was scheduling Denver-based Dominion's lawsuit for trial on April 17, 2023. Fox, part of Fox Corp, had asked Owens for a trial date in early 2024.
Davis set aside five weeks for the trial, which could be the first of several involving baseless claims made by a variety of news outlets and individuals about Dominion's technology. Dominion filed its lawsuit against Fox News in March 2021.
People associated with Trump's campaign, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, floated conspiracy theories that Dominion rigged vote totals in the weeks after the Nov. 3, 2020, election in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Trump.
Dominion has filed defamation lawsuits against several Trump allies, including Giuliani and Powell, as well as conservative television networks Newsmax and One America News. Another election technology firm at the center of conspiracy theories, Smartmatic, has filed similar lawsuits.
The defendants have said they were commenting on matters of public concern and their remarks are free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Davis in December ruled against a Fox News request that he dismiss Dominion's lawsuit. Owens wrote in his ruling that it was ""reasonably conceivable"" that Dominion has a viable defamation claim, and allowed the company to continue to seek documents and witness testimony from Fox.
Fox News representatives have called Dominion's lawsuit ""baseless"" and have said the network remains committed to defending itself.

""As we have maintained, FOX News, along with every single news organization across the country, vigorously covered the breaking news surrounding the unprecedented 2020 election, providing full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear-cut analysis,"" a Fox spokesperson said in December.
Fox News and Dominion representatives did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Tuesday.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Benetton family and investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are talking to banks to put the final touches to a bid for Italy's Atlantia, sources said on Wednesday, as the two get ready to launch one of this year's biggest takeover deals.
Benetton holding company Edizione, which already owns 33% of Atlantia, is expected later on Wednesday to give the green light to a deal which could value the roads and airports group at more than 48 billion euros ($51.90 billion) if 30 billion euros of net debt is included.
If successful, it would be the second-biggest global deal of 2022 so far, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
The move comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the enforced sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a deal aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
The takeover will mark a new phase for the infrastructure group after almost four years during which Atlantia's business was put at risk and its reputation wrecked following the death of 43 people in the bridge disaster.
Edizione last week said it was in talks with Blackstone regarding Atlantia after it rejected an approach by Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield to acquire Atlantia and hand its motorway concessions to Spain's Florentino Perez.
""The funds proposed the Benettons to completely exit the business and indicated their intention to break the group up,"" one source told Reuters, adding this sounded like a slap in the face for the family who had stood by their investment throughout the aftermath of the bridge crisis. 
The Benettons and Blackstone now aim to delist Atlantia to shield it from rival suitors who have partnered with Perez.
The Spanish business tycoon Perez controls construction company ACS which in turn runs Spanish road group Abertis with Atlantia.
Sources said Perez and the funds backing him were in a 'wait and see' mode after their offer was rebuffed by the Benettons, but had not pulled out of the race.
""We would see as unlikely a counter bid... given the low chances to be successful given Edizione's stake... and government intervention in the case of a foreign bid,"" Italian broker Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) said on Wednesday.
At 1330 GMT Atlantia shares were up 0.9% at 21.92 euros.

On Tuesday, one source told Reuters Edizione and Blackstone were considering an offer between 22 and 23 euros per share, a premium of around 30% over Atlantia's average stock price in the last six months.

TASS news agency had cited Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov as saying it was in talks with Mercedes-Benz to acquire the carmaker's stake in Kamaz.
""We cannot confirm the TASS report,"" a Mercedes-Benz spokesperson said. ""As far as we are aware there are no talks ongoing with Rostec,"" a  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck spokesperson added.
Rostec holds 49.9% of Kamaz shares, according to Kamaz's website. Mercedes-Benz, formerly Daimler AG (ETR:MBGn), holds 15%. The remaining 20.81% are held by Cyprus-registered company Avtoinvest.
Avtoinvest could not immediately be reached for comment.
Mercedes-Benz AG, which at the time was Daimler AG, took over a 15% stake in Kamaz from Daimler Truck in September 2021 with a view to returning it to Daimler Truck after the truckmaker was spun off from the carmaker in December last year.
After the spin-off, Daimler AG was renamed Mercedes-Benz AG.
However, approval was needed from Russian regulators, as well as Kamaz's other shareholders, before the share could be returned to Daimler Truck, its CEO Martin Daum said in late March.

A spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz said talks with Russian regulators had not been finalised.
Like many other companies, Daimler Truck froze its business in Russia in February following Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, suspending its joint venture with Kamaz, which produces trucks, buses and Mercedes-Benz passenger cars.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The activist investor that pushed to oust Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc's co-founder and leader in January is now criticizing its new chief executive officer, arguing he has not made enough changes and that the company should be sold now.
Blackwells Capital, which owns nearly 5% of the company, said Peloton has failed to deliver on promises to transform the business and that too many insiders, including co-founder John Foley, continue to control its moves.
Peloton, a market darling during the COVID-19 pandemic as people flocked to its bikes, treadmills and popular streamed workouts, hired former Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) executive Barry McCarthy as CEO in February to replace Foley who was named executive chairman.
In a presentation published on Wednesday, Blackwells said the new management team has failed to make ""meaningful changes"" and that shareholders have lost nearly $2 billion of value since McCarthy was hired.
Peloton's stock price, which had come under pressure as people returned to gyms as the pandemic eased, has fallen nearly 40% since McCarthy arrived. The company is now worth $7.8 billion, down from nearly $50 billion at its peak during the pandemic. The stock price climbed 5% to $24.91 after the presentation was published.
Peloton said it appreciates investors views and has ""acted, and will continue to act, in the best interest of all Peloton shareholders.”
Blackwells' founder, Jason Aintabi, said the $800 million expense reduction plan does not appear to go far enough and that there was room to ""further rationalize the business.""
Aintabi also criticized Foley's decision in February to sell roughly $50 million in Peloton stock to Michael Dell's MSD Partners at a 12% discount. The move exacerbates ""misalignment with other shareholders,"" the presentation said.

Aintabi again said Peloton should be sold. It could bring at least $75 a share in a sale and companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Netflix and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have complementary businesses that would mesh with Peloton, Aintabi said.
""For Peloton to garner a similar share price would likely take years through the acquisition of millions more subscribers,"" the presentation said.

European cloud companies have called on regulators to investigate the U.S. tech giant, arguing that Microsoft undermines competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market. The complaint was filed last year but only one of the three cloud providers who were on it was named, France’s OVH.
Microsoft customers have complained that they pay more to use its must-have programs like Windows and Office when they’re run through rival cloud-computing systems instead of Microsoft’s Azure, and the practice shows Microsoft is using its power in one market to undermine competitors in another, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
A spokesman for Aruba confirmed to Bloomberg that it’s part of OVH’s complaint. Danish Cloud Community, a group of cloud providers in Denmark, is also part of the complaint, according to a people familiar with the matter.  
Microsoft President Brad Smith pledged the company will talk with customers and rivals, saying in an interview “there definitely are some valid concerns” and “it’s very important for us to learn more and then make some changes.”
European cloud trade group CISPE said Smith’s remarks demonstrate the need for “urgent action, not only vague commitments to talk,” and called on European Union officials to hold the company to account. The group’s members include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., whose Amazon Web Services dominates the market for cloud computing, followed by Azure.
“Microsoft’s steady pattern of amendments to license terms has ratcheted up pressure on rival vendors and led to increasing costs for customers over several years,” a CISPE spokesman said in a statement. “We urge regulators to continue investigating forcefully.”
The bloc’s officials have been asking regional cloud companies about Microsoft’s practices, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.
A spokesman for Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the CISPE remarks. Danish Cloud Community declined to comment.

The stock climbed as high as $24.68 in New York following the release of a new presentation by Blackwells pushing for changes. Peloton had been down 34% this year through Tuesday’s close.
New CEO Barry McCarthy took the helm in February and has vowed to turn around the company, which had been thriving during pandemic lockdowns but is now struggling with slowing demand. But he has dismissed the idea of selling the business -- irking investors like Blackwells, which says that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and other could be bidders.
Peloton co-founder John Foley was removed from the CEO job in February’s shake-up, but he remains executive chairman and is part of a group that controls the company with super-voting stock. That limits the power of an investor like Blackwells to force Peloton’s hand.
“Peloton will continue to be poorly valued for as long as a close-knit group of insiders, who have proven themselves incapable of creating value, continue to wield voting power far in excess of their economic interest,” Blackwells Chief Investment Officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement. “No shareholder should want Mr. Foley to still sit atop the management pyramid or control the board through his super voting-stock. He lost his entitlement to both positions when he destroyed $40 billion of shareholder wealth in less than a year.”
McCarthy, a former finance executive at Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), has been working to boost Peloton’s revenue from services -- as opposed to hardware. This month the company slashed the price of a new strength-training device that just went on sale. It also is testing a program that lets customers buy its signature bikes through a subscription program.
But Spotify has lost an additional $2 billion in market value since the overhaul in February and it’s time for bigger changes, Blackwells said.
“Blackwells calls upon Mr. Foley to recognize his own limitations and the dampening effect his control has on public market investors by immediately eliminating the dual class structure,” Aintabi said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by former  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shareholders who claim they missed out on the recent run-up in its stock price because he waited too long to disclose a 9.2% stake in the social media company.
In a proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court, the shareholders said Musk, the chief executive of electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, made ""materially false and misleading statements and omissions"" by failing to reveal he had invested in Twitter by March 24 as required under federal law.
Twitter shares rose 27% on April 4, to $49.97 from $39.31, after Musk disclosed his stake, which investors viewed as a vote of confidence from the world's richest person in San Francisco-based Twitter.
Former shareholders led by Marc Rasella said the delayed disclosure let Musk buy more Twitter shares at lower prices, while defrauding them into selling at ""artificially deflated"" prices.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
A lawyer for Musk had no immediate comment. Tesla is not a defendant.
U.S. securities law requires investors to disclose within 10 days when they have acquired 5% of a company, which in Musk's case would have been March 24.
Twitter announced on April 5 that Musk would join its board of directors, but this week said he had decided not to.
By not joining the board, Musk, a prolific Twitter user, can keep buying shares without being bound by his agreement with the company to limit his stake to 14.9%.
Some analysts have suggested Musk could push Twitter to make changes, or even pursue an unsolicited bid for the company.

Rasella said he sold 35 Twitter shares for $1,373, or an average price of $39.23, between March 25 and 29. Musk is worth $265.1 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

We remain above consensus on FCF, as we see continued optimization of content spending driving top-line growth, while the total rate of spending eases. We are below sell-side consensus on paid net member additions near-term, but we think buy-side expectations are more muted, and that APAC could surprise owing to the mobile-first gaming strategy in this mobile-first viewing region.”
Barclays’ Kannan Venkateshwar (Equal Weight, $380 from $425): “Based on the average predicted value across various short and long term models, Netflix appears to be on a path to ~4mm subs, better than company guidance, but still weak in the absolute for a Q1.”
Monness, Crespi, Hardt’s Brian White (Neutral, N/A): “Although the content on Netflix has been exceptional over the past couple of years, nefarious forces appear to be lurking beneath the surface of Netflix’s post-lockdown recovery, either in the form of a slower-than-expected healing process after the pandemic-driven pull forward, a weaker-than-expected global economy, or a platform that has simply hit a near term, growth wall.”

The company reported a first-quarter adjusted loss per share of $1.23, compared to the expected loss per share of $1.26. Adjusted revenue came in at $8.16 billion in the period, beating the analyst expectations of $8.12 billion.
Passenger revenue totaled $6.91 billion, below the estimated $7.07 billion. The passenger load factor stood at 75%, compared to the analyst consensus of 79%.

210,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 10:55AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble stabilised near 80 to the dollar on Wednesday and stock indexes pared earlier gains and inched lower, losing momentum after weeks of jittery trade.
Russian actions in Ukraine, which Moscow calls ""a special military operation"", remained in focus, along with a risk of new Western sanctions and expectations that the economy is heading for its sharpest contraction since 1994.
At 1438 GMT, the rouble eased 0.3% to 79.91 against the dollar, after rallying to 71 last week, which was its strongest since Nov. 11.
Against the euro, the rouble was little changed on the day at 86.29.
""There will be several periods of strong turbulence on the market by the year end,"" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank, adding that even though the rouble may firm in the coming month, there is substantial room for its weakening in the longer run.
The rouble eased this week after the central bank scrapped a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages and promised to lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18.
But the rouble retains support from export-focused companies that are obliged to convert 80% of their forex revenues on the domestic market.
On the bond market, yields on 10-year OFZ treasury bonds declined to 10.57% from a record high of 19.74% seen on March 21 after a nearly month-long trading hiatus.
The finance ministry, which has suspended borrowing on domestic and external markets this year, is due to pay coupons on three OFZ series on Wednesday.
Stock market indexes gave up earlier gains, with the rouble-based MOEX Russian index sliding 0.7% to 2,523.1 points. The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 0.8% to 996.3 points.
Shares in Rosbank, a Russian subsidiary of French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), have again outperformed the market, adding 10% after rising by around 40% a day on Monday and Tuesday.

Rosbank shares rallied after Societe General said it would quit Russia and take a 3 billion euro ($3.25 billion) income hit from selling Rosbank to Interros Capital, a firm linked to Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.

SANTA LUCIA, Mexico (Reuters) - After a grandiose inauguration ceremony of Mexico City's newest airport last month, not a single suitcase was in sight there on a recent Friday afternoon, with just one flight flashing across the display board: Aeromexico, arriving from the Mexican city of Merida, delayed. 
Three weeks after the opening, Felipe Angeles International Airport (AIFA), 28 miles (45 km) north of the current Mexico City hub, was still under construction.
The teething problems risk embarrassing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who made the airport a key project of his presidency, and giving ammunition to the opposition that have long criticized the new airport as a vanity project.
Chain-link fences covered with green tarps lined the entrance to the airport, and dust painted the sky a reddish hue as construction crews continued excavation.
The reality contrasts starkly with the pitch sold by Lopez Obrador, who called it ""one of the best airports in the world"" ahead of the inauguration.
The leftist rattled investors when he canceled his predecessor's $13 billion partially built airport before even taking office just over three years ago, arguing that the project was riddled with graft, too costly and poorly located.
Instead, he ordered the Army to build a commercial airport on the grounds of the Santa Lucia military air base.
Lopez Obrador inaugurated the airport on March 21, the birthday of 19th century Mexican hero Benito Juarez and ahead of a recall vote on the president's rule, which he handily won despite low voter turnout.
""I think the airport is 100%. It's completely finished,"" Lopez Obrador said at the grand opening. 
As well as the uncompleted construction work, the airport also suffers from congested roadways linking it to the city and will not have a train connection until next year. For the moment, the airport does not allow pick-ups through ride-hailing services.
A new highway connection to the airport is still under construction, though one employee said what had been built cut her commute time in half.
TOURISTS ARRIVE, BUT NOT TO TRAVEL
Of the 14 arrivals and departures confirmed at AIFA that day, compared to the close to 900 daily flights at the main Mexico City International Airport, a handful were military flights, according to flight records.
Since its opening, the AIFA has averaged around a dozen flights a day, flight records show. Around 2,000 passengers use the airport a day, presidential spokesman Jesus Ramirez told Reuters. The AIFA estimates that it will serve 2.4 million passengers this year and double that in 2023, he said.
The AIFA has yet to appoint a spokesperson, officials told Reuters, and the Army and Mexico's Transportation Ministry had no immediate comment for this story. 
Inside the new airport, check-in booths stood empty, even as Mexican carriers Volaris, Aeromexico and VivaAerobus as well as Venezuela's Conviasa have announced routes to and from here. 
An airport employee who works with the airlines said flights using AIFA were estimated to cost about half of those to and from the original Mexico City airport due to a lower airport usage tariff and government incentives. 
Volaris told Reuters that flight costs would be lower, though it said it was not receiving subsidies. The other airlines did not comment. 
The airport should at some point have two commercial runways, public construction plans show, though only one is currently in operation.
""Being able to land two planes at once or have two take off at the same time ... not even the Mexico City International Airport has that,"" said Victor Manuel Pena Chavez, an aeronautical engineering professor at the National Polytechnical Institute.
Past security, staff worked at a Krispy Kreme stall and a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), while a smattering of storefronts - such as a Mexican-themed gift store and a pastry shop - had already opened. Most spots remained shuttered, plastered with ""coming soon"" signs.
By late afternoon, plenty of people were milling about the 3,800-acre grounds, though not to travel.
They were curious neighbors or employees on their day off, families that stuck around as the sun went down, hoping to see the delayed Aeromexico flight land. 

In the almost four hours that a Reuters journalist spent at the airport, the plane was the only one seen occupying the runway, which flight records confirmed.
""Once we get to mid-year, I really hope there'll be more flights,"" one of the employees said.

The appointment of Esper, who was fired as defense secretary over a range of differences on policy issues, comes a month after U.S. President Joe Biden sought a record peacetime national defense budget of $813 billion, including the largest research and development budget in history.
The fiscal budget has earmarked $130 billion to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.
""I believe the key to accelerating and expanding the U.S. military's overmatch in the years ahead is through the rapid, sustained, and aggressive modernization of the joint force,"" Esper said in the statement.

Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden commented:
“We estimate that the core ROTCE came in at 18.5% for the quarter versus our expectations of 16.2%. All in, we believe that the market will see these results as broadly in-line, with stronger trading results, NII and the margin, but significantly more pressure on capital ratios, which should weigh on capital return,” Ramsden wrote in a memo.

The brand new Lucid Air Grand Touring Performance will be priced at $179,000 and will hit the markets in June. Lucid’s previous Air sedan has impressed drivers and critics around the world, partly thanks to the remarkable performance of the 1,111 horsepower Dream Edition.
However, Lucid capped production of that model to just 520 vehicles, while the new Grand Air Touring Performance, even though will cost $10,000 more than the Dream Edition, will not be as limited in production.
The new Air sedan is still in the early phases of production, said Lucid. The electric vehicle (EV) maker produced roughly 400 vehicles since its production began in September, adding it had around 25,000 reservations for the Air.
The carmaker expects to ship between 12,000 and 14,000 cars in 2022, down from its original outlook of 20,000 as global supply chain challenges have weighed on the Air production.
The company decided to build the new version of Air after seeing increasing demand for the powerful luxury sedan, said Lucid’s CEO Peter Rawlinson. The carmaker was able to develop the new, even faster model; thanks to its “vertical integration,” Rawlinson added.
Following the announcement, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli commented:
“The introduction of new trims is fairly common and so we don’t view this as major news. However, if Lucid does see healthy demand for this new Performance trim, it could benefit ASPs/mix later this year,” the analyst said in a client note.

The overall charge comprises of 30% hardware platform fee for sales made through Meta Quest Store, where it sells apps and games meant for its virtual reality headsets, and a further 17.5% cut as its Horizon platform fees, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.
On Monday, the tech giant said it would start testing tools for creators to sell digital assets and in turn make money on Horizon Worlds, a key part of its plan for creating a metaverse.
Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has been a critic of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s app store fees of 30%, but Meta's latest move to charge creators nearly half their sales on its own platform has angered many of them.

The Facebook parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.

RBC analyst Brad Erickson lowered the price target to $240.00 per share from $245.00 to reflect lower estimates.
“Another round of SMB ad agency channel checks raises our conviction that FB is likely to see another rocky quarter upcoming prompting lower estimates and PT to $240. Digital ad spend decisions remain in flux with many SMBs considering new channels away from FB for the first time and we detected no perceived improvement to FB's targeting algo or performance. We'd expect some reversion at some point given FB's audience size and relative scaled conversion advantage (which keeps us at Outperform), but we see that narrative as unlikely to materialize near-term,” the analyst said in a client note.
Similarly, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein also cut the price target to $305.00 per share from $375.00 to reflect lower estimates, which mirror impacts from Russia, a weaker European economy, and continued headwinds to performance ad-targeting on FB/IG from IDFA impacts.
“Based on FB's CFO comments at the most recent industry conference, 1Q guidance was largely driven by softening e-commerce demand, since exacerbated in Europe, as Russia/Ukraine further affects consumer spending. Lowering 1Q22E revenue 4% and core EBITDA 6%. Lowering '22E/'23E revenue 9% each and core EBITDA 13%/10%, respectively. While shares may trade lower on earnings, we see short-term headwinds priced in at current levels, at 22x/14x '22E GAAP EPS/core EPS (ex.

As a result, NIO stock price tumbled on fears that the halt will push the company to miss production and delivery targets.
However, Nomura analyst Martin Heung argues that the overall situation is not as bad as initially feared.
“The market has widely believed that NIO is undertaking a complete production halt. However, according to NIO management, the halt is limited to weekends only, and production lines will still be running on weekdays, albeit on a limited scale. According to management, the affected suppliers are responsible for exterior body parts of vehicles (from Jilin) and engineering components (from Shanghai) that are essential for automotive electrification,” Heung said in a client note.
The analyst added that Nio’s management is hopeful of restarting EV production in the coming days with the normal level of functionality expected to be achieved in 2-3 weeks.

Rainey serves as PayPal’s head of finances and is expected to take on his role at Walmart on June 6, succeeding Bret Biggs, who announced his decision to step down in November.
Biggs will step down from his duty in June, though he will remain the company’s advisor through January 31.
Rainey “has a proven track record of leading change at scale in customer service organizations innovating in their fields,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.
Before joining PayPal, Rainey served as the CFO of United Airlines.
“I’m confident that John’s mix of financial and digital acumen, coupled with his experience leading finance in complex, highly competitive industries, will help us deliver for our customers and shareholders as we continue to transform our company,” McMillon said.
The appointment comes as Walmart continues to identify and unlock new revenue-driving opportunities, such as its plan to expand its third-party marketplace and upgrade its advertising business.
The retail giant has also recently created and backed a financial technology startup spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs bankers.
Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman commented that Rainey is a “high quality hire.”
“Positives: strong reputation, fintech/tech background, established CFO track record at two large public companies. Negatives: lack of direct Retail experience and omni-channel/store operational expertise,” Gutman said in a client note.
On the other hand, Gutman’s colleague and PYPL analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), James Faucette, says that Rainey’s exit is a “mixed update.”
“John Rainey's departure may be perceived as negative signaling, and could potentially refresh fears around the company's ability to sustain above market growth and reach financial targets, which include rapidly accelerating revenue growth throughout 2022 and a medium-term outlook for ~20% revenue growth and ~22% EPS growth. At the same time, there may be some relief among investors as there had been speculation around a change in senior leadership given recent earnings misses and related selloffs of PayPal's stock,” Faucette wrote in a memo.
Bank of America) analyst Jason Kupferberg is more negative on PYPL than Faucette.
“Notably, PYPL did not reiterate guidance in today's announcement, which adds uncertainty heading into earnings on 4/27. Though valuation remains near all-time lows, we see limited visibility on PYPL's 2H ramp & normalized earnings power,” Kupferberg wrote in a memo.
The analyst reiterated a Neutral rating as he believes PYPL shares will continue to trade in a range-bound mode until investors can better understand the company’s new strategy.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Former Raiffeisen Switzerland Chief Executive Pierin Vincenz was jailed for nearly four years on Wednesday at the end of a fraud trial which exposed his huge strip club bills and misuse of company expenses.
After one of Switzerland's highest-profile corporate crime trials in decades, Zurich's district court convicted Vincenz, a former Swiss 'banker of the year' who was charged with making millions through illicit deals while he was CEO of the bank.
Vincenz, who was acquitted on several counts, was fined 840,000 Swiss francs ($900,600) and ordered to pay nearly 1.6 million francs in damages to compensate firms in which he was involved, as the court also found the 65-year-old guilty of using business expenses for private purposes.
His lawyer told Reuters that Vincenz, who denies any wrongdoing, would appeal the verdict after he was sentenced to 3-3/4 years in prison.
Vincenz had told the court that a near 200,000 Swiss franc expenses bill for strip club visits was largely business-related, while a 700 franc dinner with a woman he met on dating app Tinder was justified because he was considering her for a real estate job.
But Judge Sebastian Aeppli told the court that the expense claims went too far and were not in his employer's interests.
""(His) understanding, whereby practically all expenditures of a business person fall under disposable company expenses so long as any remote connection to the business activity exists, clearly went too far,"" Aeppli said.
""The relationship maintenance he carried out in cabarets, strip clubs and contact bars was no longer in the primary interest of Raiffeisen,"" the judge said, adding prudent handling of Raiffeisen's money would have meant limiting tabs to 1,000 Swiss francs or less per occasion.
The trial, which was moved from a courthouse to Zurich's Volkshaus theatre due to the intense public interest, centred around conflicts of interest on deals between a number of firms in which Vincenz and another defendant were involved. 
All seven defendants in the trial, which began in January, had denied the allegations against them.
Vincenz was ordered to pay Raiffeisen more than 260,000 Swiss francs over expenses he charged to the bank, while he was ordered to pay a further 1.3 million francs to compensate damages incurred by another firm over a corporate transaction.
Prosecutors had sought nearly 70 million Swiss francs in total in assets from the defendants, as well as pursuing financial penalties and prison sentences ranging from two to six years for all but one of them.

Prosecutor Marc Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel told reporters that his office would await the written verdict as well as other parties' next moves before deciding on any possible appeal, but noted the court had largely supported the prosecutors' charges.

236,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>",,,"KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told clients today that demand for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone lineup remains resilient with an expectation of iPhone SE.
KeyBanc’s checks showed that the customer demand for iPhone 13 remained “healthy” in March and “largely in line with store expectations.” The domestic iPhone sales likely soared 12% in March on a MoM basis, but still flat y/y.
According to Vinh, the strong demand has been fueled by: 1) better supply; 2) tax refunds; and 3) the release of the green iPhone, which is tracking slightly above store expectations.
“Store inventory levels for Pro/Pro Max increased further, and all the stores we surveyed have either Pro or Pro Max inventory vs. ~70% in February. In aggregate, Days of inventory (DOI) increased m/m to just over two days but remain lean and well below targeted levels,” Vinh said in a client note.
On a more negative note, Apple is experiencing another disappointing campaign, this time for the iPhone SE model.
KeyBanc’s data shows “disappointing” SE3 sell-through, or below store expectations. Lower-than-expected sales have resulted in high inventory for this model, which is available for walk-in customers.
The analyst explains why this may be the case.
“Promotions on other models overshadow the price advantage of the new SE3, such as AT&T offering iPhone 12 discounted at $365 amortized over 36 months vs. $430 for the SE3, both of which are 5G capable and without trade-in. Customers’ awareness for the release is relatively low and consumers’ preference for larger form factor continues to grow, despite SE3 retaining the Home button,” Vinh added.
Overall, Vinh adjusted estimates to reflect key findings from this report. The Q2 iPhone unit sales estimates remain at 58.3 million, above 57.7 million but iPhone revenues are boosted by 1.1% to $49 billion.
“Our Key First Look Data suggests AAPL is tracking somewhat in line with consensus. Historically, C1Q (Apple's F2Q) Apple Hardware is -35% q/q over the last three years, which compares to the current C1Q22 q/q consensus estimate of -29% and our estimate of -30% q/q. Our data is not currently pointing to material upside, where the main weakness we expect is around more discretionary purchases in the wearables and accessories segments. With the iPhone SE3 initially disappointing and AAPL build forecast being lowered and being replaced with iPhone 13, we slightly revise our iPhone mix assumptions,” Vinh concluded.

(Reuters) - Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) sought to bolster its cancer business on Wednesday by agreeing a $1.9 billion deal to buy U.S. drug developer Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA), the latest move to fend off pressure from activist shareholder Elliott.
GSK has been facing mounting calls to shore up its drug pipeline since Elliott built up a significant stake in the company last year.
The company is also pressing ahead with plans to spin off its large consumer healthcare business, which includes brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, in July.
Shareholders in Sierra, a cancer drug developer, will receive $55 per share of common stock in cash, which is a 39% premium to the company's closing price on Tuesday. 
GSK's shares were up 0.9% at 1043 GMT, while Sierra’s shares jumped 37% in U.S. premarket trading. 
The deal’s price tag doesn't look unreasonable given it is roughly three times consensus peak sales expectations of $630 million for Sierra’s lead experimental drug, momelotinib, J.P.Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
Momelotinib, which Sierra acquired from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) in 2018, is designed to treat anaemic patients with a type of bone marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. It is expected to be submitted for U.S. marketing approval this quarter. 
Results from a late-stage trial in January showed the drug was successful in reducing disease symptoms and cut patients' dependence on blood transfusions.
“We see the key risk around the acquisition as being commercial execution on the launch, given the number of competitors targeting the myelofibrosis space, and momelotinib’s mixed historical data, prior to the recent positive .... study results,” the analysts added. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter and will complement Blenrep, GSK’s treatment for another form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma. 
There's about a 70% overlap in customer base between momelotinib, Blenrep and other haematology products, said Luke Miels, chief commercial officer at GSK.
GSK, whose oncology business last year accounted for about 2.8% of total pharmaceutical sales, recently suffered trial setbacks on two cancer compounds that were once touted as potential blockbusters.
Patent exclusivity on its HIV drug dolutegravir is also due to expire at the end of 2027, worth about 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in annual sales.

Miels signalled GSK continues to have an appetite for deals like Sierra. “They could be anywhere ranging from cancer, anti-infectives, vaccines, renal, autoimmune,” he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut will keep operating in Russia to help customers and employees there, even though images from the war in Ukraine create ""enormous pressure,"" it said on Wednesday.
Shares in the Zurich based-group fell more than 5% as some analysts worried about its - albeit small - exposure to the turbulent Russian market, as well as flattish first-half earnings per tonne of chocolate sold. 
The company reported higher first-half profits and sales volumes overall, helped by a recovery in the global chocolate market. But Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has forced all consumer goods companies with a presence in Russia to rethink strategies.
While customer Nestle has stopped selling most foods, including KitKat chocolate bars, in Russia, Barry Callebaut's three Russian factories and 500 staff are still working.
""We are under enormous pressure just watching the images we get from the war and we cannot not look into the boardroom of other companies,"" Chief Executive Peter Boone told reporters.
He said the question of whether to stay in Russia was raised ""internally and externally"" and even by his children, but it was important to protect the jobs of staff in Russia. 
""It feels right because we are in contact with our 500 colleagues in Russia, they clearly have not asked for this decision by the Russian government. For us, it feels like the right thing to do to stay close for our employees and our customers,"" he said, adding the company's chocolate and cocoa went into all kinds of products including drinks and breakfast cereals.
He said the business in Russia - the fourth-largest chocolate confectionery market, according to Euromonitor - represented less than 5% of group volumes and the company was taking a 5 million Swiss franc ($5.4 million) impairment to reflect the increased risk of customer default there. It has also stopped new capital investment in the country.
Shares in the group were down 5.7% at 1123 GMT, underperforming the European food sector index.
""The exposure to Russia with close to 5% of the group’s volume as well as the flattish EBIT per tonne despite strong volume growth could partly explain the share price drop,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said in an emailed comment. 
Boone said it was difficult to get raw materials to Russia, but still possible as food is not covered by Western sanctions. 
The company confirmed its goals for 5-7% sales volume growth and earnings before interest and tax above volume growth for the three years to August 2023. 

Strong chocolate sales and a recovery in its gourmet business with restaurants helped sales volumes rise 8.7% in the six months to the end of February. Net profit climbed 3.1%.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, with investors digesting the latest consumer inflation report as the quarterly earnings season starts in earnest.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 160 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 100 points, or 0.7%.
The major indices are down sharply this week, and year to date, on concerns that soaring inflation will cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy, potentially causing a slowdown in growth.
Data released on Tuesday showed the highest U.S. consumer inflation since late 1981, however, there was a small glimmer of hope that price pressures may have peaked, as core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, came in below expectations.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points when it next meets in May, while also starting to cut back its $9 trillion balance sheet. But the core data raised the possibility that the central bank might not need to be as aggressive in the second half of this year as originally expected.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at 2.756% Wednesday, falling back from the over-three-year peak of 2.836% seen before the inflation data.
The March producer price index is due at 8:30 AM ET, with analysts expecting the annual figure to climb 10.6%, growing 1.1% on the month.
Additionally, the companies of the S&P 500 are set to start reporting earnings, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) starting the ball rolling before the open Wednesday.
Banks are seen as beneficiaries of a rising rate environment, but market volatility could dampen capital markets and investment banking activity for the big Wall Street firms, while Delta forecasts a profit in the second quarter as surging volumes and prices more than made up for rising costs.
Oil prices traded higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s hefty gains amid concerns of Russian supply being further reduced, and helped by signs the lockdown of Shanghai and other regions of China may soon be at least partially lifted.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that peace talks had come to a dead end have raised fears that the European Union could embargo Russian crude to further punish Moscow.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 7.8 million barrels last week, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute released Tuesday, but gasoline inventories fell by 5 million barrels, an indication of strong U.S. fuel demand.
The official crude oil supply data from the EIA is due later in the day.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $101.89 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $106.11. Both benchmarks climbed more than 6% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,978.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.0826."

Earnings per share fell some 3% short of expectations at $2.63, while revenue was broadly in line with expectations at $30.72 billion, down 7% from a year earlier.
However, the bank softened any disappointment by approving a new buyback program of $30 billion.
""We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term – consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels – but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,"" chief executive and chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. That caution was reflected in $902 million of net new provisions against possible loan losses, ending a sequence of quarters that has been hallmarked by the release of previous provisions as the pandemic has receded.
The bank also notched a $524 million hit due to the revaluation of various positions as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through global commodity and debt markets.
Global dealmaking revenue fell 31% from a year ago, while global markets revenue was down 3%.
In addition to a slowdown in dealmaking and capital markets revenues, the bank's results also showed signs of strain from the rising interest rate environment and supply chain problems in key sectors of the economy.
Auto loans rose 3% on the year but the bank said the lack of vehicle supply continues to hurt its new loan business, which fell 25%. In Home Lending, originations of $25 billion were down 37%, primarily due to the rising rate environment, it added. That comes at a time when mortgage rates are at their highest since the end of 2018, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
JPMorgan stock is down 16% from the beginning of the year, still down 24% from its 52-week high of $172.96 set on October 25, 2021. It is underperforming the S&P 500, which is down 7.7% from the start of the year.

241,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- With shares skyrocketing since its trading debut, Airbnb Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABNB) initial public offering was well-timed. That rally shows little sign of abating.
It has soared 135% since it went public in December 2020. The timing was auspicious: Covid-19 vaccines were just arriving, sparking a revival in travel and also demand for lodging where travelers could isolate more easily than in a hotel. Employees also embraced a work-anywhere environment, encouraging the use of temporary homes. 
Airbnb’s climb to $103 billion in value has made it the world’s biggest online travel company, eclipsing Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc.,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc., and hotel operator Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc. 
“It is evolving, and becoming an interesting play with respect to work-from-home and long-term rental trends,” said Thomas George, a portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which owns the stock. “Those are additional levers it can unlock for growth.” 
Airbnb’s post-IPO performance has also given it the title of best performer of any listing to raise $1 billion or more since its debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This comes at a time where weak trading in recent IPOs have weighed on the pipeline for new listings.
Some caution is warranted. Its stock rally has surpassed its peers by a mile in the travel industry since it went public, which could mean its upside is minimal. Booking has climbed 3.5%, Marriott is 25% higher and Expedia is up 39% in that time period. 
And it isn’t cheap. Airbnb sells for about 12 times its estimated sales. That’s well above its peers with Booking sitting at 5.3, and both Expedia’s and TripAdvisor’s are below 3. 
But investors have more reasons to stay bullish. Airbnb’s stock is expected to climb by an average of 24% over the next 12 months with a majority of the 41 analysts covering the firm recommending investors hold on to their shares or buy more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Brokerages on average predict the company next month will report a 64% jump in first-quarter sales. Airbnb, which was profitable on a net-income basis the past two quarters, probably lost money again in the first three months of this year, analysts say. 
Airbnb’s revenue grew 78% to $1.53 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ projections as people spread out over thousands of towns and cities and stayed for weeks and months with workers no longer having to be in traditional offices five days a week. 
“The benefits seen over the past year or so are expected to continue, especially as traveling increases with the pandemic hopefully continuing to wane,” said Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge. 
Tech Chart of the Day
The cloud continues to darken around Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc. Its shares fell 1.1% on Tuesday, rounding out a sixth day of losses. Its losing streak, which has erased $55 billion in market value, is its longest since May 2019. All eyes will be on the company’s quarterly results slated for April 27, where investors will be looking for any guidance on future growth and its metaverse strategy.

244,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:35AM ET</span>","Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it moved 141 of its jet orders into accounting limbo because of geopolitical tensions and international sanctions due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The aircraft maker said it made changes to its order backlog in monthly orders and deliveries, which also showed that the company delivered 41 jets last month.
Data showed that Boeing delivered 34 737 MAX single-aisle aircraft, two 767 freighters for FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and one 777 freighter for China Airlines.
Boeing’s March deliveries almost double the 22 the company delivered in February and 29 in the year-ago period, suggesting a sharp recovery in travel and cargo demand. The aerospace company has delivered 95 jets since the start of 2022.
On the other hand, Boeing’s deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner model are still suspended as the company continues to examine and repair the twin-aisle jetliners that were grounded due to production issues.
The number of orders in the first three months surged to 167 from 114, said Boeing. Excluding deliveries that were canceled or swapped, the number of orders totaled 145, up from 107.
Excluding jets that were unlikely to be delivered, net orders for the quarter year to date totaled 76, down from 179. Ultimately, Boeing’s official order backlog stood at 4,231, down from 4,375 overall.
The adjustment also included 141 jets Boeing put in accounting limbo due to the invasion of Ukraine and the consequent global sanctions against Russia.
The company noted the majority of questionable orders included jets for Russian and Ukrainian airlines, most of which were 737 MAX models and some 777 and 787 widebody units.
In March, clients canceled orders for 15 Boeing aircraft, including a 737 MAX for Aviation Capital Group, 11 737 MAX units for an undisclosed buyer, as well as two 787-9 Dreamliner jets for Air China (OTC:AIRYY) and Avolon.
Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak has reflected positively on the report as he expects deliveries to accelerate over the coming months as air travel recovers.
“Boeing continues to deliver no 787 aircraft, reflecting the ongoing temporary halt following the FAA requesting more information about Boeing's proposed solution to the previous quality issues. The FAA is at various stages of the process on their end, in an ongoing dialogue with Boeing that may require some additional input from the company. However, Boeing has a recommended fix for every currently identified issue on the aircraft, and does not expect to find any new issues. We expect deliveries to resume in 2Q22,” Poponak said in a client note.
Wolfe Research analyst Mike Maugeri is more cautious than Poponak.
“We continue to see the fundamental demand backdrop for commercial OEM deliveries as favorable, particularly for narrowbody aircraft, but BA still has idiosyncratic issues to work through. BA seems to be the most polarizing name in our A&D coverage based on our conversations and the results of our quarterly survey of investors published this morning. BA was voted both top long/overweight and top short/underweight in our survey,” the analyst said in a client note.
Boeing stock price closed at $176.28 yesterday.

LONDON (Reuters) -Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, warned of a drop in profits this financial year as surging inflation piles pressure on the supermarket group and its customers alike.
Shares in the company, which has a more-than 27% share of Britain's grocery market, were down 5% at 0931 GMT, the biggest decline of a blue-chip stock in Europe.
That dragged down other grocery stocks, including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and Ocado (LON:OCDO), as well as retailers such as JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports.
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) reported retail adjusted operating profit of 2.65 billion pounds ($3.45 billion) for the year to Feb. 28, up 36% and in line with guidance. It sees profit of between 2.4 billion pounds and 2.6 billion pounds for 2022-23. 
""Given the significant uncertainties in the external environment, we believe it is appropriate to provide profit guidance in the form of a wider than usual range,"" Tesco said.
Britain's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 7% in March, even before April's sharp increase in utility bills. Surging prices are causing the biggest squeeze on household incomes since at least the 1950s.
Tesco said three factors would influence its performance - the return to more normal customer behaviour after the COVID-19 pandemic, its ability to offset higher costs with savings elsewhere in the business, and the investment required to keep prices competitive.
""Inflation is very real for everyone. It's household expenses going up and finances stretched. It has been many years since we last saw living costs rise at the rate they are today,"" CEO Ken Murphy told reporters.
COST OF LIVING CRISIS
A cost of living crisis and supply chain disruptions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are weighing on Britain's grocers.
Last week, No. 4 supermarket group Morrisons warned its annual profit could be hit by the conflict and rising inflation. No. 7 player, the Co-operative Group, pointed to ""stark"" economic headwinds.
The war in Ukraine has hurt supplies of sunflower oil, and has driven-up animal feed and wheat prices, which has had a knock-on effect on meat, dairy and bakery.
Soaring energy prices, as well as increased labour costs, have added to the cost of doing business.
Murphy said Tesco was ""laser focused"" on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check and noted cheaper, own-brand products would play an important role. He said Tesco was in ""great shape"" to deal with the crisis.
Market data suggests shoppers have started to shift their buying habits to save money, opting for more own-label foods.
Tesco's group sales rose 3.0% to 54.8 billion pounds in 2021-22, while UK like-for-like sales rose 0.4% as it gained market share. Industry data has shown Tesco consistently outperform its three biggest rivals - Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons.
Analysts say Tesco is benefiting from its strategy of matching prices at discounter Aldi on 650 key lines, the popularity of its 'Clubcard Prices' loyalty scheme and the unrivalled scale of its store network and online operation.
Tesco raised its full-year dividend 19.1% to 10.9 pence a share and committed to return a further 750 million pounds to shareholders by April 2023 through a share buyback programme.

""Tesco has proven its ability to adeptly navigate tricky periods and few would bet against it doing so again,"" said Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's accelerated timeline to fully embrace electric vehicles (EVs) presents a threat to some auto suppliers and auto mechanics, with the latter pinning hopes on a key legislation to adapt to the changing needs of the industry.
Last month, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government set out a mandatory target for all new light-duty cars and passenger trucks to be zero-emission by 2035, from an earlier goal of 2040. Recent investments by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in their Canadian units to primarily boost EVs give the parts industry some hope in the immediate future.
""Where there's risk is on the parts manufacturers that make parts for internal combustion components like engines and transmissions,"" said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufactures' Association. 
Volpe noted these parts will disappear in future years, and there are concerns the companies won't be capable of adapting, if they even remain the suppliers after new competition enters the market. 
Auto parts are Canada's fifth-biggest export industry, employing roughly 71,400 workers as of January, according to official data. Volpe is still confident many established parts makers will be preferred, given their track record.
Industry groups say the switch to EVs is a bigger threat to auto mechanics, who may struggle unless the 'right to repair' bill is passed in Canada. 
That bill was reintroduced in the Parliament in February, after it was killed in the House of Commons in August 2021 ahead of the federal election. The bill would force big automakers to share the parts, software and training used to repair products.
Failure to pass the bill could result in the closure of many mechanics down the line and substantial job losses in the sector, said Jean-Francois Champagne, president of the Automotive Industries Association of Canada, which represents automotive after-market supply and service chains.
Roughly 109,816 Canadians are employed in the automotive repair and maintenance industry, according to a 2022 report by Statistics Canada. A move to EVs that are loaded with technology that allows greater automation and over-the-air software updates could lead to the loss of as many as 53,707 jobs by 2051 in the worst case scenario, according to the Conference Board of Canada.
FIGHT FOR DATA
Currently, computers in EV makers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are connected in a 'closed ecosystem,' making them inaccessible to typical mechanics.
""If you have a Tesla today, pretty much Tesla will determine where you go to get your car serviced, they'll determine which parts you put on and how much you're going to pay,"" said Champagne.
Tesla did not offer an immediate comment. But in 2020, Tesla urged its Massachusetts customers to vote against the updated ‘right to repair’ legislation, arguing it would pose security concerns. Tesla already has an open-source philosophy for much of its patented intellectual property, it said. Yet, Massachusetts voters approved the ‘right to repair’ bill.
Jamie Keeler, owner and sole mechanic of Keeler Automotive in Ontario, said the Canadian legislation will ensure customers have the freedom to choose who repairs their car.
""If you're a licensed mechanic, you should be able to fix anything that’s on the road, and have access to the software to do it,"" said Keeler, who on average services 50-60 cars a week.
Keeler, who has been a licensed mechanic for three decades, said if a petition for 'right to repair' comes around, he will happily sign or vote for it.
The United States already passed a ‘right to repair’ policy in July of 2021, as part of sweeping executive order signed by President Biden. With the contents of Canada's bill already formed, and previous support established, its biggest hurdle will be automakers fighting to quash it in coming months.

Alliance for Automotive Innovation did not offer an immediate comment when asked about Canada’s ‘right to repair’ bill.
""Automakers want to control the data in the car, because that's what's going to get monetized down the road, the same as your cell phone did,"" said Champagne. ""So, it's a fight to control the data, and they've been very active in fighting those legislations everywhere they can.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Fiat parent Stellantis will sell its stake in an auto financing joint venture to its Chinese partner Dongfeng and set up its own financial services unit in China, the latest step to overhaul its business in the world's top car market.
The move comes after the world's fourth-largest carmaker expanded its credit business in the United States and launched a major reorganisation in Europe, as CEO Carlos Tavares aims to boost profitability and simplify the company's structure.
Stellantis, formed at the start of 2021 through the merger of France's PSA with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), has struggled to sell cars in China and has been looking to reshuffle its strategy in the country where it has joint ventures with Dongfeng and GAC.
""As we continue our push to drive profitable growth in China, we need to also reset our financial services offering in the country,"" said Tavares in a statement.
Under the deal, one of Stellantis' financing units and car maker DPCA - co-owned by Stellantis and Dongfeng - have entered into an equity transfer agreement with Dongfeng aimed at transferring the whole of their joint auto financing assets to the Chinese company. 
In return, Stellantis said it would create a new structure called Auto Finance Co (AFC).
JOINT VENTURES
Stellantis through its China-based joint ventures represents just 0.5% of the Chinese auto market. DPCA, the joint venture with Dongfeng, sold 100,567 vehicles in 2021, more than doubling annual sales. Its joint venture with GAC sold 20,123 units last year, a 50% decline.
The proposed transaction should be completed during the second half of 2022, pending regulatory approval, the car maker added.
In its business plan to 2030 outlined last month, Stellantis said it would adopt an ""asset-light"" model there - keeping only one fully-owned plant and opening up other manufacturing capacity to third parties to lower fixed costs.
It is aiming for Chinese revenue to reach 20 billion euros ($22 billion) by 2030. Revenue for ""China, India and Asia Pacific"" totalled 3.9 billion euros last year. 
In November, Stellantis bought First Investors Financial Services Group for around $285 million as it seeks to build a full-service captive finance arm in the United States, where owning 100% of such structures is a common feature.
The business offers U.S. customers, dealers and partners financing options, including retail loans, leases and floorplan financing.
It took a different approach in Europe. Late last year, the company agreed to set up financing and leasing joint ventures with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Santander (BME:SAN).

The aim was to cut the number of entities it inherited from PSA and FCA.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's top offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd. is preparing to exit its operations in Britain, Canada and the United States, because of concerns in Beijing the assets could become subject to Western sanctions, industry sources said.
Ties between China and the West have long been strained by trade and human rights issues and the tension has grown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which China has refused to condemn.
The United States said last week China could face consequences if it helped Russia to evade Western sanctions that have included financial measures that restrict Russia's access to foreign currency and make it complicated to process international payments. 
CNOOC did not immediately comment.
Companies periodically carry out reviews of their portfolios, but the exit being prepared would take place less than a decade after state-owned CNOOC entered the three countries via a $15 billion acquisition of Canada's Nexen, a deal that transformed the Chinese champion into a leading global producer. 
The assets, which include stakes in major fields in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and large Canadian oil sand projects, produce around 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), Reuters calculations found.
Last month, Reuters reported CNOOC had hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to prepare for the sale of its North Sea assets, which include a stake in one of the basin's largest fields.
CNOOC has launched a global portfolio review ahead of its planned public listing in the Shanghai stock exchange later this month that is aimed primarily at tapping alternative funding following the delisting of its U.S. shares last October, the sources said.
The delisting was part of a move by former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in 2020 that targeted several Chinese companies Washington said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military. China condemned the move.
CNOOC is also taking advantage of a rally in oil and gas prices, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, and hopes to attract buyers as Western countries seek to develop domestic production to substitute Russian energy.
As it seeks to leave the West, CNOOC is looking to acquire new assets in Latin America and Africa, and also wants to prioritise the development of large, new prospects in Brazil, Guyana and Uganda, the sources said.
'A PAIN'
CNOOC is seeking to sell ""marginal and hard to manage"" assets in Britain, Canada and the United States, a senior industry source told Reuters.
All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The industry source said last month that CNOOC's top management, including chairman Wang Dongjin, found managing the former Nexen assets was ""uncomfortable"" because of red tape and high operating costs compared with developing nations.
CNOOC has faced hurdles operating in the United States in particular, such as security clearances required by Washington for its Chinese executives to enter the country, the source added.  
""Assets like Gulf of Mexico deepwater are technologically challenging and CNOOC really needed to work with partners to learn, but company executives were not even allowed to visit the U.S. offices. It had been a pain all along these years and the Trump administration's blacklisting of CNOOC made it worse,"" said the source. 
In its prospectus ahead of the initial public offering, CNOOC said it could face additional sanctions.
""We cannot predict if the company or its affiliates and partners will be affected by U.S. sanctions in future, if policies change,"" CNOOC said.

In the United States, CNOOC owns assets in the onshore Eagle Ford and Rockies shale basins as well as stakes in two large offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Appomattox and Stampede.
Its main Canadian assets oil sands projects are Long Lake and Hangingstone in Alberta Province.

The company will open a new office in Atlanta this year, and expand its data center in Storey County, Nevada, it added. 
""It might seem counterintuitive to step up our investment in physical offices even as we embrace more flexibility in how we work. Yet we believe it's more important than ever to invest in our campuses…,"" Google said in a statement.

DUBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - It's been the subject of quiet speculation among diplomats and executives for years, but now global casino bosses are setting their sights on a once improbable prize: gambling in the United Arab Emirates
Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), one of the smaller and lesser-known of the seven emirates, said earlier this year that it planned to regulate gaming in some resorts. On the same day, Las Vegas casino giant Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) said it would build a resort licensed for gaming, or gambling, on a man-made island. 
The announcements could mark a watershed moment for the Gulf, a region that has traditionally imposed stricter Islamic rules than other parts of the Middle East, and one where gambling has long been off-limits. 
Currently, those seeking a flutter head to the likes of Lebanon's Casino du Liban or some upmarket Egyptian hotels.
Yet times may be changing. 
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that gambling in some form would be permitted in the UAE, but that it would be up to each emirate to decide whether and how to regulate it, similar to how Sharjah prohibits alcohol sales unlike other emirates. The sources said it would happen soon, without providing a specific timeframe.
Other global casino and hotel brands which have moved into the UAE could benefit should RAK pave the way for other emirates to follow – with many eyes on the bigger and glitzier jackpot of Dubai, a global tourist magnet, where gaming is currently banned.
Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Palace, which opened in Dubai in 2018 and is the only one of U.S. giant Caesars Entertainment' resorts globally without a casino - told Reuters that it would examine any possibility of offering gambling in Dubai.
""That acceptance now that there is going to be the potential of gaming in the UAE, in whatever form it's going to be, allows people like Caesar's and MGM as well to look at that closely,"" said Anthony Costa, regional president at Caesars Palace. ""I think it's wonderful."" 
""Like anybody, if a license is able to be bid for, any global gaming company is going to want to be actively involved in the conversation,"" he added.
About 10 km along Dubai's coast from the Caesars resort, digging has begun on another artificial outcrop to support a luxury resort by Las Vegas gambling stalwart MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International. 
When asked whether it would consider introducing gaming at the resort, MGM said ""gaming has not been part of the planning and there are no updates to our plans"".
A year ago Dubai, traditionally the most liberal emirate, denied rumours circulating on social media and among the business community that several hospitality venues had been granted gambling licences. 
The UAE government media office, as well as the media offices of the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, did not respond to requests for comment on RAK's plan to regulate gambling and whether they planned to make similar shifts. 
EMIRATES VS SAUDI
The prospect of casinos plays out against the backdrop of intense competition in the Gulf, with business and tourism hub UAE vying with rapidly-opening Saudi Arabia to become the go-to destination in a region pivoting away from oil. 
The UAE, where foreigners make up 90% of the population, has already moved in other areas to keep first mover advantage over Saudi Arabia, the largest and most conservative Gulf state.
The Emirates switched to a Saturday-Sunday weekend this year to move closer to global markets, from the Friday-Saturday break common in many Muslim nations. In the past 18 months, the UAE has overhauled laws and regulations, including decriminalising alcohol consumption and pre-marital cohabitation. 
The country has also found ways to offer some potentially lucrative games of chance.
In 2020 a national ""Loto"" was launched, for example. Players purchased a ""collectable"" picture of an iconic UAE scene, such as the Burj al Arab hotel, for 35 dirhams ($9.50) and were entered into a draw. Now players seeking to enter the draw purchase a bottle of water to be donated to charity to win a top prize of 10 million dirhams.
The game was deemed Sharia compliant by virtue of there being an ""exchange of value"" in the purchase of the collectable or bottle.
Horse racing fans at some UAE racecourses can also enter for free a 'pick six' competition across a number of races for the chance to win 40,000 dirhams. 
Yet, while RAK's intentions are clear, big question marks remain over how it or other emirates would actually license gaming, until a prohibition is removed from the federal penal code, which was overhauled as recently as January.
RAK stressed that its regulations, being developed by the recently created Department of Entertainment and Gaming Regulation, would push for responsible gaming.
""Gaming is a responsible form of entertainment and leisure tourism that takes into consideration community, cultural and social norms,"" the Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority told Reuters. 
It did not answer questions about how its plans would work alongside the federal prohibition. 
Wynn told Reuters that the definition of gaming and types of games permitted would be determined by the regulator. 
FOREIGNERS ONLY?
RAK's gaming regulations are being shaped by those of Singapore and the United States, according to Wynn Resorts and Vitaly Umansky, a gambling industry analyst at the Sanford C Bernstein investment company in Hong Kong who is familiar with the Wynn project.
""Like Singapore, the country is looking to gaming to help drive tourism and has allowed gaming to occur in an integrated resort format for just such purpose,"" Umansky said.
He added that gaming in RAK would likely be limited to foreigners. 
The UAE also appears unlikely to develop resorts that rely primarily on gaming revenues, or foreground gaming, with slots and tables forming part of a wide entertainment offering. 

""The regulatory environment would be the kind that hides the casino, kind of like Singapore but even more so. It won't be like Vegas where the casino is out there,"" Umansky said of Wynn's proposals, which are currently in the design phase.
Caesar's Costa said big resort brands did not necessarily need to operate their gaming side: ""They are great hotels in themselves.""

253,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 04:58AM ET</span>","TOKYO (Reuters) - Uniqlo operator Fast Retailing Co's earnings on Thursday may give an indication of how major global retailers are weathering COVID-related shutdowns in China, one of the biggest growth markets for many Western brands.
China is Fast Retailing's biggest overseas market, with 863 stores on the mainland, almost 90 outlets in Shanghai, where stringent lockdown measures, introduced in late March, remain in place to contain the country's worst outbreak of the pandemic.
Fast Retailing is due to report six-month results through end-February, and COVID conditions in China have only worsened since the first quarter, when the company said profits from China slid dramatically.
The restrictions impact global brands like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which each have dozens of outlets in Shanghai, but also disrupt the production hubs of major clothing retailers including Fast Retailing, H&M, and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Retailers have tried to speed up transportation of their goods out of Asian production hubs following log jams at ports in the United States last year. 
But now the same thing is happening in Asia, with container ships lined up outside ports waiting to get in, said Keith Jelinek, managing director of performance improvement for the Berkeley Research Group. 
""These lockdowns in China have shut down a lot of production for manufacturing, so there's going to be this long timeframe to build all that back up, and that's a concern,"" he said. 
Fast Retailing has more Uniqlo stores in China than in its home market of Japan. The fast fashion retailer opened a flagship store in Beijing in November, its third megastore in mainland China, and plans to open 100 locations in the country each year going forward.
China makes up about 60% of Fast Retailing's overseas revenue. The company decided to close about 50 stores in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

""The Shanghai lockdowns will impact current quarter more than last quarter,"" said Mark Chadwick, a Japanese equity analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.
""I wonder to what extent (Fast Retailing) saw these lockdowns coming and were able to adjust production. If not, expect to see markdowns and lower gross margins going forward,"" he added.

Investing.com -- Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) shares plunged to their lowest in six months on Wednesday after the U.K. grocery giant said operating profit will fall in the next 12 months as it battles to contain the effects of runaway inflation. 
By 4:54 AM ET (0854 GMT), Tesco stock in London was down 5.6%, the second-worst performer in the benchmark FTSE 100 index, as the market fretted about its ability to offset higher input costs. 
The company said it expects adjusted operating earnings, its preferred metric of profitability, to fall to as little as 2.4 billion pounds ($3.12 billion) over the 12 months through next March, due to an acceleration of investments to cut operating costs. Tesco's ability to raise prices is constrained by intense competition, notably from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, and the company has stuck by its commitment to match Aldi's prices on a list of 650 items. 
""Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months,"" Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy said in a statement. ""Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check – working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs.”
Adjusted operating profit for the year ended in March rose 58% to 2.83 billion pounds, supported by a strong economic rebound as the pandemic receded. That enabled Tesco to raise its full-year dividend by 19% to 10.9 pence. The supermarket chain now faces headwinds from the normalization of consumer spending in the coming year, as a population no longer locked down diverts more of its spending back to services.
Tesco's results come on the same day that consumer inflation in the U.K. surged to a 30-year high of 7%, with prices rising 1.1% on the month alone, well ahead of expectations.
""Tesco has already pledged to increase staff wages in its efforts to retain service levels, raising salaries by 6%, while rising fuel prices are likely to increase the costs of maintaining its delivery and logistics operations,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said in a flash note.",,,,,

The purchase of the 21.2 million shares via a call option raises Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s stake in T-Mobile US to 48.4%, within touching distance of a majority stake, from below 47%, the German company said on Wednesday.
As part of a deal agreed with Softbank in 2020, Deutsche Telekom paid a fixed price of $101.46 per T-Mobile US share for 11.8 million of the shares, and $128.68 per share for the rest, based on the stock's weighted average price.

That means the average price for the deal was $113 per T-Mobile US share, compared with Tuesday's closing price of $131.44.
Deutsche Telekom used part of the roughly 4 billion euros it received from the sale of its T-Mobile Netherlands business to pay for the shares.

Europe's third-largest insurer is at the centre of a shareholder battle over the board and the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet. Shareholder Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali, has put up his own candidates for the top jobs.
""We are talking about a (debt) leverage to use only in the case of an operation that would truly create value. At the moment (Generali's) leverage is 20%, Allianz (DE:ALVG)'s at 25% .... We propose to bridge a part of the gap with Allianz,"" Luciano Cirina told daily La Stampa in an interview.
He added that any decision would ""not put at risk the rating of the company"" and that a capital increase ""was not on the table"". 
""The true key to an acquisition is to integrate. And it's not easy. For this reason at the moment it's impossible to talk about possible targets,"" Cirina said. 
The challengers to Generali's current management pledged to increase earnings by a double-digit percentage and free more cash for takeovers.
In their plan - dubbed ""Awakening the lion"" - they aim to boost average annual growth in earnings per share, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8%. They also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Cirina, a veteran executive of the insurer who was fired at the end of March after he sided with Caltagirone, added that his lawyers were analysing how to contest Generali's decision to terminate his contract.

""I have also given them a mandate to pursue a legal action for the not indifferent reputational damage. It certainly was not elegant to use my sacking to get ahead in this race,"" the former head of Austria and the CEE countries at the insurer said.
Investor advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders at Generali back the proposal by the Italian insurer's outgoing board to hand Donnet another term at the helm, documents showed.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Wednesday, with investors weighing the risks associated with soaring inflation, central bank policies, and the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
By 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%.
Hopes for a prompt end to the war in Ukraine received a blow late Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue the invasion, stating that peace talks with Ukraine were “at a dead end,” while suggesting the seven-week offensive is going to plan.
U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, and the United States is reportedly set to announce an additional $750 million in military assistance, in a sign the war is expected to drag on.
The conflict and the associated sanctions levied on Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, have roiled commodity markets, adding to inflationary pressures and prompted central banks to consider tightening monetary policies.  
The highly anticipated U.S. consumer price index rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981, virtually cementing a 50 basis point hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in May.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) plans to launch its first product in China's $220 billion onshore exchange-traded fund (ETF) market later this year and has started hiring staff accordingly, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The world's largest money manager, which thrives on the rise of passive investing with 70% of its $10 trillion global portfolio in ETFs and index funds, will be the first wholly owned foreign fund manager to tap the onshore Chinese ETF market.
Currently, the U.S. firm manages overseas assets of a handful of China's large state-backed investors such as the country's sovereign wealth fund and national pension fund via offshore units, as all products sold are foreign-domiciled. 
The first BlackRock ETF product launch is scheduled for the fourth quarter, said the people, which will add to 6.8 billion yuan ($1.07 billion) worth of assets BlackRock manages through two mutual funds with investments in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks.
Several index providers have started talks with BlackRock but the fund manager is yet to decide which index to track for the first ETF product, the people said. 
Options under consideration include a carbon neutrality-themed index composed by China Securities Index Co, one of the people said. China has seen dozens of environment-linked ETF launches in the last two years betting on buoyant new-energy stocks.
""BlackRock is committed to helping more Chinese investors achieve their financial goals by bringing them a broader suite of investment products and solutions, including ETF and index investments,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
It said it is ""investing in more local talent"" to support its ""growth priority"".
China Securities Index did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BlackRock's planned foray into the fast-growing Chinese ETF market comes against the backdrop of continued opening up of the financial market in the world's second-largest economy.
The move will also bolster the fund manager's presence in China, after it became the first global asset manager licensed to start a wholly owned onshore mutual fund business in the country last year. 
BlackRock's ETF operation in China is set to open doors to local institutional as well as retail investors.
LUCRATIVE MARKET 
China's nascent $220 billion ETF market with over 600 products as at the end of 2021 has only in recent years started contributing meaningfully to a global passive fund boom that catapulted the sector beyond $10 trillion in value.
Assets in China's onshore ETFs expanded 30.5% in 2021, almost on a par with the 31.9% growth rate of U.S. ETFs, but better than European peers' 24.7% growth, showed data from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
BlackRock's iShares, which ""remained a significant growth driver"" in 2021, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink, drew in $306 billion assets last year, accounting for 57% of new money into all of the firm's active and passive offerings.
For its China ETF foray, BlackRock is recruiting for roles across ETF portfolio management, operations and focused marketing, said the two people. The firm initially plans to form a team of five to six employees, they said.
Measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have largely curbed business activity in Shanghai, with candidate interviews being moved online, one of the people said.
BlackRock's Shanghai office currently has at least 70 staff, showed fund association data, and is set to recruit over 15 more, excluding the ETF hires, company job adverts showed.
Since China allowed fully foreign-owned fund units in 2019, a flurry of foreign fund houses, including U.S.-based ETF specialist VanEck, has applied for licences to operate in the local fund market.
Most of the equities ETFs in China charge a 0.5% management fee per annum, higher than 10 to 20 basis points charged by managers of such products in the U.S. and Europe, making it a lucrative market for foreigners.

The country's 10 largest ETF providers, most of them local players, control over 80% of market share.

And note that while New Zealand's central bank just hiked interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in its biggest hike in over two decades, it tempered its hawkish stance by keeping its previous forecast for rates to peak around 3.35% by-end 2023.

Between January and June last year, Honda Australia told customers of Brighton Automotive (Astoria) in Victoria and Tynan Motors in New South Wales that the dealerships would no longer service Honda vehicles, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged.
""The ACCC alleges that in emails, text messages and phone conversations, Honda informed Astoria and Tynan customers that these businesses had closed and directed customers to contact a Honda dealership or Honda Service Centre to book their next service,"" the watchdog said.
But the dealerships continued to service vehicles, including Honda cars and operate independently after ending agreements with Honda Australia in January 2021 following a restructuring of the carmaker's unit in May 2019, the ACCC said.

The regulator accused Honda Australia of causing ""harm"" to the business of Astoria and Tynan by falsely claiming they had closed or would close, resulting in lower customer footfall, and sought penalty against it in the court.
Honda Australia declined to comment on the claims as it was reviewing the filing, but said in an email to Reuters it has cooperated with the ACCC's investigation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese firms including Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and Mitsubishi Corp will face resolutions from activist shareholders urging greater commitment to tackling climate change at their annual meetings this year.
Five climate activist groups, including Japan's Kiko Network and Australia's Market Forces, said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they had submitted shareholder resolutions for consideration at AGMs of four Tokyo-listed companies this year. Utility Chubu Electric Power completes the quartet.
Activist investors are increasingly turning their attention to Japanese companies, using resolutions that have been deployed in Europe and the United States to push companies and banks away from investing in, or financing, fossil fuel infrastructure.
The lifetime emissions from 10 proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) power projects involving the four companies are estimated to be 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide or its equivalent, the groups said.
This is almost double Japan's 2030 absolute emission reduction target under its nationally determined contributions towards achieving the Paris climate accord, they said.
SMFG, Tepco and Chubu Electric all confirmed they had received the shareholder resolutions, saying that their boards plan to discuss them.
A spokesperson at trading house Mitsubishi said the company would discuss and respond to the proposal appropriately.

Last year, Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, Japan' biggest bank, and trading house Sumitomo Corp faced similar climate resolutions, although the proposals were voted down.

Investing.com -- Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, while U.S. Treasuries fell, as investors continued weighing the risks from high inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.31% by 10:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.33%. The country’s trade data for March 2022 is due later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.31%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.64% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.17%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Investors continued to digest Tuesday’s U.S. inflation data, which showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981. The CPI rose 1.2% month-on-month, while the core CPI rose 6.5% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month.
U.S. Treasuries trimmed a rally that was sparked by the core CPI figure. The figure also prompted traders to scale back bets on how aggressively the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, but some investors warned that cost pressures continue to remain a big risk.
“We’re hopeful that this is where it’s going to peak,” Allspring Global Investments head of active equity Ann Miletti told Bloomberg, referring to U.S. inflation. However, markets continue to face a wall of worry from rising interest rates to the impact of China’s COVID-19 lockdowns, she added.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard also said the U.S. central bank will move “expeditiously” to hike interest rates to a level that neither stimulates nor slows the economy in 2022. She added that a decision on paring the Fed balance sheet could come as soon as May, with reductions starting a month later.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak on Thursday.
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked its interest rate to 1.5% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The Bank of Canada follows later in the day, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Korea following on Thursday.
A rally in oil, as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue the invasion of Ukraine and China partially eased COVID-19 lockdowns, also highlighted inflation concerns.
Putin said peace talks with Ukraine are “at a dead end” and vowed to continue the invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. His Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy again appealed for further European Union sanctions on Russia to include oil as well as all banks.
On the data front, U.S. data, including retail sales and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is due on Thursday. Investors are also monitoring the latest earnings season, with concerns growing that rising commodity costs and consumers who are more cautious could squeeze company profits."

(Reuters) - Top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday recommended investors cast proxy votes against the pay of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Charles Scharf and other leaders, citing concerns about the discretion used to award the pay and lack of disclosures.
In a report provided by a representative, ISS also backed a call for a report on racial equity at the big California-based bank but supported all company director nominees and recommended votes ""against"" a shareholder proposal that would sharply curtail lending for fossil fuel projects. 
CEO Scharf received total compensation of $21.4 million in 2021, up from $20.4 million in 2020, according to Wells Fargo's proxy statement. Last year only a narrow majority of investor ballots, 57%, backed the 2020 compensation in an advisory vote, part of a wave of critical investor feedback on the topic. 
Wells Fargo spoke with shareholders in response and said they wanted things like more detail about how it determined compensation and that more of Scharf's pay be tied to performance. 
But ISS said changes the bank made then still left concerns, such as that financial accomplishments the bank highlighted for setting 2021 pay ""are not entirely consistent with those highlighted in the prior year without specific rationale provided,"" according to its report.

In addition ISS said executives' base salaries are relatively high including that of Scharf, who received a salary of $2.5 million.
Wells Fargo representatives did not immediately comment.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Phillips 66 on Tuesday said Mark Lashier, its chief operating officer, will take over the fourth largest U.S. oil refiner from Chief Executive Greg Garland on July 1. 
Garland, who has led the refining, petrochemical and pipeline company since it spun off from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) 10 years ago, will step down as CEO but remain executive chairman until his retirement in 2024, according to a company statement. 
Lashier, a chemical engineer who joined the company three decades ago in its chemicals group, was promoted to president and COO a year ago after having run  Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co, its joint venture with Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) , since 2017. 
Garland has viewed refining as a mature business and focused on growing its energy pipeline, chemicals and carving out a role in electric-vehicle battery components. Last year, it paid about $150 million for a 16% stake in Novonix Ltd, an Australian supplier of materials for lithium-ion batteries. 
Garland “created a leading diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company, while investing for the future and delivering strong financial returns,” said Glen Tilton, Philips 66's lead independent director. 
The Houston company's non-refining investments have delivered strong shareholder returns but more recently its shares have lagged larger rivals that benefited from soaring fuel margins as motor fuels demand emerged from pandemic lockdowns. 
Lashier is likely to continue Garland's strategy of diversifying into biofuels, hydrogen and battery component. But he must show he can match shareholder returns of rivals Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) and  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) lifted returns by spinning off retail arms and jumping into renewable diesel, analysts said. 

Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) on Tuesday traded at $81.97, up 13% year-to-date, compared to 34% year-to-date increases at Marathon and Valero, and a nearly 96% gain at PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF). 
""Lashier's challenge is to improve the company's valuation,"" said Matthew Blair, analyst at investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. ""He will face questions about the valuation and what he can do to improve stock price performance and capitalize on the potential valuation"" of its non-refining operations.

The department had asked for the sanction based on Google's ""Communicate with Care"" program, which asked employees to add a lawyer to many emails. The government said it was sometimes a ""game"" to shield communications that should not have been protected. 
Judge Amit Mehta said last week that he was not convinced he had the power to sanction a company for actions taken before the lawsuit was filed. Mehta on Tuesday asked the government and Google, which had opposed the sanction, to identify any cases that would buttress their arguments for or against the sanction. 
Mehta also ordered Google to produce a random sample of 210 of the 21,000 emails for review.

""Upon completing its review, the court will determine whether an order compelling disclosure of the full set of the disputed emails or some other course of action is appropriate,"" Mehta said in his order.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street turned rally to sell-off on Tuesday, reversing earlier gains as impending monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve once again pulled growth stocks back into red territory.
All three major U.S. stock indexes turned from positive to negative early in the afternoon, weighed down by healthcare and financials. 
The turnabout began in earnest shortly after remarks from Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who reiterated the need for the central bank to ""expeditiously"" take on decades-high inflation.
""The comments coming out from Fed officials have been more hawkish than the markets have anticipated,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""(Brainard) has generally been nondescript, but now she’s more forceful in her commentary, and that’s getting people to sit up and take notice.""
The Labor Department's CPI report showed the prices urban American consumers pay for a basket of goods posted the biggest monthly jump since September 2005, and an annual surge of 8.5%, the hottest year-on-year inflation number in more than four decades.
Much of the topline CPI growth was attributable to an 18.3% monthly surge in gasoline prices, to a record high of $4.33 per gallon.
The report did little to budge the needle of expectations regarding impending interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
""It's reiteration the Fed can't be sitting back here,"" Nolte added. ""They need to get moving, post-haste.""
The chart below shows core CPI - which strips out volatile food and energy prices - along with other major indicators, all of which continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target:

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China lifted a nine-month freeze on gaming licences after companies, including industry leader Tencent, made major adjustments to their business practices and due to the ban's economic fallout, industry sources and analysts said.
The watchdog of the $47 billion video games market, the world's largest, stopped issuing publishing licenses, which are key to monetising games, in August following a crackdown that curbed game-playing time for minors. That freeze was lifted on Monday when 45 games were granted licences. 
Sources and analysts said while the timing of the relaxation was unexpected, companies had bent over backwards after facing heavy criticism from authorities for being non-compliant.
""Regulations this time around are certainly the strictest they have been,"" said Chenyu Cui, senior analyst at research firm Omdia, ""Every company is scared of falling out of compliance.""
A source at a game studio of which Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is a major shareholder said it was requested by Tencent to remove English words from its game, avoid the colour red and scrap wordings such as “headshots” or “death” to be compliant. 
And the studio also delayed the title's international launch fearing that it could been seen as circumventing Chinese rules, the source said, declining to be named because he is not authorised to speak to media. 
During a similar freeze on licences in 2018, some projects opted to release their games – including Tencent’s Bladed Fury and Iris.Fall - overseas, while waiting for the domestic situation to be resolved.
Tencent declined to comment. 
China's regulators have also been proactive in ensuring compliance in a sector state media once called ""spiritual opium"".
Two sources said that during the suspension companies were still able to submit games for approval and received regular feedback on changes needed on their content or monetisation features.
In September, a state-backed gaming association organised a training programme for developers at which it emphasised that games had to highlight ""a correct set of values"" and could not contain any violent or religious elements, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners, said that over 5,000 game companies were now connected to the national anti-addiction system, numerous firms have made changes to in-game content and non-compliant ones have been investigated and fined by the relevant regulators.
""Concerns have been adequately addressed,"" he said.
Tencent, smaller peer NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and over 200 other firms pledged in September to self-regulate to combat gaming addiction.
ECONOMIC HIT
While companies were getting their house in order, the worsening economic impact of the gaming crackdown could no longer be ignored by Beijing.
During the licence freeze, about 14,000 video gaming-related firms – including those involved in merchandising, advertising and publishing - shut, according to business registry firm Tianyancha.
Some highly anticipated projects have also been spiked, such as Lilith Games’ Eden Apocalypse. A representative said this was due to a change in the business's direction.
Three gaming industry sources said many projects have been hit by a hiring freeze as they are under pressure to cut their size and budget. 
Tencent, a big employer of fresh graduates, said during its results its hiring pace would slow, and Reuters has reported that it and other peers plan to cut jobs. 
""They are doing this to protect jobs,"" one industry executive told Reuters, referring to the lifting of the freeze and declining to be named as he was not permitted to speak to the media. 
The game industry's regulator, National Press and Public Administration, did not respond to a request for comment. 
LOOKING OVERSEAS
Chinese gaming shares soared on Tuesday after the regulatory relaxation, with some analysts saying it showed the government's commitment to the sector.
But some were also cautious, pointing out that only 45 games were approved this time, versus the 80 to 90 usually greenlighted once a month prior to the freeze.
And the landscape has changed completely, prompting some to diversify or to consider leaving the Chinese market altogether. 

Small gaming firms in China are considering pivoting towards blockchain gaming in the West, even though it could mean abandoning the China market since Beijing bans unapproved cryptocurrencies, said Greg Pilarowski, head of law firm Pillar Legal.
""The current environment in China is very challenging for gaming companies,"" Pilarowski said. ""So a lot of folks are asking how they could get into blockchain games… because crypto and blockchain have been very profitable for many people in the US.""

The first day of the company's presentations was focused on the various business digitalization initiatives that Ambev, part of Belgium's Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, is implementing to expand its revenue base beyond simply selling beverages.
The strategy, according to Jereissati Neto, is to create an ""ambidextrous"" company, capable of operating with solutions that include the platforms Ze Delivery, which sells directly to consumers, and Bees, through which it bets on growth among retailers.
When questioned about market share, the CEO said, without detailing numbers, that 2021 ""was, by far, the year in which we gained the most market share"".

""It was a market share gain in a depressed environment and now we seem to have the wind in our favor,"" said the executive, referring to the social isolation measures that ended last year in Brazil.
Ambev's plans for the Bees platform is to keep the business separate from the brewery, gaining scale over time while reinforcing its operations in markets where it is already present and looking into additional service offerings such as ""click & collect"".

Duane Morris LLP said Shkreli's former company Phoenixus AG agreed to cover his legal fees but has refused to pay the $2.04 million owed through March 31, after exhausting the limits of an insurance policy covering the fees in October.
In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Duane Morris also said Shkreli ""has no assets"" to pay its fees, and would not be harmed if it withdrew because the antitrust trial is over. The law firm said Shkreli did not oppose its withdrawal.
Lawyers for Phoenixus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shkreli, 39, became known as ""pharma bro"" after raising the price of the anti-parisitic drug Daraprim overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50 in 2015, and appearing unrepentant when criticized.
In January, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan banned Shkreli from the drug industry for life and ordered him to pay $64.6 million, finding he illegally sought to keep generic Daraprim rivals off the market.
The case had been brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and seven U.S. states.
Shkreli is serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2017 of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran and scheming to defraud investors in another company.

He is eligible for release on Nov. 7.
In February, the Brooklyn judge who oversaw the criminal case and a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case permanently banned Shkreli from serving as an officer or director of public companies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce as soon as Wednesday another $750 million in military assistance for Ukraine for its fight against Russian forces, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The equipment would be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. 
One of the officials said final determinations were still being made about the mix of equipment. 
A senior congressional aide said the equipment to be announced would likely include heavy ground artillery systems to Ukraine, including howitzers.
White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine that Russia calls a ""special military operation.""The congressional aide said some lawmakers had been informed within the last 24 hours about the upcoming announcement, which was expected within the next 24 to 48 hours.
Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armor. 
U.S. and European leaders are being pressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to provide heavier arms and equipment to engage Russia in Ukraine's eastern region, where Russia is expected to intensify its military efforts.

Rainey, who announced his departure from PayPal on Tuesday after almost seven years with the payments firm, joins Walmart at a time when retailers across the board are rushing to beef up their e-commerce businesses following the pandemic-led shift to online shopping. 
Walmart in 2018 bought a majority stake in Indian online marketplace Flipkart in a $16 billion deal, its biggest overseas investment, and strengthened its U.S. e-commerce business by acquiring apparel retailers Modcloth and Bonobos. 
Walmart said Biggs will serve as an adviser until he leaves the company in January 2023.

PayPal said it has appointed senior executive Gabrielle Rabinovitch as interim CFO and launched a formal search for Rainey's replacement. 
Rainey, who is on the board of directors at Nasdaq, also served as CFO at United Airlines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. consumer watchdog on Tuesday sued  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) and one of its former executives, accusing the credit reporting agency of tricking consumers into making recurring payments after the company was fined in 2017 for similar activity.
The lawsuit, filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in federal court in Illinois, accuses John Danaher (NYSE:DHR), who headed one of TransUnion's subsidiaries, of failing to ensure that the company stopped the deceptive activity. 
The suit seeks monetary relief for consumers, injunctive relief and fines.
""TransUnion is an out-of-control repeat offender that believes it is above the law,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. ""I am concerned that TransUnion's leadership is either unwilling or incapable of operating its businesses lawfully.""
The company in a statement called the CFPB's claims ""meritless."" 
Danaher retired from TransUnion in 2021, according to a company filing. Attorneys for Danaher also described the claims as without merit, saying in a statement that ""the CFPB is focused more on politically expedient headlines than the facts or the law.""
The bureau is asking a court to order the defendants to refund money to customers, pay restitution to harmed consumers and pay back ill-gotten gains for unjustified enrichment. 
The lawsuit underscores the bureau's more aggressive posture under President Joe Biden's administration. Chopra said last month the CFPB was looking at ""structural remedies"" to hold big companies more accountable for repeat offenses. 
Tackling corporate recidivism has emerged as a key priority under Biden, who entered the White House nearly 15 months ago, with the Justice Department last year rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at better deterring repeat misconduct.
In its complaint, the CFPB said TransUnion failed to address shortcomings identified in a 2017 enforcement action under which the company paid $16.9 million to settle charges that it deceptively marketed its products, tricking customers into recurring-payment products and making canceling them difficult.

The CFPB said Danaher, who headed a subsidiary called TransUnion Interactive, sought to delay compliance with the 2017 order to try to boost revenue. For example, Danaher told the company to stop requiring customers to check a box to confirm enrollment in a paid product, which had been required by the order, the CFPB said. 
TransUnion in its statement said it remains in compliance with the order, adding that the CFPB failed to honor its own obligations to respond to a plan for compliance that the company filed shortly thereafter.

PARIS (Reuters) -Robust demand for Louis Vuitton and Dior products boosted first-quarter sales at the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, kicking off earnings season for the industry with a show of resilience despite geopolitical tensions, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and volatile stock markets.
High-end fashion brands drove a 30% rise in sales of its largest division, fashion and leather goods, on a like-for-like basis, beating analyst expectations of 17%, according to consensus estimates cited by RBC.
""The year starts on a high note,"" said Luca Solca of Bernstein, citing ""another material beat"" of consensus expectations, particularly the fashion and leather goods activity.
Dior and Celine grew faster than other labels, while Louis Vuitton ""is never very far from the average for the division,"" LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts in a call.
The group will continue to raise prices at its fashion labels - but reasonably - to reflect the cost of business, said the executive.
Luxury industry prices have increased over the last six months by around 8 percent since September last year, with hikes in the range of 20%-23% at Louis Vuitton and Tiffany, according to recent estimates from HSBC.
Watches and jewellery labels also performed strongly, with sales for the high end products up 19%, boosted by Tiffany, particularly in the United States. The American luxury brand is undergoing a renewal drive led by its new French owner targeting younger audiences, with marketing campaigns featuring K-pop star Rose wearing chunky gold jewellery.
Traffic in Sephora stores in the U.S. and France helped push up sales at the selective retail division, which clocked 24% organic sales growth. But the luxury group's DFS travel retail business continued to suffer from travel restrictions in Asia, including Hong Kong where tourists have not yet returned.
Turnaround efforts at DFS could help it break even this year, predicted Guiony. 
The executive sought to reassure investors concerned about disruptions in China from restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus, although he cautioned that in addition to lockdowns in Shanghai and Shenzhen, traffic is down in cities that are not affected by such measures, with people travelling less.
""Obviously this is an impact - it's a fairly recent impact so you don't see it in the numbers,"" he said, noting that the effects seen in April so far are similar to the second half of March. Drawing on experience from previous lockdowns in China, the executive predicted that demand would return quickly once restrictions ease.

""It is probably worth looking beyond 2Q China disruption,"" said Citi, which plans to retain a buy rating on shares. Overall sales at LVMH rose by 23% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the effect of currency changes, in the three months to March to 18 billion euros, beating a consensus estimate for 18% growth, cited by Jefferies.
Hermes reports first-quarter sales on April 14 and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) on April 21.

Investing.com -- The Dow reversed gains to close lower Tuesday, as tech's attempt to rebound failed following data that fueled debate on whether inflation was nearing a peak. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.26%, or 87 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.33%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.30%.
The consumer price index, or CPI, climbed to 8.5% in the 12 months through March, above economists’ forecasts of 8.4%, but it was the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, that dominated investor attention.
The core CPI rose 0.3% in March, slower than economists’ forecast for a rise of 0.5%, led by a “larger-than-expected decline in core goods prices alongside a surprising miss in rents,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Some on Wall Street aren’t getting carried away, warning that there is still a long way to go for inflation to return to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
“[W]hile today's report is encouraging, the Fed is a long way away from claiming victory and will have to remain in inflation-fighting mode,” Jefferies said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields took a breather following the data, briefly helping growth sectors of the market including tech catch a bid. 
Energy stocks were the biggest gainer in the wake of surging oil prices as global demand worries eased after Shanghai curbed some of its Covid-19 restrictions.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) led the gains in the energy sector.  
Losses in consumer discretionary stocks were limited by rising restaurant stocks after Citi highlighted Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), and  Texas Roadhouse  (NASDAQ:TXRH) as opportunities with the most upside that can ride out the waning reopening boost and the impact of labor shortages.

Investing.com – Stocks went on a rollercoaster ride on Tuesday that left them in the red as of late trading, even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury eased back.
Tech stocks had surged earlier in the session on the rollback in the 10-year yield, which moves inverse to price.
The move comes just as a spate of S&P 500 will report earnings, starting with JPMorgan and Delta Air Lines on Wednesday. 
Banks are seen as beneficiaries of a rising rate environment, but market volatility could dampen capital markets and investment banking activity for the big Wall Street firms, most of which report this week. The flip side is surging energy and commodity prices could have boosted trading.
Airlines are also benefiting from the rebound in travel, though it has had its disruptions as well.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) updated its outlook to be slightly more positive than expected, and Delta is expected to give an outlook on summer travel trends.
Inflation is running at 40-year highs, and the Federal Reserve is likely to take that into account when it meets in a few weeks to decide its next policy action. Most agree that will be a half-point rate hike and a plan to start cutting back its $9 trillion balance sheet. 
Much of the uncertainty in the markets since February has been the economic repercussions of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said peace talks with Ukrainian counterparties hit a “dead end” and he promised to continue Russia’s fight, sending oil prices back up above $100 a barrel.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. JPMorgan earnings
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will also report on its latest quarter before the open, with analysts tracked by Investing.com forecasting earnings per share of $2.70 on revenue of $30.63 billion.
2. Delta Air earnings
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will report earnings before the opening bell Wednesday, and while international travel trends seem to be on the up, Delta shareholders will be looking for a boost. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect Delta to report earnings per share of $1.33 on revenue of $8.74 billion.
3. Producer prices
At 8:30 AM ET the U.S. will report the month over month producer price index for March. Analysts expect PPI to grow to 1.1%, above the previous reading of 0.8%.

The crowd-sourced review platform for restaurants and other businesses will provide travel benefits to its U.S. employees who need to travel out of states like Texas and Oklahoma that have restricted access to abortion services.
“As a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, this new benefit allows our U.S. employees and their dependents to have equitable access to reproductive care, regardless of where they live,” Miriam Warren, Yelp's chief diversity officer, said in a statement.
Other companies have pledged to offer similar support to their Texas-based employees. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) in March started covering travel expenses for employees who go out of state for abortions, becoming the first major U.S. bank to make that commitment.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill that makes it illegal to perform an abortion in the state except in medical emergencies, penalizing those who do with up to $100,000 in fines and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law that gives its conservative majority a chance to undermine or even repeal the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday questioned whether allowing Mexico to sue U.S. gun manufacturers for facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels would open the door to other countries suing them, including Russia over firearms used by Ukrainians in the ongoing war.
U.S. District Judge F. Dennis Saylor in Boston raised that prospect as he weighed whether to dismiss Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold gun makers including Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co responsible for a deadly flood of weapons across the border.
Mexico in a lawsuit filed in August accused the companies of undermining its strict gun laws by designing, marketing and distributing military-style assault weapons in ways they knew would arm drug cartels, fueling murders and kidnappings.
It said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the gun makers it sued, which also include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt's Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc.
""They know how criminals are getting their guns,"" Jonathan Lowy, a lawyer for Mexico, argued during the 90-minute virtual hearing. ""They could stop and they choose to be willfully blind to the facts.""
But Saylor questioned whether Mexico's stance would mean the protections gun makers typically enjoy under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) from lawsuits over their products' misuse is ""completely hollow.""
He asked why if Mexico could sue the gun makers other countries could not too, such as Italy over mafia killings, Israel over attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas, or even Russia over the deaths of its soldiers in Ukraine if the companies' guns were used.
""If Ukrainians are using United States manufactured military weapons or Smith & Wesson revolvers for that matter to defend themselves, can the government of Russia come in and say you have caused us harm?"" he asked. ""I mean, why not, if your theory is right?""
Steven Shadowen, another lawyer for Mexico, said other foreign counties could sue too if they met the requirements, though he said U.S. courts could refuse to hear a case if it presented a political question.
But Andrew Lelling, a lawyer for Smith & Wesson, said it would be ""absurd"" to conclude the federal law only bars lawsuits over injuries in the United States and not Mexico's allegations over the trafficking of guns to Mexican criminals.
He said it was too much of a reach for Mexico to sue the companies over gun sales that were legal in the United States to wholesalers who in turn sold them to retailers before criminals smuggled them. 
""They would have to argue that Congress intended for this robust statute to apply if an independent criminal actor shot somebody in San Diego, but not if he slips over the border and shoots somebody in Tijuana,"" Lelling said.

Alejandro Celorio, the Mexican foreign ministry's legal counsel, said the court's resolution would likely take weeks, and noted that the complexity of the case made a nuanced, rather than a simple ""yes or no"" ruling more likely in the end.
Speaking in a video conference, Celorio said if the court ruled against Mexico, the government would likely appeal. A negotiated settlement was ""always an option"", he added, but stressed Mexico had no plans to change its strategy for now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global equities reversed earlier gains on Tuesday, while U.S. Treasury yields slipped as data showing a jump in U.S. inflation was in line with expectations gave investors some relief.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 1.2% last month, the biggest increase in 16-1/2 years and cementing the case for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
However, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last down 6.1 basis points to 2.721%, its first decline in eight sessions, as the inflation number had been priced in and also reflecting the market's unease that an aggressive policy response to inflation from the Federal Reserve could undermine economic growth.
""Inflation is still a really big part of the macro narrative here (but) we're seeing some encouraging signs beneath the surface,"" said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.'
""Market has been picking up today on the fact that the CPI was a bit softer than expected... Anything that indicates a softening momentum on the inflation front is going to mean that the Fed perhaps may not have to go as aggressively in tightening monetary policy.""

""Markets have decided that central banks are late and need to do more to tame inflation, and moderate volatility in equities is not enough to stop this,"" said Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich. ""The reason for the wobble in equity markets is higher rates and geopolitics.""
While U.S. 10-year Treasury yields pulled back from their highs, they are up almost 45 basis points so far this month.
More disconcerting for equities is the move in real or inflation-adjusted yields, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) approaching 0%.

Investors also await Wednesday's first-quarter earnings season for big banks, many of which are expected to report a sharp decline in earnings from a year earlier, according to analysts, who noted many lenders benefited from exceptionally strong deal-making, trading and funds set aside for loan losses being released.

The latest warnings from Japanese policymakers, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida saying on Tuesday that rapid currency moves are undesirable, failed to shore up the yen, which has shed over 3% this month.
""Markets at this point are not sure policymakers are genuinely inclined to intervene on the yen and that's why we have most likely seen a limited impact,"" said James Lord, global head of FXEM Strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""Typically verbal intervention doesn't have much impact on currency markets, and that's not specific to the yen.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight U.S. weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry's capacity to meet Ukraine's weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years, two people familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday.
Demand for weapons has shot up after Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 spurred U.S. and allied weapons transfers to Ukraine. Resupplying as well as planning for a longer war is expected to be discussed at the meeting, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The Pentagon's office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense, will host the 90 minute meeting and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was expected to attend, one of the people said.
The Pentagon has said that the most useful weapons are smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington and allies have been shipping to Ukraine on a nearly daily basis.
The intense usage, as well as the battlefield effectiveness displayed by Ukrainian forces, has driven interest in restocking these weapons.
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX). 
The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including over 5,000 Javelins and more than 1,400 Stingers.

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Administration is having weekly meetings of its European Crisis Management Team to review specific requests related to Ukraine.
To speed up U.S. government approval for sales and transfers of arms produced by American defense contractors, the Pentagon has re-established a team to respond to the increased demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest remained bullish on top holding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Tuesday despite growing fears of a U.S. recession and shutdowns of the car maker's Shanghai factory due to spiking coronavirus cases. 
""What we said during COVID about innovation solving problems will move into overdrive,"" she told a webinar, with Tesla poised to ""deliver truly exponential growth for many, many years"" as it expands its autonomous driving programs.
Wood's bullish stance on technology comes as yields of two-year Treasuries have moved above those of 10-year Treasuries in recent weeks, which is often considered a precursor to a recession. 
Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund in 2020, said that she expects ""truly disruptive innovation"" will come back into favor as investors turn to technology to solve economic problems. 
Tesla is down 6% for the year to date, while Wood's second-largest position, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, is down nearly 26% over the same time. 
Overall, ARK Innovation is down 36.7% for the year to date, a performance that puts it in the worst percentile among the 615 U.S. Mid-Cap Growth funds tracked by Morningstar. Shares of the fund rose 0.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday. 

Investors have pulled approximately a net $791 billion out of the fund over last three weeks, according to Lipper data. 
That three-week losing streak was its longest since November.

(Reuters) - The BA.2 Omicron subvariant of the coronavirus is now responsible for 86% of U.S. COVID-19 cases and more than 90% of infections in the Northeast, according to data on Tuesday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
COVID-19 infections have been back on the rise during the last few weeks, particularly in Northeast states such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, although overall cases have dropped sharply nationally since hitting record levels in January, according to data from the agency.
A resurgence in COVID-19 cases in parts of Asia and Europe has raised concerns that another wave could follow in the United States, as has been the case with previous surges during the pandemic.
Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of division of infectious diseases at Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital, said the trend of an overall decline in cases has now reversed. 
""It's clear that there is now a trend towards an increasing number of cases across the country and particularly in the Northeast,"" Kuritzkes said. 
The seven-day moving average of U.S. COVID-19 cases stood at 28,339 as of April 9, up nearly 10% from a week earlier, the CDC said, with BA.2 accounting for 85.9% of infections. 
For the week ending April 2, BA.2 made up 75.4% of the variants identified in the country, up from a previous estimate of 72.2%, according to CDC estimates. 

Philadelphia, in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania, will reimpose indoor mask mandate from April 18, as a response to a fresh wave of cases, making it the first major U.S. city to take that step. 
""I think it's likely that if the numbers pick up in the same way, individual cities will reimpose masking requirements,"" said Kuritzkes. ""I don't think it's likely that will happen at the state level.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Renault Chief Executive Luca de Meo said on Tuesday that the automaker's plans to create a separate division for its electric (EV) assets could eventually lead to a separate listing.
""This could mean a separate listing. This is a conditional, this is precisely what we are reviewing,"" De Meo told a news conference.
The plan to separate the combustion engines activity could interest Nissan (OTC:NSANY) or long-term investors, he added.
De Meo wants to press ahead with plans to create separate divisions for electric (EV) and combustion engine vehicles despite potentially costly uncertainty over its interests in Russia, three sources told Reuters last week.
Playing catch-up with rivals like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the French automaker first outlined its strategy shift in February, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying its turnaround plan was ahead of schedule.
De Meo on Tuesday said  Renault  (PA:RENA) was ""very confident"" to deliver on its turnaround plan as it was financed despite the impact of the Russian assets suspension.
The war in Ukraine has resulted in Western powers imposing extensive sanctions against Russia, leaving Renault, majority owner of Russia's biggest carmaker Avtovaz, faced with what de Meo has called a ""very complex situation"".

After announcing the suspension of its activities in Russia, Renault is reviewing its options for the Moscow plant and its shareholding in Avtovaz.
""We are well armed to try to find a solution in the long term that can protect our assets and our employees, and in fact not to completely insult the future because life goes on and we hope the situation on the ground returns to normal,"" De Meo said on Tuesday.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Major U.S. airlines are enjoying the strongest travel demand in three years, yet investors will focus on how they are mitigating mounting inflationary pressures when they report quarterly earnings starting on Wednesday.
After a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant, travel demand has roared back, with some airlines reporting the highest ticket sales in their history. U.S. passenger traffic has been averaging about 89% of the pre-pandemic levels since mid-February, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data. 
But jet fuel prices in North America have gone up by more than 30% in the past month, since Western countries slapped sanctions on Russian exports. Carriers also must pay more to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), due to report first-quarter earnings on April 21, on Tuesday revised up estimates for jet fuel expenses. Overall, it projected costs in the quarter through March would be at least 16% higher than in the corresponding period of 2019.
The Texas-based carrier is tipped to report a loss of $2.42 per share for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Soaring fuel costs have raised concerns among investors at a time when the airline industry has spent two years trying to recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19.
HIGHER FARES 
Fuel is the industry's second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. airlines do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. 
Instead, they typically look to offset fuel costs with higher fares. Airlines fares were up about 24% year-on-year in March, among the biggest contributors to a jump in U.S. consumer prices.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) has said it is passing along most additional fuel costs to customers. Its average fares are up more than 100% from a year ago, according to data from Cowen.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), which will report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, last month said it needed to raise ticket prices by about 10% each way to cover the fuel costs.
Historically, the U.S. airline industry has offset around 60% of changes in fuel expense with higher revenue, analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note. As a result, demand needs to stay strong for sustainable profitability, analysts say.

Some are concerned that rising fares and higher inflation could dent travel spending.
Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, said consumers might hit the brakes in the second half, making it tougher for airline revenues to rebound to 2019 levels.

(Reuters) - Airbus urged Europe on Tuesday not to block imports of titanium from Russia, saying sanctions on the strategic metal would damage aerospace while barely hurting Russia's economy.
Widening the action taken after Russia's invasion of Ukraine to titanium, used in airplanes and jet engines, would ""not be appropriate,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said at an annual shareholder meeting.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on Western governments to impose stronger economic sanctions on Russia.
The European Union said on Monday more sanctions were an option and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday Kyiv's allies would continue to tighten pressure on Moscow. 
Russia is the largest producer of titanium, a strategic metal prized for its strength relative to its weight.
The EU has so far avoided banning Russian commodities other than steel and coal, and titanium remains exempt from restrictions on trade with Russia.
""Airbus is applying and will continue to apply the sanctions fully,"" a company spokesperson said.
""Sanctions on Russian titanium would hardly harm Russia, because they only account for a small part of export revenues there. But they would massively damage the entire aerospace industry across Europe,"" the spokesperson added.
Airbus is accelerating a search for non-Russian supplies in the long term, while its needs are covered in the short and medium term, Faury said.
In March, Airbus said it ""is directly sourcing titanium from Russia as well as from other countries"" and indirectly acquiring Russian titanium via suppliers. 
On Tuesday, it reaffirmed this in answer to a Reuters query but declined to say when it had last received Russian titanium.
OUTLOOK CONFIRMED
Airbus has said it relies on Russia for half its titanium needs, while state-backed VSMPO-AVISMA provided a third of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s needs under a deal renewed last November. Last month, Boeing said it had suspended buying Russian titanium.
VSMPO-AVISMA is 25%-owned by state defence conglomerate Rostec. It relies on aerospace for three quarters of its sales. 
Aerospace officials say Airbus is partly concerned about the reliance on Russia at suppliers like France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), which uses titanium to make jet engine parts and landing gear. 
Safran said in February it had reserves for several months and depended on Russia for less than half its needs. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it shared Airbus' worries about possible sanctions.
Aerospace is not the only industry wrestling with Russia's commodity clout. U.S. utilities have lobbied the White House not to ban Russian uranium, Reuters reported last month.
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since war started on Feb. 24, according to researchers. About 80 have kept a presence, while suspending new investments. 

Faury reaffirmed Airbus' 2022 profit guidance but said it was clear the war in Ukraine was ""making it harder as we now have a more challenging risk profile"" due to economic risks.
""That being said, we still have three quarters ahead of us and we continue to believe we can achieve it,"" he said.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Benetton family and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are working on a premium of around 30% over Atlantia's average stock price in the last six months, as they ready a bid that could land as early as Wednesday, three sources said.
The two partners are considering an offer between 22 and 23 euros per share, one of the sources said, but cautioned no final decision had been taken. 
While a significant premium on the six month average share price, that would be a more modest increase over the current price of about 21.7 euros, and would value the whole of Atlantia - in which the Benetton family already owns a 33% stake - at about 18.1-19.0 billion euros ($19.7-$20.7 billion). 
Shares in the Italian infrastructure group have gained nearly 20% since April 6 when speculation first emerged about an approach involving Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Brookfield and Florentino Perez, head of Spain's ACS. 
The stock hit a two-year high of 22.5 euros on Monday as investors waited for a move that could take the group private.
""The offer could land very soon, even early Wednesday morning,"" one of the sources said.
Blackstone and Benetton holding company Edizione declined to comment. 
GRAPHIC - Atlantia's bumpy ride https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjbylxve/ATLANTIA_BID_WAR.png 
Edizione and Blackstone want to delist Atlantia to shield it from the appetite of rival suitors, who approached the Benettons last month with a proposal to buy the group and hand over Atlantia's motorway concessions to Perez. 
GIP, Brookfield and the Spanish tycoon are in a 'wait and see' mode after the Benetton family and Atlantia's long-time investors CRT and GIC rebuffed their offer, sources have said.
The takeover offer comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a deal aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
It also puts the spotlight on Alessandro Benetton, 58, who was appointed chairman of Edizione earlier this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments.
After parting ways with its Autostrade per l'Italia, Atlantia will continue to run airports in Italy and France, motorways in Europe and Latin America and digital toll payment company Telepass.

The Italian government so far has been silent on the latest developments, but it has special vetting 'golden' powers over strategic assets, such as the country's airports and their ownership.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co on Tuesday moved orders for 141 of its airplanes into accounting limbo due to the war in Ukraine and international sanctions against Russia, among other contractual issues, meaning it no longer expects the jets to be delivered.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) unveiled the adjustment to its order backlog in monthly orders and deliveries data that also showed it had delivered 41 jets to customers in March.
The monthly deliveries tally included 34 of its cash-cow 737 MAX single-aisle jets, two 767 freighters for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and a 777 freighter for China Airlines.
The 41 March deliveries - nearly double the 22 it delivered in February and up from 29 a year ago - reflect rebounding travel and pandemic-driven cargo demand. Boeing said year-to-date deliveries stood at 95 aircraft. 
Deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner remained frozen due to inspections and repairs for production flaws. 
In March, Boeing booked orders for 53 planes, while customers canceled orders for 15 jets - including three of its 787s. Net of canceled orders and swapped models, Boeing had 38 orders, it said. 
For the first three months of the year, Boeing's orders rose to 167 from 114, Boeing said. Taking out cases where customers canceled orders or swapped models, orders stood at 145, up from 107, Boeing reported. 
After adjustments for deals deemed unlikely to result in actual delivery, net orders year to date dropped to 76 from 179, Boeing said. 
Overall, Boeing's order backlog fell to 4,231 from 4,375.
Boeing said the accounting adjustment included 141 aircraft removed from its backlog for financial and contractual considerations. 
Most of the aircraft removed were due to the war in Ukraine, which prompted international sanctions against Russia and ruined Ukraine's airline industry. 
The orders were mainly for Russian carriers and included 138 of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX, and more than a dozen 777 and 787 widebody models. 
Jet orders could return to the backlog if Boeing's assessment changes. 
Boeing rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) said it delivered 142 planes in the first quarter, up more than 13% on the year.

Airbus said it sold a total of 253 jets in the first quarter, or a net total of 83 after cancellations.
Airbus does not publish a figure comparable to Boeing's accounting adjustment, but industry sources said the European planemaker also has an internal filter for screening out orders that are unlikely to be delivered and does not place them into its production plan.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have recommended  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s shareholders vote against discharging the bank's board and management from liability for the 2020 financial year at its annual general meeting on April 29.
Glass Lewis said in a report on Monday that shareholders ""could reasonably hold the board and executives accountable for the identified deficiencies in the Company's risk and control framework that were in place during fiscal year 2020"".
ISS noted in a report on Tuesday that the same issues had entailed ""entailed substantial monetary and reputational costs for the company, and by extension its shareholders.""
Shareholders are set to scrutinise the performance of Switzerland's second-largest bank during 2020 and 2021, when a series of scandals prompted ousters, investigations and losses.
Credit Suisse's board will leave managers potentially liable for its Greensill-linked funds' collapse when it asks investors to grant them a discharge for other activities.
The bank racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.7 billion) 2021 loss, partly as a result of a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos.
It was also hit by the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill for which it is still trying to recover funds.
Votes at this year's AGM will cover two financial years as Credit Suisse withdrew an agenda item from its meeting in 2021 while it investigated the Greensill and Archegos matters.
Both ISS and Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote in favour of discharging Credit Suisse directors from liability for the 2021 financial year. 
While the bank still had ""a long way to go to effect a convincing turnaround and materially reduce its exposure to reputational and litigation risk,"" it had taken meaningful steps to improve its culture and risk governance, Glass Lewis said.
ISS said a ""qualified vote"" in favour of management's performance for 2021 was warranted due to ""significant levels of personnel refreshment and remedial measures implemented"".
""Nevertheless, some concern is still raised for 2021 considering the actions of the former board chair during the year,"" it added.
Credit Suisse said it took note of the recommendations, adding that Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended shareholders support the board's positions on all but one proposal.

Shareholder groups have submitted two proposals running counter to the board of directors, asking investors to approve a special audit examining the bank's actions, and separately to strengthen its climate change strategy.
Glass Lewis and ISS recommended shareholders reject both.

Scores of foreign companies have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia or said they were leaving for good since Russia began what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
A bill submitted to the lower house of parliament on Tuesday showed that Russian lawmakers proposed appointing VEB or other entities, as per authorities' and courts' decisions, as external administration at companies where foreign ownership exceeds 25%.
The external administration could be set at companies playing a critical role in infrastructure or monopoly supplies of certain goods if their decision to leave Russia poses a threat to supply chains or could result in job cuts.
Earlier on Tuesday, telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) said it was pulling out of the Russian market, going a step further than rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which said on Monday it was indefinitely suspending its business in Russia.
Russian authorities have previously suggested that Russia may nationalise assets held by Western investors who decide to depart.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made clear he wants to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the unit, floating names of Mexican billionaires like Ricardo Salinas of Banco Azteca and Carlos Hank Gonzalez of Banorte as potential buyers.
""It's completely reasonable that the government has a vision of who is the best manager for one of the country's largest financial entities,"" Paco Ybarra, chief executive of Citi's Institutional Clients Group, told local newspaper El Financiero. 
""It's one more factor in the decision process, not something that we consider to be decisive and it is open to as many options as possible,"" said Ybarra, underscoring the sale is open to foreign buyers. 
Citi country head Manuel Romo announced in March that Ybarra will lead the sale.
The executive is currently in Mexico City ahead of the bank's announcement of sale terms, several outlets reported.
In February, Romo said Citibanamex could be sold directly or through an initial public offering, but not piecemeal.
Ybarra also told local outlet El Economista that for Citi, ""it's important for the buyer to pay what we know (the unit) is worth."" 

Analysts have said Citibanamex could go for $4 billion to $8 billion, though Citi, which paid $12.5 billion for the unit in 2001, has not yet named a price.

(Reuters) -European shares fell on Tuesday as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) slumped after a big stake sale, while a U.S. reading on inflation kept aggressive Federal Reserve tightening bets from ramping up. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3%, paring some losses from earlier in the day, with healthcare stocks leading losses, and banks among the worst hit. 
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank fell 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively, after an undisclosed investor sold stakes of more than 5% in Germany's top lenders. 
The appetite for shares firmed slightly from earlier in the day after U.S. data showed consumer prices in the world's largest economy rose largely in line with estimates, pushing U.S. Treasury yields lower. [US/]
After a strong rebound from March lows, the STOXX 600 has been stuck in a range on worries about the fallout of the Ukraine war, aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation and rising coronavirus cases in China.
""That sinking feeling hit European shares amid concerns that inflationary pressures are still mounting and growing evidence that consumer confidence is suffering amid the cost of living squeeze,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""The increasingly entrenched Ukraine conflict has already sent commodity prices soaring... The sanctions screw expected to be turned tighter on Russia, and the European Union is thought to be inching closer towards agreeing a Russian oil embargo,"" she said, adding that the associated supply fears were pushing up crude prices.

COLOMBO/LONDON (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's central bank said on Tuesday it had become ""challenging and impossible"" to repay external debt, as it tries to use its dwindling foreign exchange reserves to import essentials like fuel.
The island nation's reserves have slumped more than two-thirds in the past two years, as tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic badly hurt its tourism-dependent economy and exposed the government's debt-fuelled spending.
Street protests against shortages of fuel, power, food and medicine have gone on for more than a month.
""We need to focus on essential imports and not have to worry about servicing external debt,"" Central Bank of Sri Lanka's governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, told reporters.
""It has come to a point that making debt payments are challenging and impossible.""
Weerasinghe said the suspension of payment would be until the country came to an agreement with creditors and with the support of a loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sri Lanka starts formal talks with the global lender on Monday for emergency loans.
The country has foreign debt payments of around $4 billion due this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond maturing in July. A coupon payment of $78 million is due across two of its bonds maturing in 2023 and 2028 on Monday, though there is a 30-day grace period. 
""It is a default. This was inevitable,"" said Murtaza Jafferjee, the chief executive of brokerage J.B Securities.
""This is a positive for the economy because we were using scarce foreign exchange resources to service our debt when we could not afford to. This will release funds for our own citizens. It was displaced vanity at the cost of our population.""
He said Sri Lanka’s decision covers about $25 billion in bilateral and commercial debt, which includes about $12 billion of international sovereign bonds.
""The memorandum today should pave the way to an IMF program, in our view,"" said Milo Gunasinghe at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note to clients, though warned that political uncertainty remained high. 
With the government only having begun the process of selecting advisers for debt talks over the weekend, formal negotiations with creditors might only start once appointments have been made, Gunasinghe added. 
BlueBay Asset Management's senior emerging markets sovereign strategist, Timothy Ash, said the ""only surprise is that it took the administration in Colombo so long to come to terms with the reality on the ground"".
""It's logical to declare a payment moratorium until they work out a programme with the IMF and agree terms with bondholders,"" he said.
Sri Lanka's sovereign dollar-denominated bonds enjoyed healthy gains on Tuesday, with many issues up nearly 2 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.

Its hard currency bonds mostly trade at deeply distressed levels of just under 40 cents in the dollar while the bond maturing on July 25 last traded at just over 50 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Governor Weerasinghe said the call on repayment was being taken in good faith, emphasising that the country of 22 million people had never defaulted on its debt payments.

The analyst argues that Crypto.com, and other fast-growing crypto exchanges, are gaining market share at the expense of Coinbase. This makes Dolev “increasingly worried about looming retail pricing pressure and the long-term sustainability of COIN's business model.”
“We found that COIN's share has fallen from a peak of 12% in the fall of 2021 to just 8% currently, with a steep drop in between March and April. We believe that had COIN not added as many tokens in 4Q, the same-store share of volume per token may have been even worse. As a reminder, in 2021 COIN added trading for 95 new tokens, 36 of which were added in 4Q alone (i.e. 38% of the newly added tokens),” Dolev said in a client note.
The analyst adds that Crypto.com’s aggressive marketing campaign (naming rights to the home arena of the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, partnerships with UFC and LeBron James, Super Bowl ads, etc) is paying dividends as its volumes are now on par with Coinbase.
The lowered price target reflects 2022 revenue estimates that now stand at $6.8 billion from $7.0 billion previously.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to spend $64 billion on research and development over the next decade, the company said on Tuesday, laying out an ambitious target to roll out 30 electric vehicle models globally by 2030.
Its goals include producing some 2 million electric vehicles a year by 2030, aiming to gain share in the fast-growing market for electric vehicles, led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, while Japanese automakers risk falling behind European and U.S. rivals.
""As far as resource investments over the next 10 years go, we're going to invest about 8 trillion yen in research and development expenses,"" said Honda Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe, referring to the equivalent to $64 billion.
Honda said it wanted to establish a dedicated electric vehicle production line in North America, where it will also procure Ultium batteries from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
It is also considering a separate joint venture company for battery production there, aside from its GM partnership.
Last week Honda said it and GM would develop a series of lower-priced electric vehicles based on a new joint platform, expanding on plans for GM to begin building two electric SUVs for Honda starting in 2024.
The push towards electric vehicles has prompted it to hunt for partners to optimise costs and share technology.
""This puts them in good company with a lot of other makers that have made big battery announcements ... ultimately the world is going to leave internal combustion engines behind,"" said Christopher Richter, an analyst at CLSA. 
""Given their size, I am glad they are cooperating with General Motors.""
The bulk of the 8-trillion-yen investment is earmarked for electrification and software technologies. That includes about 43 billion yen on a demonstration line for production of solid-state batteries, targeted to start in spring 2024.
HYBRID 'WEAPON'
Honda and other Japanese automakers have long said that even as they go electric, they will not give up on older, hybrid technology.
Proponents of hybrids point to the many markets, especially in emerging countries, where the infrastructure to support battery electric vehicles will be a long time coming.
""By no means is this the end of hybrids and the replacement of all hybrids with EVs,"" Mibe told the presentation.
""We will develop our current hybrids and use them as a weapon in our business.""
Honda's plan to make 2 million EVs annually was within expectations, said analyst Seiji Sugiura of Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
This is because  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has already targeted sales of 3.5 million such vehicles by 2030 and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co has aims for half its cars to be electric by the end of the decade. 
Just a year into the job, Honda boss Mibe has already made a number of bold pronouncements.
In March, the company said it would team with Sony Corp (T:6758) to develop and sell electric vehicles, aiming to start selling the first model in 2025.
Last year he unveiled a 2040 target for electric and fuel cell vehicles to make up all of global sales. 

Shares of Honda finished down 0.2% on Tuesday, outperforming the Nikkei 225 index, which fell 1.8%.

(Reuters) - Franchise Group (NASDAQ:FRG) Inc, owner and operator of retail stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Buddy's Home Furnishings, has entered the race for Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) with a $9 billion indicative offer, three people familiar with the matter said. 
Franchise Group has informed Kohl's it would be willing to pay $69 per share to acquire the department store retail chain, subject to due diligence, the sources said.
Franchise Group's bid is not the highest offer, however. Luxury department store operator Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Company has indicated it is willing to pay at least $70 per share for Kohl's, the sources said. Kohl's shares ended trading on Monday at $57.24.
The sources declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
Still, Franchise Group's entry in the process gives Kohl's more options as it explores a sale under pressure from activist hedge funds. The buyer will have to secure committed financing to assume Kohl's debt pile, which totaled $6.8 billion at the end of 2021, including operating leases.
Franchise Group has a market value of $1.6 billion and carried long-term debt of $1.9 billion as of the end of December. Its ability to carry out the deal would largely depend on the backing of Vintage Capital Management LLC, an investment firm run by retail investing veteran Brian Kahn. Vintage owned a 12.3% stake in Franchise Group as of December and Kahn was its chief executive.
A consortium backed by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, which includes Authentic Brands, has also made a bid for Kohl's, the sources said.
Private equity firm Sycamore Partners and a group that includes Acacia Research Corp, a holding company for business controlled by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, made offers for Kohl's during the first round of bidding, the sources said. It is unclear whether these parties remain in the process. 
Representatives for Franchise Group, Hudson's Bay, Leonard Green, Sycamore and Acacia did not respond to requests for comment. 
A representative for Kohl's could not be reached for comment.
Kohl's, which operates more than 1,100 stores in the United States, is fighting to fend off a board challenge even as it considers selling itself. Hedge fund Macellum Advisors GP in February nominated 10 directors to the company's 14-member board, arguing it has not done enough to improve its business and that it should sell itself.

Last week, Macellum urged the company to be more open about the sales process and give bidders and shareholders a fuller financial picture of itself. 
In response, Kohl's said it is thoughtfully and thoroughly evaluating proposals. Its investment bankers had held conversations with more than 20 potential buyers, the company has disclosed.

The three key takeaways from the report are:
1) Retail GPU pricing has indeed collapsed, as the markup over MSRP has fallen from +77% to +41% QOQ;
2) ODM builds and discussions with the channel indicate a potential slowing in demand, although likely exacerbated by Chinese COVID shutdowns; and
3) Intel’s Alder Lake gained share in the quarter, as the more competitive CPU and aggressive pricing appear to be slowing AMD’s share gain trajectory.

PUNE, India (Reuters) -Germany's Mercedes-Benz is betting that an expanding pool of young new millionaires will drive demand for luxury cars in India, creating faster sales growth than for mass market cars, a top company official said.
India's increasing numbers of ""dollar millionaires"" include young entrepreneurs or high-earning professionals who appreciate the luxury element and technology of the cars, said Martin Schwenk, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz India. 
""The base is getting broader and gradually moving beyond our traditional customers,"" Schwenk told Reuters in a recent interview in the western industrial city of Pune, home to Mercedes' India headquarters and manufacturing plant.
""Going forward we will see higher growth rates in the luxury segment than we see in the mass market,"" he said, adding that buyers' average age had also fallen below 40, from more than 45 earlier.
Mercedes is the top-selling luxury car brand in India, with a market share of more than 40%, says auto market data provider JATO Dynamics, and it competes with Audi, BMW and  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM)' Jaguar Land Rover.
Global carmakers' biggest growth hurdle is a shortage of semiconductors and logistics woes worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For Mercedes India, this has led to an order backlog of 4,000 cars and wait times of more than six months in some cases, Schwenk said.
""We have very good sales momentum, the concerns are on the supply side. You have congestion at the ports that cause really significant delays and that is hampering our output,"" he said. 
India's start-up frenzy and stock market boom are creating a new breed of wealthy splurgers on luxury brands such as Rolex, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, the 2021 Hurun India Wealth Report showed.
The number of Indian households with a net worth of at least a million dollars grew 11% in 2021 to 458,000 and is expected to increase by 30% over the next five years, the report said. 
India is largely a small and low-cost car market in which luxury models account for just over 1% of total annual sales of about 3 million. 
Mercedes' India sales rose more than 40% to 11,242 cars in 2021, coming off a low of 7,893 during the pandemic-hit year of 2020.
But the carmaker saw growth of 80% in top-end models such as the GLS, S-Class and GLS Maybach, all cars costing more than 10 million rupees ($131,337).
Schwenk said while the pandemic had driven some of this demand, as more people ""spent for their own pleasure"", India's luxury car market showed potential for higher growth, a feature missing over the last six to eight years.
To capitalise on the momentum, the company plans to launch 10 models in 2022, including its locally assembled electric sedan EQS.
While growth in India's luxury and mass markets are not directly comparable, Mercedes' high-end models doing well reflects the wealth of the nation, said Ravi Bhatia, president for India at JATO.
""The rich have become richer and some of them have ended up upgrading their lifestyle,"" Bhatia said. 
JATO's analysis also showed that Mercedes' product mix and pricing led to a lower average weighted price of its cars, putting upgrades to the luxury segment within reach of more customers, he added.

Mercedes' sales in India in 2021, however, were still lower than its peak of more than 15,500 cars in 2018. Schwenk said sales could approach 2018 levels this year if there were no further supply chain disruptions because of COVID or geopolitical issues.
Lowering Indian taxes on luxury cars, which he said were among the highest in the world, would also help grow the segment and benefit the car market.

As a result, the analyst downgraded the industry view to Cautious.
“While Q4 earnings and TMT presented a more optimistic outlook that supported this take, we are now starting to see signs of weakness accumulate, in particular, a more cautious flash survey on hardware, and most notably, reseller checks noting softer 2H pipelines. Resellers have been noting in recent checks that a combination of 1) Ukraine conflict, 2) higher underlying costs of doing business and 3) strong IT spending over the last year are making customers more weary on larger capex orders, causing smaller 2H pipelines to build than expected,” Marshall said in a client note.
Moreover, Marshall downgraded shares of F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) to Equal Weight from Overweight with price targets of $250.00 and $91.00, respectively.
“We believe that over a multi-year period, FFIV and NTAP will still likely outperform the market and their respective networking and storage comps. However, with ~25% of FFIV's business still being hardware driven, a more difficult 2H FY setup and weakening macro demand data points, we think it will be more difficult to focus attention in the NT on the software story, particularly with 35-40% software growth targets already established,” Marshall added.
The analyst also downgraded Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) from Equal Weight to Underweight with a price target of $15.00 per share, down from $17.00.
“While valuation of HPE is not challenging at 7.5x 22e P/E and 11x 22e P/FCF, and cash balance provides meaningful optionality, a combination of weak CIO data, VAR commentary, exposure to servers / storage (60% of revenue) with less backlog buffer, and European concentration (37%), we expect the stock to underperform over the next 12 months,” Marshall concluded.

(Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would buy cobalt from miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) PLC to use in its electric vehicles (EVs), as automakers around the world scramble to stock up on the critical raw material amid supply chain disruptions.
Global automakers, ranging from EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), are splurging billions of dollars on developing vehicles for a market that could be worth $5 trillion over the next decade.
However, metals to make batteries that last longer hard to come by due to supply chain disruptions, which has led to automakers rushing to secure supplies of lithium, nickel and cobalt.
The prices of these rare metals have soared to multi-year highs. 
Cobalt, a metal that makes up 0.001% of the earth's crust, ensures cathodes do not easily overheat or catch fire and helps extend the life of batteries, which automakers usually guarantee for eight to 10 years.
The cobalt, secured from Glencore's Murrin Murrin operation in Australia, will be used in GM's Ultium battery cathodes, which powers the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq vehicles, the companies said in a joint statement https:// They did not disclose the size of the deal. GM, which has laid out plans to ramp up capacity to build one million EVs in North America by the end of 2025, also has an agreement with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co to develop a supply chain of rare earth and other materials. 
It had also announced it would invest in a U.S. lithium project last year, which could become the country's largest by 2024. Rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it had signed a preliminary deal to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina.

334,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:59AM ET</span>",,,"Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya has reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and a Top Pick designation after shares extended losses yesterday.
Nvidia stock price closed 5.2% lower yesterday, fueled by a Baird downgrade call. This way, Nvidia shares are down roughly 25% in the last 2 weeks.
However, Arya believes that selling is likely done. He also addressed investor key concerns that facilitated a sharp drop in Nvidia stock recently.
“The key concern relates to NVDA’s gaming business (44% of sales) that could face weaker demand from customers in Europe (Russia turmoil), China (lockdowns) and crypto mining (Ethereum price declines, change to proof-of-stake which does not require graphics cards). We flag these headwinds, but argue investors could be underappreciating other supportive trends including: (1) strength in data center, pro-viz and 2H autos ramp; (2) upcoming new Hopper-based gaming product cycle in 2H; (3) low gaming channel inventory so any end- user slowdown could be used by channel to restock inventory,” Arya said in a client note.
When it comes to a slowing demand in the PC gaming market, the analyst acknowledged headwinds related to Europe, China, and Ethereum. However, these headwinds imply “only a 7-9% EPS impact to FY23/FY24E (roughly CY22/23E) pf-EPS.”
On the other hand, the analyst sees a greater upside potential as “incremental capacity can be directed to the more profitable (data center, pro-viz) parts of NVDA’s business.”
With these headwinds mostly priced in NVDA stock, Arya continues to advocate for a recovery in shares.
“We continue to see NVDA as one of the most important growth companies in semis, perhaps in tech given its ability to grow sales in high entry-barrier computing markets at a 20-25% CAGR (3x semis industry growth), while maintaining industry leading 45%+ EBIT mgns. Balance sheet is solid, and the company is just starting to embark on large new metaverse, enterprise AI and software opptys. Rising interest rates bring the trading multiples under scrutiny, but we assume that volatility should be reflected in the market over the next few weeks, helping to drive a recovery in NVDA stock,” he concluded.

336,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY)'s plan to focus on the development of electric aero engines and greener fuel options raises doubts over the prospects of its mainstay civil aviation business, J.P.Morgan said in a note on Tuesday.
Lowering the stock to ""underweight"" from ""equal-weight"" in its first rating change since March last year, the U.S. bank said Rolls-Royce's move implied weak confidence in the company's biggest unit and could raise execution risks in the coming years.
The warning sent the British aero-engine maker's stock tumbling 5% to its lowest in a month, piling pressure on a company whose shares have already lost a quarter of their value this year.
After being floored by the COVID-driven collapse in air travel in 2020, Rolls-Royce has tried to repair its balance sheet by cutting more than 1 billion pounds ($1.30 billion) in costs and said recently that it expected to be modestly cash flow positive for 2022 as airline customers fly again.
The company has also sharpened its focus on developing less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen-powered engine options, which could eventually replace traditional engines. 
Those efforts have, however, met with some scepticism. 
""Most aviation experts believe it will not be possible to have a large commercial aircraft that is powered electrically, at least for many decades to come,"" J.P.Morgan analyst David Perry said.
The greener engine options belong to the ""New Markets"" reporting segment that also includes a project to build the company's small modular reactors unit, which could eventually replace sustainable aviation fuel. The project has been backed by Qatar and Britain.

Perry's ""sell"" recommendation on Rolls-Royce is echoed by 4 other analysts, while 10 brokerages have a neutral rating on the company, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Haas also reminded investors that BBBY stock is one of the top Underperform ideas for 2022 at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as the company continues to lose market share to rivals.
“BBBY’s 4Q comp guidance of down high single digits implies comps down roughly 10% on a 3-year basis vs. +23% 3-year home furnishings industry growth per the US Census. BBBY has been losing share for years as consumers have increasingly consolidated purchases at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other mass retailers. The share losses accelerated further following a turnaround strategy which included coupon reductions and private label expansion. We think mgmt. moved too quickly, core customers were lost and now more sharp promotions are being used to recuperate sales including 20% off entire orders, free same day shipping ($10 value) and $10 gift cards for $50 spent,” Haas said in a client note.
The analyst is especially vocal about BBBY’s decision to introduce a $1 billion stock buyback program, which has “materially worsened” the balance sheet.
“This will make completion of BBBY’s turnaround more difficult, as there is much heavy lifting still ahead including standing up a distribution center network and implementing modern IT systems. BBBY has cut capex plans this year from $400mn+ to $350mn. BBBY has also opened one buybuy BABY (“BABY”) store as of 3Q21 despite plans to open 50 from ’21-23. BBBY’s turnaround could work, but will take many years in our view, and activist investor, RC Ventures, who recently obtained three board seats is already advocating for a strategic change,” Haas added.
Finally, the analyst has reflected on BBBY stock price which trades over 100% higher compared to his price target of $9.50. Haas adds that BBBY shares are “disconnected from the fair value” after Ryan Cohen, co-founder of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), got involved.
“Retail investors are looking for a short squeeze following the sale of BABY which Cohen believes is worth “several billion.” We value BABY at just over $500mn. The company may announce a new buyback authorization with earnings, but it could be hard to complete with less cash on the balance sheet and our expectation for negative free cash flow over the next several years. The fiscal year has likely started off weak; we expect a “hockey stick” guide,” the analyst concluded.

The person confirming the name spoke on condition of anonymity.
Deutsche Bank shares were down 8.8% and Commerzbank had lost 8% by mid-afternoon in Frankfurt.
A statement from Deutsche Bank said that it remained ""confident"" in its strategy.

Twitter was so confident about Musk joining the board that it even listed the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO as a board member on its investor relations webpage.
Furthermore, Agrawal said he will arrange a Q&A session with Musk and Twitter employees this week after some of them were concerned about Musk’s addition to the board.

Some Twitter employees said their colleagues are feeling super stressed and are “working together to help each other get through the week.”
Musk’s decision not to join the board frees him from restrictions on how many Twitter shares he can purchase and allows him to continue criticizing the company in his tweets.

""This is the first time the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) Importers (GIIGNL) has issued such an urgent message, underlining the sense of crisis,"" Michiaki Hirose, GIIGNL's vice president for Asia told reporters on Tuesday.
The Paris-based group, whose members account for more than 90% of global LNG trade, issued a statement a day earlier after a meeting of its executive committee, saying governments should provide protection mechanisms to reduce the exposure of LNG importers and consumers to potential procurement cost increases.
It also said governments should encourage technological development and LNG contracts through policy and financial support to underpin final investment decisions in the LNG value chain.
""In the midst of the current global energy crisis, the stabilisation of LNG trade is a matter of urgency,"" said Hirose, who is also Chairman of Tokyo Gas Co Ltd.
Japan, the world's second-biggest LNG buyer after China, should consider boosting the capacity of LNG storage tanks and tankers, Hirose said.
""Holding LNG reserves has been a taboo subject as it is physically and technically difficult to store...But some measures similar to national petroleum reserves may be needed,"" he said.
Unlike some European countries that can store months of natural gas supplies in underground salt caverns or depleted gas fields, Japan can only store around three weeks of its LNG requirement in superchilled storage above ground near import terminals.

Cooperation among LNG buyers within Japan and each region are also key in the event of any supply disruption, Hirose said.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) -European perfume- and cosmetics-makers face shortages of paper, glass, and some key oils and alcohols, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds further disruptions to the supply chains for beauty products, driving prices higher amid robust demand.
Like the food industry, the $500 billion global cosmetics sector is grappling with fallout from the war because producers use alcohol derived from grains and organic beets to make perfumes, and sunflower-seed oils to make cosmetics - all key crops from Ukraine.
At the same time, the energy crisis sparked by the war has pushed glass and paper prices through the roof, while China's COVID-19 lockdowns have thwarted companies' ability to obtain packaging components for $100-a-bottle scents and $30 lipsticks. 
""We're in crisis management mode when it comes to these subjects of sourcing,"" Emmanuel Guichard, secretary general of French cosmetics association FEBEA, told Reuters in an interview. 
Consultancy firm Bain & Company calculates higher prices for packaging, energy and raw materials have driven up production costs in the cosmetics industry on average by 25%-30%, posing a challenge to mass cosmetics producers, though demand for personal care products remains strong, according to partner and EMEA luxury practice leader Federica Levato.  
Italian fragrance manufacturer ICR expects sales this year to surpass pre-COVID levels, but the family-owned maker of Bulgari and Salvatore Ferragamo perfumes is wrestling with a yearly 30% spike in the cost of alcohol, on top of a 10% rise in the cost of glass and paper, Vice President Ambra Martone said. 
Sales of beauty products globally are seen topping the 2019 level of $538 billion this year, up from $518 billion in 2021 and $458 billion in 2020, a McKinsey report showed.
That is still a fraction of other industries that have been disrupted by the war, including the global packaged food industry, which is forecast to be worth over $2 trillion this year, according to the latest estimates from Euromonitor. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused turmoil in markets for staple grains and edible oils, pushing world food prices to new highs.
While larger companies with higher profit margins have more financial firepower and flexibility to cope - L'Oreal's luxury division, which sells Giorgio Armani and Valentino branded makeup and perfume, for example, has an operating margin of 22.8% - the challenge is particularly acute for small- and medium-sized companies in Europe. 
""We face scarcity and price increases every step of the way: from essences and alcohol to glass and paper - even for spray dispenser pumps and Surlyn plastic used for caps,"" said Marco Vidal, managing director of Venetian fragrance manufacturer Mavive, owner of the Merchant of Venice brand. 
The challenges are flaring up as consumers continue snapping up higher-priced beauty products, including perfumes made with a stronger concentration of oils and more unusual raw ingredients.
Sales of fragrances have been rising steadily over the past three years, and were up by 15% in 2021 in the United States, with perfumes priced at more than $175 a bottle more than doubling in unit sales, according to the latest data from NPD Group. 
""It's a disaster, and you just can't find glass,"" said Alba Chiara De Vitis, founder of Florence-based Alchemia Essenze whose fragrances sell for up to 180 euros ($196) a bottle.
European cosmetic makers, which exported 22.6 billion euros ($24.6 billion) of goods in 2020 according to industry association Cosmetics Europe, found competing demand for packaging materials after the coronavirus pandemic which has boosted e-commerce, driving paper consumption amid efforts to reduce use of plastic.
Glass makers, on their part, have struggled to cope with demand for vaccine vials after scaling down production in the early stages of the pandemic, turning off furnaces in Italy for the first time in decades.
Now gas prices are exacerbating problems for both industries, forcing paper mills in Italy to temporarily halt production to renegotiate selling prices.
A doubling in the cost of paper it uses to make rigid luxury boxes for clients including Dolce & Gabbana, Ferragamo and Givenchy has led Italy's Isem Group to hike the price of its products of between 10% and 40%, CEO Francesco Pintucci told Reuters.
Italian glass-maker Bormioli Luigi, which makes bottles for spirits, perfumes and cosmetics with yearly revenue of 480 million euros, expects 80 million euros in extra energy costs this year, half of which borne by its beauty division whose clients include French brands Chanel and Dior, head of fragrances Simone Baratta told Reuters. 
""Before the war the cost of a flacon from distributors was 0.75-1.40 euros, now it's 1.00-1.50 euros,"" De Vitis said.
Glass makers in France, where larger cosmetics companies began placing orders months earlier than they had in the past, have struck a more reassuring note, said Guichard, who predicts they, too, will likely soon feel the pinch of the energy crisis.
""I think we'll have a hard time obtaining gas to make perfume bottles,"" he said, noting there wouldn't be enough time to convert gas-powered ovens to electric systems.  
Meanwhile, executives at Intercos, an Italian cosmetics supplier for brand names, which on Tuesday signed a five-year commercial deal with Dolce & Gabbana, said it had raised prices by around 5% in late 2021 and was considering a further hike in the summer. 

""In the luxury beauty sector, we expect that the consumers will carry the burden of these higher costs after a transition period that could last a few months,"" Levato said.

348,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:21AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Pegatron Corp, which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), said on Tuesday it had suspended operations at its Shanghai and Kunshan plants in China due to the government's strict COVID-19 protocols.
China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.
Global companies, from phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.
According to Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission, as of April 7 a total of 161 listed Taiwanese companies reported their operations in Shanghai and Kunshan have stopped, 41 of them make electronics.
""In the best-case scenario, complete resumption of production may not be possible until late April or early May,"" analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities said, adding that Apple could minimise the impact due to its strong supply chain and relationship with the Chinese government.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Staffing, logistics and transportation issues are forcing manufacturers to rely on available inventory, barely meeting the needs of production lines and exacerbating component mismatches, according to data provider TrendForce.
A surge in shipments and demand for materials after lockdowns are lifted could also gridlock customs authorities, causing potential delivery delays, according to the TrendForce report.
Demand for iPhones could also be hit as consumers divert funds from phones and gadgets to everyday essentials.
Pegatron said the resumption of work depended on the two plants being given clearance by the government.

The company said it will maintain close contact with customers and suppliers and ""actively cooperate"" with local governments to resume work as soon as possible.
The far larger Taiwanese firm Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, also assembles iPhones in China. Its operations in the southern city of Shenzhen were disrupted last month by a COVID-19 outbreak there.

349,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:09AM ET</span>",,,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, Apple Inc. has been at the forefront of multi-billion dollar stock repurchases among technology mega-caps. According to Citigroup Inc. analyst Jim Suva, it may be about to raise its game.
In a note published Tuesday, Suva estimated that the iPhone maker might announce a buyback of $80 billion to $90 billion, while also increasing its dividend by 5% to 10%. All eyes will be on its second-quarter results due after the closing bell on April 28.
With their coffers filling fast, companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). have been looking for ways to employ excess cash. Apple’s repurchases have totalled $274.5 billion, including $20.4 billion in the December quarter alone. Yet the company still has cash of more than $200 billion on the balance sheet, and with authorization to purchase up to $315 billion of stock, has scope to do a lot more.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have fared better than peers this year, falling 6.7% versus the 14% drop of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. That’s despite reports of production difficulties that Suva says “could provide a near-term stock pullback which we would use as a buying opportunity.”
According to the Citi analyst, the company’s current market value does not reflect potential new product category launches such as augmented reality/virtual reality headsets and the Apple car.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, with investors bracing for a key inflation report which could cement a rapid pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up just 3 points, largely flat, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.2%.
The main focus of Tuesday’s session is the latest consumer inflation release, due at 8:30 GMT (1230 GMT), which is widely expected to show price gains running at their hottest in four decades.
The March release is expected to show an annual gain of 8.4%, the highest level since December 1981, while the core number, which excludes food and energy prices, is seen up 6.6% on the year.
“We expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s price hike,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, as last month’s 7.9% figure didn’t include the majority of the jump in oil and gas costs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
This is the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting, when it is expected to raise rates by a half point, upping the pace of its tightening after the quarter-point move in March.
Also of interest will be comments from Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard later in the session, after she said last week the Fed could start reducing its balance sheet as soon as May at a rapid pace, while Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin is also set to speak. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield last traded at a yield of 2.80%, just off the 2.83% level seen earlier in the session, which is the highest level since December 2018, as investors positioned for the Fed to aggressively lift interest rates throughout the year.
In corporate news, CarMax (NYSE:KMX) is likely to be in focus, with its quarterly earnings coming at a time when the market for used cars is starting to show signs of softening.
Oil prices rose Tuesday, rebounding after recent losses after China eased some of its Covid-related lockdowns, lifting some of the worries about oil demand from the world’s largest importer.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will update its forecasts for global supply and demand in its monthly report later, the U.S. will release its Short-Term Energy Outlook, while the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly estimate for U.S. crude stocks.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.2% higher at $98.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 4.5% to $102.93. Both benchmarks dropped around 4% on Monday, after recording last week their second consecutive losing week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,955.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0866."
352,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 06:54AM ET</span>",,,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could announce an incremental stock buyback of $80-90 billion this month, according to Citi analyst Jim Suva.
Apple spent roughly $81 billion in the last 12 months on buying back its shares, Juva adds. Furthermore, the Cupertino-based titan could also raise its dividend by 5-10%, Citi analyst said.
As far as fundamentals are concerned, Suva sees several positive drivers for Apple‘s products and services.
“While supply chain headwinds are likely to linger, we see demand driven by mix shift away from lower priced Android phones towards more mid end and premium pricing products. We note recent media news of production cuts is nothing unusual at this point in the product cycle given Apple tends to overshoot on build estimates to ensure sufficient supply,” the Citi analyst wrote in a client note.
News concerning regulatory risks could eventually act as a “major overhang” on Apple shares, however, the analyst says this is a headline risk rather than a fundamental risk.
Still, he recognizes that Apple stock could correct lower on such headlines but these pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities.
The analyst also reflected on the recent media report that Apple is working on subscription offerings for its hardware products.
“Many technology companies are offering more as a service offerings rather than full purchase price. We believe at some point in the future Apple may do this with its Mac, iPads, Apple Watch, and other devices. This is not that dissimilar to the iPhone leasing program, but will make these other devices more affordable as they will not require the large upfront cash outlay,” Suva added.
Apple shares closed at $165.75 yesterday.

The sale reportedly includes 116 million shares of Deutsche Bank and 72.5 million shares of Commerzbank, which translates to over 5% of the two banking giants.
Deutsche Bank said it feels “confident” about its strategy after its shares initially fell 9.5% before recovering.
“As we said during our investor day, we have had a promising start into the year and our objectives remain unchanged,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesperson.
According to Bloomberg data, only two investors have large enough stakes for a sale of this scale including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Capital Group. However, BlackRock is mainly a passive investor whose stake is related to Deutsche Bank’s membership in multiple stock indexes and cannot be sold as one.
Nigel Bolton, a co-chief-investment officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, said that traders should pay close attention to large investor flows.

Investors are particularly fearful of a downward revision cycle that may come after markets suffered three big shocks - rates, Ukraine, and commodities.

Our studies show that when fear is high, the S&P 500 tends to see elevated returns.

Still, Goldman Sachs expects stocks to finish this quarter over 6% higher and around 15% upside over the next 12 months.
“Our analysis of nine statistically significant flow variables suggests the S&P 500 should be 6% higher than current levels. Strong ETF flows have continued and incremental hedge fund flows have turned positive over the past two weeks,” Marshall added.
Goldman strategists picked 25 stocks that could outperform during the earnings season, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG).

PARIS (Reuters) - In the final hours of 2021 Airbus officially delivered two A350s to Russia's Aeroflot, helping the jetmaker meet annual delivery targets. Months later, the jets remain in French storage limbo after sanctions forced Airbus to abandon physical handover.
The setback sheds new light on workarounds used by the European planemaker under prevailing accounting rules to support deliveries during the pandemic, as well as the scramble to hit targets at the close of each year, industry sources said.
Airbus reached delivery targets during the crisis, in part due to auditor-approved deals that allowed carriers to delay accounting for some new planes on certain conditions.
The use of such acceptance and delivery agreements (ADA) to smooth deliveries was revealed by Reuters in July.
Industry sources say the system was used for as many as 10-15% of deliveries at the height of the pandemic as the world's largest planemaker fought to contain a drop in deliveries at a time of severe shock for the industry.
But the arrangement has fallen under the spotlight after sanctions against Russia interrupted the choreographed handover sequence. Airbus declined to comment on contractual details or on whether other ADA deals may be disrupted.
Even in ordinary times, a delivery spans 4-5 days of tests and paperwork, according to a recent Airbus filing. Last on the list before jets fly away is ""Transfer of Title"" or ownership.
Under the ADA agreements, the process can stretch out for months after deliveries are announced, the sources said.
Airlines must pay everything owed except for a token four-figure sum on a $50-150 million jet - enough to ring up a sale and record a delivery for Airbus auditors, but just short of the final tally needed to hand formal ownership to the airline.
The advantage for Airbus is that it is able to book the revenue due on delivery, while the airline can delay taking the jet for 3-6 months and pause costly charges like depreciation.
SANCTIONS IMPACT 
Airbus' auditors agreed during the crisis to book such transactions as revenue-earning deliveries strictly on the basis that there is an ""irrevocable commitment"" to transfer ownership at a specific date, three people familiar with the system said.
In the case of the two Aeroflot jets, war in Ukraine and swift European sanctions against Russia fell in the middle of this sequence, cutting away the certainty required by auditors.
On Friday, Airbus took the rare step of reversing the two deliveries that contributed to forecast-beating 2021 results and put aside money to be refunded whenever sanctions allow. The jets, stored in central France, are back on sale.
Some see the U-turn as a potential turning point as aviation switches focus from urgent crisis management towards recovery.
""With what happened to Aeroflot, auditors might start looking at the ADA process differently,"" an airline source said. 
An Airbus spokesperson said any policies were a matter for auditors EY, whose UK-based global office had no immediate comment. EY typically does not discuss individual cases. Airbus is due to hold its annual shareholder meeting later on Tuesday.
The episode also highlights longstanding internal pressure to avoid deliveries being skewed towards the end of the year.
While most Western businesses wind down on New Year's Eve, Airbus works flat-out to meet annual delivery targets after a summer break. That included Aeroflot's A350s booked on Dec. 31.
The chronic end-year pattern was already under internal review after Airbus signed a $175,000-a-day compensation clause to secure an A350 delivery to Qatar Airways exactly a year earlier on Dec 31, 2020, reflecting flaws on a separate jet. 
The agreement unlocked a crucial delivery as one year ended, but now stands at the centre of a $1-billion compensation battle with the airline over 23 jets with similar flaws.

The two sides disagree whether the clause applies but the potential impact of the last-minute deal could speed changes in the way end-year deliveries are managed, industry sources said.
The Airbus spokesperson said deliveries are agreed with customers, and peaks and troughs are normal throughout the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet said it was yet to see an easing of crew sickness that is causing it to cancel flights and disrupt the Easter plans of thousands of travellers, but it was confident it would be able to return to a near pre-pandemic schedule this summer.
The British low-cost carrier had no option but to preemptively cancel hundreds of flights in recent days as COVID-related crew absences reached 20% at some of its bases, Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters on Tuesday.
""You would expect that the spike that we're seeing in COVID infections that really exists here in the UK and also in parts of the network is going to come down, but this is something that we don't see yet,"" he said.
""And (until) that moment in time, we'll just continue to monitor the situation.""
The airline has flown 94% of its planned schedule in the last seven days, and Lundgren said daily cancellations were currently about 4% of flights, with the majority of customers able to rebook for the same day.
He said easyJet (LON:EZJ) was flying around a quarter of a million customers each day over Easter on up to 1,600 daily flights, the highest number operated since 2019.
The carrier expects to operate about 90% of its pre-pandemic schedule in the April-June quarter, Lundgren said, and to return to near-2019 levels this summer, for which it was seeing strong customer demand.
""We are not worried to that extent for the summer and the things that sit inside our control, we have the crew in place,"" he said. 
Lundgren said despite COVID-19 and rising fuel prices, easyJet had outperformed expectations in the six months to the end of March, and would report a loss before tax of between 535 million and 565 million pounds ($696 million-735 million) for the period.
For the same period last year the carrier reported a headline loss before tax of 701 million pounds. 

Shares in easyJet, which have fallen 31% in the last 12 months, were trading down 1.5% in early deals.

Investing.com --Deliveroo (LON:ROO) shares fell 2.6% by mid-morning in London on Tuesday, after the food delivery company warned of a tough year ahead. 
Deliveroo said that its gross transaction value rose by 11% on the year in the first quarter, on a 16% rise in orders. That was against a tough comparison quarter, given that the first quarter of 2021 saw lengthy lockdowns in all of its major markets, boosting the demand for food delivery.
However, the company's more recent momentum appears to have weakened as lockdowns have eased and restaurants have reopened. The number of monthly average users of its service flatlined from the final quarter of 2021 in the U.K. and Ireland, which account for over half of sales, and the company only posted a minimal increase of 100,000 in the rest of Europe. 
Deliveroo repeated the guidance that it gave last month, in expecting gross transaction value to grow by between 15% and 25% this year, adjusted for foreign exchange swings. It still remains far from profitability, however, in a marketplace where it has to compete with the likes of Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) and, increasingly, Just Eat Takeaway. The company expects its adjusted EBITDA this year to be negative, at between 1.5% and 1.8% of GTV. 
The company said its retention rate for its couriers had been ""robust"" in the first quarter, despite a cost-of-living squeeze that is forcing companies to pay higher wages. Deliveroo didn't break out its staff costs but U.K. data released earlier on Tuesday showed that average earnings including bonuses rose 5.4% on the year in February. Food price inflation, meanwhile, hit 5.1% on the year in March. 
Deliveroo shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value since listing in London last year, as investors have turned skeptical about its path to profitability. The stock is currently only 7% above the all-time low it hit in March. ",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) -Optimism among fund managers over global economic growth has hit an all-time low while concerns of possible stagflation have risen to the highest since August 2008, a monthly survey by investment bank BoFA Securities showed on Tuesday.
The survey, which took the views of firms managing a total of more than $833 billion, is one of the biggest regular tests of fund manager views and comes as inflationary pressures rise even as the risk of recession increases in major economies.
Asked about their expectations for global growth in the coming months, a net 71% of survey respondents were pessimistic about prospects, the most since the survey records began in the early 1990s. 
The European edition of the survey found investors continuing to cut their European growth projections, with a net 81% of survey respondents expecting the region's economy to weaken over the coming year compared with 69% in the March edition. 
Though fund manager holdings of cash - traditionally an indicator of investor caution - eased to 5.5% in the April edition of the survey from 5.9% in the previous month, prospects of a global recession remain the top ""tail risk"" for global markets, the survey found. 
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has receded to fourth place, after aggressive central bank interest rate actions and inflation.
Allocations to commodities jumped to a record 38%, with investments into oil and commodities zipping up the charts to become the top most ""crowded trade"". 
Other ""long"" positions were in resources stocks and healthcare, while ""short"" bets - by investors expecting a decline in prices - were evident in bonds and cyclical stocks whose performance is most linked to economic growth, BoFA said.
Participants in the survey expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by as many as seven times in the current cycle, compared with four times in the previous edition, with a majority of investors expecting inflation to soften over the next 12 months.
Global profit expectations deteriorated to their weakest levels since March 2020, BoFA said.
In terms of regional stock market allocations, investors were most bullish on U.S. equities, while European and UK equities were the top bearish bets.
Despite the growing recession concerns, a majority of survey respondents expect European equities to mark new highs in the currency economic cycle, with less than 30% of survey respondents expecting market weakness.

The UK remains the favourite equity market in Europe, while Germany and Italy are the least preferred, the European edition of the survey said. 
The survey was conducted between April 1 and April 7.

Bosch said it had paused production at a Thermotechnology factory in Shanghai and an automotive components site in Changchun in northeastern Jilin province. 
Two other auto parts plants in Shanghai and neighbouring Taicang city are maintaining ""closed-loop"" operations, in which workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of society to prevent virus transmission, the manufacturer said.
""We are currently seeing temporarily effects on logistics and supply chain sourcing,"" Bosch said in a statement. ""In this situation, we are doing everything we can to maintain the supply chains as much as possible and to serve the demands.""
China has imposed strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, including in Jilin province and Shanghai.

Auto sales plunged in March as the country's curbs to rein in COVID-19 outbreaks took their toll, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota were among automakers feeling the impact of limits on production.
The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said on Monday it had sent a letter to the country's cabinet detailing how the country's COVID control measures had disrupted European companies and urged it to revise its policies, such as by allowing home quarantine for some COVID patients.

LONDON (Reuters) -Supply chain snags hammered first-half profit at ASOS (LON:ASOS) and the British online fashion retailer warned its expectations for a much better second half could be disrupted by surging inflation. 
Shares in the company, which sells fast-fashion aimed at 20-somethings, dropped as much as 6% in early Tuesday trading after it reported an 87% plunge in first-half adjusted earnings. 
However, they bounced back to last trade over 2% higher after it said stock levels - heavily affected in recent months by industry-wide supply chain problems - were much improved. 
ASOS, which had warned on full-year profits in October when parting ways with then CEO Nick Beighton, said it was sticking with its latest annual guidance - excluding the already-flagged impact of quitting Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. 
But it cautioned there was a greater risk to forecasting that normal as the full impact of recent inflationary pressure on consumers was yet to be felt.
Chief operating officer Mat Dunn said he expected analysts to trim about 14 million pounds ($18 million) from full-year profit guidance of 110-140 million pounds, to take account of the withdrawal from Russia. ASOS made an adjusted profit of 193.6 million pounds in its 2020-21 financial year.
The company said its forecasts reflected an improved stock profile, the easing of comparative growth rates, the return of event and holiday-led demand, increased marketing investment and improved lead-times as supply chain pressures ease.
""We've opened the (spring/summer) season with a very good level of stock,"" Dunn told Reuters.
""There is some uncertainty around (supply from) China, but we're in a much better situation than we were at the start of autumn/winter.""
Dunn said ASOS had raised prices by a low to mid-single percentage in January, but not since.
""We're making sure that our value proposition is as attractive to customers as it can be and we've definitely absorbed some of the inflationary pressures in order to do that,"" he said.
Dunn said the process to recruit a new CEO was ongoing.

Adjusted profit before tax was 14.8 million pounds for the six months to Feb. 28, down from 112.9 million pounds a year earlier. Revenue was up 4% to 2.0 billion pounds.

(Reuters) - Britain's Deliveroo said on Tuesday that consumer spending could slow for the remainder of the year after the food delivery firm reported higher order values for the first quarter.
The warning comes as Europeans face a cost-of-living squeeze due to higher energy bills and soaring inflation, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 
The quarterly 12% growth in gross transaction value (GTV), the money value of all food orders on its platform, was higher compared to a year earlier, but shares fell 3% in early trading and analysts turned sceptical.
""For a growth company like Deliveroo, this (quarterly GTV growth) is not a stellar figure. Actually, it is a warning that the rest of the year is going to be quite volatile,"" said AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson.
During the peak of the pandemic last year, Deliveroo, which competes with the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Just Eat Takeaway, had enjoyed strong orders from people stuck indoors.
""Consumer behaviour may moderate during the year, and this is reflected in our guidance,"" Deliveroo Founder and Chief Executive Will Shu said even as the company stuck to its annual GTV growth of 15%-25% that it provided last month. 
""We remain confident in our ability to adapt financially to any further changes in the macroeconomic environment.""

Britain and Ireland account for nearly 54% of the company's overall GTV.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's finance minister will lobby for the country to be included in the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Capital International (MSCI) developed market index when he meets the index provider next week, he said on Tuesday. 
""Inclusion in the developed market index is necessary and already overdue,"" Hong Nam-ki said at a news conference with foreign media in Seoul. 
Hong said the won - currently at around 1,230 to the dollar - is at one of the weakest levels he has ever seen and that the government is ready to deploy market stabilizing measures if needed.
Asia's fourth largest economy is seeking inclusion on an MSCI watchlist by June. 
The absence of an offshore currency market for the won has been one of the main obstacles South Korea has faced in its efforts to be promoted from the MSCI emerging market index to the developed market. 
The outgoing finance minister said some of the measures on the table for discussion would be extending trading hours and allowing overseas FX dealers to participate in the market, but he did not provide further details when asked. 
Currently, onshore trading hours are 00:00 GMT to 06:30 GMT and only locally licensed financial institutions can participate.
Asked whether further opening up the USD/KRW spot market could increase volatility at a time when rising interest rates and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are adding to uncertainties, Hong said those are obstacles the country needs to cope with. 

""There are concerns over opening up the FX market for 24 hours, but we will have to bear what we have to,"" Hong added. 
The won's one-month contract jumped to as high as 1,227.4 per dollar in non-deliverable forward (NDF) trading immediately after Hong's comments were released at 0630 GMT, strengthening 0.72% from its onshore spot market close of 1,236.2.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global index-tracking fund managers with exposure to U.S.-listed Chinese firms are pushing index providers to swap into their Hong Kong-traded peers as delisting risks threaten to roil the $37 billion market for China-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Washington is demanding complete access to the audit papers of these firms, a request so far denied by Beijing. Without a solution, Chinese American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) will be delisted by 2024, potentially bashing ETFs with big ADR exposure. 
""We have proactively engaged all of our index providers on the risks associated with ADR delisting,"" said Brendan Ahern, CIO of Krane Funds Advisors, which manages China-focused ETFs based on CSI and MSCI indices.
""Passive ETF managers will want their index providers to transition from ADRs to the HK share classes in order to avoid tracking error,"" he said, referring to the unwelcome performance difference between an ETF and the index it tracks. 
""Index providers are moving at varying speeds,"" he added.
ETF managers including CSOP Asset Management and Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management said they have also nudged their index providers to swap Chinese ADRs into Hong Kong-traded peers, where available.
Some smaller index companies, such as China Securities Index Co, said they have started the switching but the likes of S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI are more cautious, citing the need for further clarity around Sino-U.S. audit talks, and concerns over relatively low liquidity levels in Hong Kong. 
Also, many active fund managers, unfettered by index-tracking needs, have already dumped ADRs, or made the transition to Hong Kong shares.
TRACKING ERRORS
ADR exposure of the S&P New China Sector Index ETF, run by CSOP, has decreased to 6% from over 30% a year ago after discussions between the Hong Kong-based asset manager and its index provider, portfolio manager Wang Yi said.
Last month, Chinese index publisher China Securities Index started prioritising inclusion of Hong Kong-listed stocks for its CSI Overseas China Internet Index, when a company has multiple listings eligible for selection. 
The index is tracked by a $6 billion ETF run by KraneShares and many other index funds.
Others are also holding out.
Earlier this month, China proposed rules that would potentially give U.S. regulators access to Chinese companies' audit working papers, as Beijing seeks to reach a deal to keep Chinese ADRs listed.
Mike Shiao, Invesco's chief investment officer, Asia ex-Japan, said the overhang on U.S.-listed Chinese companies was ""partially"" removed, but Invesco, which runs an ETF heavily invested in ADRs, would continue to monitor the U.S. response.
S&P Dow Jones declined comment on potential changes to methodologies, while MSCI and FTSE Russell also declined comment.

Underscoring some investors' impatience, the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF said last month that it aimed to fully transition to Hong Kong shares in coming months.
""Could an ETF convert without the index provider? Yes, though it would create tracking error,"" KraneShares' Ahern said. ""Obviously one would rather have tracking error versus holding a stock through a delisting,"" he said.

(Reuters) - South Korea's SK Group said on Tuesday it was mulling investments in small-sized nuclear reactors and that one of the candidates was TerraPower, a U.S. venture founded by Bill Gates.
A spokesperson for SK Inc, the holding company of the No. 3 conglomerate in South Korea, confirmed that TerraPower is a potential investment target among many but nothing had been decided, including details such as the possible investment amount, stake size or partners.
Founded by Bill Gates in 2006, TerraPower designs small modular reactors (SMR) and plans to build its first reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming by 2028. The $4 billion project is scheduled to begin in 2024, according to the company.

The interest in SMR and TerraPower comes after SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won last year pledged to cut 200 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions in 2030, which is roughly 1% of the global carbon elimination goal of 21 billion tons by 2030, according to SK Group.
President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol has pledged his support for nuclear power, which generated 27% of the nation's electricity as of 2021, signaling a grand U-turn from incumbent President Moon Jae-in's nuclear phase-out policy.

There it is: an admission from a central banker that rapid policy tightening may cause a hard landing for economic growth -- Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller described rate hikes as a ""blunt force"" tool that may act like a ""hammer"", causing collateral damage to the economy.
Well, markets at least have already been enduring the collateral damage. Global stocks are down 8.5% this year while Treasury 10-year yields are up around 130 basis points. Yields climbed on Tuesday to a new three-year high, while German 10-year borrowing costs are already at seven-year peaks.
The worst of the growth damage is still confined to Europe. Germany's ZEW investor confidence index due later in the day is projected to fall further, after last month posting the biggest monthly drop on record.
The hope now is that the threat of rate hikes and tighter financial conditions will start to put a lid on inflation. March U.S. consumer inflation is expected later on Tuesday at above 8 year-over-year, following a 7.9% reading for February. 
U.S. factory inflation, on Wednesday, is seen surging above 10%, though many reckon this could be the peak. In any case the data is likely to seal a 50 basis-point Fed rate hike next month. 
Inflation expectations rise https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/CONSUMER-EXPECTATIONS/gdpzyjgxevw/chart.png
Inflation pressures are everywhere, in fact, even in Japan which earlier in the day reported record wholesale price growth, while Britain's three-month jobless rate fell to 3.8% -- it last fell below that level in 1974.
Markets appear set for another brutal session -- European bourses are opening as much as 1% lower. 
Investors will keep a close watch on U.S. ""real"" interest rates; deeply negative rates have made stock market investments a no-brainer. Now though, real 10-year rates (after inflation is stripped out) are now steadily climbing toward 0%, a level last touched in 2020.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Tuesday, with investors cautious ahead of key central bank meetings, with inflation climbing sharply, while the ongoing Ukraine conflict looks likely to intensify.
By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.9% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.9%, while CAC 40 in France rose 1.9%.
The European Central Bank is set to hold its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday, and ahead of that German consumer price inflation rose 2.5% on the month in March, up a massive 7.3% on the year.
The U.S. inflation equivalent number is due later in the session, and investors are bracing for price gains running at their highest level in four decades. This will be the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting.
Elsewhere, data released earlier Monday showed the U.K. unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in February, dropping to its lowest level since 2019.
Also of interest later in the session will be the German ZEW economic sentiment index, which is expected to show a drop in confidence in the Eurozone’s largest economy in April, with the war in Ukraine weighing.
This conflict looks set to intensify, with Russia said to be amassing troops in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine for a new assault on the port of Mariupol.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is pulling out of the Russian market, its CEO told Reuters, going a step further than rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which said on Monday it was indefinitely suspending its business in the country. 
Hundreds of foreign companies are cutting ties with Russia following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and after Western sanctions against Moscow. 
While several sectors, including telecoms, have been exempted from some sanctions on humanitarian or related grounds, Nokia said it had decided that quitting Russia was the only option.
""We just simply do not see any possibilities to continue in the country under the current circumstances,"" CEO Pekka Lundmark said in an interview.
He added Nokia would continue to support customers during its exit, and it was not possible to say at this stage how long the withdrawal would take. 
Nokia is applying for the relevant licences to support customers in compliance with current sanctions, it said in a statement.
Both Nokia and Ericsson made a low single-digit percentage of sales in Russia, where Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) have a bigger share.
Nokia does not expect this decision to impact its 2022 outlook but said it would lead to a provision in the first quarter of about 100 million euros ($109 million).
Russia is also at loggerheads with Finland and Sweden, the home countries of Nokia and Ericsson respectively, over their interest in joining the NATO military alliance.
Russia had also been pushing for companies to start building networks using only Russian equipment, seeking to persuade Nokia and Ericsson to set up factories in the country.
Lundmark said Nokia would not implement a plan announced in November to set up a joint venture with Russia's YADRO to build 4G and 5G telecom base stations.
Nokia's decision to leave Russia will affect about 2,000 workers, and some of them might be offered work in other parts of the world, Lundmark said. 
Nokia has about 90,000 employees globally.

""A lot would have to change before it will be possible to consider again doing business in the country,"" Lundmark said.

Financial terms were not disclosed. 
While a tie up between the country's biggest food delivery service and its biggest grocer had seemed logical, Ahold also operates its own grocery delivery service, as well as e-commerce site Bol.com, which is more popular than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Netherlands.
The companies said the partnership will focus on a smaller range of around 1,200 products, with a focus on fresh produce and convenience products -- items that usually have higher margins.
""Fast grocery"" services such as Gorillas, Flink and Getir saw blistering growth in the Netherlands during the coronavirus pandemic.
However in recent months, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other major cities have imposed bans on new distribution centres, the ""dark stores"" they rely on, in residential areas.

Ahold and Takeaway said they would target a 30 minute delivery time for orders, slightly longer than the 10 or 15 minutes promised by some of the fast grocery startups.
Takeaway shares, which have lost two-thirds of their value since October 2020, were trading flat at 30.50 euros at 0709 GMT.

Investing.com -- EasyJet (LON:EZJ) said Tuesday it has experienced a ""strong, sustained recovery"" in bookings since the U.K. lifted its COVID-19 restrictions but still expects to have lost over half a billion pounds in the six months through March.
Europe's second biggest discount flyer said that bookings over the last six weeks have run ahead of the same period in 2019, the last comparable period before the outbreak of the pandemic and that it expects to fly at nearly 90% of its capacity over the current quarter and at close to its pre-pandemic capacity in the summer quarter.
The company was able to record a steady improvement in operations throughout the quarter as the wave of Omicron-variant COVID-19 swept through Europe before starting to ebb at the end of January. Load factor increased from 68% in January to 81% in both February and March.
The total number of passengers flown was over nine times the level of a year ago, at 11.545 million, while the company also succeeded in squeezing more revenue out of each booking by selling ancillary services such as vacations and car rentals. Ancillary revenue per seat sold rose to 19.56 pounds in the first half from 12.47 a year earlier.
Even so, the toll taken by COVID over the winter is high. The company said it expects a net loss for the first half of its fiscal year of between 535 million and 565 million pounds ($696 million-$736 million).
In contrast to rival Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ), EasyJet has no direct exposure to routes into and out of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. But while its exposure to that risk is minimal, it can't escape the problem of higher fuel costs that are affecting all airlines right now. 
The airline said it has hedged nearly two-thirds of its fuel requirements for the next six months at a price of around $571 a metric ton ($78.11 a barrel). That compares to a spot price for jet fuel of $1,100 currently. Crude oil has traded well above $100/barrel since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
However, it's hedging for the periods beyond September is much lower, at only 42% for the first half of fiscal 2023 and 15% for the second half. Since currently c.64% hedged for fuel in H2 of FY22 at c.US$571 per metric ton, c.42% hedged for H1 FY23 at c.US$654, and c.15% hedged for H2 FY23 at c.US$766.",,,,,

(Reuters) - Asian bonds witnessed their biggest monthly foreign outflow in two years last month, weighed down by a strengthening dollar and higher interest rates overseas, and analysts expect such selling to continue in coming months.
Overseas investors offloaded a combined net total of $7.87 billion in South Korean, Thai, Indian, Indonesian and Malaysian bonds last month, marking their first net selling since May 2020, data from regulatory authorities and bond market associations showed.

Eugene Leow, a strategist at DBS Bank, said an unrelenting rise in the dollar rates due to a restrictive Federal Reserve affected Asian bonds last month. 
""With U.S. rates no longer low in absolute terms, there are collateral damage to EM/Asia government bonds,"" he said.
The U.S. dollar index jumped 1.7% last month, posting its biggest gain in four months, on expectations of two half-point rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year. 
The Fed raised its interest rates for the first time in three years last month. 
Foreigners sold Indonesian bonds worth $3.37 billion and Thai bonds worth $3.08 billion last month.

Malaysian bonds and Indian bonds also faced outflows of $958 million and $741 million, respectively. 
Meanwhile, South Korean bonds saw inflows of $279 million, the lowest since December 2020.
South Korea has raised interest rates three times since August last year, and some analysts expect more such tightening measures from Asian central banks to counter foreign outflows this year. 
""With inflationary pressures rising due to elevated commodity prices, Asian central banks are increasingly mulling rate hikes,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ Bank. ""This, coupled with the Fed about to embark on quantitative tightening, will keep portfolio flows in the region volatile in the near term.""

The Taiwanese central bank's monetary policy will move in the direction of tightening this year, its governor said last month.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 2.9%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
Global stock markets have struggled of late on concerns that soaring inflation will cause central banks to tighten monetary policy sharply, weighing on economic growth.
The European Central Bank is set to hold its latest policy setting meeting on Thursday, and ahead of that German consumer price inflation came in earlier Tuesday at 2.5% on the month in March, up a massive 7.3% on the year.
The U.S. inflation equivalent number is due later in the session, and investors are bracing for price gains running at their highest level in four decades. This will be the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting.
Elsewhere, data released earlier Monday showed the U.K. unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in February, from 3.9% the previous month, while the claimant count in March dropped 46,900.
Also of interest later in the session will be the German ZEW economic sentiment index, which is expected to show a drop in confidence in the Eurozone’s largest economy in April, with the war in Ukraine weighing.
This conflict looks set to intensify, with Russia said to be amassing troops in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine for a new assault on the port of Mariupol. Capturing this city would allow Moscow to attempt to encircle the main Ukrainian force in the east.
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said, following talks in Moscow on Monday, that an offensive in the east was ""being prepared on a massive scale.""
The French market remains in a state of uncertainty with incumbent Emmanuel Macron set for a tight run-off against right-wing leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential elections.
Oil prices rose Monday, rebounding after recent losses after China eased some of its COVID-related lockdowns and OPEC warned it would be impossible for it to replace lost Russian supply.
The Chinese financial hub of Shanghai announced Monday the partial easing of lockdowns after some areas reported no new infections for 14 days, lifting some of the worries about oil demand from the world’s largest importer.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries warned that losses from Russian sources due to sanctions could be as much as seven million barrels per day, adding that the volume will be “impossible” to replace.
This follows a meeting between OPEC and European Union officials, with the EU currently drafting proposals for an oil embargo on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% higher at $96.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.1% to $100.59. Both benchmarks dropped around 4% on Monday, after recording last week their second consecutive losing week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,957.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0869."

The government will also facilitate corporate financing in COVID-hit areas and urge state shareholders of listed firms to actively buy undervalued stocks, the country's securities watchdog said in a statement on its website late on Monday. 
China's benchmark CSI300 index fell 3.1% on Monday, the biggest drop in a month, as a lockdown in Shanghai and other parts of the country threatens economic growth. 
The market dipped further on Tuesday morning to a near four-week low, bringing this year's loss to 17%, as investors appeared unmoved by the authorities' gesture.
Yuan Yuwei, hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management, said mobilising capital, especially public money, into Chinese stocks now doesn't make sense.
""There remain lots of structural bubbles and risks in this market, which also faces huge external uncertainty,"" he said, citing capital outflow risk, fallout from the Ukraine crisis, and rising geo-political tensions. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in Monday's statement that authorities will take steps to stabilise expectations of listed companies and investors. 
China will encourage social security funds, pension funds, insurers, trust firms and wealth management firms to allocate more money to equity assets, and invest more in quality listed companies, the CSRC added. 
The government will also improve the financing mechanism for private companies, and support corporate fundraising, acquisitions and restructurings in areas badly hit by COVID. 
BOOST CONFIDENCE
To boost investor confidence, CSRC said it will encourage listed firms to buy back their shares to stabilise prices. Major shareholders and senior executives are also encouraged to actively buy shares when prices fall sharply.
Meanwhile, state shareholders should actively buy undervalued stocks, and support share buy-back and cash dividend plans by listed firms, according to the statement, which was jointly published by the CSRC, China's state assets supervisor, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
China is also stepping up efforts to woo foreign investors, amid signs of capital outflows. 
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said late on Monday that it had held a virtual roadshow with nearly 200 representatives from global investors including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to promote index investments tracking China. 
The promotion came after Institute of International Finance (IIF) data showed outflows of $6.3 billion from China equities in March, and $11.2 billion out of China bonds.
""Investor sentiment toward Chinese equities remains negative amid elevated regulatory risk and concerns that the asset class provides limited hedge against stagflation risk,"" Manulife Investment Management said in a note on Tuesday.

The money manager expects slower growth in China, citing challenges including the rising economic costs of zero-COVID policies, which damp consumption.
Also citing the ""substantial"" costs of China's strategy to fight COVID, Nomura said late on Monday China is facing a rising risk of recession.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning and bonds extended a selloff, which left the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield at the highest since 2018. Investors continue to monitor high inflation, tighter monetary policy, and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.32% by 10:41 PM ET (2:41 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.93%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.58%, with the National Australia Bank business confidence index for March 2022 at 16.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.11%. The country approved the first batch of new video game licenses since July 2021.
U.S. Treasuries fell, with the 10-year yield at 2.80% and reflecting expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten its monetary policy at the fastest rate since 1994. Australian and New Zealand debt also fell.
Oil erased most of its gains sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and lockdowns in China are also impacting fuel demand. Investors also await the U.S. consumer price index, due later in the day.
“What we’re faced with this year is stagflation,” Bulltick LLC head of global macro research Kathryn Rooney Vera told Bloomberg.
“It’s a very complicated environment that the Fed has found itself in” and the market is pricing in potentially 50 basis points of interest rate hikes at each of the next two policy meetings, she added.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said an accelerated pace of rate hikes to combat inflation is worth debating. The central bank is doing all it can to avoid “collateral damage” from raising interest rates, a “brute-force tool” that can act as a “hammer” on the economy, Fed Governor Christopher Waller added.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin will speak later in the day, followed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker following on Thursday.
One of the more dangerous scenarios for markets “is that we have to raise rates at such a pace that it will clamp down on growth,” AlphaSimplex Group chief research strategist Kathryn Kaminski told Bloomberg.
“That’s the scenario that most people are worried about.”
Policy decisions from other central banks are due throughout the week, starting with the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Korea will follow a day later.
Meanwhile, the credit derivatives market ruled Russian Railways JSC to be in default after the company missed an interest payment in March. Russia also warned that it would take legal action should Western sanctions force it into a sovereign default.

The National Press and Publication Administration published a list of 45 domestic titles on its website late Monday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. While leaders Tencent and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. were noticeably absent from a lineup of mostly casual games, the long-awaited resumption in licensing quelled investors’ worst fears about Beijing’s intentions for the gaming sector, which had come under fire for encouraging addiction and undesirable behavior among youths.
Analysts expect Tencent and NetEase to eventually get games approved. During a previous major suspension in 2018, Tencent was also excluded from the first crop of licensed titles.
Tencent gained the most in about three weeks in Hong Kong on an intraday basis. Video and game streaming service Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. soared as much as 15%, while NetEase gained more than 6%. Video platform  DouYu International Holdings  (NASDAQ:DOYU) Ltd. rose 2.4% in U.S. trade.
“The resumption of game approval is a positive development to China’s games industry,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a note. It “will help boost investor confidence that the government remains supportive of cultural and innovative aspects of the games industry and could signal resumption of a more regular approval process.”

Beijing’s far-reaching tech crackdown -- which has ensnared sectors from e-commerce to fintech and even online education -- spread to online gaming in August, when regulators introduced stringent measures capping play time for minors and imposed new requirements aimed at curbing addiction. 
The media watchdog has also been reviewing new titles to determine whether they meet stricter criteria around content and child protection, an effort that’s slowed rollouts, Bloomberg News has reported.
The titles approved Monday were only from domestic companies, including a Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). game, XD Inc.’s “Flash Party” and iDreamSky Technology Holdings Ltd.’s “Watch Out For Candles.” The line-up also included 37 Interactive Entertainment and Youzu Interactive Co.
Of the 45 approved titles, five are for PC, one for the Nintendo  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) console, and the rest are mobile games. Many of them appear to be casual games with lower player spending.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk disclosed on Monday he had abandoned a plan to join  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s board just as his tenure was about to start, the latest move by the world's richest man that defied corporate America's norms.
Musk revealed last week he had accepted a board seat at Twitter, contradicting a regulatory filing he had published a day earlier in which he described himself as a passive investor.
Sources told Reuters at the time that Musk asked Twitter for a board seat weeks before the social media company agreed to the arrangement. 
Musk and Twitter did not disclose the reason for the u-turn. Musk said in a regulatory filing on Monday he could now increase his 9.1% stake in Twitter or push the company to pursue transactions, even though he has no such plans at this time. 
There was no sign that Twitter was worried that a hostile bid from Musk was imminent. In announcing the development, Twitter disclosed no shareholder rights plan, known as a ""poison pill,"" that would force dilution if Musk tried to raise his stake above a certain threshold.
However, Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal warned Twitter employees in a tweet on Sunday of ""distractions ahead,"" a possible reference to Musk's criticism of the company through tweets. He added that he believed Musk's withdrawal was ""for the best.""
A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Twitter shares were up 2.6% at $47.48 in afternoon trading in New York on Monday. They are up more than 20% since Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter on April 4. Wall Street analysts say Musk's involvement attracted legions of retail investors to the stock.
Securities experts have pointed out that by delaying and mischaracterizing the disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk bought the shares more cheaply, saving himself $143 million by one estimate. It is unclear whether this would be a consideration for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $274 billion.
Musk could not be reached for comment.
Musk deleted on Monday many of the tweets he posted over the weekend about the social media platform. It was not clear what prompted the move. The tweets ranged from a call to remove advertising on Twitter to dropping the letter ""w"" in the social media company's name.
Jacob Frenkel, a former enforcement attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said Musk's reversal was unconventional but did not appear to violate any rules.
""Merely being extended an offer to join the offer to board, contemplating doing so and deciding not to is not a violation of securities laws,"" said Frenkel.
A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.
Other experts pointed out that Musk's public criticism of Twitter would have been difficult to reconcile with his fiduciary duties as a board director.
""Once on the board, most people, including activist shareholders, traditionally don't talk publicly,"" said Gregory Taxin, managing director of activist investor advisory firm Spotlight Advisors.
'FUNDING SECURED'
It is not the first time that Musk performed a high-profile U-turn. In 2018, he tweeted that there was ""funding secured"" for a $72-billion deal to take Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private, but did not move ahead with an offer.
He and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors. Musk has since challenged an agreement he entered into with the SEC for some of his tweets to be vetted by a lawyer.
Securities experts have also questioned Musk's compliance with his arrangement with the SEC. In early November, Musk posted on Twitter that he would offload 10% of his Tesla stake if users approved. A majority did, and the poll sent Tesla shares into a slump. Musk has since sold $16.4 billion of Tesla stock.
News of Musk taking a board seat last week had some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media company's ability to moderate content, company sources told Reuters.
Charles Elson, founding director at the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, said Tesla, an electric car marker, and SpaceX, a space rocket developer, were already keeping Musk very busy, and he would have had little time to contribute to Twitter meaningfully as a board director.

""The shareholders of Tesla should be quite concerned about his involvement here because it simply takes time and energy away from his primary venture,"" Elson said.
A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) met on Monday to seek an end to a three-week-old strike by 500 workers at the company's Richmond, California, refinery, a union official said. 
B.K. White, first vice president of USW Local 12-5, said the union had received a proposal from the company and was preparing a reply.
Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich did not reply to a request for comment. 
Monday's meeting is the first face-to-face discussion between the two sides in two weeks.
Chevron has continued operating the 245,271-barrel-per-day (bpd) with managers and supervisors but has begun advertising for temporary replacement workers in ads placed online. 
The ads list pay of $70 an hour for the temporary replacement workers who will be hired for up to five months, according to the advertisements.
""Our personnel working onsite are being compensated appropriately for their time and expertise,"" Kruzich said prior to the meeting between the two sides. 
The national average pay for a union refinery worker after four years is about $45 an hour, the USW has said. 
""They are throwing money at the scabs trying to break our union,"" White said.

Retirees, former employees and recent graduate of process operations programs are among those usually recruited to be temporary replacement workers.
The strike began after the Local 12-5 twice rejected contract offers from Chevron.

The tools will be available initially to a handpicked set of users who are creating virtual classes, games and fashion accessories within the company's immersive platform, which is accessible via VR headsets, Meta said in a statement.
Using one tool, those select users will be able to sell their accessories or offer paid access to specialized digital spaces they have built, the company said.
The social media giant is also testing out a ""creator bonus"" program for a small set of Horizon Worlds users in the United States, through which it will pay participants each month for using new features the company launches.
""We want there to just be tons of awesome worlds, and in order for that to happen there needs to be a lot of creators who can support themselves and make this their job,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conversation with early adopters, held inside Horizon Worlds using avatars.
The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent company, which changed its name to Meta last year, has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality to reflect its new bet on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play. 

The company is competing with up-and-coming virtual world players where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold as non-fungible tokens, or blockchain-based virtual assets. The market for these assets exploded last year, with sales sometimes fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Meta's Horizon Worlds, an expansive VR social platform, and Horizon Venues, which is focused on virtual events, are early iterations of metaverse-like spaces.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -For the U.S. bond market, the first quarter was marked by historically high volatility and the poorest performance in decades. Hedge funds scored badly, and will be hoping for a better showing in the second quarter.
U.S. futures market positioning in the first week of the new quarter showed that funds generally got it right on the move up in short-dated rates and yields, but didn't anticipate the spike higher in the 10-year yield.
It was a mixed bag on the relative value trade between two- and 10-year Treasuries, the closely watched ""2s/10s"" yield curve. The curve flattening that funds positioned for came to pass, but only briefly.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed that funds cut their net short 10-year Treasuries position in the week to April 5 by 113,682 contracts to 362,875, and increased their net short position in two-year bonds to 72,194 contracts from 59,202.
That was essentially a bet on the 10-year yield falling, and the two-year yield rising. 
The 10-year yield rose to 2.55% from 2.40% in that week and has continued to soar, reaching a three-year high on Monday of 2.77%. The two-year cash yield jumped by around 30 basis points to 2.60% in the week to April 5. 
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
Taken together, these CFTC position shifts were a collective bet on a flatter ""2s/10s"" curve. The curve inverted by as much as 8 basis points on April 4 before rapidly steepening to +20 bps a few days later. 
Q1 CURVE TRADES CRUSHED 
Hedge funds often take long-term directional bets and thrive on the arbitrage opportunities created by rising volatility. While funds seemed to get it at least partially right as the second quarter started, with regard to their Treasuries bets, the first quarter was extremely challenging.
Industry data provider HFR said on Friday its Relative Value Fixed Income-Sovereign Index lost 2.66% in the first quarter, the worst performance for two years and a stark contrast to the 7.71% surge in its broader Macro Index.
Comparing the shifts in CFTC Treasuries futures positioning in the January-March period with moves in U.S. yields shows that funds got the directional bets on higher yields right, but were crushed on their curve trades.
Funds increased their 10-year bond net short position by almost 265,000 contracts and their two-year net short position by 147,000 contracts, effectively a bet that the 10-year yield would rise by more than the two-year yield.
The 10-year yield rose around 83 bps in the quarter, but the two-year yield surged 160 bps, the biggest quarterly rise in over 40 years. The curve flattened by 77 bps, the most since 2011.
The overwhelming consensus now is that the Fed is about to undertake the most aggressive policy tightening in decades via steep interest rate hikes and a rapid reduction of its balance sheet.
So where does the curve go from here? 
Analysts at Citi note a fairly substantial amount of easing is already priced into U.S. money markets from the expected peak in rates in the second half of next year, suggesting there may be limited room for the curve to flatten further. 
But analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) argue that an inverted yield curve ""is here to stay,"" without necessarily flagging recession ahead. 
If a clear trend emerges over the course of the quarter, funds will be hoping they are on the right side of it this time.

West Texas Intermediate futures rose around 1% to trade above $95 a barrel. Shanghai has eased lockdowns for some housing complexes, though authorities indicated they would reimpose restrictions if cases climb. The southern city of Guangzhou is also taking measures to prevent a flare-up. Oil has now almost given up all its gains since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The oil market has seen a tumultuous period of trading since late February, whipsawed by Russia’s invasion of its neighbor, rising tensions in the Middle East, the virus flare-up in China and tightening monetary policy. The war in Ukraine has entered its second month despite efforts to agree a cease-fire.
The invasion has fanned inflation and prompted the U.S. and its allies to release strategic reserves to tame rising energy prices. OPEC’s top diplomat, meanwhile, told European Union officials that the current crisis in global oil markets caused by Russia’s war is beyond the group’s control. 
Brent remains in a bullish backwardation structure -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- but it’s eased over the past week. The prompt timespread for the global benchmark was 21 cents a barrel in backwardation on Monday, compared with $1.53 a week ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett needed just two weeks to put together Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's $11.6 billion takeover of Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, its largest acquisition in six years, even as he balked at paying the insurer's banking fee, a regulatory filing on Monday shows.
Alleghany said its Chief Executive Officer Joseph Brandon met with Buffett for dinner in New York City on March 7, where after some ""casual conversation"" Buffett offered $850 per share in cash for the company, less the fee for bankers at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Five days later, Brandon and Alleghany Chairman Jefferson Kirby (NYSE:KEX) met Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, where Kirby asked Buffett to make a higher offer, pay Goldman's $27 million fee, or use Berkshire stock to fund part of the purchase.
""Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points,"" the filing said.
Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, ultimately agreed to pay $848.02 per share, with the $1.98 difference from $850 accounting for Goldman's fee.
The merger was announced on March 21. Alleghany got 25 days to potentially find a better offer. Goldman has since asked 31 potential bidders about their interest, the filing said. The ""go-shop"" period ends on April 14.
Brandon led Berkshire's General Re unit from 2001 to 2008.
Buffett, 91, has long objected to the costs of doing business on Wall Street.
He rarely uses investment banks at Berkshire, relying on 98-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for help in major capital decisions.
Buffett has praised former Goldman banker Byron Trott, working with him on purchases of food distributor McLane Co from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and a large stake in truck stop operator Pilot Flying J from the family of billionaire Jimmy Haslam.

The Alleghany purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals.
Berkshire's last major acquisition was the $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016.

""All eyes on an inflation number that’s probably going to be the highest in 40 years, which could prompt higher and more frequent (interest) rate hikes from the Fed,"" Tuz added.
The Labor Department's CPI report expected on Tuesday for any sign the inflation wave has crested. Analysts expect the report will show an 8.5% year-on-year growth in consumer prices, the hottest reading since 1981.
Ongoing geopolitical strife also helped prompt the flight to safety.
Ukraine said it expected Russia to launch a huge new offensive soon as the most serious conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s wore on, despite ongoing peace negotiations.

(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc supplied billions of opioid pills to drug addicts and criminals, contributing to an addiction epidemic in Florida, a lawyer for the state said on Monday in a civil trial against the pharmacy chain.
Walgreens filled one in four opioid prescriptions in Florida between 1999 and 2020, and failed to investigate red flags that could have prevented drugs from being diverted for illegal use, the state's lawyer Jim Webster said as jurors heard opening statements in the trial held in New Port Richey.
""Walgreens was the last line of defense in preventing improper distribution of opioids,"" Webster said. ""It was the entity that actually put the opioids in the hands of people addicted to opioids and the hands of criminals.""
Walgreens, which has denied the allegations, is the final remaining defendant in the trial taking place before Judge Kimberly Sharpe Byrd in Pasco County Circuit Court. 
Florida previously reached $878 million in settlements with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, Abbvie Inc's Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc. 
Steven Derringer, Walgreen's attorney, said in his opening statement that the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions from doctors and did not ignore red flags that allowed opioids to flood Florida.
""There are so many pills because doctors have written so many prescriptions for pain medicine,"" Derringer said.
Florida has spent more than $14 billion to address the opioid crisis in the state, and opioid overdoses have caused nearly 40,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, Webster told jurors. 
Walgreens deserves a ""huge chunk of the blame"" for overdose deaths and the state's increased spending, Webster said.
Derringer countered that others should be blamed for the state's opioid epidemic including drug manufacturers who lied to pharmacies about addiction risk, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials who approved the sale of opioids for chronic pain and doctors who wrote unnecessary prescriptions. 
Florida has collected more than $3 billion in opioid litigation against drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies, according to Attorney General Ashley Moody. Most will be spent on efforts to mitigate the opioid crisis in the state.
In March, Walgreens rival CVS Health Corp agreed to pay Florida $484 million. Drugmakers Teva will pay $194.8 million, Allergan will pay $134.2 million and Endo will pay $65 million.
Walgreens previously argued it was immune from being sued based on a mere $3,000 settlement it reached with Florida in 2012, following an investigation into its record-keeping policies and efforts to prevent the diversion of opioid drugs.

Byrd ruled in March that the 2012 settlement addressed only a single record-keeping violation and did not protect Walgreens from other claims. The company has appealed her ruling.
While a large portion of the more than 500,000 U.S. deaths from overdoses in the past two decades were caused by the powerful opioid fentanyl and other illicit drugs, overuse of prescription pain medicines put countless Americans on the path to addiction.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Sachem Head on Monday cut its slate of director nominees at US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Co to five from seven, backing away from plans to try and take control of the food distributor's board.
The hedge fund, US Foods' biggest shareholder with an 8.7% stake, announced the move in a regulatory filing less than two weeks after the company appointed two new independent directors to persuade investors it was pursuing the right strategy.
Sachem Head, which has been invested in US Foods since 2018, did not say which of its director nominees have been cut or which US Foods board members it hopes to replace with its own candidates at the annual meeting.
The hedge fund said it ""reevaluated"" the optimal number of directors it needs to nominate to push for the change it believes is needed for the company to ""begin to fulfill its potential."" Investors will vote for directors at the annual meeting on May 18 unless a settlement is reached beforehand.
The hedge fund's original nominees included Scott Ferguson, Sachem Head's portfolio manager, as well as former Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees and other executives with supply chain and food industry expertise.
Ferguson began pushing for changes last year and has said he believes the company is lagging peers and has not improved operations as promised.
The two sides have held discussions to try and resolve the boardroom battle, and Ferguson late last month made a settlement proposal that the company rejected, according to a regulatory filing made by the company on Monday.
Sachem Head offered to end the proxy contest in return for four board seats and a public announcement that US Foods was searching for a new chief executive officer or was exploring strategic alternatives, the company's filing said.
In early April, the company proposed handing two seats to Sachem Head, picking the directors from the hedge fund's slate. It also offered forming a committee to assess ways to boost the share price, and insisted on a standstill agreement. In an earlier effort to settle the matter, the company had already offered two seats, one to a Sachem Head nominee, and one to a director the two sides picked jointly while rejecting the possibility of adding Hees to the board. 
The company's share price closed up 2.30% at $36.05 on Monday.

(Reuters) -New York pension officials on Monday said they will support shareholder resolutions filed at major banks seeking quick cuts to financing of new fossil fuel development, pushing climate issues to the fore of another springtime shareholder meeting season.
Shareholders should support resolutions filed at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and four other banks ""in order to mitigate the systemic risks posed by unfettered climate change,"" according to a statement sent by a representative of New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees some $280 billion in retirement assets.
Backing from the third-largest U.S. public retirement system will boost prospects of the resolutions from green-minded investors including the Sierra Club Foundation and Trillium Asset Management. 
Effectively, the nonbinding proposals call for banks to end development of new fossil fuel projects in line with calls this year from global watchdog the International Energy Agency (IEA).
So far, banks have opposed the resolutions. In a securities filing Bank of America said its board ""believes the policy requested by the proposal is unnecessary in light of our commitment to financing a low-carbon environment, our robust risk management programs and policies, and our net zero commitment.""
Goldman Sachs said in another filing that given its investments in decarbonization and transition finance, its stakeholders ""are better served by our engagement, not our divestment.""

Influential proxy adviser Glass Lewis so far has recommended investors vote ""against"" the resolutions, saying the banks have been responsive to climate concerns. 
In another report Glass Lewis also wrote that expanded fossil fuel development is likely as result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Shareholders may be reluctant to limit Bank of America’s ability to participate in such projects in the current geopolitical context,"" Glass Lewis said.

(Reuters) - Daily Journal Corp, the publishing and software company where Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger helps oversee investments and until recently was chairman, on Monday said it halved its investment in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
In a regulatory filing, the Los Angeles-based company said it owned 300,000 of Alibaba's American depositary shares (""ADS"")worth $32.6 million as of March 31, down from 602,060 shares at the end of 2021.
The reduction essentially reversed Daily Journal's trading activity in last year's fourth quarter, when its Alibaba stake nearly doubled in size.
The price of Alibaba's ADS has fallen 15% this year, and 68% from its October 2020 peak.
Daily Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company publishes newspapers and provides software to courthouses.
Munger, 98, had been Daily Journal's chairman for 45 years before stepping down last month.
Daily Journal said he would remain a director and focus on matters he has worked on, including its securities portfolio. Munger is better known for his work at Berkshire, where he has been vice chairman since 1978 and helps the 91-year-old Buffett allocate capital.
Long bullish on China, Munger spearheaded Berkshire's approximately 7% stake in electric car maker BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF).
At Daily Journal's annual meeting in February, Munger lamented recent deterioration in relations between the United States and China.

""They should like us and we should like them,"" he said.
Most of the rest of Daily Journal's securities portfolio is in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which is also a major Berkshire investment, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.

(Reuters) -Private equity firm Thoma Bravo will acquire SailPoint Technologies for $6.12 billion, the cybersecurity firm said on Monday, in the latest deal that underscores the heightened interest in the security software market. 
In buying Austin, Texas-based SailPoint, Thoma Bravo will bolster its strength in the security-focused space, where it already has key investments in firms including Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) Inc, Barracuda Networks and Sophos. 
Shares of SailPoint, founded in 2005, closed at $64.05 on Monday, a 29% jump from Friday. 
Cybersecurity has been a hot sector for buyouts thanks to a COVID-19 pandemic-led shift to remote working as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has led to a spike in cyberattacks. Datto, a security solutions provider, has also been taken private in a $6.2 billion deal by investors led by Insight Partners on Monday. 
Thoma Bravo, which manages more than $103 billion in assets, was the majority stakeholder in SailPoint prior to its initial public offering in 2017. It exited from its position by the end of 2018. 
SailPoint shareholders will receive $65.25 per share in cash, the company said on Monday, representing a premium of 31.6% as of Friday close. Including debt, the deal is valued at about $6.9 billion. 
Sources said the deal could help SailPoint accelerate its transition to a software as a service (SaaS) model without the scrutiny of being a public company, and fund potential transformative acquisitions with the dry powder from Thoma Broavo. 
SailPoint's Chief Executive Officer Mark McClain said the go-private deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, would allow the company to pursue long-term growth with greater flexibility and expand their markets on the back of additional capital from the private equity firm.

""We're about 10% penetrated in our target market. We have a lot of room to grow in terms of what we add to our portfolio,"" McClain said. 
SailPoint specializes in software related to identity and access management that helps businesses mitigate unwanted user access and reduce the risk of sensitive data leakage. SailPoint shares had lost about 9.2% in 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell on Monday, pulled lower by technology shares in Europe and on Wall Street, as U.S. Treasury yields jumped ahead of inflation data that could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten policy enough to slow a rebounding economy.
The euro rose against the dollar to snap a seven-day losing streak as the single currency rallied after French leader Emmanuel Macron beat far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in France's first round of presidential voting on Sunday.
The dollar held just below almost two-year highs against a basket of currencies and strengthened against the Japanese yen, up 0.88%, and versus the commodity currencies - the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose more than 7 basis points to 2.793%, the highest level since January 2019. 
Yields have surged in anticipation of Fed rate hikes, which Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation at SLC Management, expects to be by 50 basis points at each of the Fed's next three policy meetings.
""The Fed is going to move aggressively. The market has appropriately priced it in,"" Mullarkey said. 
""They don't want to be an issue in the midterms,"" Mullarkey added, referring to elections in November that will determine whether Republicans can wrest control from President Joe Biden's Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. ""They also do not want to be in the position where they don't have inflation under control."" 
Economists polled by Reuters forecast the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) on Tuesday would post an 8.4% year-over-year increase in March. Separately, they also saw the probability of a recession next year at 40%.
Technology shares, which have been underpinned by record low interest rates, fell 2% in Europe and 2.6% on Wall Street.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.33% and the pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.59% as regional bourses fell with the exception of France's CAC 40.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.19%, the S&P 500 lost 1.69% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.18%. All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell.
Volatility gripped French blue chips on the outlook for a tight Macron-Le Pen race in the final round of voting. French assets have underperformed as markets are uneasy about Le Pen's agenda of protectionism, tax cuts and nationalization. 
The CAC 40 index, which is off 1.5% so far in April as the STOXX 600 gains about 0.4%, closed up 0.12%. 
""I don't expect the French equity markets to rally until we have the second round - we expect a lot of volatility and range-bound trading,"" said Mathieu Racheter, head of equity strategy at Julius Baer. ""It is really a close call in the runoff.""
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.6% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slid 0.61%.
Oil prices dropped by $4 a barrel, with Brent tumbling below $100 on plans to release record volumes of crude from strategic reserves and on continuing COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
U.S. crude futures fell $3.97 to settle at $94.29 a barrel while Brent settled down $4.30 at $98.48.
Palladium steadied after jumping as much as 5% on supply concerns following a recent suspension on trading of the metal sourced from Russia in the London metals hub, while gold was buoyed by inflation fears.
U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,948.20 an ounce.
Bitcoin fell 5.66% to $39,748.60.
China's inflation figures surprised on the high side on Monday although they were still relatively modest at 1.5% year-on-year in March.

But that still saw yields on China's 10-year government bonds fall below U.S. Treasury yields for the first time in 12 years on Monday.

(Reuters) - California utility PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp has reached settlement agreements with district attorneys representing Northern California counties to avoid prosecution over two major wildfires, with the company agreeing to pay $55 million.
""As a result of these agreements, no criminal charges will be filed in the Dixie Fire (2021), and the criminal complaint regarding the Kincade Fire (2019) will be dismissed,"" the company said in a statement on Monday.
The financial commitments within the agreements total $55 million over five years, and PG&E will not seek recovery of these costs from customers, it added.
PG&E did not admit wrongdoing in the settlements reached with prosecutors for the 2021 Dixie Fire and the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County.
The Dixie fire, ranked as the second-largest California wildfire on record, scorched through Northern California communities and forests in August, forcing thousands to flee from their homes and prompted precautionary power shutdowns. PG&E had said the blaze may have started when a tree fell onto one of the utility's power cables.
The Kincade wildfire in California's wine country in 2019 that forced some 2,000 people to flee homes was caused by PG&E's electrical transmission lines, the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in 2020.
PG&E entered agreements with Butte, Lassen, Plumas, Shasta, Sonoma and Tehama counties to strengthen wildfire safety and response programs and to work with local organizations affected by the fires to help rebuild impacted communities, the company said on Monday.

The utility emerged from bankruptcy in 2020. It had sought protection from creditors after wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 drove the utility's potential liabilities into tens of billions of dollars. 
Late last year, PG&E said it had received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office seeking documents from the Californian utility related to the Dixie Fire.

Investing.com --  GDS Holdings Ltd  (NASDAQ:GDS) shares gained 3.5% Monday after a Morgan Stanley analyst wrote a note on the stock saying it ""will rise in absolute terms over the next 15 days.""
Analyst Yang Liu reiterated an overweight rating and $58 price target on the stock, attributing the forecasted rise to GDS peer VNET receiving ""an unsolicited preliminary nonbinding buyout proposal.""
It was reported earlier today that VNET Group Inc (NASDAQ:VNET) has received a proposal from investment-firm Hina Group and Industrial Bank Co. Ltd., Shanghai Branch, for all of its outstanding ordinary shares for $8 per American depositary share, or approximately $1.33 per ordinary share.
VNET shares jumped 28% Monday.
""The offer price implies a 54% premium to VNET's last closing price. We think this event could trigger a valuation repair for China IDC (internet data center) ADRs including GDS, which is trading far below its current asset value,"" explained Liu.
""We estimate that there is about an 80%+ (or ""highly likely"") probability for the scenario,"" the analyst said.

Investing.com – Stocks sank on Monday as rising Treasury yields– which move inverse to price– sent tech shares tumbling.
Investors are bracing for tomorrow’s release of inflation data for March, which is widely expected to show price gains running their hottest in four decades.
Still, the job market is also at multi-decade highs, in terms of the economy being at full employment, as the economy recovers from the pandemic era shutdowns.
Tomorrow’s data release is the last time the Federal Reserve will see official consumer price index data before its May meeting, when it is expected to raise rates by a half point, rather than its customary quarter-point move.
Oil is down around $94 a barrel, which could be a sign the inflationary pressures of the last few months could be nearing a peak. If energy prices fall far enough, that will eventually work its way through prices for fuel and consumer goods.
Also this week, a spate of big company earnings as first quarter reporting season kicks off. Big banks are due starting Wednesday and other S&P 500 companies are on the agenda.
The U.S. stock market is closed Friday for the holiday weekend, so investors are looking at an abbreviated trading week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Consumer prices
The US will report CPI data on Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET. For the year-over-year comparison, it is expected to show a gain of 8.4% after a 7.9% gain in February. Meanwhile, CPI for March from the prior month is expected to be 1.2%, above the previous 0.8% recorded, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Core inflation
Core CPI MoM, which measures the changes in the price of goods and services excluding food and energy, is forecast to come in at 0.5% for March, matching February’s reading.
3. Fed speech
Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard will be speaking tomorrow. Last week Brainard said the Fed could start reducing its balance sheet as soon as May at a rapid pace. Brainard, along with Chair Jerome Powell, is still awaiting a Senate confirmation vote.

MILAN (Reuters) -The Benettons and U.S. investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are aiming to launch a takeover offer for Italy's Atlantia this week without involving directly other partners for now, two sources close to the matter said on Monday.
One of the sources said the bid could be announced before Saturday, as the two partners rush for taking the Italian infrastructure group private after an unsolicited approach by a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield.
Benettons' holding company Edizione, which controls Atlantia with a 33% stake, and Blackstone are expected to set up a new company that will launch the offer for the infrastructure group, the sources said.
Edizione will have the majority of the ""Newco,"" with Blackstone holding the rest, other partners could follow at a later stage, the sources said.
Speculation over an incoming bid for the group has pushed the stock briefly above 22 euros on Friday, valuing it more than 48 billion euros ($52 billion) including net debt worth 30 billion euros. 
Atlantia, which operates airports in Italy and France along with motorways in Europe and Latin America, will pocket 8 billion euros next month from the sale of its Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia.
This transaction, designed to end a political dispute over the collapse of a bridge operated by Autostrade, has made Atlantia cash-rich, attracting suitors.
In March, GIP, Brookfield and Spain's ACS approached the Benettons with a proposal to buy the infrastructure group, they said last week.
According to the sources, the two funds also courted Italian banking foundation CRT and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, two long-time investors in Atlantia which own 4.5% and 8.3% respectively in the group, but were rebuffed.
CRT and GIC could have a role in Edizione-Blackstone's project for Atlantia at a later stage, one of the sources said.
""Edizione and Blackstone are not currently discussing any plan to involve GIP and Brookfield in their bid,"" one of the sources said. 

CRT declined to comment; GIC, Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield was not immediately available to comment.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Monday, paced by a tech-led slump as surging U.S. Treasury yields kept the pressure on growth sectors of the market including tech.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.1%, or 375 points, the Nasdaq slipped 2.0%.
Technology stocks, which snapped a three-week winning streak last week, started the week on the back foot, as Treasury yields continued to rack up gains on expectations of a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening next month.
“U.S. bond yields are on the rise as investors continue to digest the Fed’s more hawkish position. As a result, the 10-year yield has pushed from 2.40% to 2.74% in the past week,” Stifel said in a note.
The Fed’s plan to curb inflation will come under added scrutiny on Tuesday as the U.S. is expected report that the pace of inflation in March rose at annual rate of 8.4%, a four-decade high.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), down more than 3%, led the decline in big tech after UBS estimated that Office 365, the tech giant's second-biggest business, will likely see declining growth ahead as the boost from the pandemic and work from home trend fades.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down more than 2%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, bucked the trend lower after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk made a u-turn on a decision to join the social media's board, paving the way for Musk to buy more shares of Twitter. Joining the board of Twitter, would have limited Musk to owning no more than 14.9% of the company.  
Semiconductor stocks also pressured the broader tech sector as sentiment on chipmakers was hurt after Baird downgraded Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to neutral from outperform and cut its price target on the stock to $225 from $360, sending its shares down more than 5%.
Baird flagged order cancellations for Nvidia’s consumer GPUs, and said the upcoming fork for cryptocurrency Ethereum could further dent demand.
Financials, mostly banks, relatively outperformed the broader market, down just 0.2%, boosted by rising yields ahead of the start of the quarterly earnings season.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reports results on Wednesday.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday.
Energy stocks were also a big drag on the broader market even as oil prices were pressured by worries about the impact on demand from lockdowns in China.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were among the biggest decliners in the sector.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors moved a step closer on Monday to a potential payout of billions of dollars in default insurance on debt issued by the Russian government and its entities as the country is on the brink of its first external default in over a century.
The EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (CDDC) ruled on Monday that state-owned Russia Railways is in default on a missed bond payment, a key step in triggering so called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) - an instrument to insure exposure to default risk.
The decision, which marked the first time a Russia-originated debt instrument has been officially classified as defaulted since the country's invasion of Ukraine, was closely watched by creditors waiting to see whether the country's sovereign external debt might follow the same path.
Only a few hours later, the same committee was asked whether a potential failure to pay occurred on hard-currency bonds issued by Russia's government.
The CDDC, whose members include some of the world's biggest investment banks, said on Monday it had decided a ""failure to pay"" credit event has occurred on Swiss franc loan participation notes linked to state-owned Russian Railways. 
The loan participation notes due 2026 were issued by RZD Capital to finance a loan of 250 million Swiss francs ($268 million) to Russian Railways. 
There are $21.1 million worth of net notional CDS across 17 contracts outstanding for Russian Railways, according to data by IHS Markit.
Western sanctions against Russia following the Ukraine invasion, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"", as well as counter measures by Moscow have imposed strains on the Russian economy and raised questions about the possible default of many bonds issued by Russian corporations. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank are some of the committee members who voted ""yes"" to the question on whether a failure to pay event occurred on Russian Railways. The committee met on Friday.
Some analysts see this as a test case on whether a solvent issuer that could not physically make the payment due to sanctions is considered in default.
""Apparently CDDC says yes... and probably means it will conclude something similar with the Russian sovereign trying to pay a USD coupon – but failing to,"" said a source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for UBS AG, the notes' paying agent, declined to comment. 
Russian Railways, which operates both cargo and passenger trains along thousands of miles of railway, said it had attempted to make interest payments due March 14 but was unable to do so due to ""legal and regulatory compliance obligations within the correspondent banking network,"" according to an official notice posted by the SIX Swiss Exchange and referenced in the request to the committee.
While outstanding CDS on Russian Railways are relatively limited, there are currently $3.43 billion of net notional Russia CDS to be settled, investment bank JPMorgan said in a note on Monday.
The question on the Russian sovereign debt is pending consent from the determinations committee and no date for a meeting has been set https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/cds/the-russian-federation-2, according to its website. 
Russia could face its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles last week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars.

Russia Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the country will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt.

California in July last year brought a lawsuit against the company alleging it ""fostered a sexist culture"". Activision has also been the subject of investigative stories detailing allegations of sexual harassment internally, with employees staging walkouts to protest the company's response to the issues.

Warner Bros Discovery shares were up 0.8% at $24.62, while AT&T stock climbed 2% to $18.62 before the bell.
AT&T and Discovery set out to create a standalone media business in May last year and the deal closed on Friday, with the new business housing channels including HBO, CNN and the Discovery Channel as well as franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"". 
The company, which also owns streaming services HBO Max and Discovery+, faces stiff competition from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.
Warner Bros Discovery is led by long-time Discovery veteran David Zaslav, and the new leadership team, announced last week, comprises many of his lieutenants.
""We expect that Zaslav will use his experience to help Warner Bros. Discovery transition into a DTC (direct-to-consumer) powerhouse by focusing further investment in both content and the user experience, which has garnered complaints on both HBO Max and Discovery+,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker wrote in a note.
Analysts at MoffettNathanson also signaled rising interest rates as a concern for the stock, adding there are concerns about slowing DTC subscriber growth across the industry.
Meanwhile, AT&T can focus on its core business as the telecom major uses part of the proceeds to cut down debt. 

J.P. Morgan said it was an attractive time to buy into AT&T.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it has signed a preliminary deal to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina, marking the first time the automaker has publicly announced where it will procure the electric vehicle battery metal.
The deal is a major bet by Ford on direct lithium extraction (DLE), a relatively new breed of technologies that filter the metal from brines and use far less acreage than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), BMW, Stellantis NV and other Ford rivals have inked supply deals of their own with companies planning to use DLE technology. 
Ford aims to buy 25,000 tonnes annually of the white metal from Lake's Kachi project in northern Argentina, which is being developed with privately held extraction startup Lilac Solutions Inc. 
Lilac's technology, like all DLE technologies, has yet to work commercially, though it has the support of Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and other high-profile investors.
The agreement between Lake and Ford is nonbinding and would need to be finalized to include a specific delivery timetable. 
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in February that his company was working on deals to secure supply of key raw materials for batteries such as lithium, nickel, rare earths and copper.
""This is one of several agreements we're exploring to help Ford secure raw materials to support our aggressive EV acceleration plan,"" said Ford spokesperson Jennifer Flake.
Sydney-based Lake Resources is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, which requires supply deals to be publicly disclosed.

The Kachi project, in northern Argentina near the Chilean border, is expected to cost about $540 million and open by 2024. 
Lilac's technology uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced. Lilac has said it could use a desalination plant to filter brackish water to avoid using potable water.

PARIS (Reuters) -French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said on Monday it would quit Russia and take a 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) income hit from selling its Rosbank unit to Interros Capital, a firm linked to Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.
Rosbank will rejoin the business empire of Potanin, the 61-year-old head of mining giant Norilsk Nickel, who has been sanctioned by Canada https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/russia_regulations-reglement_russie13.aspx?lang=eng under Western moves against Russia's business and political elite over its invasion of Ukraine.
He has not been sanctioned by the European Union or the United States. 
While financial terms of the deal were not announced, SocGen said it would write off 3.1 billion euros, comprising a 2 billion-euro hit on Rosbank's book value and the rest linked to the reversal of rouble conversion reserves.
SocGen, the first major Western bank to announce its exit from Russia, had previously flagged the risk of a write-off on its 99% stake in Rosbank. Investors said its exit from Russia removed a lot of uncertainty.
It pledged to stick to plans for a dividend and a 915 million-euro share buyback. 
Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz noted SocGen shares rallied 7% on the news, even though Russia only accounted for about 2% of SocGen's earnings.
""It shows what discount the market was pricing in for potential Russian risks. This draws a line in the sand,"" he said.
SocGen ""essentially gives the business away for free,"" Scholtz said, noting the book value writedown on Rosbank.
""The only way they can do that is that if they get no material consideration,"" he added. 
Interros agreed, however, to pay off Rosbank's subordinated debt, approximately 500 million euros. 
Overall, SocGen said the exit would shave 20 basis points (bps) from its Tier 1 capital ratio - the core measure of a bank's financial strength - which stood at 13.7% at the end of 2021 or 470 bps above the minimum required.
Citi analysts said the news was ""a welcome surprise for the market, given the small capital impact and the reduction of future risk, as well as confirmation of dividend policy.""
But the sale to Potanin was not universally applauded.
""It's a bit distressing that ultimately this is an enormous gift to one of the wealthiest oligarchs,"" said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
France's finance ministry declined to comment when asked whether the government had a role in negotiations. It declined to comment on Potanin’s status as a sanctioned individual.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation,"" has prompted a wave of foreign companies to shutter their Russian businesses. Orchestrating a complete break is, however, more difficult due to sanctions and political sensitivities.
Axiom's Legras said SocGen's Russian exit put pressure on others to act. Italy's UniCredit and Austria's Raiffeisen are still considering their futures in Russia, while U.S. bank Citi is trying to offload a consumer banking franchise. 
""The challenge in this environment is whom can you sell to? It's easier to sell at a deep discount or walk away when it's 2% of your earnings than if it is a third,"" Morningstar's Scholtz said, referring to Raiffeisen which earns almost 30% of net profits from Russia. 
Asked whether SocGen's deal meant other companies could sell their assets to Russian buyers, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This depends on the decision of an owner of a specific company which is leaving Russia"".

SocGen said the deal would allow it to quit Russia in an ""an effective and orderly manner"" and ensure continuity for Rosbank's employees and clients.
Potanin's holding company had owned Rosbank from 1998, before SocGen bought a stake in 2006 and merged it with its other Russian operations in 2010. SocGen paid https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/pressrelase/06132gb.pdf $317 million for its initial 10% stake in Rosbank.
Potanin, Russia's second richest man with $27 billion worth of assets according to Forbes magazine estimates, worked in the Soviet Union's foreign trade ministry and later as a banker before establishing Interros in 1990, an umbrella for his assets which range from metals production to a ski resort.
During the 1990s, Potanin served as Russia’s first deputy Prime Minister, masterminding the first wave of privatisations of former state-owned and himself buying several large businesses, including a stake in mining giant Nornickel.
Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, Potanin said that confiscating assets from companies that had left Russia would shatter investor confidence for decades.
""The most important goal of Interros is to maintain the stability of Rosbank and create new opportunities for its clients and partners,"" Potanin said in a statement. 
Interros said the Rosbank deal should be closed in the next few weeks after all necessary regulatory approvals.

The week-long drama started when Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter on April 4 and later said he would take a board seat. But, becoming a director would have prevented Musk from becoming a beneficial owner of more than 14.9% of Twitter's common stock.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, its co-founder Jack Dorsey and Musk have tweeted their way through agreements, plans and congratulatory messages since the disclosure. 
Here are some tweets Musk published and erased after disclosing his stake:
Date Tweet 
April 10, 2022 Musk polled followers on Twitter asking whether the 
company's headquarters in San Francisco should be 
converted into a homeless shelter. The tweet is now 
deleted. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos had backed Musk's idea. 
April 10, 2022 Twitter CEO Agrawal shared a note https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1513354622466867201 
on Twitter saying that Musk rejected the company's offer 
to join its board. Musk deleted the tweet, where he 
responded with an emoticon with a 
face-with-hand-over-mouth. 
April 10, 2022 Musk started a poll asking if ""w"" should be deleted from 
Twitter's name, leaving two voting options, ""yes"" and ""of 
course."" He deleted that too. 
April 9, 2022 With respect to Twitter's business model, Musk tweeted 
before deleting it: ""And no ads. The power of corporations 
to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends 
on advertising money to survive."" 
April 9, 2022 Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1512946176244473863, 
""Everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue (ie pays 
$3/month) should get an authentication checkmark"" about 
its subscription service that offers ""exclusive access to 
premium features"" on a monthly basis. Later, he deleted 
the tweet. 
April 5, 2022 Agrawal tweeted https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1511320953598357505?s=21&t=Is9i_R_hPKzFuUV5VhxUZQ

passionate believer and intense critic of the service 
which is exactly what we need on 
@Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the 
long-term"", a follow-on tweet said.

added: ""Parag and Elon both lead with their hearts, and 
they will be an incredible team."" 
April 4, 2022 Musk posted a Twitter poll asking users if they wanted an 
edit button. ""Do you want an edit button?"" Musk asked in 
the tweet, in response to which Agrawal said the 
consequences of the poll will be important. ""Please vote 
carefully,"" he tweeted. 
April 4, 2022 In his first tweet since the disclosure of his stake in

(Reuters) -European stocks fell on Monday as surging bond yields hit technology shares and volatility gripped French blue-chip stocks on forecasts of a tight race between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the final round of the election.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.6%, led by a 2.2% slide in technology stocks. Among the regional indexes, Germany's DAX slipped 0.6% and the UK's FTSE 100 fell 0.7%.

French assets have underperformed recently as investors priced in a possibility of a victory for Le Pen, with markets uneasy about her agenda of protectionism, tax cuts and nationalisation. The CAC 40 has shed 1.6% so far in April, while the STOXX 600 is up 0.4%. 
""The CAC 40 climbed modestly on relief that Macron won the first round of the presidential election with a slightly bigger lead than anticipated,"" said Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at brokerage XM.

(Reuters) -Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc on Monday announced a 10-for-1 split of its class A and class B stock, joining a growing list of companies that have split their shares to make them more attractive for investors.
Shopify would also seek shareholder approval to authorize and issue a new class of shares, called the Founder share, to Tobi Lutke, its chief executive officer and founder.
The proposal seeks to preserve the voting power of Lutke, as the Founder share will provide him with a variable number of votes and that combined with his previously owned shares from other classes would represent 40% of the total voting power attached to all of Shopify's outstanding shares. 
The proposal, however, said that Lutke will hold the Founder shares only until he is an executive at Shopify or a board member.
While D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Tom Forte said the brokerage is generally opposed to founder shares and believes they are not in the interest of shareholders, he said he is willing to give Lutke the benefit of doubt due to his ""superb"" track record.
""We believe it may protect the company from unwanted suitors, such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), considering the recent weakness in the (Shopify) stock,"" Forte added.
U.S.-listed shares of Shopify were marginally down at $602.61 in morning trading, while they were slightly up at C$765 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They have lost more than half their value this year.

Currently, the company's class A shares carry one vote per share and class B shares carry 10 votes per share.
Other stock split announcements this year came from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc as well as videogame retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc also had said it would seek shareholder approval for a stock split.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading may be a surprise bright spot for Wall Street banks in the first quarter, after clients rejigged portfolios in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and interest rate hikes, analysts and executives say.
But quarterly results from banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will show a sharp decline in investment banking revenues and in first-quarter earnings overall. That is due to companies pausing deals until choppy equity markets stabilize. 
Coming into the year, banks had expected trading volumes to decline to levels similar to 2019, following exceptional activity in 2020 and 2021. Traders had benefited from the Federal Reserve pumping liquidity into markets to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the conflict in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" and the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes as the Fed attempts to bring inflation under control, has led to traders enjoying another bumper period.
""There's definitely been more volatility than we expected coming into the year and that volatility benefited trading businesses, particularly on the fixed income side,"" said one senior New York-based banker.
Uncertainty over the pace of interest rate hikes by central banks has stimulated rates trading, the source said.
Another senior executive at a European bank with large U.S. operations said his firm's trading businesses had enjoyed a ""pretty phenomenal quarter.""
""It was a very similar trend to what we saw in the same quarter last year in terms of volumes,"" he said.
Banks face exceptionally tough comparatives. The first quarter last year saw major equity indexes hit record highs, driving volumes. Having initially forecast sharp year-on-year declines, analysts now expect a similar performance this year.
Analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) anticipate a boost in banks' trading revenues ""that could roughly mirror the exceptional results of first-quarter 2021,"" they said in a research note.
Still, some see more headwinds. Christopher McGratty of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates an 18% decline in trading revenues.
'GOOD VOLATILITY'
Traders are hoping they continue to see ""good volatility,"" where clients are encouraged to buy and sell securities to reshape portfolios, rather than ""bad volatility,"" where liquidity dries up due to bid/ask spreads being too high.
Equity trading surged in the first quarter as the VIX - a measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks that some call Wall Street's fear gauge - spiked. Fixed-income trading ramped up as clients hedged their positions, bankers say.
Rapid shifts in asset prices can mean banks benefit from increased trading volumes as clients adjust their exposures. But they present dangers too, from counterparty risk. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) was forced to halt nickel trading earlier this month after prices doubled to more than $100,000 per tonne, a rise which sources blamed on short covering by one of the world's top producers.
The New York-based bank executive said his firm had been ""carefully monitoring"" its commodities exposures and testing the liquidity of clients on a regular basis.
Another downside for banks has been a sharp drop in investment banking fees as companies hold off on deals. M&A advisory fees are expected to drop by 30-40%, analysts say.
Equity capital markets (ECM) issuance dropped 70-80%, according to analysts. The decline in major equity indexes led to initial public offerings virtually drying up. 

Despite that, pipelines remain healthy and activity could pick up quickly when markets stabilize, bankers say. Companies could be encouraged to make acquisitions because valuations have declined from last year's highs. That could, in turn, lead to a pick-up in equity capital markets.
""The first quarter marked a significant shift in the operating environment, but we continue to see opportunity in the year ahead,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy plans to beef up its scrutiny of corporate takeovers with a new dedicated division at the cabinet office to oversee merger deals involving strategic companies, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi's 14-month old government has used so-called ""golden powers"" to set conditions on scores of mergers and has blocked several attempts by China to extend its presence in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
Now Draghi's closes aides are working to create a new Directorate-General in his office to strengthen Rome's capacity to police any changes to the ownership structure of strategic firms, the sources said, asking not to be named.
Among the tasks of the new bureau will be ""strategic analysis of what is happening in relevant markets,"" one of the sources said, adding that the restructuring will increase the staff dedicated to takeover issues. 
As part of the drive to strengthen the golden powers, the government plans to finalise by the end of May new rules forcing companies that own sensitive assets to inform it of preliminary discussions with potential suitors, the second source said.
If already in place, such a rule would have allowed the government to have a direct say over KKR's failed takeover approach for  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
The moves come after Rome introduced new measures last month requiring firms operating 5G networks to supply, on an annual basis, considerably more detailed notification to the authorities over proposed mergers and supply deals.
The government also permanently extended the special powers to cover banks and insurance companies as well as proposed takeovers of Italian companies by other EU firms.
Until former European Central Bank chief Draghi took office in Italy in February 2021, the golden power veto had been used just twice in a decade to curb foreign forays in Italy. Draghi used it four more times in just over a year, heading off as many Chinese bids.
The latest episode, last month, saw Rome annul a 2018 sale of a military drones company to Chinese investors.
However, Draghi's approach has triggered legal challenges from both foreign predators and their Italian prey. 

The notification requirements have also increased red tape for firms, which in order to avoid the risk of infractions and fines are informing the government of any mergers and deals even when it would not be necessary.
Last year the number of notifications jumped to almost 500, compared with 342 in 2020 and just 83 in 2019.

The analyst made the case despite the fact he is more comfortable projecting 95 million room-nights compared to over 100 million suggested by the Buyside.
Nevertheless, Fuller maintains a Neutral rating on the stock, adding that the bull case for Airbnb is based on ""catching up to pre-Covid growth rates"" rather than the room-night recovery rate compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The lowered price target reflects lower estimates for F4Q22 (Mar Q) and FY23 to mirror “incremental Covid-19 related headwinds, on top of regulatory and macro impacts last year.”
Liu expects to see March online retail sales growth decelerating “significantly” amid a spike in Covid-19 cases across China. Hence, the near-term challenges are likely to force Alibaba to cut costs.
“This will impact supply chains and fulfillment networks, and weaken consumer demand, especially in categories like apparel. We now assume the Jun Q is the trough for Customer Management revenue (CMR) YoY growth vs. Mar Q previously, as we conservatively assume the MoM deterioration in growth near term offsets the easing YoY comparisons. There are some additional growth impacts to domestic on-demand, international e-commerce, and cloud segments, but we also see improvements later this year,” Liu said in a client note.
Still, the analyst remains positive on BABA shares.
“As consumption in China recovers later this year, we expect Alibaba's top and bottom line growth rates to accelerate. With the stock trading at 10x/9x CY22/23 earnings, we believe the risk/reward is attractive given an average of 13% EBIT growth in CY23-25, limited regulatory risks from here, and improving sector-wide cost control. Any positive outcome on ADR listing negotiations between regulators, and to a lesser extent shifting Alibaba's Hong Kong listing to a primary one could be additional catalysts,” Liu said in a client note.
Alibaba stock price is down 1.5% today.

Investing.com --  Hoth Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:HOTH) stock more than doubled in early trade on Monday after the biotech startup said that its experimental cancer treatment HT-KIT had appeared successful in killing cancerous cells and stopping tumor growth in a preclinical study.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), Hoth stock was up 110% at $1.28. However, that's still barely 20% of its value when it listed in 2019.
HT-KIT is a new molecular entity under development for treatment of mast cell-derived cancers and anaphylaxis. It has already been awarded Orphan Drug status, which will guarantee the company tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees, and seven years of patent protection if it is formally approved for use.
HT-KIT is a treatment based on messenger RNA, the same technology that is behind the COVID-19 vaccines of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
The company said that research conducted jointly with North Carolina State University showed HT-KIT can kill cancer cells and inhibit their growth within 72 hours, reducing the likelihood of tumors spreading to other organs in the body.
""With our HT-KIT drug, we are flipping off a key cancer signal that's involved in multiple aggressive cancers, such as systemic mastocytosis, mast cell leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and acute myeloid leukemia,"" CEO Robb Knie said in a statement.
He noted that the next round of preclinical studies for the drug has already started and that the company plans to brief the Food and Drug Administration on their results in the course of this year.
Hoth has already completed a manufacturing feasibility study for the drug together with China-based WuXi STA.",,,,,

Heading into earnings, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan lowered the price target to $420.00 per share from $450.00 on the Neutral-rated NFLX shares to reflect lower estimates - from 21 million to 17 million for 2022 net adds - and continued margin pressure.
“In order to get more constructive on NFLX, we continue to be focused on post-pandemic normalization, a lessening of media consumption competitive intensity, clearer line of sight into more moderate content spend growth and/or sustainable FCF generation that can fund share buybacks,” Sheridan said in a client note.
Similarly, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson has reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Netflix ahead of a potentially “noisy” report. Overall, the analyst lowered 2022E/2023E EPS by 1%/6%, respectively.
“We believe 1Q paid net adds benefited from a stronger content line-up in Asia, which should partially offset a ~1M drag from Russia, resulting in our new estimate of 2.1M (prev. 2.5M). While positive, we believe further FX headwinds, inflation, and competition elevate risk to 2022E/2023E revenue/EPS.

The Detroit-based automaker said it was on track to launch more than 20 new and refreshed models in the world's biggest auto market despite the pandemic's impact.
The COVID-19 curbs introduced in China to fight the worst outbreak in two years caused auto sales in the country to plunge in March, with automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc feeling the pain of limits on production.
GM's sales fell 21.4% to 613,000 vehicles in China in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Sales of its top-selling Chevrolet brand declined nearly 20% in the same period. 
The lockdown, one of the biggest tests for China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, has forced automakers and suppliers to either try to adapt with extreme measures to keep factories running or to shut down and risk delayed shipments at a time when demand for vehicles is strong.

China's financial center of Shanghai started easing its lockdown measures in some areas on Monday despite reporting more than 25,000 new COVID-19 infections. 
GM had said in March its manufacturing facilities were operating normally in Shanghai and were not affected by the city's lockdown measures.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary and Austria questioned an EU decision to blacklist two Russian oligarchs but eventually accepted the move after pressure from other governments, European Union diplomats and officials said.
The EU adopted a new package of sanctions against Russia last Friday over its invasion of Ukraine, including the blacklisting of oligarchs close to the Kremlin, among them Moshe Kantor and German Gref.
Hungary and Austria enjoyed relatively cordial relations with Russia before the invasion, and their concerns about blacklisting Kantor and Gref underlines the difficulty the EU faces in presenting a united front against Russia.
The envoys of Estonia and Lithuania successfully urged their partners not to remove the two men from the list, the diplomats said. 
Kantor, a large shareholder in Russian fertilizers company Akron, is also a philanthropist who had headed the European Jewish Congress (EJC).
He was sanctioned for having close ties to President Vladimir Putin, the EU sanctions document said. Kantor, a citizen of both Britain and Russia, has already been sanctioned by London and the EJC said on Friday he would stand down as its president.
Hungary and Austria had both questioned the move against Kantor at a meeting of EU diplomats last Wednesday, officials who attended the meeting said.
The Hungarian envoy had expressed surprise at the blacklisting of somebody he described as a highly decorated man, they said. Kantor has received awards from several EU states, including Austria, Italy and France.
Spokespersons for Hungary's government and its diplomatic mission in Brussels had no immediate comment.
The Austrian envoy at Wednesday's meeting had asked for more information about why Kantor had been listed, sources said.
""Austria has never objected to or blocked any listings and will of course not do so in the future,"" a spokeswoman for Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said.
Blacklisted oligarchs face asset freezes and travel bans in the EU, but not all EU countries have reported enforcement measures.
Out of about 30 billion euros frozen to oligarchs since the start of the Ukraine war, Austria has reported a few hundreds of millions of euros blocked in bank accounts linked to blacklisted individuals. Hungary has so far not publicly reported any measures. 

At the meeting, Hungary also questioned the listing of Gref, head of Sberbank, Russia's largest lender.
Sberbank plays a crucial role in energy transactions and has so far been exempted from EU sanctions because of the EU's reliance on Russian gas and oil.

Wilson believes that the stock market is sending a clear message to traders: Stay defensive as growth will disappoint. The strategist added that we are facing “a pivotal earnings season.”
“The internal message from stocks is diverging again from bonds and the S&P 500. When that happens we think it pays to follow stocks. Our main takeaway is to stay defensive and be wary of what bonds are really saying about growth. The move looks more technical at this point which tends to exhaust and reverse quickly. Cyclicals look most vulnerable to such a reversal if it happens,” Wilson said in a client note.
On why the S&P 500 is trading less than 10% off the all-time high despite an extremely challenging macro environment, Wilson says that mis-priced yields helped the index to “remain resilient” after ignoring “the growing risk of a more hawkish Fed in the fourth quarter of 2021.”
Wilson argues that the stock market is “the best strategist in the world.”
“On that score, the internals of the stock market are once again diverging from the message from the bond market. More specifically, back end rates have had one of it's largest 1 month moves in history as Fed funds futures catch up to reality. To be clear, we don't have a bone to pick with this move higher in rates given the state of inflation and the Fed's persistent attempt to convince the world they are going to do whatever it takes to quash it. However, we do question the bond market's apparent view that the Fed can do this much tightening without impacting the economy in such a way that this path for rate hikes will be challenging to complete,” the strategist added.

The combined company, a result of Discovery’s merger with AT&T’s Warner Media, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange today under the ticker symbol “WBD.”
“Today’s announcement marks an exciting milestone not just for Warner Bros. Discovery but for our shareholders, our distributors, our advertisers, our creative partners and, most importantly, consumers globally,” said David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros.
Under the terms of the deal, AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. AT&T investors received 0.241917 shares of the combined company for each AT&T common share they owned at the close.
Ultimately, shareholders of the telecommunications company received 1.7 billion WBD shares, which accounts for 71% of the combined company’s stock on a fully diluted basis. Shareholders of Discovery hold the remaining stake of WBD.
Following the completion of the deal, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft named WBD a new Top Pick in the bank’s media sector coverage. A new price target is $48.00 per share, up from $40.00.
“We view the new Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as one of the best positioned companies in the global streaming video entertainment industry1 given its content and IP portfolio, combined with its widely recognized HBO Max brand and existing base of 92M streaming subscribers. From a content perspective, we view WBD as #1 in scripted general entertainment content given the Warner Brothers + HBO libraries and current production slates; and #1 in unscripted given legacy Discovery's content across its lifestyle brand portfolio. We also view CNN as a valuable and differentiating asset for WBD's global streaming business,” Kraft said in a client note.
The analyst believes WBD could reach 194 million global DTC/streaming subscribers by the end of 2026.
“Given that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is already at 222M subscribers, we believe there could be upside to our WBD forecast,” the analyst added.
On the other hand, Bank of America analyst David Barden reiterated a Buy rating on T stock on premium yield and value. The analyst also lowered the price target to $25.00 per share from $35.00 to reflect the WM spin.
“We believe AT&T’s shares are undervalued. In recent years T’s valuation has reflected an overly complex structure of loosely-related businesses sub-optimally organized as a conglomerate. While the divestitures of the past year have addressed the complexity (admittedly in a complex way sometimes eg. DTV), headwinds were once again created on May 17, 2021 when AT&T announced the dividend reset to $1.11/share (from $2.08) once the WM spin closed. With the deal now closed, the dividend reset, and the investor base stabilizing, we believe the stage is set for investors to begin focusing on AT&T’s improving fundamentals,” Barden wrote in a memo.

Around 15% of this energy should come from solar and wind plants on or linked to Mercedes-Benz' own sites, production chief Joerg Burzer said in a presentation.
The rest will be sourced through so-called Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), where power producers are paid to generate a certain amount of energy over a number of years at a set price.
The carmaker is in advanced discussions to purchase additional wind energy through PPAs worth a billion euros ($1.09 billion) by 2025, Burzer added.

For now, Mercedes-Benz still relies on gas as a back-up supply source. ""We obviously still need the gas,"" Burzer said. ""We are working on minimising that.""

The e-commerce and Cloud-hosting giant, which recently announced a $10 billion stock buyback program, aims to borrow a total of $12 billion through seven separate tranches, with maturities stretching up to 40 years. The sales will be handled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), according to the company's filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission.
Unverified market talk indicated that the 10-year tranche would be priced to yield around 110 basis points over the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury. while the 30-year tranche was aiming for a spread of 140 basis points and the 40-year tranche a spread of 155 basis points.
Amazon had just under $37 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of last year, along with another $60 billion in short-term investments. At the same time, it had $64 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations. 
The sale comes as long-term interest rates in the U.S. hit their highest in over three years. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to as much as 2.78% overnight, its highest since March 2019, while the 30-Year yield rose to as high as 2.80%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) is suspending its business in Russia indefinitely and has put employees on paid leave, six weeks after the Swedish telecom equipment maker started a review of the impact of Western sanctions on its operations.
The company said on Monday it would record a 900 million crown ($95 million) provision in the first quarter for impairment of assets and other exceptional costs related to the move.
Ericsson has about 600 employees in Russia, a spokesperson said. 
Hundreds of Western companies have either withdrawn https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-600-companies-have-withdrawn-russia-some-remain or suspended operations in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in February while Western governments have imposed sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Ericsson had paused deliveries to customers in Russia in February, and rival Nokia (NYSE:NOK) did so in early March. 
""Move was inevitable following a swathe of sanctions,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. ""It will be a huge blow to both Ericsson and Nokia as they will not be paid for their networks."" 
The suspension will also hurt Ericsson's future plans in the country as Russia said last year it would extend telecoms operators' licences beyond 2023 for networks on the condition that they started building networks using only Russian equipment.
Ericsson does not have any manufacturing in Russia and its manufacturing hubs in Europe are in Estonia and Poland.
Nokia in November announced plans to set up a joint venture with YADRO, a leading Russian developer and producer of high-performance servers and storage systems, to build 4G and 5G telecom base stations in Russia.
Nokia said in a statement the company complies with all sanctions and restrictions and has suspended deliveries to Russia for the time being. 
""Nokia will not continue R&D in Russia and we have already started the process of transferring R&D tasks outside of Russia,"" the company said.

CEO Parag Agrawal announced Elon Musk has rejected the company’s offer to join the board of directors, an unexpected turn of events just a week after Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO became Twitter’s largest shareholder.
Agrawal posted a tweet saying the social media company’s board held multiple talks with Musk, who did not state the reason why he will not be joining Twitter’s board.
Twitter planned to appoint Musk to the board on Saturday, a move that would have prevented him from becoming the beneficial owner of nearly 15% of Twitter’s common stock.
""I believe this is for the best,"" Agrawal said, referring to Musk’s decision. ""There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.""
Musk’s only response was a tweet with the face-with-hand-over-mouth emoticon. The billionaire disclosed his 9.1% stake in Twitter on April 4, after which he promised to bring “significant improvements” to the social network.
The announcement of Musk joining Twitter’s board prompted discontent among some Twitter employees, who were concerned that he could harm the company.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees more turbulence coming after CEO Agrawal announced the news on Sunday. Ives believes two sides couldn't agree on Musk's communications with the public “as he likely needed to take a more back seat/quiet stance as part of joining the Board.”
“This now goes from a Cinderella story with Musk joining the Twitter Board and keeping his stake under 14.9% helping move Twitter strategically forward to likely a ""Game of Thrones"" battle between Musk and Twitter with the high likelihood that Elon takes a more hostile stance towards Twitter and further builds his active stake in the company,” Ives commented in a note.
The analyst sees the three potential scenarios for Musk and Twitter.
“In our opinion its likely paths 1 or 2 with the Street now focused on Musk's next poker (next filing/stake in Twitter) move in this ongoing soap opera between Elon and Twitter,” Ives concluded.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces an additional EU antitrust charge in the coming weeks in an investigation triggered by a complaint from Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), a person familiar with the matter said, a sign that EU enforcers are strengthening their case against the U.S. company.
The European Commission last year accused the iPhone maker of distorting competition in the music streaming market via restrictive rules for its App Store that force developers to use its own in-app payment system and prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options.
Such requirements have also come under scrutiny in countries including the United States and Britain.
Extra charges set out in a so-called supplementary statement of objections are usually issued to companies when the EU competition enforcer has gathered new evidence or has modified some elements to boost its case. 
The Commission declined to comment. Apple had no immediate comment.
Under new EU tech rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) agreed last month, such practices are illegal. However Apple and other U.S. tech giants targeted by the rules will have a couple of years before the crackdown starts.
""The DMA is still two years away. The rules will probably apply to Apple at the beginning of 2024. This is why antitrust cases remain important,"" said lawyer Damien Geradin at Geradin Partners, who is advising several app developers in other cases against Apple.
Companies found breaching EU antitrust rules face fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover and orders to ditch anti-competitive practices.

In addition to the music streaming investigation, Apple's practices in e-books and its Apple Pay are also in the EU antitrust crosshairs.
Sweden's Spotify, the largest music subscription service in the world, is one of Europe's big global success stories in consumer technology.

Investing.com -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rose 2.7% in premarket trading, bucking a generally weak market trend after the e-commerce company said its key personnel will give up majority voting control.
Under the terms of a proposal posted on the company’s website, the long-serving director and ‘angel investor’ John Phillips and his wife Catherine will convert their Class B shares, which have preferential voting rights, into Class A shares, ones held by Shopify’s outside shareholders.
That would raise the total voting rights of the Class A shares to 59% from 49% currently. The remaining voting rights will remain with the Class B shares, which are held by CEO and founder Tobias Lütke and affiliates. It would also ensure that Lütke is not able to pass on control of the company to future generations.
Shopify said it will seek approval for the measures at the same time as for a 10-for-1 stock split aimed at making its stock more accessible to smaller investors. It’s the latest company to take such a measure, after similar moves by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and others.
“The proposal will…strengthen the foundation for long-term stewardship by Mr. Lütke, a proven leader who has delivered significant shareholder value since the Company’s IPO,” the statement said. “This stability of leadership is expected to cement the Company’s focus on the long-term to the lasting benefit of merchants, employees and shareholders.”
Shopify’s stock had exploded in the early stages of the pandemic, as investors priced in a massive acceleration of the secular trend to e-commerce. Rock-bottom interest rates, which allowed analysts to model for low capital costs throughout a long growth phase, also supported its valuation.
However, that calculation has been undone by the Federal Reserve’s signaling that it will tighten monetary policy rapidly to rein in inflation. Since peaking at $1,762.92 in November last year, it has lost two-thirds of its value to trade at $603.18 as of Friday’s close.
Despite that selloff, it still trades at multiples that would have been considered expensive before the age of zero interest rates. At Friday’s close, it traded at well over 10 times the company’s expected sales in 2022. Shopify had said in February that it expected revenue growth to slow from a rate of 57% in 2021."

The analyst is concerned about order cancellations related to the consumer GPUs, as well as excess inventories, a slowdown in consumer and PC demand, and the Russian sanctions.
“While Nvidia sells at MSRP, pricing declines in GPUs post a pricing peak mid last year reflect on weakening demand, to the point where orders are now being impacted. Importantly Nvidia is not cutting wafer/substrate orders so far, as Nvidia has been supply restricted for the past 1.5 years and as data center demand remains very strong,” Gerra said in a client note.
Moreover, he argues that the demand weakness could increase in the light of the Ethereum fork that is expected this year.
The Ethereum fork expected late 2Q/early 3Q would compound the weakening demand trends, as it would result in a significant increase in graphic cards on the second-hand market, pressuring pricing further and likely reducing orders at least until the ramp of the GeForce RTX 40 series gains momentum (not until C2023). During the 2018 peak, mining represented as much as 40% of total consumer GPU demand based on supply chain estimates,” the analyst added.
The analyst also added that investors are underestimating the impact of Russia on Nvidia as this area “likely represents a larger percentage of consumer GPU than the consensus view.”
A new price target on Nvidia stock is $225.00 per share, down from $360.00.

Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. private equity firm is set to pay $65.25 a share for SailPoint. Thoma Bravo will pay a 31.5% premium to SailPoint’s Friday closing price.
The deal marks the second time Thoma Bravo has invested in SailPoint after the PE firm had bought a stake in the cybersecurity company in 2014 before it made an exit in 2018.
“Identity security is core to cyber security and businesses have realized that to fuel business growth and success, they must start with identity as the foundation for secure business transformation. We've experienced rapid growth and see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to continue to set the pace in the identity security market as the category leader,” said Mark McClain, CEO and Founder, SailPoint.
The deal is the latest addition to the takeover frenzy in the software industry, after a number of software makers have been sold to private equity buyers.
Last month, Thoma Bravo also bought cloud-based business software company  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) for 10.7 billion, the first major deal after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In January, affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners agreed to buy cloud computing company Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) for $16.5 billion. Elliot Management also acquired television rating company, Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN), for $16 billion.
Furthermore, cyber security software maker McAfee was taken private by a consortium managed by Advent International and Permira Advisers for $14 billion.
Private equity and investment firms have raised billions through traditional bank funding or private lenders, in spite of record inflation and the potential interest rate hike. To fund its buyout of Anaplan, Thoma Bravo secured the capital from a group of private lenders managed by Owl Rock, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Apollo Global, and Golub Capital.
Its acquisition of SailPoint will also be funded by private lenders, some of which have participated in the buyout of Anaplan, according to the Financial Times.
The SAIL transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.

465,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 07:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s dealmaking boom came to an abrupt halt amid the war in Ukraine and a global shift toward rising interest rates, leaving big banks set to post a quarterly slump in investment-banking revenue.
The record merger-and-acquisition pipelines bank executives touted at the start of 2022 are still on the horizon, but have been put on the back burner amid gyrating markets and rampant inflation, according to Barclays Plc analyst Jason Goldberg.
“Many deals did not get launched given the market volatility throughout the quarter,” Goldberg said. “We do think pipelines remain strong and have just been more elongated than canceled.”
Another pressure point is the Biden administration’s more-skeptical view of mega mergers. U.S. antitrust enforcers earlier this year announced an effort to toughen merger reviews, saying a new framework is needed to combat a surge in deals that threatens to worsen already high concentration across industries.
M&A volume in the first quarter clocked in at $1.01 trillion, the lowest total since the early days of the pandemic, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Leadership at top banks cautioned when they reported fourth-quarter results that 2021’s deal wave wouldn’t last, even as investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported their best quarter ever.
JPMorgan is first among the top six banks scheduled to report, with results for the New York-based company set for Wednesday. That’s followed by an avalanche on Thursday: Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) & Co. all report that day. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) comes next Monday.
Other key topics to watch in first-quarter earnings:
Trading
The same volatility clogging deal pipelines is hanging question marks over trading revenue at the banks. While projections suggest it will weaken along with investment banking, big swings in markets could mean banks will post better-than-expected results. 
Volatility was particularly intense in prices for materials such as crude, gas, wheat and metals as a gulf emerged between buyers and sellers who are facing big financing strains. Markets were roiled as the invasion of Ukraine constrained commodities flows, though in many cases rallies were quickly followed by a drop in prices.
“This is the type of quarter that will make those banks that exited commodities do a double take,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with  Wells Fargo . “The big outstanding question is, How will the market’s volatility impact the results? There’s likely to be winners and losers.”
Underwriting
Capital markets will probably be another weak spot. Companies aggressively issued debt to boost liquidity during the pandemic and take advantage of low interest rates. Now they’re sitting on comfortable stockpiles of cash with little need to borrow anytime soon.
On the equities side, a slowdown in listings by special purpose acquisition companies is hampering results. Deals done by blank-check firms were a key source of equity-underwriting business last year, but have since fallen off. And the market is still digesting a plan from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would curb legal protections around forward-looking statements the entities currently enjoy.  
Loan Growth
Banks’ lending businesses suffered through historically low interest rates and weak demand amid government stimulus programs. But dwindling federal aid programs combined with higher interest rates could deliver the most substantive increase in loan growth since the start of the pandemic.
Projections from the top banks indicate lending could show a first-quarter gain of 9% from a year earlier, which would be the highest level since the first quarter of 2020.
Lenders are also boosting the rates they charge on loans, with the amount paid out on deposits rising at a slower pace. Banks are benefiting from the Federal Reserve’s shift to higher rates to combat spiraling inflation brought on by pandemic-era pressures and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“The tailwinds for Main Street banking should be mitigated by headwinds in Wall Street banking,” Wells Fargo’s Mayo said.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Russia's state-owned nuclear power supplier Rosatom and its Finnish unit RAOS Project will proceed with a planned nuclear plant in Finland, RAOS said on Monday, despite uncertainty over government permits since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Rosatom and RAOS Project continue fulfilling their obligations under signed agreements and contracts relating to the Hanhikivi 1 project,"" RAOS Project told Reuters in an email.
Since Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, Finland's minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila has repeatedly said it would be ""absolutely impossible"" for the government to grant a construction permit for the Hanhikivi plant.
The plant was commissioned by a Finnish-Russian consortium dubbed Fennovoima, in which Finnish stakeholders such as Outokumpu, Fortum and SSAB own two thirds and Rosatom's subsidiary RAOS Voima holds the rest.
Many of the Finnish stakeholders have publicly expressed their will to pull out and write down the project, but are unwilling to pay RAOS Project for breach of existing contracts and possible indemnities.
Meanwhile, RAOS Project has continued preparatory construction work, such as cabling and excavation in the planned plant's site on the northwest coast of Finland, but cannot embark on building the facility without a government licence.
""RAOS Project Ltd as the ... supplier is acting based on and in accordance with the engineering, procurement and construction contract signed in December 2013 with Fennovoima,"" it wrote. 

Fennovoima had expected to obtain a construction licence from the government by summer 2022 to build the 1.2 gigawatt (GW) reactor, while construction was expected to begin in 2023.
Finland's government was not immediately available for comment.

Data show that car sales in the Chinese auto market plunged 11.4% in March from a year earlier to 2.23 million vehicles, even though sales have seen a sharp increase of 18.7% just a month earlier.
""The recent pandemic situation has been quite severe and so the figures in March were not too good, and we currently do not see much improvement in April,"" said Chen Shihua, the deputy secretary general of the CAAM.
Shihua said the car manufacturers were urging the authorities to provide support through new measures including the reduction of car purchase taxes.
The Omicron variant has spread rapidly across China, urging Beijing to introduce tighter measures and lockdowns, forcing some automakers, including Tesla, to temporarily shut down their factories.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) halted production at its Shanghai assembly plant on March 28, followed by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which suspended operations at its Shanghai joint venture in April.
Tesla produced just 55,462 cars last month when it was forced to suspend production for two days, just 154 more than in the 28-day long February. By comparison, the EV carmaker manufactured 68,117 units in January.
The new data also showed Tesla delivered 65,814 China-made cars in March; up 16.5% MoM. Strong local demand resulted in Tesla exporting just 60 EV units.
On Monday, Shanghai authorities said the lockdown will be eased in some areas of the city in a bid to revive the city after more than two weeks of strict measures.
The lockdown has significantly affected Shanghai residents, pressuring the city’s authorities to reduce the measures as some people struggle to access food and medicine.
Shanghai now plans to organize residents into three risk categories as a part of its plan to allow ""appropriate activity"" to those who live in neighborhoods with no Covid cases for two weeks.
""Each district will announce the specific names of the first batch (of communities) divided into the three types, and three subsequent lists will be announced in a timely manner,"" said Shanghai official Gu Honghui.
He added that the city was divided into 7,624 areas that are still under lockdown measures, while a group of 2,460 neighborhoods is to be reviewed after a week of no fresh infections. The last group of 7,565 ""prevention areas"" is set to have measures eased after two weeks of no infections.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, at the start of a holiday-shortened week that sees the new earnings season get underway and the release of key inflation data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 110 points, or 0.8%.
The main Wall Street indices suffered losses last week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, falling 3.9%, weighed by soaring U.S. Treasury yields.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at a yield of 2.75% on Monday, just off its highest level since March 2019, as investors positioned for the Federal Reserve to aggressively lift interest rates throughout the year to combat rampant inflation.
February's consumer price inflation reading of 7.9% was the largest annual increase in 40 years, and soaring commodity prices on the back of the Ukraine war mean March’s reading on Tuesday is expected to show that CPI climbed higher still, by an annualized 8.5%.
A strong inflation reading would likely add to investor concerns that tighter monetary policy could act as a drag on the economy.
A number of Fed policy makers are scheduled to speak during a week cut short by Friday’s Easter holiday, including Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, Raphael Bostic and Charles Evans later Monday. Their comments will be studied carefully for clues over the pace of future Fed tightening.
Also of interest this week is the start of the first quarterly earnings season, with the big U.S. banks first up. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) will report before the bell on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) follow on Thursday.

Oil prices fell Monday, continuing recent weakness as China’s lockdowns continue as its Covid outbreak worsens, weighing on demand from the world’s largest crude importer.

LISBON (Reuters) -Ailing Portuguese airline TAP posted an annual loss of 1.6 billion euros ($1.74 billion) on Monday, while voicing ""cautious optimism"" that 2022 would bring better results despite uncertainties caused by the Ukraine war and the pandemic.
The airline, which is 72.5% controlled by the Portuguese state, is under a Brussels-approved rescue plan worth 3.2 billion euros and was forced to reduce its fleet size, cut more than 2,900 jobs and reduce wages. 
TAP said its 2021 results were hurt by the closure of its aircraft maintenance business in Brazil and the depreciation of the euro against the dollar. 
The company, along with the rest of the industry, was still facing ""unprecedented levels of uncertainty"" due to various factors, from COVID-19 to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chief Executive Officer Christine Ourmieres-Widener told a news conference. 
Rising inflation may create further challenges, mostly due to the cost of materials and fuel, she said. 
Chief Financial Officer Goncalo Pires said the airline would need to ""continue to perform in line"" with its restructuring plan in order to present better results in the future. 
""Delivering the plan is about maximising revenue but also controlling costs,"" Pires told reporters. ""There are many external factors, so we need to find strategies to mitigate those.""
Under the restructuring plan, TAP also had to wind down and close its aircraft maintenance business in Brazil, which represented a non-recurring loss of 1.03 billion euros. 
In 2020, the airline posted a 1.2 billion euros loss due to the pandemic. Ourmieres-Widener said TAP was not likely to reach pre-pandemic levels before next year. 

The company transported 5.83 million passengers last year, up 25% on 2020, but only 34% of the pre-pandemic level in 2019.

Elder advocacy group AARP tipped Google to the scam last September following a complaint from a South Carolina resident who had sent $700 in digital gift cards to an online seller for a basset hound puppy that never came, according to Google's lawsuit in U.S. district court in San Jose.
Google is seeking monetary damages and a court order banning the accused user, Nche Noel of Cameroon. Noel did not respond to a request for comment through one of several puppy websites named in the lawsuit, and an attorney was not immediately listed for Noel in court records.
Noel used dozens of Gmail email and Google Voice accounts ""to communicate false promises to victims, register the fraudulent websites with U.S. internet hosting companies, and request and receive payments,"" the lawsuit states.
In addition to basset hounds, websites allegedly linked to Noel have offered maltipoo puppies and marijuana and prescription opiate cough syrup, according to the lawsuit.
Google policies bar use of its services in illegal activities. The lawsuit says the puppy scam harmed Google's reputation and cost it over $75,000 to investigate and remediate.
The company said that while it was unlikely that Noel would appear in court, an order against Noel could disrupt the alleged scam and deter copycats.
Previously, Google referred a similar case to the U.S. Justice Department. That Cameroonian puppy scammer pleaded guilty last year https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cameroonian-citizen-extradited-romania-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-defraud-online-purchasers.

Google has previously sued hackers based in Russia and marketing companies masquerading under its name. But the company said it was the first time it directly filed a consumer protection case before.
Google timed its filing to coincide with National Pet Day.

Investing.com -- Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell in premarket trading on Monday after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said at the weekend that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk won't join the board of the social media company after all. 
Twitter had offered Musk - the world's richest man and one of the most-followed people on the micro-blogging site - a board seat last week after Musk had disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company. 
Twitter stock had risen some 25% in response to the announcement, with many hoping that Musk would help reverse the stock's recent underperformance. Prior to the initial announcement, it had lost over half its value since peaking in February 2021.
Agrawal said that Musk had told the board on Saturday he wouldn't take up the offer of a board seat. In a statement on the platform, Agrawal said: ""I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.”
Musk, for his part, issued a series of tweets about Twitter - some serious, some joking - over the course of the weekend, including a suggestion that the company accept payments to its premium Blue service in the form of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that he has touted in the past. 
Agrawal's statement hinted that the board had been anxious to limit Musk's ability to disrupt its current strategy.
""We also believed that having Elon as a fiduciary of the company where he, like all board members, has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders, was the best path forward,” Agrawal said. 
Musk's activity on the site since disclosing his stake had indicated that he would seek to change various elements of the company's operations, despite styling his investment as ""passive"".  Investors considering a more 'activist' engagement are required to disclose more to the Securities and Exchanges Commission about their intentions - something which Musk has not yet done.

Loss of the two eastern markets would cost 25% of revenue, it said.
In response, it will enter Italy, Greece and Cyprus next year and continue expanding its ""Reserved"" brand in Germany and Britain.
""After the difficult period of the pandemic, we faced further challenges related to losing a significant part of the sales network,"" said Chief Financial Officer Przemyslaw Lutkiewicz, referring to the suspension of Ukrainian operations and decision to quit Russia.
""Despite this, the company's situation remains stable, and the expected revenues for the current financial year, more than 16 billion zlotys ($3.76 billion), allow us to think calmly about the future of LPP,"" Lutkiewicz added.
Since the company could not predict the future situation in Ukraine, it had decided to focus on EU markets where it was already present, he said. ""At the same time, we want to debut in new markets, especially in the southern European region, where we see growth potential for our brands.""
The company will also focus this year on developing its e-commerce business, which in the fourth quarter of its financial year to January 31, 2022, exceeded 30% of total sales. 

In the current year, the estimated value of revenues from online sales may reach 5 billion zlotys. That would be 31% if total revenue is 16 billion zlotys.

475,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 05:31AM ET</span>","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Drugmakers on Monday pledged to speed up the market launch of new drugs in underserved EU member states in a bid to avert stricter regulation by Brussels.
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said in a statement on Monday its members pledge to file for reimbursement by national health systems no later than two years after EU regulatory approval, ""provided that local systems allow it"".
While EU drug approval is largely centralised, with the European Medicines Agency acting as watchdog, procedures to subsequently set the treatment price for national health systems remain in the hands of member states and differ greatly.
The pledge would reduce the time patients wait for new medicines by four to five months in several countries such as Bulgaria, Poland and Romania, EFPIA said, citing estimates by market researcher IQVIA.
The lobby group warned that any new rules forcing drugmakers to bring new products to all EU countries within a certain deadline could backfire and discourage companies from bringing some products to public health systems in the region altogether.
""We understand that some of the proposals being discussed could introduce obligations for (drugmaker) to market or supply all EU Member States,"" EFPIA said in a separate report.
""The industry has concerns regarding the use of regulatory tools designed for medicines authorisation being applied to address availability issues that are within the remit of member states,"" it added.
The average lag between EU market clearance and large patient groups receiving a newly developed drug varies greatly within the bloc, ranging from 133 days in Germany and 497 days in France to 899 days, or 2.5 years, in Romania, according to the report.

EFPIA said that the delays were influenced by several regulatory factors beyond companies' control. 
The lobby group also said it was proposing a harmonised system of tiered drug pricing, based on a country’s ability to pay, to replace the highly diverse EU price-setting landscape.

The phone is being produced at a local plant of Apple's Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, situated in the town of Sriperumbudur in Southern Tamil Nadu state, according to a source.
Apple has been shifting some areas of iPhone production from China to other markets including India, the world's second biggest smartphone market, and is also planning to assemble iPad tablets there. 

India and countries such as Mexico and Vietnam are becoming increasingly important to contract manufacturers supplying American brands as they try to diversify production away from China.
The iPhone 13 is the fourth model to be produced locally after Apple launched manufacturing operations in India in 2017 with the iPhone SE.

Fundraising will be expanded to 32.29 billion yuan if an over-allotment ""greenshoe"" option to buy and sell more shares, issued to investment banks underwriting the deal, is fully exercised, the company said in a sales prospectus.
CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil producer, priced its Shanghai offering at 10.8 yuan ($1.69) per share, a 13% premium to its Hong Kong share price on Friday. It said it would use the share sale proceeds to fund one gas and seven oilfield projects in China and overseas, and to replenish capital. 
The firm's Hong Kong shares fell 3.3% in Hong Kong on Monday morning, more than the 2.5% drop in the benchmark Hang Seng index.
The Shanghai sale comes after CNOOC was delisted last October by the New York Stock Exchange after Washington added the firm to a trade blacklist citing suspected connections to the Chinese military. State-backed rivals PetroChina and Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) are already listed in Shanghai.
It also comes as a number of Chinese companies have paused Shanghai listing plans citing disruption to business life in the city, under lockdown to fight China's biggest coronavirus outbreak in two years.
CNOOC seeks to take advantage of soaring global oil prices as Russia's war on Ukraine pushes up already high energy prices. CNOOC expects first-quarter profit to jump 62%-89% from a year earlier, after registering record profit, and output in 2021.

CNOOC priced its Shanghai offering, which will make the top 10 of China's listing if the greenshoe option is fully exercised according to Refinitiv data, at 23.88 times earnings, or 1.05 times net assets.

Sales in the world's biggest car market tumbled 11.7% in March from a year earlier to 2.23 million vehicles - its first decline in three months and contrasting sharply with an 18.7% jump in February, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. 
""The recent pandemic situation has been quite severe and so the figures in March were not too good, and we currently do not see much improvement in April,"" said Chen Shihua, the association's deputy secretary general.
He added automakers were pressing the government for supportive measures such as cuts to the auto purchase tax. 
China has imposed strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, including in Jilin province and Shanghai.
Tesla has suspended production at its Shanghai factory since March 28, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Shanghai joint venture paused operations this month. Volkswagen and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp joint ventures with their Chinese partners in Changchun, Jilin's capital, have been suspended since mid-March.
Tesla only assembled 55,462 units in March when it also paused production for two days in the middle of the month, data from a separate association showed.
That was just 154 more than in February, a much shorter month for workers due to the Lunar New Year holiday. By comparison, the plant made 68,117 vehicles in January.
The data also showed Tesla's exports of cars made in China tumbled to just 60 in March, as domestic deliveries more than doubled from February. 
Chinese buyers have rushed to place orders, worried that Tesla may raise prices further after announcing price hikes in November and March due to the higher costs of raw materials. 
Tesla export data is patchy and can fluctuate wildly due to seasonal factors. It exported 33,315 China-made cars in February.
Other automakers hit hard by COVID curbs included electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) which said on Saturday it had suspended production after operations at its suppliers were disrupted. Its shares slumped 9% in Monday trade.

Battery giant CATL also said on Monday it has implemented a so-called ""closed-loop management"" system at its main factory to keep production going. A ""closed-loop management"" system is akin to a bubble-like arrangement, in which workers sleep, live and work in isolation from the rest of society to prevent virus transmission.
While China's overall March sales plummeted, sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, more than doubled in March to 484,000 vehicles. That was, however, sharply slower than a tripling of sales in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has acquired Netherlands-based asset manager  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners for 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to expand its asset management footprint in Europe and increase its sustainable investment capabilities.
NN Investment Partners, formerly part of NN Group, will be integrated into Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). The acquisition of the firm, which has more than 900 employees, brings Goldman's assets under supervision to approximately 2.8 trillion dollars.
Buying NN Investment Partners, based in The Hague, is part of Goldman Sachs’ plan to scale up its European operations. The business will push growth in products such as European equity and investment-grade credit, sustainable investments and ""green"" bonds.
It will also help GSAM deepen its integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) values into its operations. 
""This acquisition advances our commitment to put sustainability at the heart of our investment platform. It adds scale to our European client franchise and extends our leadership in insurance asset management,"" David Solomon, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said on Monday.
Solomon is looking to diversify the bank's revenue to focus on more predictable business such as consumer banking, wealth and asset management.

As part of the transaction, GSAM has entered into a long-term strategic partnership with NN Group to manage an approximately 180 billion dollar asset portfolio.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's $8 billion Amul dairy group said on Monday it is bracing for disruptions and higher input costs for some products from July when the government's ban on plastic straws kicks in.
India last week refused to waive an impending ban on straws that are packaged with small juice and milk beverage packs, stoking fears in the $790 million industry that includes players like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), India's Dabur and Parle Agro, Reuters reported.
Amul has not worked out any practical solution to replace the tiny plastic straws and the paper variant is not feasible, said R. S. Sodhi, Amul's managing director.
""The intention of the government is good ... (but) the straws are not even 0.1% of total plastic consumption,"" Sodhi told Reuters. 
""The entire industry will be impacted.""
Sodhi's comments underscore the growing tensions in India's drinks industry at a time when demand surges in the sweltering summer season.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing to stamp out polluting, single-use plastic trash that chokes rivers. The government believes the tiny straws are a ""low-utility product"" and should be scrapped for paper straws or spout pouches.
Amul, a household name in India best-known for its milk and butter products, clocked sales of 610 billion rupees ($8.04 billion) in 2021-22, Sodhi said. It also sells various milk-based beverages in small packs with straws. 
With the ban, supplies of such packs will be disrupted and manufacturers may shift to more expensive packaging solutions, thereby raising costs, Sodhi said, adding that Amul sells billions of such carton packs each year.

Pepsi's Tropicana juice and Coca-Cola's Maaza and Parle Agro's Frooti mango drinks are among other popular beverages sold in such packs. An industry body representing them and other beverage makers has said it plans to again raise concerns with the government, and Sodhi said Amul will follow suit.
""We will write to the appropriate authorities,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Monday at the start of a holiday-shortened week, with the investors digesting the French presidential election, slowing U.K. growth, an upcoming ECB policy-setting meeting as well as the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
By 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%, while CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%.
Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron won the first round of voting in Sunday’s French presidential election, beating the populist right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. 
Macron will now face a run-off against Le Pen in two weeks' time, in a repeat of the 2017 elections, creating a degree of uncertainty with opinion polls predicting a very tight battle in the second round.
A Le Pen victory could send shockwaves through Europe given her anti-European Union stance, but the gains on the CAC 40 early Monday suggest a degree of relief that Macron is ahead at this point.
Adding to the positive tone on the French market Monday was the news Monday that  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) has agreed to sell its stake in  Rosbank  (MCX:ROSB), ending a more than 15-year investment in the Russian lender. The French bank's stock soared 6% as investors reacted positively to the news that it was exiting the Russian market. 
The European Central Bank is set to hold its latest policy-setting meeting on Thursday, the day before Friday's Europe-wide holiday, and investors will be looking for guidance of future monetary policy with Eurozone inflation running at a record high 7.5% and showing no signs of peaking.
Policymakers will be reluctant to tighten policy amid uncertainty over the impact of the war in Ukraine on the bloc’s economy, but the more hawkish members of the ECB’s governing council will continue to push for interest rate hikes this year.
Evidence of the likely economic slowdown in the region came from the U.K., with the country’s GDP climbing just 0.1% on the month, a drop from the 0.8% increase seen the previous month. 
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later Monday in Moscow. This would be the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in late February.
Oil prices fell Monday, continuing recent weakness as China’s lockdowns continue as it COVID outbreak worsens, weighing on demand from the world’s largest crude importer.

Investing.com --  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) stock rose sharply by mid-morning on Monday as the French bank said it will sell its Russian subsidiary Rosbank (MCX:ROSB) back to its former owners, the latest in a string of moves by western institutions turning their back on the Russian market in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The French bank said it will take a total of 3.1 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in charges from writedowns of both  Rosbank  and its insurance operations in Russia, which it is also selling back to Interros, the holding company controlled by metals magnate Vladimir Potanin. The bank made no mention of a purchase price, except in so far as Interros will repay some $500 million of subordinated debt issued by SocGen to its subsidiary.
The move had been expected and the market was reassured by SocGen's assurances that the accompanying writedowns would have only a modest impact on its overall financial health. The bank's core tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of financial strength, will fall by only 20 basis points as a result of the disposal. At the end of last year, that capital ratio had stood at 13.7% - some 470 basis points above the regulatory minimum.
The move ends what had been an increasingly profitable venture for SocGen. Rosbank had contributed 152 million euros in net income to the group's bottom line in 2021, more than double what it earned in the first year of the pandemic.
The stock's reaction made SocGen the best performing stock in Paris on a morning when the overall market breathed a sigh of relief at incumbent Emmanuel Macron's narrow win in the first of two rounds of voting in the country's presidential elections.

The bombardment killed at least three people, including a child, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said publicly. Images of bloodied, heavily pregnant women fleeing through the rubble, their hands cradling their bellies, sparked immediate outrage worldwide.
Among the most-recognized women was Mariana Vishegirskaya, a Ukrainian fashion and beauty influencer. Photos of her navigating down a hospital stairwell in polka-dot pajamas circulated widely after the attack, captured by an Associated Press https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-edf7240a9d990e7e3e32f82ca351dede photographer.
Online expressions of support for the mother-to-be quickly turned to attacks on her Instagram account, according to two contractors directly moderating content from the conflict on Facebook and Instagram. They spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, citing non-disclosure agreements that barred them from discussing their work publicly.
The case involving the beauty influencer is just one example of how Meta's content policies and enforcement mechanisms have enabled pro-Russian propaganda during the Ukraine invasion, the moderators told Reuters.
Russian officialdom seized on the images, setting them side-by-side against her glossy Instagram photos in an effort to persuade viewers that the attack had been faked. On state television and social media, and in the chamber of the U.N. Security Council, Moscow alleged - falsely - that Vishegirskaya had donned make-up and multiple outfits in an elaborately staged hoax orchestrated by Ukrainian forces.
Swarms of comments accusing the influencer of duplicity and being an actress appeared underneath old Instagram posts of her posed with tubes of makeup, the moderators said.
At the height of the onslaught, comments containing false allegations about the woman accounted for most of the material in one moderator's content queue, which normally would have contained a mix of posts suspected of violating Meta's myriad policies, the person recalled.
""The posts were vile,"" and appeared to be orchestrated, the moderator told Reuters. But many were within the company's rules, the person said, because they did not directly mention the attack. ""I couldn't do anything about them,"" the moderator said.
Reuters was unable to contact Vishegirskaya.
Meta declined to comment on its handling of the activity involving Vishegirskaya, but said in a statement to Reuters that multiple teams are addressing the issue.
""We have separate, expert teams and outside partners that review misinformation and inauthentic behavior and we have been applying our policies to counter that activity forcefully throughout the war,"" the statement said.
Meta policy chief Nick Clegg separately told reporters on Wednesday that the company was considering new steps to address misinformation and hoaxes from Russian government pages, without elaborating.
Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media and the Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment.
Representatives of Ukraine did not respond to a request for comment.
'SPIRIT OF THE POLICY'
Based at a moderation hub of several hundred people reviewing content from Eastern Europe, the two contractors are foot soldiers in Meta's battle to police content from the conflict. They are among tens of thousands of low-paid workers at outsourcing firms around the world that Meta contracts to enforce its rules.
The tech giant has sought to position itself as a responsible steward of online speech during the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.
Just a few days into the war, Meta imposed restrictions on Russian state media and took down a small network of coordinated fake accounts that it said were trying to undermine trust in the Ukrainian government.
It later said it had pulled down another Russia-based network that was falsely reporting people for violations like hate speech or bullying, while beating back attempts by previously disabled networks to return to the platform.
Meanwhile, the company attempted to carve out space for users in the region to express their anger over Russia’s invasion and to issue calls to arms in ways Meta normally would not permit.
In Ukraine and 11 other countries across Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, it created a series of temporary ""spirit of the policy"" exemptions to its rules barring hate speech, violent threats and more; the changes were intended to honor the general principles of those policies rather than their literal wording, according to Meta instructions to moderators seen by Reuters.
For example, it permitted ""dehumanizing speech against Russian soldiers"" and calls for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, unless those calls were considered credible or contained additional targets, according to the instructions viewed by Reuters.
The changes became a flashpoint for Meta as it navigated pressures both inside the company and from Moscow, which opened a criminal case into the firm after a March 10 Reuters report made the carve-outs public. Russia also banned Facebook and Instagram inside its borders, with a court accusing Meta of ""extremist activity.""
Meta walked back elements of the exceptions after the Reuters report. It first limited them to Ukraine alone and then canceled one altogether, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, Meta's public statements, and interviews with two Meta staffers, the two moderators in Europe and a third moderator who handles English-language content in another region who had seen the advisories.
The documents offer a rare lens into how Meta interprets its policies, called community standards. The company says its system is neutral and rule-based.
Critics say it is often reactive, driven as much by business considerations and news cycles as by principle. It’s a complaint that has dogged Meta in other global conflicts including Myanmar, Syria and Ethiopia. Social media researchers say the approach allows the company to escape accountability for how its policies affect the 3.6 billion users of its services.
The shifting guidance over Ukraine has generated confusion and frustration for moderators, who say they have 90 seconds on average to decide whether a given post violates policy, as first reported by the New York Times. Reuters independently confirmed such frustrations with three moderators.
After Reuters reported the exemptions on March 10, Meta policy chief Nick Clegg said in a statement the next day that Meta would allow such speech only in Ukraine.
Two days later, Clegg told employees the company was reversing altogether the exemption that had allowed users to call for the deaths of Putin and Lukashenko, according to a March 13 internal company post seen by Reuters.
At the end of March, the company extended the remaining Ukraine-only exemptions through April 30, the documents show. Reuters is the first to report this extension, which allows Ukrainians to continue engaging in certain types of violent and dehumanizing speech that normally would be off-limits.
Inside the company, writing on an internal social platform, some Meta employees expressed frustration that Facebook was allowing Ukrainians to make statements that would have been deemed out of bounds for users posting about previous conflicts in the Middle East and other parts of the world, according to copies of the messages viewed by Reuters.
""Seems this policy is saying hate speech and violence is ok if it is targeting the 'right' people,"" one employee wrote, one of 900 comments on a post about the changes.
Meanwhile, Meta gave moderators no guidance to enhance their ability to disable posts promoting false narratives about Russia's invasion, like denials that civilian deaths have occurred, the people told Reuters.
The company declined to comment on its guidance to moderators.
DENYING VIOLENT TRAGEDIES
In theory, Meta did have a rule that should have enabled moderators to address the mobs of commenters directing baseless vitriol at Vishegirskaya, the pregnant beauty influencer. She survived the Mariupol hospital bombing and delivered her baby, the Associated Press https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-health-europe-bombings-259ec00f1a6c426603827985dac3a3e9 reported.
Meta's harassment policy prohibits users from ""posting content about a violent tragedy, or victims of violent tragedies that include claims that a violent tragedy did not occur,"" according to the Community Standards published on its website. It cited that rule when it removed posts by the Russian Embassy in London that had pushed false claims about the Mariupol bombing following the March 9 attack.
But because the rule is narrowly defined, two of the moderators said, it could be used only sparingly to battle the online hate campaign against the beauty influencer that followed.
Posts that explicitly alleged that the bombing was staged were eligible for removal, but comments such as ""you're such a good actress"" were considered too vague and had to stay up, even when the subtext was clear, they said.
Guidance from Meta enabling commenters to consider context and enforce the spirit of that policy could have helped, they added.
Meta declined to comment on whether the rule applied to the comments on Vishegirskaya's account.
At the same time, even explicit posts proved elusive to Meta's enforcement systems.
A week after the bombing, versions of the Russian Embassy posts were still circulating on at least eight official Russian accounts on Facebook, including its embassies in Denmark, Mexico and Japan, according to an Israeli watchdog organization, FakeReporter.
One showed a red ""fake"" label laid over the Associated Press photos of Mariupol, with text claiming the attack on Vishegirskaya was a hoax, and pointing readers to ""more than 500 comments from real users"" on her Instagram account condemning her for participating in the alleged ruse.
Meta removed those posts on March 16, hours after Reuters asked the company about them, a spokesperson confirmed. Meta declined to comment on why the posts had evaded its own detection systems.

The following day, on March 17, Meta designated Vishegirskaya an ""involuntary public person,"" which meant moderators could finally start deleting the comments under the company's bullying and harassment policy, they told Reuters.
But the change, they said, came too late. The flow of posts related to the woman had already slowed to a trickle.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An aggressive Federal Reserve, soaring inflation and geopolitical uncertainty from the war in Ukraine are muddying the outlook for the upcoming U.S. earnings season, leaving some strategists wary of surprises as corporate results kick off this week.
Expectations for earnings growth have largely held up in recent weeks, despite a first quarter that saw commodities prices surge after Russia invaded Ukraine, threatening to exacerbate already-high consumer prices. 
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have increased by about 6% in the first three months of 2022 from a year ago and forecast profit growth of about 9% for the year, forecasts in line with those at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The reporting period for S&P 500 companies begins this week with results from major banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday.
Some worry, however, that a cocktail of rising prices, higher wages and tightening financial conditions may have weighed on some companies' balance sheets or clouded expectations for the rest of the year. 
""The environment is very different this quarter. There are so many things going on,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. ""It will be fascinating to see how companies respond."" 
Earnings season comes on the heels of a tumultuous quarter for asset prices that saw the S&P 500 swoon nearly 13% before paring losses in a furious rebound late last month. The index is down about 6% for the year-to-date.
Energy and other commodity prices have surged, with Brent crude futures up 32% for the year so far. The war in Ukraine has also created worries about supply and transportation problems, adding to concerns that have been building since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
That's led a number of companies to warn about the impact of rising raw material and other costs on margins in recent weeks, including packaged food company Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc, which this month lowered its full-year profit forecast. 
""I see capital more expensive, labor more expensive, commodities more expensive,"" Ablin said. ""Unless these firms can pass these costs along - and arguably they'll be able to pass along some but not all... That says to me, margins have to decline."" 
Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wages, another negative for companies. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rebounded in March amid growing labor market optimism. 
In March, the Fed raised rates for the first time since 2018 and policymakers have signaled they are ready to aggressively fight the fastest consumer price growth in nearly four decades with meaty rate hikes and balance sheet runoff, leading some investors to worry that the central bank's monetary policies may bring on a recession. 
With earnings, ""it's easy to identify the multiple negatives,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""The question is how much of those negatives have already been priced into individual company shares."" 
Given recent market volatility and nervousness heading into earnings season, he said, ""The only guarantee is there are going to be outsized moves in both directions from individual companies"" following their reports. 
Among sectors, analysts expect a massive year-over-year jump in energy earnings in the first quarter because of the higher oil prices, while materials' growth also is expected to have benefited from surging prices. 
Meanwhile, big banks are expected to report a large decline in earnings from a year earlier, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading.
At the same time, major U.S. companies including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) have halted sales in Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine in late February. While overall S&P 500 companies' revenue exposure to Russia is relatively small, the war, which Russia calls a ""special operation,"" adds to the uncertain outlook for companies. 
Overall, corporate margins have held up, ""so the market can take some margin contraction, only because we're coming from such high rates,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. 

Still, the rate of earnings growth has slowed from last year, when companies were rebounding sharply from the lows of the pandemic, he said. S&P 500 profit growth for all of 2021 was about 52%, based on Refinitiv data. 
""This is going to be a normalization year, so to speak, where growth rates are slower,"" Wren said. ""You don't have all of this fiscal and monetary stimulus. That's what the market has to adjust to.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese question-and-answer website Zhihu Inc opened its bookbuilding process on Monday to raise $133 million in a dual primary listing in Hong Kong, according to its regulatory filings and a term sheet seen by Reuters.
The deal comes amid a regulatory standoff between Washington and Beijing over access to Chinese company audits, a dispute that is casting doubt on the fuure of those companies listed in the United States.
Zhihu, which listed in New York in March last year, is selling 26 million existing shares in the Hong Kong deal, which will be finalised on Thursday, the filings showed.
Four major shareholders, led by investors Capital Today and Innovation Works, are selling some of their stakes in Zhihu, according to the term sheet.
Zhihu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
With Zhihu's service, users publicly post questions to which others offer replies.
An increasing number of Chinese firms listed in the U.S are considering secondary or dual primary listings in Hong Kong in case U.S. delistings are ordered, sources have previously told Reuters.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing has previously barred foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said earlier this month it would revise the confidentiality rules involving offshore listings, which could remove a legal hurdle to the company-audit standoff.
The proposal centres on scrapping requirements that on-site inspection of overseas-listed Chinese companies be conducted mainly by Chinese regulators.
The move could allow inspections by U.S. regulators who demand complete access to such firms' audit working papers, which are stored in China.
Zhihu's New York listed shares have fallen 53.8% so far in 2022.

(Reuters) - Houston, we have a problem! 
U.S. rocket companies are facing the daunting task of ferrying hundreds of satellites to space in the coming years as sanctions sideline the Russian space launch industry.
SpaceX, Astra Space and Rocket Lab USA are among a handful of U.S. companies expected to fill the vacuum, but industry officials have doubts about their capacity to quickly ramp-up. 
As the race between companies, including Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Project Kuiper, for building giant satellite constellations to beam broadband internet from space heats up, demand for launches is expected to skyrocket.
More than 800 satellites under 100 kilograms are expected to be put in orbit this year alone, nearly double the number of launches in 2021, according to data from launch service aggregator Precious Payload. 
Small satellite launches set to double in 2022: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SATELLITELAUNCHES/zjvqkdllwvx/chart.png 
And with Project Kuiper taking up significant capacity over the next few years, analysts expect the industry to face some launch-related delays.
""Come 2024, 2025, when all these mega constellations need a launch, there is going to be a real problem,"" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told Reuters, referring to the networks of communications satellites being built by SpaceX, AST Spacemobile and OneWeb.
Rocket Lab is among a new breed of firms building miniaturized propulsion systems to cash in on an exponential rise in demand for putting compact satellites in the so-called low earth orbit.
In 2021, satellites launched by OneWeb and SpaceX accounted for the launch of about three-quarters of small satellites, according to industry analytics firm BryceTech.
Still, Russia maintained a 16% share of the global launch market over the past five years, according to historical databases. 
Russia's market share over the past five years: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SATELLITELAUNCHES/movanbrrdpa/chart.png 
Its share was actually larger, given that Soyuz rockets were also launched under a since-suspended French-Russian joint venture named Starsem.
About two-thirds of Soyuz launches were commercial or in support of the International Space Station (ISS), while the rest were for Russia's domestic customers, Quilty Analytics analyst Caleb Henry said. 
If access to Russia's capabilities are lost due to Western sanctions on the country for its invasion of Ukraine, companies in Europe and the United States will have to quickly step in to meet demand.
That, however, may not be all that easy, given the complexities and challenges involved in building and launching new rockets.
""It is always possible that new vehicles will come online faster, thanks to improved manufacturing techniques, but precedent suggests it will be difficult to achieve high launch cadences for the next few years,"" analyst Henry said.
Rocket Lab's Beck said the launch crisis would also apply to smaller satellites used to image the Earth and conduct scientific observation that usually share a ride to orbit on a rocket with other satellites.
LAUNCH CRUNCH
Delayed launches can affect satellite internet companies in multiple ways. There is a risk of losing launch rights if they do not adhere to an FCC mandated deadline, while some firms may not see return on investment unless their satellite is in orbit.
United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), is set to replace its Russian engines with those made by Jeff Bezos-backed Blue Origin. Still, Western launch companies have a long way to go.
However, Amazon's blockbuster launch contracts for Project Kuiper can incentivize rocket makers to speed up production, industry experts say.
SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle is set to be in mass production sooner and analysts expect it to meet some demand. The company also launches satellites for and operates Starlink.
""Longer term, launch constraints can be alleviated by Starship. Starship could crush pricing in the commercial market if Elon wants to, but my prediction is he is much more focused on getting humans to Mars,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Edison Yu.

Yu added that ""new space companies"" such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Astra Space are the winners when demand rises and there is no dependence from satellite manufacturers around the world on Russia's Soyuz rocket.
Earlier this year, OneWeb decided to abandon Russian launch services and signed a deal with rival SpaceX to put its satellites in orbit.

That has resulted in events of default, according to the company. 
Zhenro also said it might not be able to pay a combined $32.6 million of interest due on three other dollar bonds before grace periods end between April 10 and May 14.

Investors in Chinese equities are confronting multiple challenges at home and broad, causing the market to plunge again despite the mid-March vows from authorities to support the economy and the battered property and tech sectors. Record virus infections in Shanghai, a more-than-expected jump in China factory gate prices, concerns about tech regulations and surging U.S. yields all combined to trigger Monday’s losses.
“There’s very little to be optimistic about,” said Zhang Fushen, senior analyst at Shanghai PD Fortune Asset Management (LLP). “The shine from policy pledges of a few weeks ago is starting to wear off, especially with the situation in Shanghai. There is a gloomy atmosphere.”
The Hang Seng Tech gauge was on course for a fourth day of losses. That’s after China’s State Council issued new guidelines over the weekend on removing data monopoly at platform companies and preventing them from restricting competition.
Investors are also keenly watching for developments related to a potential delisting of Chinese companies at American exchanges as Beijing vowed to defuse risks with a radical proposal.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with bonds continuing a selloff as investor concerns about inflation and monetary tightening continue. However, incumbent Emmanuel Macron is in the lead after the first round of the French presidential vote.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.93% by 10:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 2.53%. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.68%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.66% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.53%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Investors breathed a sigh of relief over the results in France, but questions remain as to whether Macron can maintain the lead against rival Marine Le Pen in Apr.24’s runoff.
U.S. futures fell, indicating further challenges ahead for global shares as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues tightening its monetary policy.
“Today, the mantra for many investors is ‘Don’t fight the Fed when it is fighting inflation,’” Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni said in a note.
“We agree with that, but it’s not as bearish as it sounds,” in part because accumulated excess liquidity and an inflation boost to earnings are beneficial for stocks, the note added.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she is confident that the U.S. will avoid a recession even amid tighter policy, although the inflation rate will likely remain at more than 2% into 2023. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak later in the day, followed by Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin a day later. Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will speak on Thursday.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.72%, around the highest since 2019, while Australia’s 10-year bond yield hit 3% for the first time since 2015.
The war in Ukraine precipitated by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, a hawkish Fed, and the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns in China also continue to drive investor concerns.
Russia appointed General Alexander Dvornikov as the new commander for its military operations in Ukraine, in a bid to refocus its war effort after failing to secure territory around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) confirmed on Sunday it plans to cut its summer schedule in a bid to avert flight disruptions as it works to ramp up hiring.
An airline spokesman confirmed an email to staff on Saturday, reported earlier by CNBC, that said JetBlue had ""already reduced May capacity 8-10% and you can expect to see a similar size capacity pull for the remainder of the summer.""
U.S. airlines are working to aggressively ramp up hiring as they prepare for an expected spike in summer travel demand as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. Since September, several major U.S. airlines have been forced at times to cancel hundreds or thousands of flights after severe weather disruptions.
The New York-based airline said on Sunday that ""given we anticipate continued industry challenges and heavy demand into the summer, we are planning more conservatively and trying to be proactive where we can with cancellations due to disruptive weather and air traffic control events.""
JetBlue canceled 148 flights, or 13% of its schedule on Sunday and delayed 39% of its flights, according to FlightAware, after canceling 18% of flights Saturday and delaying 48%.
The airline added that ""to get our operation back on track this week and provide additional recovery options for the potential of additional April weather events, we are cancelling some flights this weekend and will be making a small schedule adjustment through the rest of the month.""

JetBlue said despite hiring more than 3,000 new crew members in 2022, ""we remain staffing constrained, and these disruptions exacerbate an already challenging staffing situation."" It said it was adding ""hundreds of new crewmembers each week as we prepare for summer travel.""
JetBlue last week made an unsolicited offer of $33 per share in cash to buy  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), surpassing a near $25 per share cash-and-stock bid from Frontier Group Holdings made in February. Spirit said on Thursday it would start talks with JetBlue on its $3.6 billion offer.

Relative to its peers, diversification is going to be a very important thing that investors will need to get on top of and understand how to properly value the business,"" said Shane Chesson, a partner at Openspace Ventures, one of Gojek's earliest investors.
Indonesia's digital economy is likely to grow nearly five times to up to $330 billion by 2030 from 2021, showed a study by consultancy Bain & Co and GoTo backers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.
While U.S.-listed peers Grab Holdings Ltd and Sea Ltd operate across Southeast Asia, GoTo focuses on Indonesia. With 2.5 million drivers, 14 million merchants and 55 million annual transacting users, GoTo's businesses straddle millions of small and mid-sized firms across the archipelago.
Angus Mackintosh, founder at CrossASEAN Research, said in a report on Smartkarma that key to GoTo's IPO was that it was small and offered only to local investors. ""This should mean that there is stronger support.""
GoTo is selling 4% in shares with most taken up by funds. Backed by names such as SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GoTo is also broadening its investor base by allocating shares to 600,000 drivers.
It will also be first to issue multiple class voting shares and tap new rules allowing unprofitable firms to list directly on the bourse's main board.
Analysts said the size and valuation are lower than expected, and that GoTo likely aimed to avoid a repeat of the experience of e-commerce peer PT Bukalapak.com Tbk.
Bukalapak raised $1.5 billion in July selling 25% of equity after initially targeting $300 million. Its stock debuted strongly but tumbled 25% within days and has halved from its IPO price.
GoTo priced its shares at 338 rupiah ($0.0235), the high end of its indicative range.
Its investors are subject to an eight-month lock-in, or two years for those with multiple class voting shares. With Bukalapak, though there was an eight-month lock-in, some funds could sell up to 10% of holdings immediately.
GoTo will become Indonesia's fourth most-valuable firm at $28 billion, with analysts estimating an index weighting of up to 9%.
""Once you're in the index, all the local funds buy quasi automatically,"" said one GoTo investor. The IDX is at a record high and is Asia's best-performer this year at 9%.
GoTo President Patrick Cao said weak markets prompted caution with pricing. Still, the firm expects listing to support fundraising and plans to list overseas within two years.

""It is a very challenging environment in the public market now, with market caps of DiDi Global Inc, Grab, DeliveryHero and many others falling below the target valuation of GoTo,"" said Jianggan Li at advisory Momentum Works.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos on Sunday backed an idea put forth by Elon Musk, who recently became Twitter's largest shareholder, to convert the social networking firm's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter as few people are working there during the pandemic.
Bezos tweeted https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1513251374774972417 an article by technology-focused blog GeekWire from May 2020 about Amazon's eight-floor family homeless shelter attached to its Seattle headquarters, saying the initiative worked out great and makes it easy for employees who wish to volunteer. 
Bezos also suggested converting at least a portion of Twitter's headquarters, if not all of it, into a homeless shelter. Musk agreed in another tweet, calling it a ""Great idea.""
Musk, who has more than 81 million followers on Twitter, started a poll on Saturday, asking users to vote if the building should be converted. The poll gained over a million votes in less than a day, with more that 90% saying yes. 
The chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, who frequently tweets about his company and other topics, has been known to leave people confused as to whether he is joking. However, Musk clarified this time he was not joking. ""I'm serious about this one btw,"" he tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1513199588454264832, following up on the topic on Sunday.

""As a result of this examination, voestalpine is currently in negotiations to sell 80% of its shares in voestalpine Texas.""
Talks were at an advanced stage, it said, without disclosing a potential sales price.
Voestalpine announced plans to invest 550 million euros in a state-of-the-art plant in Corpus Christi in 2013.
The $1 billion plant in Corpus Christi opened in October 2016, with an annual capacity of 2 million tonnes of high-quality hot briquetted iron, or sponge iron, a pre-material used in steel production.
However, the plant has since faced setbacks ranging from construction delays to cost overruns totaling more than a billion dollars, as well as a challenging market situation amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Following write-offs, the Texas operation was valued at 448 million euros, Chief Financial Officer Robert Ottel said in November 2020.

Voestalpine recognised an impairment loss of 163 million euros on the Texas operations for its 2020-21 reporting year, as the plant was confronted with ""sharply lower"" demand. 
However, during the first three quarters of its current 2021-22 reporting year, the Texas plant had benefited from ""good demand for steel in North America,"" the Austrian firm said in February, when it said it expected full-year earnings across the group at the upper end of its forecast.

The European Union on Friday formally adopted new sanctions against Russia, which will ban a range of imports and also ban all transactions with four Russian banks, including VTB.
BaFin said following the sanctions, management at VTB's Frankfurt-based subsidiary is no longer allowed to take instructions from the parent bank, and that the parent company cannot access the financial assets or economic resources of its European unit. 
The measures ""result in a complete ring-fencing of VTB Bank (Europe) SE from the parent company,"" BaFin said.
VTB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
VTB was one of the Russian banks excluded from the SWIFT messaging system, in what was a big blow to its ability to transfer money.

But the new EU sanctions will block all transactions with the bank.
BaFin also said savers who have deposits with VTB's European subsidiary would still have access to their funds.

Musk, who disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter just days ago, was offered a seat on its board of directors, a move which made some Twitter employees panic over the future of its ability to moderate content.
Twitter Blue, launched in June 2021, is Twitter's first subscription service and offers ""exclusive access to premium features"" on a monthly subscription basis, Twitter says. It is available in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In a Twitter post, the head of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc suggested that users who sign up for Twitter Blue should pay significantly less than the current $2.99 a month, and should get an authentication checkmark as well as an option to pay in local currency.
""Price should probably be ~$2/month, but paid 12 months up front & account doesn't get checkmark for 60 days (watch for credit card chargebacks) & suspended with no refund if used for scam/spam,"" Musk said in a tweet. 
""And no ads,"" Musk suggested. ""The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.""
Musk also proposed an option to pay with dogecoin and asked Twitter users for their views.
Twitter declined to comment on Musk's suggestions.

The company already lets people tip their favorite content creators using bitcoin. Twitter had said last year that it planned to support authentication for NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital assets such as images or videos that exist on a blockchain.

Fellow carmakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW have already committed to doing that.

508,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Russia faces its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles earlier this week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars.
S&P on Saturday lowered the country's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honour its commitments to foreign debtholders.
Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". 
Here are answers to key questions: 
CAN RUSSIA PAY?
Russia was due to make a payment of $649 million to holders of two of its sovereign bonds on Monday. But the U.S. Treasury blocked the transfer, preventing Russia from using any of its frozen foreign currency reserves for servicing its debt. 
Coming up with an alternative, Russia placed the rouble equivalent of those payments for bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations in special accounts at its National Settlement Depository.
Moscow has a 30-day grace period from the payment date, which was Apr. 4. 
Analysts say Russia has the means and ability to pay. The country receives billions in U.S. dollars in revenue from energy exports, and while around half its foreign exchange reserves are frozen, it has hundreds of millions that are not. 
Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, said this was likely a ""willingness-to-pay situation."" 
The U.S. Treasury did not ban correspondence banking with Russia, subject to checks, and has granted a license to allow for payments relating to Moscow servicing sovereign debt until May 25. 
All this means it looks like Russia could still make the payment, if it wanted to, according to analysts. 
WHAT TYPE OF DEFAULT? 
At its most basic level, a default is a breach of contract, though the term can cover a variety of scenarios. 
Payment default is a failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts due after the grace period has passed, according to a paper by restructuring experts file:///C:/Users/8017535/Downloads/chapter-7-sovereign-default.pdf at the International Monetary Fund. 
However, there are also technical defaults due to events such as administrative errors, generally viewed by market participants as minor and swiftly remedied. 
Legal experts say payment in the wrong currency, in this case roubles, constitutes a non-payment. 
Russia has dismissed the notion of a default. 
""In theory, a default situation could be created but this would be a purely artificial situation,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. ""There are no grounds for a real default."" 
WHO WOULD CALL A DEFAULT? 
A default is a state of affairs, not a credit rating though markets often look to credit-rating agencies to declare a default has occurred. 
S&P, assigning Russia a ""selective default"" rating, said it did not expect investors would be able to convert the rouble payments into dollars equivalent or that the government will convert those payments within a 30-day grace period. 
With major ratings agencies having withdrawn ratings on Russia it is not entirely clear what manner of announcements might be made. 
A default will have wider ramifications. 
It could, for example, trigger credit default swaps (CDS) - an insurance policy bought by investors for such a case. A determinations committee will take a view on whether a ""non-payment"" event has occurred. However, such a decision is generally taken after the grace period has passed. 
There are around $6 billion worth of CDS contracts outstanding on Russia. 
WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN? 
Russia could unilaterally declare a moratorium - a temporary or permanent payment stop.
Made as an announcement or legislation separate from the missed payment, a moratorium can come before or after the payment default, according to the IMF. 
A government might announce a moratorium as an interim measure to halt payments before launching a debt restructuring, as Mexico did in 1982. 
The declaration of a moratorium is also one of the potential triggers for CDS contracts. 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A DEFAULT? 

Debt obligations at risk of, or already in, default are often snapped up by funds specialising in distressed situations, either hoping to make money when a restructuring is eventually worked out or to litigate in courts with the aim of getting compensation or seizing a debtor's assets instead. 
However, litigation and asset seizures are lengthy and costly processes. Many previous attempts have been unsuccessful, such as when creditors tried to seize Argentina's famous navy vessel https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2135.en.pdf, the ARA Libertad, in 2012 over a debt default a decade earlier or Argentine dinosaur fossils exhibited in Europe.

On Saturday, a message on YouTube said the Duma channel had been ""terminated for a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service"".
YouTube, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's, has been under pressure from Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and officials were quick to respond.
""From the look of it, YouTube has signed its own warrant. Save content, transfer (it) to Russian platforms. And hurry up,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging service.
The communications watchdog said it had requested Google restore access to the Duma channel immediately.
""The American IT company adheres to a pronounced anti-Russian position in the information war unleashed by the West against our country,"" Roskomnadzor said.
Google told Reuters in an emailed comment that is was committed to compliance with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws.
""If we find that an account violates our Terms of Service, we take appropriate action. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation for any updates and changes."" 
Vyacheslav Volodin, the Duma's speaker, said YouTube's move was further proof of rights and freedom violations by Washington.
""The USA wants to obtain a monopoly on promoting information. We cannot let it happen,"" Volodin said on Telegram.
Russia has already restricted access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms' flagships Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram since sending thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Russia had earlier tried to ban the Telegram messaging app, now widely used by officials, but lifted its ban in mid-2020.
Some Russian media cast the move as a capitulation, but Roskomnadzor said it had acted as it did because the app's Russian founder, Pavel Durov, was prepared to cooperate in combating terrorism and extremism on the platform.

In reports issued by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis ahead of an April 29 general meeting to name a new board at Generali, the two proxy advisers urged shareholders to support the slate of board nominees put forward by the outgoing board.
The board's proposed reappointment of Donnet has been challenged by Italian tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of Generali and is its second biggest shareholder behind investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Mediobanca backs Donnet, while Generali's third-biggest investor, Italian eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, has sided with construction magnate Caltagirone.
The tussle for control of Europe's No.3 insurer threatens the stability of a group that is a cornerstone of Italy's financial system and a major holder of its public debt.
Glass Lewis said it did not believe Caltagirone's alternative plan for Generali made a compelling case to suggest the group had suffered from poor operational performance, missed targets or subpar investor returns.
""We believe the Dissident's central strategic thesis ultimately tilts from the attractively ambitious to the disconcertingly optimistic,"" it said in the report, of which Reuters saw a copy.
In pledging to grow Generali's earnings per share in coming years roughly twice as fast than envisaged by Donnet's plan, Caltagirone has put forward a veteran Generali executive, Luciano Cirina, as his own CEO candidate.

""The dissident plan is indeed more ambitious than the company's, but it appears unclear if Caltagirone's offers a superior path after considering factors like execution skills, feasibility, and risk,"" ISS said.
""In terms of governance, Caltagirone has been 14 years on the board and his accusations appear strangely timed after such a long tenure,"" it added.

“It is also one of our financing options, but we need to prove to them that we are qualified,” Vingroup Chairman Pham Nhat Vuong told a group including reporters.
VinFast said this week that its Singapore-based holding company had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with U.S. securities regulators, as the company readies a $4-billion investment to build a factory in the United States.
VinFast, which began operations in 2019, is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with two all-electric SUVs and a battery leasing model that will reduce the purchase price.
Vuong said VinFast was committed to an IPO that would help establish the electric vehicle maker as a global brand, but added: “if the conditions are not right we can wait.”
""We ourselves are determined to push and committed to this IPO, but the highest target for the IPO is not financing but to set up VinFast in the global market,"" he told the group.
Lending from the U.S. government's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (AVTM) loan programme was another option VinFast was exploring, Vuong said, in response to a question.
The $25-billion fund was established by Congress in 2007 when Detroit-based automakers were tipping into crisis. It is administered by the Department of Energy still has a lending capacity of almost $18 billion, according to its website.

VinFast has promised to create 7,500 jobs at its planned plant in North Carolina, where it will build the battery-powered VF8 and VF9 SUVs. The company has said it plans to begin construction of the plant as soon as permits are granted with a goal of starting production by 2024.

(Reuters) - Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co on Friday said they still plan to seek accelerated U.S. approval for experimental Alzheimer's drugs even after the Medicare health plan decided to severely limit coverage of medicines approved in that manner.
On Thursday, after a months-long review and a pressure campaign from patient advocacy groups, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would only pay for Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm, and other drugs that work in a similar fashion, for patients enrolled in valid clinical studies, unless the treatments demonstrate clear evidence of patient benefit.
Medicare covers nearly 64 million Americans age 65 and older, so the coverage decision could affect 85% of people who might otherwise use the medications for the age-related condition. 
Eisai's lecanemab and Lilly's donanemab, like Aduhelm, are monoclonal antibodies designed to remove beta-amyloid, a type of protein fragment that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The two drugmakers said they expect upcoming Phase III trial results to eventually validate earlier-stage data under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA in June authorized Biogen's Aduhelm - the first drug in this class and first U.S. approved Alzheimer's treatment in 20 years - under the agency's accelerated pathway based on the drug's plaque-clearing ability, rather than proof it slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients.
Medicare, however, has decided to allow standard reimbursement only for Alzheimer's drugs approved under the traditional FDA process based on ""a direct measure of clinical benefit."" 
Eisai, which is partnered with Biogen, said it aims to complete a rolling FDA application for lecanemab, under the accelerated pathway, by mid-year. The Japanese drugmaker said it also expects results from its 1,800-patient, Phase III trial this fall.
If those results are positive, Eisai said it believes the large study could meet the ""high level of evidence"" criteria set by Medicare in its coverage decision.
The study is designed to show that lecanemab can slow by at least 25% the rate of cognitive and functional decline. 
""It is a disease-modifying drug,"" Ivan Cheung, Eisai's U.S. chairman, said in a recent interview with Reuters. ""You expect to see separation between the treated and untreated groups that improves over time.""
Roche also expects to report Phase III trial results for gantenerumab later this year.
Lilly, in a statement, said it intends to complete its current, rolling application for accelerated FDA approval of donanemab this year. It does not expect to have results from a Phase III trial of the drug until mid-2023. 
The Indianapolis-based company said it believes Medicare coverage restrictions are ""unnecessary, restrictive and inappropriate"" for FDA-approved drugs.
The idea that removing amyloid plaques is reasonably likely to slow cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer’s is known as the ""amyloid hypothesis,"" a theory that has led to long history of drugs that tried and failed to clear the plaques or help patients.
Greg Rippon, neuroscience and Alzheimer's Disease medical lead at Roche's Genentech unit, explained in a recent interview that the theory is supported by analysis of inherited forms of Alzheimer's, which are all caused by mutations in amyloid processing.
He said more recent studies have shown that the build-up of amyloid is a precursor to other brain dysfunction that speeds neurodegeneration for patients with Alzheimer's.

    ""Obviously, it comes down to clinical data and demonstrating that clinical benefit and that's where a lot of skepticism is centered,"" Rippon said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield hit a three-year high above 2.7% on Friday while the U.S. dollar index posted its largest weekly percentage gain in a month, helped by the prospect of more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower in choppy trade as investors assessed the economic outlook with the Fed moving to fight inflation. 
This week's release of minutes from the Fed's March meeting showed ""many"" officials were prepared to raise rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months.
The dollar index advanced to 100 for the first time in nearly two years. It rose as high as 100.19, its highest since May 2020. It was last little changed on the day at 99.822, and up 1.3% on the week.
As the dollar has gained in recent weeks, the euro has been pressured by a tightening election race in France, the euro zone's second-biggest economy, between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Macron is still ahead in polls.
The euro dropped for the seventh straight session to a one-month low of $1.0837. It last changed hands at $1.0853, down 0.3% on the day. 
""The dollar's latest pop is the culmination of bullish factors ranging from geopolitical risk, election uncertainty in France, and the Fed's increasingly hawkish outlook for interest rates,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
In Treasuries, the 10-year yield hit 2.73%, its highest since March 2019, and the yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities went within 15 basis points of turning positive for the first time in over two years.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 5.2 basis points to 2.706% while the 2-year note yield was up 5.8 basis points at 2.520%, leaving the 2/10 spread at 18.41 basis points.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4%, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27%, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34%, to 13,711.00.

French presidential election risk was also evident in bond markets as French borrowing costs rose while yields of other core European government bonds fell. 
In the energy market, oil prices rose 2% on the day, but registered their second straight weekly decline.

Member nations of the International Energy Agency (IEA) will release 60 million barrels over the next six months, with the United States matching that amount as part of its 180 million barrel release announced in March.
Brent crude futures settled up $2.20, or 2.19%, at $102.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $2.23 to $98.26.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Dow rose and the S&P 500 ended lower in choppy trade on Friday, as beaten-down bank shares gained and investors grappled with how best to deal with an economy that could skid as the Federal Reserve moves to aggressively tackle inflation.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a three-year high of 2.73%, helping boost the S&P banking index, which rose 1.18%, after slumping to 13-month lows on Thursday. The index is down 10.8% year to date.
The big rate-sensitive lenders all rose, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) gaining 1.8%, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) 0.7%,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) 1.7% and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) 2.3%.
Since peaking at two-month highs in late March, the market has trended lower as the Fed signals it will aggressively hike rates, leading investors to reposition their portfolios. Economically sensitive value shares this year have outperformed tech-heavy growth stocks, which often depend on low rates.
""We're going into a very long-term and meaningful period of value outperforming growth. It's not merely a cyclical adjustment, but a secular story,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at wealth manager the Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
""The value-growth story is a big one and it is a byproduct of two things, which is what you want. Growth is overvalued and value is undervalued,"" he said.
The Russell 1000 Value index rose 0.51% while the Russell 1000 Growth index fell 1.09% on the day. 
Investors are weighing the probability of a recession with two outcomes. On the one hand, the Fed could engineer a ""soft landing"" with slowing but positive growth, making banks ""woefully oversold,"" said UBS bank analyst Erika Najarian. 
Or a sharp slowdown is imminent, which would cause a knee-jerk bank share sale as ""owning banks in a recession is no fun,"" she said.
Big U.S. banks, which kick off the first-quarter results season next week, are expected to report a large decline in earnings from a year earlier, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading.
""There's always going to be a price at some point where people are going to step in and think things are cheap and they might buy,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives, at Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
""Perhaps a 52-week low was enough to entice some people into the financial sector,"" Frederick said, noting the 10-year Treasury yield was at its highest level since March 2019.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4%, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27%, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34%, to 13,711.00.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.37 billion shares.
For the week, the S&P fell 1.16%, the Dow lost 0.28% and the Nasdaq shed 3.86%, as the index was hit after Fed officials raised concerns about rapid rate hikes causing a slowdown.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc fell between 1.9% and 4.5% as megacap stocks extended this week's decline as the surge in Treasury yields weighed.
The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), fell 1.76% and semiconductor stocks slid 2.42%, extending the week's decline.
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 6.88% after a report said Goldman Sachs downgraded the online brokerage, while Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co jumped 2.99% on a ratings upgrade.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 184 new lows.

NEW YORK(Reuters) -Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Roger Ng was convicted by a U.S. jury on Friday of corruption charges related to his role in helping loot hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB development fund. 
The charges stemmed from one of the biggest financial scandals in history. Prosecutors charged Ng, Goldman's former top investment banker for Malaysia, for conspiring to violate an anti-corruption law and launder money. 
They said he helped his former boss Tim Leissner embezzle money from the fund, launder the proceeds and bribe officials to win business for Goldman.
Ng, 49, had pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyers say Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors' investigation, falsely implicated Ng in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence.
The fund was founded to pursue development projects in the Southeast Asian country.
The jury convicted Ng of two counts of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) through bribery and circumvention of Goldman's internal accounting controls, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. 
""Today's verdict is a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia,"" Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. ""The defendant and his cronies saw 1MDB not as an entity to do good for the people of Malaysia, but as a piggy bank to enrich themselves."" 
Ng, wearing a black suit jacket and black tie, showed little emotion as the jury's foreperson read out the verdict. Ng glanced back and forth between the jury and the desk he was seated at. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, hung his head after the guilty verdict to the first count was read.
U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, who is overseeing the case, ordered that Ng be subject to a curfew pending sentencing, but said she did not consider him a flight risk.
Deliberations began on Tuesday after a nearly two-month trial in federal court in Brooklyn.
'HARD TO WIN'
Agnifilo said Ng may appeal, depending on the outcome of his post-trial motions and his sentence. He stood by his decision to convince Ng to waive extradition to face trial, saying he had a better chance of a fair trial in the United States than in Malaysia.
""These big cases are tough and they're hard to win,"" Agnifilo told reporters.
Prosecutors have said Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion through three bond sales, but that $4.5 billion was diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks between 2009 and 2015.
Ng is the first, and likely only, person to face trial in the United States over the scheme. Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and its Malaysian unit agreed to plead guilty.
Jurors heard nine days of testimony from Leissner, who said he sent Ng $35 million in kickbacks. Leissner said the men agreed to tell banks a ""cover story"" that the money was from a legitimate business venture between their wives. 
Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, later testified for the defense that the business venture was, in fact, legitimate. She said she invested $6 million in the mid-2000s in a Chinese company owned by the family of Leissner's then-wife, Judy Chan, and that the $35 million was her return on that investment. 

Agnifilo said in his closing argument on Monday that Leissner could not be trusted. Alixandra Smith, a prosecutor, said in her summation that Leissner's testimony was backed up by other evidence.
Jho Low, a Malaysian financier and suspected mastermind of the scheme, was indicted alongside Ng in 2018 but remains at large.

The combined company, Warner Bros Discovery Inc, will start trading on the Nasdaq on Monday under the ticker symbol ""WBD"".
In May last year, the companies set out to merge and become a standalone media business, with AT&T (NYSE:T) aiming to focus more on its wireless ambitions and Discovery looking to beef up its content library.
""With the close of this transaction, we expect to invest at record levels in our growth areas of 5G and fiber, where we have strong momentum,"" AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said in a statement.
Warner Bros Discovery's portfolio includes Discovery Channel, Warner Bros. Entertainment, CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network; streaming services Discovery+ and HBO Max; and franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"".
A top priority for David Zaslav, the long-time Discovery veteran leading the combined entity, is to make streaming video as profitable as the old TV business, analysts said.

Discovery On Thursday announced the executive team to lead the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), leaning heavily on a trusted group of lieutenants, many of whom have worked with its chief executive since his days at NBC.
Nine high-level WarnerMedia executives, including Chief Executive Jason Kilar and Studios and Network chief Ann Sarnoff, announced their exits ahead of the formation of the combined company earlier this week.

518,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 06:55PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Friday called for an election re-run after workers at a New York City warehouse voted to create the company's first U.S. union, saying that the U.S. labor board and worker-organizers suppressed turnout.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Labor Union (ALU) rejected the allegations made by the online retailer that is the second-largest U.S. private employer.
Amazon made its demand a week after the landmark victory for organized labor, which for years has sought to offer protections to workers at the company. Some 55% of employees who voted from Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island opted to join the ALU, which has argued for higher pay and job security. Turnout was about 58%.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement: ""We want our employees to have their voices heard, and in this case, that didn't happen - fewer than a third of the employees at the site voted for the union.""
Amazon also accused the ALU of intimidating workers and distributing marijuana to gain votes in its favor, according to a company filing on Friday.
Derrick Palmer, vice president of the ALU, said Amazon is trying to ""demean our character and undermine our efforts."" 
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) now must process Amazon's objections before certifying the election result. The timing for this was not immediately clear.
In its filing, Amazon said the NLRB improperly helped the ALU gain standing to hold an election and created the impression that it supported the union. Amazon also accused the NLRB of hampering turnout through mismanagement in the polling area and by allowing camera crews on site that scared away voters.

An NLRB spokesperson declined to comment on these objections but the board has said previously that it is independent and that its enforcement actions against Amazon have been consistent with its congressional mandate.
The ALU pushed back against Amazon's claims, saying the company did not contest low turnout in a prior union election in Alabama in which workers voted against organizing. The ALU said it was Amazon that had intimidated workers, and the union has filed dozens of unfair labor practice charges against the company.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus lost a fifth of outstanding orders for its A330neo long-haul jet in March as the plane's largest customer went through restructuring, but won sales elsewhere for more than 100 of its smaller jets, monthly data showed on Friday.
AirAsia X cancelled 63 of the A330-900 version of the A330neo, an upgrade of the long-established A330 wide-body model, as well as 10 smaller A321neo aircraft, Airbus said.
The European planemaker also said it had delivered 142 planes in the first quarter, up more than 13% on the year. 
But the net number of deliveries stood at 140 after two for Aeroflot were cancelled due to sanctions on Russia.
Airbus had counted the two A350 deliveries for Aeroflot in its end-year tally in December as part of its forecast-beating annual deliveries, but the planes did not fly to Russia. Airbus has also cancelled the associated Aeroflot order, data showed.
""Airbus may seek new owners for these assets,"" Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said in a note. 
Industry sources have said Airbus is trying to sell surplus A350s to Air India including three which it claims to have available as a result of a spat with Qatar Airways. The two sides are involved in a bitter court battle over the fate of A350s following the discovery of surface damage in the fleet.
The widely watched delivery totals confirm a range of 140-142 reported this week by Reuters, quoting sources - a higher number than some analysts had anticipated. 
CLEANING BACKLOG
The announcement came as Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury told a German newspaper that Airbus is sticking to its goal of raising benchmark narrow-body production to 65 a month by summer 2023, and reaffirmed financial goals despite the war in Ukraine.
The A330neo is an upgrade of Airbus' most-sold wide-body jet designed to compete with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 at a lower price.
It clocked up hundreds of orders only to face patchy demand as it was left heavily dependent on troubled AirAsia X.
Airbus has been gradually reducing the presence in its books of orders deemed unlikely to come to fruition while shifting attention to booming sales for the narrow-body A321neo.
""It is always a shock to see a large wide-body cancellation but these aircraft have probably not been counted in investors’ delivery forecasts for at least the past three years,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said.
""With the focus on strong demand for the A321neo, it is a good opportunity to take a look at the A330neo orders and clean up the backlog.""
In legal testimony on Thursday, Airbus minimised the benefits of its hot-selling A321neo compared to Boeing's 737 MAX 10, in contrast with its own marketing pitch, but analysts described the move as a courtroom tactic in its widening legal dispute with Qatar Airways.

After Friday's rejig of orders, Airbus has 200 undelivered A330neos in its order book versus 265 a month ago. These include 28 for Iran under a nuclear deal that collapsed in 2018, though Tehran is in talks with major powers aimed at reviving the deal.
Airbus said on Friday it had sold a total of 253 jets in the first quarter or a net total of 83 after cancellations. Rival Boeing will issue quarterly data next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines confirmed on Friday it has delayed the return of some grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines until at least May 12.
An engine on a United Airlines 777 jet failed shortly after takeoff from Denver in February 2021, showering debris over nearby cities but no one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
""We continue to work conscientiously with Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and the (Federal Aviation Administration) to safely return these aircraft to service soon, and our current plan will allow them to return in the second half of May,"" United spokesman Joshua Freed said.
United is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 of those planes. United shares closed down 1% Friday.
CNBC reported the delay earlier, citing a memo to pilots.
Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was finalizing three safety directives for those grounded 777s that will allow them to return to service.
The FAA said the new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, require enhanced inspections and modifications.
The FAA said the directives would be effective April 15.
In February 2021, FAA ordered immediate inspections before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine built by Pratt, a unit of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). 

Boeing must develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements. FAA must approve that bulletin before the planes can return to service.
In April 2021, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13  Boeing Co  777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned. The engines are on only a small number of older 777s outside the United States.

Investing.com -- Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) shares rebounded on Friday after tumbling 17% Thursday. The drugstore chain caught a downgrade from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and a price target cut by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
However, that did not impact the stock on Friday, with Rite Aid shares closing the session 7.44% higher.
JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill slashed the price target on Rite-Aid shares to $7 from $14, maintaining an underweight rating.
Gill said to investors that while they continue to believe the retail pharmacy group is well-positioned over the long term, ""the near-term backdrop remains challenged due to ongoing reimbursement pressure and less of an ability to offset those pressures.""
Due to various industry headwinds, JPMorgan sees a long road ahead for Rite Aid as a stand-alone entity. 
The analyst also pointed to significant near-term headwinds related to Covid-19, including lower acute scripts and weak OTC [over-the-counter] cough/cold/flu sales, driving a reduction in retail pharmacy profit in the near term.
""We believe a discount is warranted given the ongoing turnaround and high leverage at Rite Aid,"" wrote Gill."

Investing.com -- The Dow ended higher Friday, but that wasn't enough to prevent a weekly loss as tech snapped its winning streak under pressure from surging Treasury yields following further details on the Federal Reserve's plan to rein in inflation. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.40%, or 137 points, The S&P 500 fell 0.20%, the Nasdaq slipped 1.3%. All three major averages ended the week in the red.
Technology stocks snapped a three-week winning streak, keeping the broader market in the red as investors remain wary of growth sectors of the market in the wake of surging Treasury yields.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.7% for the first time in more than three years on expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to stem inflation.
The Fed’s March meeting minutes, released earlier this week showed that Fed members appear “poised to hike rates 50bps in May, and initiate a sizable drawdown of the balance sheet beginning next month,” Stifel said in a note.
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell more than 1%, while an ongoing decline in the chip stocks added pressure on the broader tech sector.  
Banking stocks, which have been under pressure in recent sessions on worries that a potential recession could increase bad debt for banks, finally found some reprieve as investors looked ahead to quarterly results from major Wall Street banks next week.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reports results on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday.
""Banks are good place to be in the upcoming economic environment not just because rates are going up, but I think the consumer still is in a position of strength,"" Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
While rising rates boost lending margins and profitability for banks, the pace of the increase in rates has driven up borrowing costs and impacted demand. The red-hot pace of increasing rates will be determined by whether the Fed follows through on its hawkish plan to tighten monetary policy.
""Most people believe that the Fed is going be very hawkish and and cause a recession, but I just don't think that they will,"" Lee added. ""If the economic data starts to look ugly, I think they will stop tightening immediately.""

(Reuters) - GTCR LLC and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) are among private equity firms that have expressed interest in acquiring U.S. medical device manufacturer  Merit Medical Systems  (NASDAQ:MMSI) Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.
GTCR has informed Merit Medical it would be willing to pay $72 to $75 per share, one of the sources said. Merit Medical shares were trading at around $61 before Reuters reported on March 9 that the company was exploring a sale.
Other private equity firms could also express interest in Merit Medical and there is no certainty that any deal will be reached, the sources said. Should there be a deal, it could come as early as May, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Spokespeople for GTCR and CD&R declined to comment. A Merit Medical spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Merit Medical manufactures and sells devices and instruments used in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy.
The South Jordan, Utah-based company previously attracted the interest of activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which clinched an agreement in 2020 to shake up Merit's board of directors. 
Both GTCR and CD&R are prolific investors in health and medical device businesses and have been seeking to capitalize on a wave of consolidation sweeping the industry.
One of GTCR's portfolio companies, vaccine reagent provider Maravai LifeSciences Holdings Inc, turned down an $11 billion acquisition offer from laboratory supplies vendor Sartorius AG in February, sources told Reuters at the time. It remains possible that the companies will negotiate a deal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it is naming a new head of its aircraft certification service as the agency works to implement significant reforms Congress ordered in December 2020.
The FAA said effective on May 8 Lirio Liu, who directs the FAA's International Affairs office, will become the new executive director of its Aircraft Certification Service replacing Earl Lawrence, who is moving to a new role at the FAA.
The move comes days after FAA Administrator Steve Dickson stepped down and Billy Nolen, the FAA’s aviation safety chief, was named acting administrator effective April 1.
There have been a number of other personnel changes recently at the FAA. On Wednesday, the National Business Aviation Administration said it was naming the FAA's acting aviation safety chief Chris Rocheleau as its new chief operating officer.
Rocheleau had been named acting aviation safety chief on April 1. 
Congress approved dramatic reforms to how the FAA certifies new airplanes after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes in five months killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month-grounding.
Dickson told Congress last year the FAA is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and the FAA is reviewing a number of issues involving Boeing.
The legislation requires disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said the FAA reform law ""was a clear course correction. It said that we needed to have stronger FAA oversight, the people in place to do that job, and to hold manufacturers accountable.""
The FAA has warned Boeing that it may not be able to win certification for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 variant by December. 
House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio on Wednesday noted the MAX 10 does ""not have an advanced flight crew alerting system"" that became an industry standard in 1982 and is on every current Airbus and Boeing model in production except for the 737s.

DeFazio noted the ""aircraft certification bill gave the FAA a two-year grace period to certify aircraft without the advanced flight crew alerting system, but that grace period should not be extended.""
Boeing said it continues to work with the FAA ""to provide the information they need and remain committed to meeting their expectations regarding 737-10 certification.""

The department had asked Judge Amit Mehta in a court filing to sanction Google, saying the company's ""Communicate with Care"" program, which asked employees to add a lawyer to many emails, was sometimes a ""game"" to shield communications that did not genuinely fall under attorney-client privilege. Google responded that it did nothing wrong.
Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said that there were an ""eye-popping"" 140,000 documents originally slated as falling under attorney-client privilege but that 98,000 or those were quickly given to the government. But he also said that he was ""not sure a federal court has the authority"" to sanction that practice since it occurred before the government filed its lawsuit.
John Schmidtlein, Google's attorney in the case, said that 21,000 of the emails were still at issue.

Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lawyer, asked that Google be sanctioned for the practice and be required to turn over the 21,000 emails. He argued that the practice cost the government valuable time in putting together its case. 
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit against Google in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law in its handling of its search business. Trial was set for September 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - Munich Re is planning new wordings in cyber insurance policies to exclude war, to avoid disputes over what is covered, the reinsurer's top cyber underwriter told Reuters.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fears of cyber attacks, with the risk that Western businesses or government institutions could be targeted.
Most cyber policies cover companies against business interruption losses and the repair of hacked networks following a cyber attack, but exclude war. However, grey areas in the wordings leave insurers open to claims as a result of cyber war.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said last week that insurance losses from the Ukraine conflict could total $35 billion, with cyber one of the classes of insurance most exposed.
Munich Re is seeking clearer war exclusion clauses in cyber policies, based on wording developed last year in the Lloyd's of London market.
The invasion of Ukraine was not a ""classic cyber war,"" said Juergen Reinhart, chief underwriter, cyber, at Munich Re, but he said it was best to be prepared.
""Let's not wait...but act now.""
Munich Re said last month it was winding down business in Russia. 
AIG (NYSE:AIG), one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is considering cutting cover for Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reported on Friday.
Munich Re was looking to bring in new wordings on its direct cyber insurance products, Reinhart said. The reinsurer was also suggesting to its cyber insurer clients that they introduce similar clauses. 
Ambiguous business interruption policy wordings led to a slew of court cases across the world in the past two years over whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic was covered by insurance.
“We have learnt this lesson as an industry in respect of the pandemic - how painful it is if you have unclear wordings,"" said Reinhart. 
""Our intention is to have very, very clear wordings...and avoid surprises.""

Julia Graham (NYSE:GHM), chief executive of UK insurance buyers' association Airmic, said clarity was needed.
""There has been a lot of uncertainty among Airmic members around war exclusions, especially for their cyber policies,"" she said.
""The lack of standardised policy wordings on cyber in the market has certainly not helped things.""",,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America on Friday voiced support for the securities regulator's proposal requiring U.S.-listed companies to disclose their climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled the draft rule last month, aiming to help investors better understand the ""actual or likely material impacts"" climate-related risks will have on a company's business, strategy and outlook.
""We think the proposal is constructive and headed in the right direction,"" said Paul Donofrio, head of sustainability at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the country's second-biggest bank by assets.
The bank is still reviewing the SEC's 500-plus-page draft rule and plans to submit a comment letter by the regulator's deadline. 
Among the proposed rule's key requirements, companies must disclose their own direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as those generated by suppliers and partners, known as Scope 3 emissions.
""We are all in on this notion of companies providing the marketplace with disclosures that will help everybody understand what the emission status is at a company and what their plans are to get to net zero ... so that market participants can allocate capital to the best and highest use,"" Donofrio told reporters.
Donofrio, who spent six years as the bank's chief financial officer, cautioned that Scope 3 emissions are currently hard for the majority of companies to calculate accurately but said the bank supports phasing in those disclosures later. 

""Scope three disclosures, today, might be subject to a lot of uncertainty, would not get the assurance, therefore not be trusted and it might call into a question other disclosures,"" Donofrio said.
He added that the bank supports a price on carbon, which could reflect ""its true cost to society so that people will see the value of those investments"".

The executive pay proposal will be put to an advisory vote at Goldman's annual general meeting scheduled on April 28.
""We are concerned about special, one-off grants to the CEO and COO considering their quantum and structural issues,"" Glass Lewis said in a note to Goldman's investors, seen by Reuters on Friday.
Goldman declined to respond to Reuters request for comment.
The opposition from Glass Lewis comes against the backdrop of a talent war on Wall Street, with rising inflation and a tight labor market forcing big U.S. banks to pay more to woo and retain employees.
In a regulatory filing October last year, Goldman said it would grant performance-based stock worth $30 million to Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, and $20 million in stock to John Waldron, the bank's president and chief operating officer. The awards would be paid out in October 2026.

The bank later expanded the awards in January to include other members of the top management. 
Goldman's stock has dived nearly 16% so far this year, as financial firms continue to grapple with the economic fallout of the Ukraine crisis and the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy.

533,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 03:01PM ET</span>","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has agreed to freeze the assets in the EU of the boss of Russia's top lender Sberbank, Vladimir Putin's two daughters and more oligarchs, according to a document published in the EU's official journal on Friday.
Since the start of war in Ukraine, the EU has blacklisted around 700 people linked to the Kremlin or accused of supporting the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". That has not always, however, led to a quick freezing of assets, amid legal hurdles and sometimes lack of political will.
The new measures will hit over 200 additional individuals, mostly from the separatist regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, and also top businessmen, politicians and military staff close to the Kremlin. 
Another 18 entities have also been hit by asset freezes, including four banks, such as VTB, and military firms, nearly doubling the number of companies hit by sanctions since the start of the war.
Herman Gref, the head of Sberbank, has been added to the EU blacklist, according to the document, in a move that is important symbolically. The EU has so far refrained from sanctioning the bank, which plays a key role in energy payments.
Putin's daughters Ekaterina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova have also now been sanctioned for benefiting from the Russian government, the document said.
Putin had already been sanctioned in an early round of restrictive measures, although it is unclear how many assets, if any, he and his family hold in the EU.
Wealthy oligarchs usually use front men or anonymous shell companies and trusts to shield their assets, making it very hard if not impossible for investigators to identify them, especially in jurisdictions with lax rules on companies' beneficial owners.

Oil company Surgutneftegas' executive Vladimir Bogdanov, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal, Oleg Deripaska, billionaire Boris Rotenberg, major shareholder in Russia's top gold miner Polyus Said Kerimov, and the chief of Russian e-commerce platform Ozon Alexander Shulgin have also been sanctioned.
The new listings are part of the EU's fifth package of sanctions against Russia, which include a ban on coal imports and restrictions for entry into the EU for Russian vessels and lorries.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Mauricio Claver-Carone, on Friday said he was the target of an ""anonymous political media campaign"" after Reuters reported the bank's directors were looking into an accusation that he had an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.
IDB directors met this week to discuss hiring an outside firm to investigate allegations that Claver-Carone had carried out an intimate relationship with a staffer, Reuters reported exclusively. 
The news agency was unable to confirm the claims about the alleged relationship, which, if verified, would appear to be against the bank's rules. Claver-Carone has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
At an event on Friday, which was streamed online, Claver-Carone criticized an ""anonymous political media campaign"" against him and said he had evidence of the truth and hoped to have the opportunity to defend himself. He did not directly address the specific allegations, which were made in an anonymous letter.
""Trust me, I would love to present to all of you today the direct evidence which I have - not circumstantial, not hearsay, not anonymous - but direct evidence of truth,"" Claver-Carone said in opening remarks at an IDB event.
""I do hope I am given the opportunity to officially present my case and information,"" he added, saying he would respect the confidentiality of the ongoing process.
He alleged that some people at the bank were ""weaponizing an anonymous letter to orchestrate a media campaign,"" without giving evidence.
The IDB declined to comment on Claver-Carone's remarks.

The bank's directors met again on Thursday and drafted a resolution to hire an external firm to investigate the allegations which must be approved by the board of governors, a bank source said. The directors decided not to propose removing Claver-Carone from his duties, the bank source added. 
The Washington-based IDB is a development bank that, while far smaller than the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, is a key player in Latin America.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are looking for bargains in beaten-down growth and tech stocks, betting they will shine as the Federal Reserve fights to slow the US economy and tame red-hot inflation.
Growth stocks – which have trounced their valued-focused peers over the last decade – have borne the brunt of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish turn this year, with the Russell 1000 Growth index down more than 11% year-to-date, compared to a more-than 5% loss for the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
By contrast, value stocks – often defined as shares of economically sensitive companies trading at a discount to their total worth – are broadly flat on the year. 
Underpinning those moves is the perception that the Fed’s fight against inflation will keep interest rates climbing, eroding the future cash flows that growth stocks are heavily valued on. Value stocks, meanwhile, have found support from a strong economy and surging commodity prices. 
That dynamic could change if the Fed’s tightening monetary policy slows the economy. That would boost the appeal of growth names for some investors who believe their profits rely less on broader economic strength. The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month and has hinted at meatier increases ahead.[L2N2W41S3]
Expectations of an aggressive Fed briefly turned the spread between yields on two and 10-year Treasuries negative last week, a phenomenon that is often seen as an indication of worries about economic growth. Recessions have followed six of the last seven yield curve inversions since 1978, according to data from Truist Advisory Services. 
“If these recession fears grow, then you are going to have a big shift away from value stocks,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank, who has been increasing her stake in technology stocks. “Sustainable earnings growth … will become more important again.” 
Growth stocks have tended to outperform in the six months following yield curve inversions, with the Russell 1000 Growth Index rising by an average of 6.4% during such periods since 1978, compared to a 4.4 % gain for value stocks, data from CFRA showed. Growth stocks have fallen by an average of 0.6% during recessions, while value stocks have fallen by an average 6.8%, according to CFRA data. 
The Russell 1000 Growth Index is up 320% over the last 10 years, compared to an 145% rise for its value-focused counterpart.
Earnings season kicks off next week, giving investors a closer look at how companies have fared at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and rising commodity prices. Also on tap is the latest US consumer prices report, due out on Tuesday. The S&P 500 is on track to close down 1% this week, as worries over a more aggressive Fed slow a rally that saw the index pare its year-to-date losses last month. [L2N2W411P]
Overall, investors have sent a net $4.2 billion to the Invesco QQQ Trust - which tracks the growth-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index - over the last three weeks, the fund's longest streak of positive inflows since January, Lipper data showed. 
Mayukh Poddar, a portfolio manager of Altfest Personal Wealth Management, has increased exposure to growth stocks in healthcare such as Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and mega-cap tech names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in anticipation that the Fed's hawkish tilt will slow the economy, hurting value stocks. 
""The Fed is telling us ... that fighting inflation has become their priority and the only way they can fight that is to slow down demand,"" he said. 
Some on Wall Street are skeptical of a bounce in growth stocks, especially as bond yields continue soaring. Yields on the US benchmark 10-year Treasury recently hit 2.71%, their highest level since 2019. 
“The period of extremely low interest rates was very good for growth stocks ― and very challenging for value investors,” wrote Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer, U.S. Fundamental Equities at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), in a recent note. “The road ahead is likely to be different, restoring some of the appeal of a value strategy.” 
Others believe it is just a matter of picking the right stocks. 

Moustapha Mounah, an assistant portfolio manager with James Investment, has cut his energy stock exposure to 8% of his portfolio from 12%, while moving into software companies such as Abobe and SalesForce that he expects will be able to raise prices amid continued high inflation. 
""The growth stocks that are really getting hurt are the speculative names, but there are many companies out there that will do well regardless of the cycle in the economy,"" he said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Negotiators from  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and the United Steelworkers union (USW) are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss a possible end to a strike at the company’s oil refinery in Richmond, California, spokespeople for both sides said.
The talks will be the first face-to-face meeting in nearly two weeks between Chevron and USW Local 12-5. Some 500 workers at the 245,271 barrel-per-day refinery formally began the strike on March 21 after the two sides failed to reach agreement on a new labor contract.
Chevron has continued to operate the refinery, its second largest in California, with managers and supervisors. The plant provides about 20% of Northern California's gasoline and 60% of the jet fuel used at area airports, according to Chevron. 
""We look forward to continuing formal discussions,” said Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich. 
The two sides have held informal talks in recent days, said Kruzich and B.K. White, first vice president of Local 12-5. 
The union began the strike after members of Local 12-5 had twice rejected the company’s contract proposal. They are seeking a 5% pay increase on top of the 12%-over-four-years national wage increase agreed to by the USW International union and U.S. refinery owners. 
The union has said it sought the additional pay because most of the wage increases in recent years were eaten up by high health insurance and housing costs in California. 

The refinery has reported at least two malfunctions since the stoppage began, according to state filings. It is preparing to shut the crude distillation unit for a planned overhaul in mid-April. Those units do the primary refining of crude oil and provide feedstocks for all other units.
One of the malfunctions forced the temporary shutdown of a jet fuel hydrotreater, which pushed prices upward in California markets temporarily. Jet fuel and diesel prices have fallen this week.

538,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 02:31PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Amazon.com accused the new union at a New York City warehouse of threatening workers unless they voted to organize, an assertion an attorney for the labor group called ""really absurd.""
A second labor group, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which was losing a bid to organize an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Alabama, also filed objections on Thursday to that union election.
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is giving Amazon until April 22 to back up its objections to last week's election in New York, in which Staten Island workers voted to form the company's first U.S. union. Amazon had requested extra time to provide evidence because its objections are ""substantial,"" it said in a filing Wednesday.
A certified election result would give organized labor a foothold in the United States' second-largest private employer, with the potential to alter how Amazon manages its finely tuned operation.
Some 55% of workers who voted in the election at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island opted to join the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has demanded higher pay and job security. Since the result, U.S. workers from another 50 Amazon sites have contacted the union, the group's leader has said.
Among Amazon's planned objections to the outcome are that the ALU interfered with employees in line to vote and that long waits depressed turnout, Amazon's filing said. Some 58% of eligible voters cast ballots in person over several days.
Eric Milner, an attorney representing the ALU from law firm Simon & Milner, dismissed Amazon's claims as false and said they would be overruled.
""To say that the Amazon Labor Union was threatening employees is really absurd,"" he said. ""The Amazon Labor Union is Amazon employees.""
Separately on Thursday, the RWDSU objected to the election in Bessemer, Alabama, in which Amazon workers voted against unionizing. It was the second election in Bessemer, after the NLRB determined that Amazon had improperly interfered in the first contest there last year. The most recent outcome is pending in light of hundreds of challenged ballots and now the RWDSU's objections, which could delay a result for months.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, “We want our employees’ voices to be heard, and we hope the NLRB counts every valid vote.”
In a filing, the RWDSU said Amazon unlawfully removed pro-union literature from non-work areas and terminated an employee who spoke in favor of the union during mandatory work meetings, among other objections. The RWDSU said these were grounds for the NLRB to set aside the result.
Amazon itself took issue with the RWDSU's conduct, such as the union's communications with workers around the use of a mailbox on warehouse property, adding that its filing objections is standard process.
The retailer faces a high bar in demonstrating that the New York union violated rules for engagement with employees that influenced the outcome, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.

In addition, the NLRB typically treats employers' alleged violations more seriously than alleged wrongdoing by unions because companies have greater power over workers, he said.
""It's going to be really tough"" for Amazon, he said.

(Reuters) - As David Zaslav prepares to take over as head of Hollywood's new powerhouse, the soon-to-be formed Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), he’ll confront a challenge few anticipated last May, when the $43 billion merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc was announced -- how to make streaming video as profitable as the old TV business it's replacing.
Nearly two years after AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia division launched its HBO Max streaming service in May 2020 to challenge market-leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Wall Street has grown skeptical of streaming’s long-term prospects, citing the significant and ongoing investments in new content and an uncertain future for even market leaders like Netflix. The reassessment came in January, as the world's largest streaming service forecast modest growth for its first quarter. 
HBO Max, which houses the Warner Bros film library that includes the ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"" franchises, classic television series such as long-running NBC sitcom “Friends” and contemporary dramas such as HBO’s “Euphoria,” ended 2021 with nearly 74 million subscribers globally, though its former parent company, AT&T, did not report its operating income. 
Zaslav will need to balance the financing of its streaming businesses, which will include the Discovery+ service and the newly launched CNN+, with supporting its cash-generating but declining cable television businesses, say Hollywood veterans who know the executive and spoke with Reuters about the challenges. 
“Streaming is an incredibly capital-intensive business. HBO Max has a huge head start in terms of brand, library, and creative abilities. But it’s competitive, so how do you stand out from the competitive crowd?” media analyst Michael Nathanson told Reuters. “How do you make sure you don’t under-invest in linear, in favor of digital?”
Warner Bros Discovery will be saddled with $55 billion in debt mostly tied to the merger, limiting Zaslav’s options. He already signaled in February that he had no plans to ""win the spending war"" against Disney's $33 billion content budget or the $17 billion that Netflix spent in 2021.
""He can’t make the purely strategic choices that a Disney can make, because they have the balance sheet to do that,” said one executive. “He has to be practical in how he navigates from the old media to the new.”
Warner Bros Discovery’s chief executive also is stepping into a minefield left by his predecessor, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who angered Hollywood’s creative community when the film studio announced it would release its 2021 movies on HBO Max and in theaters on the same day. 
Since the deal's announcement Zaslav has been busy taking meetings and meals with Hollywood producers, agents and others, to hear their concerns and solicit advice. 
“I think a lot of Hollywood is rooting for him to succeed,” said producer Jason Blum. “Unlike some of his colleagues and his competitors, he’s over the past year made a huge effort in terms of outreach ... He’s curious. He loves storytelling ... That can’t be said for a lot of people in that same job.”
Closer to home Zaslav also will need to boost morale on the Warner Bros studio lot, where the rounds of reorganizations, firings and strategy changes have taken a “psychological toll,” one former executive said.

The biggest unknown, Hollywood executives said, is how Zaslav, who has a reputation as a hands-on executive, and favors flat organizations, will manage a vastly larger media empire, with an estimated 30,000 employees, or about three-times the size of Discovery. This week, nine senior executives departed WarnerMedia. 
“The biggest kind of challenge is how does he prioritize his time?” said one veteran studio executive. “This is a very different animal than the non-scripted cable business.”

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 was flat Friday, as gains in financials and energy offset weakness in tech stocks amid pressure from higher Treasury yields ahead of the start of quarterly earnings season next week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.64%, or 225 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.89%.
Technology stocks, which are on course to snap a three-week winning streak, kept the broader market in the red as investors remain wary of growth sectors of the market in the wake of surging Treasury yields.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.7% for the first time in more than three years on expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to stem inflation.
The Fed’s March meeting minutes showed that Fed members appear “poised to hike rates 50bps in May, and initiate a sizable drawdown of the balance sheet beginning next month,” Stifel said in a note.

""Banks are good place to be in the upcoming economic environment not just because rates are going up, but I think the consumer still is in a position of strength,"" Jimmy Lee, the founder and CEO of The Wealth Consulting Group, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
While rising rates boost lending margins and profitability for banks, the pace of the increase in rates has driven up borrowing costs and impacted demand. The red-hot pace of increasing rates will be determined by whether the Fed's follows through on its hawkish plan to tighten monetary policy.
""Most people believe that the Fed is going be very hawkish and and cause a recession, but I just don't think that they will,"" Lee added. ""If the economic data starts to look ugly, I think they will stop tightening immediately.""

541,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 01:55PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble on Friday hit its strongest level against the euro since June 2020 after an unexpected central bank rate cut, but soon reversed gains and ended the day in the red, while stocks fell after the U.S. Congress voted to ban Russian oil. 
The central bank cut its key interest rate to 17% from 20% ahead of a regular board meeting scheduled for April 29, and said it was open to possible further cuts at upcoming meetings.
The volatile rouble rallied shortly after the rate cut, which partially reversed the emergency rate hike that the central bank delivered in late February after Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. But the once-free-floating Russian currency finished trading on the Moscow Exchange at levels seen on Thursday.
The rouble eased 0.4% to 76.08 against the dollar, having briefly hit its strongest level since November of 71.
Against the euro, the rouble shed 1.5% to 82.70 after briefly touching 77.0750 for the first time since late June 2020.
The rouble's rapid recovery from the record lows hit in March raises doubts about the durability of its gains. Anyone who tries to buy foreign currency online at a bank in Russia or, illegally, at a foreign exchange booth, or who buys goods and services online denominated in foreign currencies will find the actual rate considerably worse.
Yields on 10-year OFZ treasury bonds, which move inversely to their prices, fell to 10.77% from 11.62% seen before the rate cut.
The surprise rate cut came after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said this week that his ministry was working with the central bank on measures to make the rouble exchange rate more predictable and less volatile.
""If the experience of the 2014/15 rouble crisis is any guide, a large interest rate cut (like that seen today) is likely to be followed by much more gradual easing as the CBR targets a large positive real interest rate to bring inflation back down to its target,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
LockoInvest firm said it has revised its year-end rate forecast to 11-12% from not more than 15%.
VOLATILE MARKETS
Moves in the rouble remain jittery and trading volumes on the Moscow Exchange are below average, but the rouble has fully recovered to levels seen before Russian troops entered Ukraine.
The rouble is supported by Russia's strong current account surplus amid high commodity prices as well as Russia's capital controls, said Olga Belenkaya, head of macro research at Finam brokerage.
The rouble has recently been steered by the mandatory conversion of dollar and euro revenues by export-focused companies, while demand for forex is limited by a ban on buying cash dollars and euros as well as by a 12% commission on buying forex online or through a bank.
Given the latest rouble firming, some recovery in demand for FX is possible despite the commission, Otkritie bank said in a note.
On the stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index fell 1.14% to 1,079.99 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index fell 1.6% to 2,592.7 points.

Shares in oil firm Bashneft underperformed the market, losing 4.5% on the day, while shares in rival Lukoil were down 1%. 
Oil stocks took a hit after the U.S. Congress on Thursday voted to impose further economic pain on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, passing a measure to remove its ""most favoured nation"" trade status and another to ban oil imports, which puts into law a previous executive order by President Joe Biden.

""Due to the logistical difficulties, vehicle exports and parts supply to Russia have been suspended since March,"" Mitsubishi said in a statement.
Japan has joined the United States and other allies in slapping additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing assets of the country's leaders and three financial institutions, to punish Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24.
Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, said in late March it would have to close the Kaluga plant shortly as it was running out of parts.
It was not immediately clear whether Stellantis had halted its operations too in Kaluga.
The company, which had earlier suspended all exports of cars to Russia as well as all imports from Russia, was not immediately available for comment on Friday.

Stellantis has also said it was moving its current production to western Europe and freezing plans for more investments in Russia, while keeping van production in Kaluga just for the local market.
New car sales in Russia fell 62.9% year-on-year in March, contracting for a ninth straight month, as the industry encountered an acute shortage and soaring prices caused by a sharp rouble drop and disrupted logistics.

MILAN (Reuters) -Investment funds Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield are not contemplating any ""hostile"" move on Italy's road and airport operator Atlantia as a rival bid takes shape, two sources said on Friday.
The two funds said this week they had pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia to its main shareholder Edizione, a holding company controlled by the Benetton family.
But Edizione, which owns 33% of Atlantia, said it had no interest in the funds' project. It added that talks were under way with Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) on a deal of their own to strengthen its grip on the infrastructure group.
""GIP and Brookfield are in wait-and-see mode ... but there are no plans at present to launch any hostile bid,"" a source familiar with the matter said.
The two funds have an agreement with Florentino Perez's ACS for the Spanish construction company to acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer is completed.
The funds declined to comment.
The proposal, presented to the Benettons on March 30, leaves it up to Edizione to decide if it wants to remain shareholder of a group that would then be delisted, one of the sources said.
""The Benettons reject the idea of a break-up of Atlantia and also do not want to be cut out from the governance of the group,"" a third source said.
The funds' unsolicited approach comes as Atlantia prepares to pocket 8 billion euros from the sale of the group's Italian motorway unit, a transaction aimed at ending a political dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a motorway bridge.
Edizione and Blackstone, which were already exploring options for the future of Atlantia before the two funds' approach, are now working on a counter-move that may lead to the group being taken private, sources have told Reuters.
Any deal involving Atlantia would require the blessing of the Italian government that has special veto powers on strategic assets such as airports and electronic payment networks like Atlantia's Telepass unit.
Shares in Atlantia rose sharply on Friday after a report Edizione and Blackstone could launch a bid at about 24 euros per share around Easter. They ended up 8.7% at 22.07 euros.
Edizione and Blackstone declined to comment on the report in daily Il Messaggero which cited banking sources directly involved in the matter. 

A price of 24 euros would value the group as a whole at around 50 billion euros ($21.7 billion), if 30 billion euros of net debt is taken into account. 
GIP and Brookfield are working with Rothschild and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) while Edizione and Blackstone have enlisted the help of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), separate sources told Reuters. ($1 = 0.9211 euros)

(Reuters) -European shares rallied on Friday to erase weekly losses, while investors focused on a tight race between far-right rival Marine Le Pen and incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the runup to the first round of French presidential elections over the weekend.
Financials and commodity stocks led the gains with all major sectors in positive territory. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 1.3% and ended the week about 0.5% higher, with healthcare stocks firming the most on the week.

""Traders have shrugged off the negative headlines about additional sanctions on Russia, as well as the chatter about higher interest rates from the Fed,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. 
""But by and large, it was a negative week for equities as countries revealed plans to target Russia’s energy exports.""
The European Union formally adopted its fifth package of sanctions against Russia on Friday, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products.
Despite a 12% recovery from one-year lows hit in March, the STOXX 600 index is still down more than 6% this year on worries that surging inflation due to the Ukraine war will trigger central bank moves that could squeeze growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - AIG (NYSE:AIG), one of the world's biggest commercial insurers, is considering cutting cover for Russia and Ukraine, to shield itself from the risk of hefty claims as sanctions ratchet up and the war drags on, an insurance broker and a source familiar with the matter said.
AIG is looking at adding exclusion clauses to policies for businesses operating in the region across a range of policies, according to the two sources who declined to be identified. 
Other major insurers are also looking to exclude Russia, Ukraine and even Belarus from a range of policies, the sources said, citing some insurers and policyholders.
Reuters could not determine if the potential reduction in cover would apply across all AIG policies in the countries. The insurer declined to comment. 
""What we are now seeing are the underwriters starting to introduce Russia, Ukraine wording into their policies,"" said Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Schnur, managing director, U.S. and Canada cyber brokerage leader at insurance broker Marsh, declining to name the insurers.
Brokers such as Marsh act as intermediaries between corporate customers and insurers, and sometimes get involved in drawing up policies.
If AIG were to cut back cover for businesses and companies operating in Russia and Ukraine it would be the first major insurer to do so, potentially paving the way for others to follow suit.
While Russia has become a no-go zone for many companies due to sanctions imposed in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, some multinationals continue to do business there as well as in Ukraine in sectors ranging from agriculture to energy. They require insurance to keep their businesses open.
Local companies also rely on insurance for damage to goods, buildings and vehicles and for injury or loss of life of employees. Reuters could not determine how much of AIG's business in Russia and Ukraine was focused on domestic firms.
AIG, which recorded net written premiums in general insurance totalling more than $26 billion last year, has operations in Russia, according to its website, and is a major global player in sectors such as energy, construction and cyber.
'NON-NEGOTIABLE'
Sanctions on Russia are already forcing insurers to pull back from coverage of restricted Russian entities and individuals, while UK and European sanctions on aviation insurance extend beyond individual companies to all Russian firms.
Insurance brokers such as Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) have frozen operations in Russia, while reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) are among companies which have said they will not write new business in the country, whether potential policyholders are sanctioned or not.
But AIG and other underwriters are looking at going further, adding wordings into insurance policies to exclude cover for Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian and Ukrainian operations of Western businesses, industry sources say.
Insurers are concerned about reputational damage of doing business in Russia and they are also worried about property damage and delayed payments in Ukraine, where the economy has been pulverized by the war.
Some policyholders are already struggling to find insurance.
François Malan, chief risk and compliance officer at French engineering firm Eiffage, said last week that he was forced to accept an insurance exclusion for transporting cargo in waters near Ukraine.
""It was non-negotiable, it was not a question of price - it was non-covered,"" he said.
Ships sailing into waters around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, which include Ukraine's coast, need to have additional war risk insurance which means paying a separate premium. 
Some insurers are also cutting provision of this type of insurance due to the growing perils, which include being hit by projectiles or floating mines, marine insurance sources say.
PANDEMIC PLAYBOOK
Insurers generally add certain types of exclusion in policies exposed to potential conflict, such as during the South Korea winter Olympics, but do not usually exclude entire regions, as in the case of the Ukraine crisis.
The move to exclude risky areas of their business mirrors insurers' behaviour following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Faced with losses estimated at $100 billion, insurers rushed to exclude first COVID-19 and then all pandemics from policies. 
After also putting up premium rates, many of them reported strong profits in 2021, the second full year of the pandemic. Some industry sources say losses were smaller than originally anticipated as a result of those actions.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) last week estimated commercial insurers' losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict could total as much as $35 billion.

S&P said the insurance sectors likely to be most impacted were aviation, trade credit, political risk such as nationalisation, cyber, political violence and marine war.
Swiss Re said on Thursday that insurance and reinsurance losses from the invasion were likely to come in around the same as a medium-sized natural catastrophe loss such as from a hurricane.

556,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 11:01AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Moscow-listed shares of state-controlled diamond miner Alrosa were down 12% on Friday after the United States expanded sanctions on the company, aiming to cut off additional sources of revenue for the Russian state budget.
Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds and which competes with  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) unit De Beers, produced about 30% of the global output in 2021. It exports mostly to Belgium, India, and the United Arab Emirates.
Washington on Thursday placed Alrosa on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which effectively kicks a sanctioned company out of the U.S. banking system and bans its trade with Americans, complicating operations in the global diamond market.
Alrosa said that the U.S. sanctions along with previous British sanctions on the miner make it technically impossible to make a coupon payment on its Eurobond of $11.6 million due on April 9.
Alrosa is ""studying the options of the proper fulfilment of its obligations under the Notes,"" it added in a statement. It did not provide any further comment on the U.S. sanctions.
It employs more than 32,000 people and mines diamonds in Russia's far east, where the climate is harsh and chances for miners to find other job are limited.
""Diamonds are one of Russia's top 10 non-energy exports by value, with exports in 2021 totalling over $4.5 billion,"" the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in a statement announcing expanded sanctions.

After Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation, the OFAC restricted Alrosa's ability to raise new debt and equity in the United States.
Alrosa also has a 41% stake in Angolan diamond production firm Catoca, but Catoca should not be affected by the U.S. sanctions given the OFAC said only entities owned 50% or more by Alrosa were being blocked.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd received an alumina shipment from Russia's Rusal in late March, weeks after saying it was severing ties with Russian businesses over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, an analysis of shipping data showed on Friday. 
The shipment illustrates how complicated and slow it can be for companies operating in an interconnected global economy to deliver on promises to cut links with Russia. 
Unlike a number of other Russian companies, Rusal is not the target of sanctions, although its billionaire founder Oleg Deripaska is. 
Rio Tinto declined to comment on the shipment and reiterated a March 10 statement to Reuters that said: ""Rio Tinto is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business.""
Rusal declined Reuters' requests for comment. 
On March 24 a bulk cargo vessel exited Rusal's Aughinish refinery in Ireland, which produces the aluminium feedstock alumina, Refinitiv shipping data shows. 
It travelled north to Iceland, where it moored in Straumsvik, home of Rio Tinto's ISAL aluminium smelter, on March 29. On April 1 the ship left Straumsvik and headed back to Aughinish, where it arrived on the evening of April 4. 
A source close to Rio Tinto said disentangling business ties with Russia takes time as the company needed to find alternative supplies. 
Rio Tinto also supplies bauxite from its mine in Brazil to Aughinish, but the shipping data indicated it had not delivered ore to the Rusal refinery in the past 30 days. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine - that Russia terms a ""special military operation"" - and the backlash against it have wreaked havoc on Rusal's supply chains.
Australia, the world's top bauxite producer, has banned exports of the aluminium ore to Russia.

Rio Tinto said on Friday it had taken sole charge of operations and production at Australian refiner Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd, in which Rusal owns a 20% stake. 
Miner and trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) said last week it would continue to honour its legal obligations under pre-existing contracts with Russian entities, but would not enter into any new trading business in respect of ""Russian origin commodities"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Shehbaz Sharif, the person most likely to be Pakistan's next prime minister, is little known outside his home country but has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician.
The younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz, 70, is leading a bid by the opposition in parliament to topple Imran Khan, and if a vote of no-confidence goes ahead on Saturday he is widely expected to replace Khan.
Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan's military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy in the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people.
Pakistan's generals have directly intervened to topple civilian governments three times, and no prime minister has finished a full five-year term since the South Asian state's independence from Britain in 1947.
Shehbaz Sharif, part of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, is best known for his direct, ""can-do"" administrative style, which was on display when, as chief minister of Punjab province, he worked closely with China on Beijing-funded projects.
He also said in an interview last week that good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan's recently antagonistic relationship with Washington.
There are still several procedural steps before Sharif can become Pakistan's 23rd prime minister, not including caretaker administrations, although the opposition has consistently identified him as its sole candidate.
If he does take on the role, he faces immediate challenges, not least Pakistan's crumbling economy, which has been hit by high inflation, a tumbling local currency and rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves.
Analysts also say Sharif will not act with complete independence as he will have to work on a collective agenda with the others opposition parties and his brother.
Nawaz has lived for the last two years in London since being let out of jail, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, for medical treatment.
'PUNJAB SPEED'
As chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, Shehbaz Sharif planned and executed a number of ambitious infrastructure mega-projects, including Pakistan's first modern mass transport system in his hometown, the eastern city of Lahore.
According to local media, the outgoing Chinese consul general wrote to Sharif last year praising his ""Punjab Speed"" execution of projects under the huge China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.
The diplomat also said Sharif and his party would be friends of China in government or in opposition.
On Afghanistan, Islamabad is under international pressure to prod the Taliban to meet its human rights commitments while trying to limit instability there.
Unlike Khan, who has regularly denounced India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sharif political dynasty has been more dovish towards the fellow nuclear-armed neighbour, with which Pakistan has fought three wars.
In terms of his relationship with the powerful military, Sharif has long played the public ""good cop"" to Nawaz's ""bad cop"" - the latter has had several public spats with the army.
Shehbaz was born in Lahore into a wealthy industrial family and was educated locally. After that he entered the family business and jointly owns a Pakistani steel company.
He entered politics in Punjab, becoming its chief minister for the first time in 1997 before he was caught up in national political upheaval and imprisoned following a military coup. He was then sent into exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000.
Shehbaz returned from exile in 2007 to resume his political career, again in Punjab.
He entered the national political scene when he became the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party after Nawaz was found guilty in 2017 on charges of concealing assets related to the Panama Papers revelations.

The Sharif family and supporters say the cases were politically motivated.
Both brothers have faced numerous corruption cases in the National Accountability Bureau, including under Khan's premiership, but Shehbaz has not been found guilty on any charges.

However, Ohmes sees US consumers accepting the majority of price increases as US hourly earnings have risen 6%.

561,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 10:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have made hundreds of millions of dollars from inflation trading so far this year, as the Wall Street giant benefits from the war-fueled surge in European consumer prices.   
The bank generated about $300 million in the first quarter from dealing in bonds and derivatives tied to inflation, about double the tally of the same period a year ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lender’s traders made much of their money from euro-based transactions, an already-surging market that has jumped to unprecedented levels since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the person said.
The post-lockdown surge in consumer prices since last year may have spawned a global cost-of-living crisis but it has turned into a goldmine for traders who focus on inflation. Goldman Sachs made about $450 million from the business for all of 2021, double what the firm made in previous years, Bloomberg reported in February.  
Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in London, declined to comment. 
Euro-area inflation in March jumped past analysts’ forecasts to 7.5%, the highest year-on-year rate in the history of the single currency. Households and businesses across the European Union have been slammed with hikes in energy costs as the Russian invasion roils the continent’s access to oil and gas, worsening a crisis in the cost of commodities that set in last year. 
The rise in prices has forced governments across the bloc to spend billions of dollars on aid programs. The European Central Bank may raise interest rates to deal with inflation that’s now more than three times its 2% target. In France, Marine Le Pen has targeted the issue in her campaign to oust President Emmanuel Macron in elections that begin this Sunday. 
Investors have rushed to protect their holdings and speculate for short-term gains. The cost of options that pay out if inflation climbs above 2% -- viewed in the market as a form of insurance -- have climbed to previously-unseen levels. 
For Goldman Sachs, the geopolitical volatility has meant more profit. Nikhil Choraria, who helps oversee the inflation-trading business in London, has thrived by predicting the surge in the continent’s prices. 
a
Choraria has focused on derivatives tied to short-term or “front-end” inflation, the person said. This market became increasingly volatile during the first quarter as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, according to Michael Riddell, who manages about $8 billion at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. This kind of uncertainty can make traders a lot of money, he said.
“It’s not uncommon for bank trading desks to make money when you have big volatility events, although a few can also lose money too if they get caught on the wrong side,” Riddell said. “Front-end inflation markets were as volatile as it gets.”

CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California law requiring grocery stores and restaurants to donate leftover food has been hard for local food banks and small towns to implement due to climbing fuel costs and uncertainty over who pays for food recovery. 
The effort to reduce methane emissions from discarded food sent to landfills while feeding hungry people has been slow to take off, illustrating the difficulty of curbing food waste on a large scale.
The California law, which took effect in January, mandates that national retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) as well as small grocery and convenience stores, donate unsold food, redirecting anything edible from landfills and composting anything inedible. It tasks cities and counties with formulating local plans, with a statewide goal of recovering 20% of edible food by 2025.
While other states restrict food going into landfills, California is the first to require food be donated for human consumption. The effort aligns with federal goals to slash food waste in half by 2030.
Food waste makes up a fifth of climate warming gas emissions in California dumps, according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecyle).
More than 500 waivers have been submitted by rural towns and counties to delay implementing food waste measures, saying they are too small, or do not have composting infrastructure in place for food that cannot be donated.
Food banks rely on private donations and some government assistance, and were stretched thin during the COVID-19 pandemic as hunger rates rose and food costs soared. They typically purchase food in bulk and deliver it to smaller food pantries to give to the hungry. [L1N2QA1UM]
Implementing the new rules has been especially challenging in rural California. As the North State Food Bank prepared for an influx of newly-mandated donations, the daunting costs of picking up food across 8,000 square miles (5 million acres/20,720 square kilometers) in six northern California counties became clear. 
""I can't send the truck all over town, picking up leftover sandwiches,"" said Tom Dearmore, director of community services at the Butte County Community Action Agency, which houses the food bank.
""The more we have to spend on fuel, the less food we can buy. It's pretty cut and dry.""
U.S. gasoline prices and global food inflation hit records following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, adding to the challenges.
In March, Butte County Community Action's fuel costs jumped 40% versus 2019. It spent 58% more on food. Only 10% of the food bank's food is donated; it purchases the majority to distribute to smaller food pantries and homeless shelters in a county where one in five families identify as food insecure. 
INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES
In bigger metropolitan areas, food banks partner with Feeding America, which has developed a sophisticated network of food banks across the country, to capture unsold food from national and regional supermarket chains.
But smaller grocery stores and rural food banks lack the systems to track and divert food waste. Michael Flood, chief executive of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, thinks that will change. 
""It's going to force action,"" said Flood. ""(Smaller grocery stores) may have been donating before, but may not have had as comprehensive a food donation policy and plan in place."" 
In some cases, plans developed by towns and counties trying to comply with the state law increase costs for retailers who have to navigate varying food waste regulations across the state. 
Raley's Supermarkets, a chain of 250 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has noticed some towns begin to assess fees for compost pickup, said Chelsea Minor, corporate director of public affairs. She said the company pays the fees, even though stores ship all food waste to a private company that converts it into reusable methane gas.
CalRecycle, the state recycling agency, is trying to absorb some of the added costs, distributing around $25 million since 2018 to help food banks buy refrigerators and trucks to handle added food donations. But demand has far outpaced the state's efforts. California funded $5 million in grants last autumn, despite receiving applications worth $13 million.
""It’s really incumbent upon the local government to figure out how they're going to implement their system,"" said Rachel Machi Wagoner, director of CalRecycle. 
Facing rising fuel costs, Butte County Community Action launched an app, known as 530 Food Rescue, that connects restaurants and grocery stores to volunteers who can collect donations and drop them off at food aid organizations. 

On a recent Tuesday, volunteers picked up day-old baked goods from a Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) to deliver to the Torres Community Shelter for up to 140 homeless guests.
""Having enough food has always been an issue,"" said Taylor Storey, executive director of True North Housing Alliance, which oversees the shelter. ""With the state our climate is in now, every little bit counts and food recovery is a huge part of that.""

We see two key positive sustainability aspects of SEA Ltd.

(2) SEA Money, its digital financial service, provides cashless payment and other digital financial services to the un-banked and under-banked, Goodridge said in a client note released today.
The analyst also acknowledged that the company's gaming business bears a potential negative ESG risk given minor's gaming addiction.
We think that risks in ASEAN markets are low currently as the governments have been showing support for the e-sport industry. However, we are monitoring for potential regulation in Brazil. A positive sustainability aspect of Gaming is that Garena enables social interaction to >600mn Quarterly Active Users, which proved to be valuable given the social restrictions during COVID-19.
Goodridge also reflected on the pullback in Sea stock that is down almost 50% YTD. Still, the analyst sees significant long-term structural opportunities in e-commerce and fintech.
The market is applying an EV/GMV of 0.3x to the e-commerce business, a 50% discount to the average of global peers on 2023 consensus estimates; and we believe the market is not valuing its Digital Financial Services opportunity, the analyst concluded.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday, still weighed down by the selloff in bonds, which continued globally overnight and again in early dealings in New York.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 85 points, or 0.2%, at 34,503 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%. All three indices are on course for a losing week, having experienced a sharp upward repricing of interest rate expectations in response to coordinated guidance from Federal Reserve officials.
Wall Street analysts are now scrambling to revise their forecasts: Goldman Sachs strategist Jan Hatzius told clients in a note that the Fed may have to raise interest rates to 4% in order to bring down inflation, a full percentage point above the level that was, until recently, consensus. Higher inflation across the spectrum - and the consequent prospect of higher interest rates - is prompting analysts to shift their recommendations away from loss-making technology-driven companies and into stocks that are more firmly grounded in the material world.
Goldman analysts, for example, cut their recommendation on online brokerage  Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD) to sell from neutral, despite it having already lost nearly two-thirds of its value since Goldman helped it to list its stock less than a year ago. The analysts also downgraded their price target for  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) stock, more than tripling their estimate of its losses in 2023 and 2024. Robinhood stock fell 7.6% to a three-week low, while Coinbase stock fell 2.7%, also testing a three-week low if not breaking below it.
Beneficiaries included two of the U.S.'s two biggest grains traders, who were also helped by a UN report showing world food prices rising at their fastest since the organization started compiling records. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock rose 0.5% to a new all-time. It's now up 50% in the last six months. Rival  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) saw its stock rise as much as 0.6% to a new 14-year high before it retraced somewhat.
The mood was not helped by news out of Europe overnight, where Russian rocket artillery killed some 40 people and injured over 100 at a train station in Kramatorsk in the Ukrainian-held part of Donetsk region. There is ""no prospect of an easing of tensions or any diplomatic progress, let alone peace, with an intensification of the conflict in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions sadly seemingly inevitable,"" said Marc Ostwald, head of macro research at ADM ISI in London.
Those developments, as usual, supported crude oil prices, as the risk of tighter sanctions forcing European buyers to chase supplies elsewhere on the global market rose again. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said that it is a ""matter of time"" before the bloc's tentative sanctions are extended to include oil.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock, and Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock, up 1.2%, 1.7% and 2.8% respectively, all outperformed as crude futures rose back above $100, despite there being no end in sight to the disruption of global demand from local lockdowns across China, notably in manufacturing and financial hub Shanghai."

MADRID (Reuters) - Oil major Shell (LON:RDSa) and utilities Naturgy and Verbund are preparing binding bids to buy renewable energy assets in Spain valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), three sources close to the matter told Reuters. 
Spanish fund manager Q-Energy is selling the portfolio, taking advantage of strong appetite among European energy companies feeling increasing pressure from investors and governments to tackle climate change.
Competition for market share is intensifying as oil and gas companies set ambitious green targets, jostling with utilities and existing renewables businesses to lead the energy transition. 
Binding bids are due by the end of April, the sources said.
Shell, Naturgy and Q-Energy declined to comment. Verbund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Mainly consisting of solar projects, the assets up for sale are scattered from near Guadalajara in central Spain down to the sunny southern coastal region of Andalucia, one of the sources said.
The winning bidder is also likely to take on a team of about 25 people to develop the assets, the sources said.
Shell has made a number of solar acquisitions and this year won licences with Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY)'s Scottish Power to develop wind farms in the British North Sea. 
Naturgy changed its name from Gas Natural in 2018 and has since set out a plan to focus on renewable energy and distribution grids. Verbund generated 90% of its electricity from renewable sources last year and has said it is looking for opportunities to increase its investment in the sector. 
The portfolio being sold includes about 75 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity covered by an old subsidy regime that guarantees core earnings of roughly 60 million euros a year, one of the sources said.
It also includes development projects that will have capacity to generate about 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of electricity once construction is completed, the sources said. More than half of this has grid connection permits already. 

One gigawatt of power is roughly equivalent to the average production of a nuclear power plant.

Woodworth sees LME aluminum prices near peak with the geopolitical tensions starting to moderate and have a lower degree of impact on markets.
While we see current geopolitical events as driving lasting structural support for aluminum prices relative to the 2018 Rusal sanctions, we do believe supply/demand balances will start to normalize in 2H-22 as trade flows are gradually realigned, off-warrant material is monetized, and smelter operating rates sharply recover in China, Woodworth said in a client note.
On the other hand, Alcoa continues to experience inflationary pressures.
Accelerated cost pressures for caustic soda, pitch & coke, as well as energy/power remain headwinds. Higher caustic/carbon costs flow into COGS on lag with more impact to be felt in 2Q with prices up ~$250-350/mt y/y. AA buys ~1mt caustic annually. AA is likely to accelerate capex ahead as new low carbon technologies inch closer to commercialization. Given the current valuation, we argue the impacts from cost inflation and potentially higher capex matter to FCF yield value, the analyst added.

571,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 08:35AM ET</span>",,,,,"Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney is cautious on the US Autos sector ahead of the Q1 earnings season.
The analyst expects to see a difficult earnings season on expectations most companies will guide below the Street consensus amid supply chain and geopolitical headwinds.
The war in Ukraine has pushed costs of raw materials higher while the lack of key components resulted in some facility downtime.
""We believe that auto tier 1 suppliers in our coverage will be most impacted given their exposure to higher input costs, and to a lesser extent by lower revenue (recall that many suppliers in our coverage were generally conservative with global auto production volume assumptions for 2022, so we see less of a revenue impact on average),"" Delaney said in a client note.
Given these challenges and headwinds, the analyst expects investors to become even more selective coming out of earnings.
When it comes to OEMs, Delaney prefers General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Ford (NYSE:F) given that the former has no material exposure to Europe, and GM had less units impacted in 1Q by semis than Ford (per IHS).
Goldman Sachs sees a risk to Ford's Q1 AND CY22 EBIT estimates. On the other hand, Delaney is positive on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after in-line Q1 deliveries were reported last weekend.
""We remain positive on Tesla for the full-year driven by strong EV demand, the company's leading ability to navigate the supply chain (e.g., Tesla has been able to find alternative suppliers more quickly in part due to its vertically integrated model), and increasing prices for its vehicles. However, the ongoing shutdown of its Shanghai factory due to COVID protocols in the city is a risk,"" the analyst added.

Around 750 of the 3,000 new hires the luxury carmaker plans to bring in globally to develop the operating system were hired in Sindelfingen, working on features from in-vehicle entertainment to autonomous driving.
The centre is part of a wider effort by Mercedes-Benz to streamline its software strategy from a patchwork approach bringing in technology from a wide range of suppliers, to controlling the core of its software offering itself.
""We take responsibility for software architecture and integration – that is our main goal,"" Chief Software Officer Magnus Oestberg said in a roundtable.
""We don’t do everything ourselves – we place value on partnerships, but of course the parts that are most important for us, we do in-house.""
One such partnership is with U.S. computer graphics specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with whom Mercedes-Benz struck a deal in 2020 to develop assisted and self-driving functions which will form part of the MB.OS system launching in two years time.
The carmaker is 600 unfilled vacancies away from achieving its goal of a global team of 10,000 software engineers in Berlin, China, India, Israel, Japan, and the United States.

A planned phase-out of coal imports is the cornerstone measure in a fifth package of sanctions against Russia proposed by the European Commission this week in reaction to civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
""The VdKi believes that prices will increase in the short term due to the change in the flow of goods and shortages of certain coal qualities,"" it said in a press release that described measures already being taken to switch away from Russian coal.
Citing a survey of its 44 member companies - which import the bulk of coal going to German power stations and steelmakers, foundries and heat providers - the group added that 60% expected prices to remain steady over the medium to long term.
On Wednesday, VDKi said alternative supplies would be in place by the peak demand winter season.
Germany imported around 18.2 million tonnes of Russian coal for power generation and 2.3 million tonnes for other uses last year, accounting for about half of its total requirement. 
VDKi said traders and consumers had already begun turning away from Russia due to logistics problems since September.
Benchmark European API2 coal futures for 2023 are just under $214 a tonne, three times the level of a year ago.
Sources told Reuters this week that a EU ban on Russian coal, its first on the country's energy sector, would take full effect from mid-August, a month later than initially planned following pressure from Germany to delay the measure.

Ifo institute researcher Karen Pittel said an embargo would be ""uncomfortable in the short-term, but manageable"".
Russia has said it can sell coal elsewhere. It denies targeting civilians during what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank has adequate provisions to face potential future losses given the current market uncertainty, the bank's Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Gortazar said on Friday. 
A day earlier, the Bank of Spain told lenders to monitor credit risks of customers most exposed to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and urged banks not to release provisions, which were boosted during the pandemic, given the current uncertainty.
""At the end of 2021, the unallocated amount of the pandemic-related provision is more than 1.4 billion euros, so we are comfortable with the existing cushion to absorb any losses that might happen,"" Gortazar told shareholders during the bank's annual meeting. 
Caixabank's pandemic-related provisions fell by around a fifth in 2021 compared to the previous year, boosting the lender's recurrent net profit by more than 70%.
The Bank of Spain is monitoring the evolution of state-backed loans granted in the pandemic as repayment freezes are lifted and indirect impacts from the Ukraine war show up in credit portfolios.
The central bank's Director General for Supervision Mercedes Olano said on Thursday that she expected an increase in bad loans but that should be manageable as Spanish banks' exposure to Russia was limited.
Gortazar told investors that Caixabank was confident that credit quality this year would remain at ""very adequate"" levels.
At the end of December, the bank's non-performing loans accounted for 3.6% of total lending, in line with the previous quarter. 
Shareholders are expected to approve a gross cash dividend of 0.1463 euros per share against 2021 earnings, representing a 50% pay-out.
Caixabank aims for a dividend cash pay-out policy of between 50-60% of 2022 consolidated earnings.

Investors will also be asked to approve a reduction of the group's outstanding share capital of up to 10%.

As a result, HP shares surged yesterday to a fresh all-time high above $40.00. Given that HP stock price hit UBS price target, the analyst sees a full validation.
Moreover, he cited other factors that contributed to his downgrade call, including incremental signs of softness in low-end Consumer PCs following recent checks over the past month along with the likelihood of a slower buyback next year following the expected close of the Plantronics (NYSE:POLY) deal in late CY22.
The current valuation of roughly $42.2 billion reflects the strong execution with the P/E multiple surging around 33% since late 2021.
""While use cases for PCs has expanded the TAM, we believe the risk that PC unit growth turns negative as early as the October quarter given supply chain headwinds and macro cross currents following recent checks is increasing. As such, considering the solid share outperformance over the past 12 months (HPQ ~28% vs S&P 500 ~12%) and a NTM P/E of 9.5x in-line with our target P/E, we are stepping to the sideline,"" Vogt added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, continuing the previous session’s rebound as investors sought bargains after expectations of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate increases had weighed.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 115 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Thursday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing nearly 100 points, or 0.3%, helped by dip buying investors seeking value after digesting the likelihood of tighter monetary policy from the U.S. central bank.
However, these averages are still set for a lower week, with the Dow currently heading for a drop of 0.7%, the S&P 500 a loss of 1% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.6%. 
The minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in March, the gathering which saw the U.S. central bank hike interest rates for the first time since 2018, added to recent comments from a number of policymakers that indicated hefty interest rate increases were on the way.
St. Louis Fed President “James Bullard doubled down on his recent hawkish statements by calling for up to 300bp of tightening this year,” said ING analysts, in a note.
The new quarterly earnings season starts next week, kicking off with reports from the banking sector. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) will report before the bell on Wednesday, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) will report before the open on Thursday.
The major lenders are set to show a sharp decline in first quarter earnings from a year ago, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading, but investors are likely to focus more on the chances of increased net interest income, as the banks benefit from higher interest rates. 
There is little in the way of major economic data scheduled for Friday, and investors may instead focus on events in Ukraine following reports of many deaths as a result of a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in the east of the country.
The U.S. Congress removed its ""most favored nation"" trade status on Russia on Thursday following previous allegations of atrocities by Russian troops on Ukrainian civilians.
Oil prices stabilized Friday but are still heading for hefty weekly losses, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its Covid outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, while China announced over 21,000 new Covid cases on Thursday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $96.09 a barrel, on course for a loss of 3.2% this week, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $100.35, down 3.9% so far this week.

Adoption of superior cloud-native technologies is mission-critical for the DoD and the DIB, as all federal agencies must remain vigilant in today's heightened threat environment. It's crucial the government takes steps to adequately prepare for disruptive activity from our nation's adversaries, said Shawn Henry, CSO of CrowdStrike and president of CrowdStrike Services.
CrowdStrike provides its cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, identity and data, as well as cybersecurity response services to 65 of the Fortune 100 companies and 15 of the top 20 banks in the world.
The company has recently teamed up with other companies to improve the cyber defense system of the U.S. through the joint Critical Infrastructure Defense Project.

We view the revised outlook as highly encouraging, although we believe it will still ultimately prove too low.

Similarly, Stifel analyst Brad Reback sees the new target as very achievable as he believes the company's growth opportunity remains in the early days as the company should continue to gain unit share from its market-leading endpoint platform, drive ARPU gains given continuous product innovation as well as benefit from a very robust cybersecurity spending environment.
Moreover, given CrowdStrike's operational efficiency (~30% FCF margin in FY22), we believe it will be extremely difficult for smaller, less advanced, competitors to sustain the pace of investment in both R&D and S&M that would be needed to close the technical/sales gap needed to catch CrowdStrike, Reback added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are expected to show a sharp decline in first quarter earnings from a year ago, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading, and funds set aside for loan losses being released.
Net income for the six biggest U.S. banks will be down about 35% from a year earlier, according to analyst estimates from Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Investment banking revenues stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. 
The quarter will be challenging for the biggest banks, according to analyst Christopher McGratty of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Estimated revenue declines of 36% in investment banking and 18% in trading are the biggest headwind, he said.
""Last year was massive for capital markets at the banks so comparisons are hard,"" McGratty said.
The quarter could be seen as short-term pain with the promise of long-term gain, analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a report. An example came on March 31 when PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) lowered its first-quarter revenue forecast but increased its full-year expectations, he noted. 
Investors are expected to focus more on the prospects for banks to increase their net interest income, or the difference between income from loans and interest paid on deposits and other funds, as they benefit from higher interest rates.
Bank executives will be asked for views on whether the U.S. economy will continue to grow if the war in Ukraine continues and the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to try to cool inflation. They may be pressed on whether lower-income borrowers can make repayments after the rise in gas and food prices.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the largest bank in the United States, reports results on Wednesday.
On Thursday,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is due the following Monday. 
Analysts expect pre-provision net revenue - which is not clouded by swings in loss reserves set during the pandemic - to decline more modestly than overall profits plunge.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke expects a 7% decline in pre-provision net revenue compared with a 24% decline in earnings per share at the banks she covers.
An area of increasing concern to investors is whether banks, particularly JPMorgan, are allowing expenses to increase too much. JPMorgan's non-interest expenses jumped 11% in the last quarter, partly due to higher wages. It has also warned of rising technology and acquisition costs. 
Banks are more exposed to possible trading losses this quarter, particularly in commodities markets which turned volatile after Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Some banks, such as Citigroup, may make provisions for losses on Russian businesses after Western nations began imposing sanctions. Citigroup has said it could lose nearly half of its $9.8 billion exposure in a severe scenario. 
Another unknown is how much banks slowed their share buybacks during the quarter. Buybacks lift earnings per share, but they may have been tempered as banks saw their excess capital dented by unrealized losses on bond holdings which fell in value as yields rose during the quarter. [L2N2W31XD]

We believe this lack of clarity around the path to profitability will prevent the stock from re-rating higher, Nance said in a client note.
For Nance to become more constructive on Robinhood, he lists three things he is looking for:
1) An inflection in user growth, which we view as necessary for the company to continue to scale its platform;
2) A clearer path to near-term profitability, and
3) A more conservative Street outlook for revenue growth.
Nance is 10%/18% below 2022/2023 consensus on revenue.
The new price target on HOOD shares is $13.00, down from $15.00.
The analyst also downgraded AvidXchange (NASDAQ:AVDX) to Neutral from Buy.

The lower price target reflects higher execution risk and the fact that some positive catalysts that were expected for April are now likely to materialize at a later stage. The delay is fueled mainly by the Boeing 737 NG accident in China.
Still, Liwag remains Overweight as he is bullish on the aerospace recovery post-COVID-19 and we do not expect the industry to revert back to global shutdowns. The analyst also expects BA to return to positive FCF in 2022, for the first time in 5 years.
""Despite some of these continued execution risks, we recognize that Boeing is emerging from the worst operating period of its history. Free cash flow is inflecting positive in 2022, the first year since 2018. Aircraft cancellations have significantly slowed down and aircraft orders have been gaining positive momentum. There is a visible backlog for the Boeing 737 MAX 8,"" the MS analyst said in a client note.
Liwag also listed 5 catalysts to watch for 2022:
""We note that if Boeing is unable to certify these aircraft by year end, the program would have to comply with the Aircraft Safety and Certification Reform Act, which could add significant time and resources,"" Liwag concluded.

HAIPHONG (Reuters) -Vietnamese automaker VinFast said on Thursday its Singapore-based holding company had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with U.S. securities regulators, as it plans spending of $4 billion on its first U.S. factory complex.
VinFast, which became the first fully fledged domestic car maker in 2019, is betting big on the U.S. market, where it hopes to compete with legacy automakers and startups with electric SUVs and a battery leasing model.
A source familiar with the matter said VinFast would probably look to raise about $2 billion from the offering.
""VinFast is moving ahead with its plans but the timing of the IPO is very much open,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There needs to be a window to get the IPO done and it could easily take a couple of months.""
A unit of Vietnam's biggest conglomerate Vingroup JSC, Vinfast said it had not determined the IPO https:// size and price range.
""There are options to look at. We are still considering a lot of options,"" Chief Executive Le Thi Thu Thuy told reporters on the sidelines of an event to showcase the company's new VF8 battery-powered SUV.
She said the IPO was planned for the second half of this year as one option to fund a plant planned in North Carolina and U.S. expansion.
Last week the company said it signed a preliminary deal to initially invest $2 billion to build the North Carolina factory to make electric buses, sport utility vehicles and batteries for electric vehicles.
The company, established in 2017, plans to transition to all-electric vehicle production from late 2022.
A year ago sources said Vinfast was considering an IPO that could value the company at about $60 billion.
That valuation looks stretched in current markets, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
""Even the companies that have gone ahead with U.S. IPOs have had a sharp correction in valuations, so that's a given,"" he added.

Outside North America, VinFast is looking for a plant in Germany, it said in January.
VinFast said prices for its VF8 SUV started from $41,000 in the United States, versus about $63,000 for a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) SUV. It targets global electric vehicle sales of 42,000 this year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF)' flagship Galaxy S22 smartphone has taken a battering from reports of hobbled performance and has seen carriers half its price at home in South Korea just weeks since its launch, hurting its image as an iPhone rival.
Consumers have complained - and even filed a class-action lawsuit - about the handset maker advertising what it called its most powerful smartphone yet with scant detail about performance management software that they say drastically slows the premium device when using processor-intensive applications.
Such are the complaints that the Korea Fair Trade Commission last month began investigating the world's biggest phone vendor.
The controversy represents a blow to Samsung (KS:005930)'s reputation for high-end handsets - and potentially its finances - as it tries to make up for two years of premium sales that missed analyst estimates and reverse a decline in market share.
""The dispute will inevitably be a big hit to Samsung's credibility,"" said analyst Lee Seung-woo at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
At the heart of complaints is Samsung's Game Optimising Service (GOS) which manages device performance during gaming to prevent overheating and preserve battery life. The manufacturer introduced the software in 2016, just months before it pulled its premium Galaxy Note 7 following a series of battery fires.
GOS automatically limits handset performance during gaming but also during use of other processor-intensive applications, said Geekbench, a widely used performance scorer, which found the software slowed the S22's processor by as much as 46%.
The extent to which GOS slows the S22, lack of details about the software in marketing materials, and the inability to disable it set social media alight.
""This is an unprecedented, crazy issue that can't be excused in any way,"" ITSub, a YouTuber with 2.1 million subscribers who specialises in gadgets, said in a YouTube post.
Samsung said it issued an update to allow users to disable the software with no risk to safety. It also said it would continue to invest to innovate in both hardware and software.
PRICE DROP
The S22 series hit sales of 1 million handsets in South Korea within six weeks of release, reaching the mark two weeks faster than its predecessor, Samsung said.
""The intentional performance downgrade surely had a negative effect, but its actual impact on Samsung's sales seems limited. Data shows that sales are not much affected,"" said analyst Kim Ji-san at Kiwoom Securities.
Still, South Korea's three major telecom providers have nearly doubled subsidies for the S22, pushing its price as low as 549,000 won ($451) from a launch of 999,000 won. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 13, released in October, starts at 1,090,000 won with carriers offering smaller subsidies of around 150,000 won.
""When subsidies go up simultaneously at all three telcos, it's typically the manufacturer making up the contributions,"" said an official at carrier LG Uplus Corp, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Samsung's 2021 market share in devices over $400 shrank 3 percentage points to 17% from a year prior, while Apple's rose 5 percentage points to 60%, showed data from market researcher Counterpoint. The data also showed sales of both the S20 and S21 fell short of the S series' first-year norm of 30 million units.
Early shipments of the S22, launched late February, indicate Samsung will move over 6 million handsets by March-end, broadly in line with expectations, said Counterpoint Associate Director Sujeong Lim.
Still, Lee at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects the GOS furore to combine with increased component costs to leave April-June operating profit at Samsung's mobile arm at 3 trillion won, down from a previous forecast of 3.4 trillion won.
IBK Investment & Securities analyst Kim Un-ho also downgraded his forecast to 3 trillion won from 3.5 trillion won.
Samsung on Thursday said it expects to report an estimated 50% jump in overall January-March operating profit on April 28, as demand for its memory chips remained solid.
SPEED LIMIT
Teardowns of the lowest-priced S22 showed the handset lacked a cooling component called a vapour chamber, implying increased reliance on software to manage overheating, reviewers said.
Analysts said the lean toward software solutions stems from a renewed policy to cut costs - a strategy they said erodes a reputation as an innovator based on hardware strength.
Lee said Samsung ""is putting too much emphasis on cutting costs, which led to this unfortunate case.""
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Han Jong-hee at an annual shareholders meeting last month said he ""will not compromise quality to cut expenses, and will continue to introduce products that put utmost priority on first-rate product experience and quality.""
At least 1,885 consumers are not convinced, having filed a class-action lawsuit arguing Samsung's marketing inflates the S22's performance.

""If Porsche has a speed limit of 100 kilometres (62 miles)per hour, would you still buy it?"" said Kim Hoon-chan, the lawyer representing the consumers, adding that some 1,500 people have joined to file a second class-action suit.

The court said BT Funds Management had incorrectly charged its superannuation fund members insurance premiums that included commission payments, despite a ban on such commissions under the 2013 Future of Financial Advice reforms. 
BT Funds, the court said, had continued to charge these commissions until 2020.
The court also found BT Funds misrepresented members in their periodic statements, indicating that proper deductions were made even though such actions were not permitted.
Australian banks and financial institutions have been under scrutiny since an inquiry by the Royal Commission in 2018 found widespread shortcomings, forcing overhaul in the sector.
Friday's penalty order comes after six civil penalty proceedings filed by financial watchdog Australian Securities and Investment commission (ASIC) against the bank last November, alleging widespread compliance failures across many businesses.
Westpac and ASIC had then together proposed a A$113 million penalty to the Federal Court, with the lender saying it will remediate A$80 million to affected customers.
""Westpac and ASIC (had) jointly submitted agreed proposed penalties for each of the proceedings. These penalties remain subject to court approval and have been substantially provisioned in our full-year 2021 results,"" Westpac said.

Meanwhile, the ASIC said on Friday Westpac has indicated it will pay over A$9.8 million in remediation to over 9,900 members by July 2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc plans to take Japanese chip equipment maker Kokusai Electric Corp public in an IPO as early as June, three sources said, in what is likely to be Tokyo's biggest listing in more than three years.
While the size of the initial public offering was not immediately clear, one of the sources said Kokusai Electric would likely list with a market value of around 700 billion yen ($5.67 billion).
That would make it the biggest company to list in Tokyo since SoftBank Group Corp listed its telecom unit with a market value of 7.2 trillion yen in late 2018, according to Refinitiv data. 
The Tokyo bourse is set to approve the listing as early as May, according to the three sources, all of whom declined to be identified because the matter was still private.
Lead underwriters include SMBC Nikko Securities, a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), two of the sources said.
KKR plans to sell part of its stake to domestic and overseas investors, according to the three sources.
KKR, Kokusai Electric, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, SMBC Nikko and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment. 
Kokusai Electric was spun off from Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Kokusai Electric Inc in June 2018.
The planned listing comes after U.S. firm Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) terminated its $3.5-billion deal to buy Kokusai Electric in March last year after failing to obtain regulatory approval from China.
Kokusai Electric said at the time it would continue to seek strategic partners and that an IPO would be an option.
KKR initially aimed for an IPO in March, but decided to delay as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and higher U.S. interest rates hit the global stock market.
Kokusai Electric, a maker of equipment for thin film formation, reported operating profit of 60 billion yen on sales of 178 billion yen in the year ended March last year.
Global demand for chip equipment has surged as semiconductors are being used in everything from artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other new technology.

Global sales of total semiconductor manufacturing equipment by original equipment manufacturers reached a new high of $103 billion in 2021, surging 44.7% from the previous industry record of $71 billion in 2020, according to industry group SEMI.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, ending a volatile week on a positive note as investors continued to digest the prospect of tighter monetary policy, more sanctions on Russia, and potential French political turmoil.
By 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.5% and U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%.
Despite these gains, European equity markets are set to end the week largely lower, with the DAX down around 1.2% so far, the CAC 40 down 1.9%, and the blue Euro Stoxx 50 index 1.6% weaker.
The prospect of aggressive global rate hikes has rattled investors this week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling that it was prepared to act more quickly than previously guided to contain rampant inflation. 
The policymakers at the European Central Bank were not as hawkish, but still appeared keen to unwind stimulus, according to the accounts of their March meeting, released Thursday.
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with the United Nations General Assembly suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council over allegations of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, something denied by Moscow. 
The U.S. Congress also removed its ""most favored nation"" trade status, and the European Union agreed to ban coal imports, the first time that sanctions have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues.
Also on the radar is the risk of a political upset in France, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen very close to incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of the French presidential election.
In corporate news, Volvo (ST:VOLVb) stock fell 1% after the Swedish truck maker set aside provisions of 4 billion crowns ($423.2 million), expecting its first quarter operating income to take a hit from uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.
Banco Bpm (MI:BAMI) stock surged over 14% after French bank  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR), up 0.7%, said it has bought a 9.2% stake in Italy's third-largest lender.
Oil prices edged higher Friday but are still heading for weekly losses of around 3%, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its COVID outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, while China’s COVID-19 outbreak appears to be worsening, with new case numbers topping 21,000 on Thursday.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $96.84 a barrel, on course for a loss of 3% this week, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $101.30, down 3.5% so far this week.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian gas producer Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd's agreed merger with BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s petroleum arm is in the best interest of its shareholders, an independent expert said, valuing the combined group at around $40 billion.
Global miner BHP agreed to hive off its petroleum business to Woodside last year in a nil-premium deal that will give BHP shareholders a 48% stake in the combined group and turn Woodside into a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer.
Accounting firm KPMG assessed the value of the combined group at between $37.2 billion and $42.3 billion, equating to a per share valuation of A$26.25 to A$29.81, which was equal to or more than its estimate of Woodside's current per share value. 
""Based on these measures, the proposed transaction is, in our opinion, fair to Woodside shareholders,"" KPMG said in a report commissioned by Woodside and released to its shareholders on Friday ahead of a vote on the deal on May 19. 
Woodside's board unanimously recommended that the company's shareholders vote in favour of the merger. 
Its shares fell 1.5% to A$32.40 after the report was released, compared with a 0.5% gain in the broader market. 
KPMG's valuation of the combined group was below an estimates by UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), at about A$34.60 a share and A$33 a share respectively, based on the banks' current oil price outlooks.
The independent expert assumed a Brent oil price of $100 a barrel for 2022, falling gradually to $70 a barrel in 2026. 
Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said KPMG's report did not shine as much light on BHP's growth prospects as hoped, including significantly underestimating the potential value of its Calypso gas find in Trinidad.
He also said the cashflow profile showed little increase in free cash flow despite Woodside's Scarborough gas project coming online in 2026, which he said ""may flag risk of decline elsewhere, including at Pluto/Sangomar/North West Shelf"".
KPMG highlighted the strength of the combined balance sheet, with BHP assets being handed over debt-free, which would lower the combined group's gearing to around 8%, compared with Woodside's target gearing of 15% to 35%.
""BHP Petroleum's asset base provides Woodside with immediate access to significant development and growth opportunities, within a time frame that is unlikely to otherwise have been available to Woodside as a standalone entity,"" KPMG said.
In a separate announcement, BHP said based on Woodside's share price of $25.55 on April 6, the implied value of BHP Petroleum is $23.4 billion.

Woodside said on Friday it expects to achieve its target of more than $400 million in cost savings from combining the two groups by early 2024, including cutting executive jobs and other staff, but said carrying out the changes would require one-off costs of up to $600 million in the first two years.
The independent expert's report confirmed that Woodside will be inheriting about $3.9 billion in oil and gas closure and rehabilitation liabilities from BHP.

CMA CGM had been authorised by the European Commission to acquire Gefco's capital immediately, pending final approval of the deal expected in the coming months, it said in a statement without disclosing financial details.
Gefco had announced last week it would buy back the 75% of its shares held by RZD after the state-owned company became the target of Western sanctions.
Stellantis confirmed in a separate statement it had sold its remaining 25% stake in Gefco to CMA CGM.
France's PSA group, which last year merged with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis, fully owned Gefco until 2012, when it sold a 75% stake to RZD for 800 million euros ($869 million).
“The sale of this non-strategic asset marks the last step of our exit plan, initiated a decade ago, from the transportation and logistics industry,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said in the statement.
French media last week reported that, following the exit of RZD, the business would likely be acquired by CMA CGM, which has invested heavily in non-maritime logistics in recent years alongside container shipping, its core activity.
Gefco would allow CMA CGM's logistics division CEVA to become a market leader in auto transport and reinforce its presence in France and Europe, CMA CGM said.

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - GoTo is banking for a steady market debut after raising $1.1 billion in a relatively cautious IPO, while a booming local share market is cementing expectations that Indonesia's largest tech firm can buck a global downtrend in tech stocks.
Formed by the May merger of ride-hailing-to-payments company Gojek and e-commerce giant Tokopedia, PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk will debut in Jakarta on Monday in the culmination of one of the world's biggest initial public offerings (IPO) so far this year.
Taking advantage of new listing rules, the debut will mark a watershed for the $70 billion digital market of Southeast Asia's largest economy, where record venture funding is creating a wave of startups.
""GoTo is the most differentiated technology company in Southeast Asia. Relative to its peers, diversification is going to be a very important thing that investors will need to get on top of and understand how to properly value the business,"" said Shane Chesson, a partner at Openspace Ventures, one of Gojek's earliest investors.
Indonesia's digital economy is likely to grow nearly five times to up to $330 billion by 2030 from 2021, showed a study by consultancy Bain & Co and GoTo backers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.
While U.S.-listed peers Grab Holdings Ltd and Sea Ltd operate across Southeast Asia, GoTo focuses on Indonesia. With 2.5 million drivers, 14 million merchants and 55 million annual transacting users, GoTo's businesses straddle millions of small and mid-sized firms across the archipelago.
Angus Mackintosh, founder at CrossASEAN Research, said in a report on Smartkarma that key to GoTo's IPO was that it was small and offered only to local investors. ""This should mean that there is stronger support.""
GoTo is selling 4% in shares with most taken up by funds. Backed by names such as SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GoTo is also broadening its investor base by allocating shares to 600,000 drivers.
It will also be first to issue multiple class voting shares and tap new rules allowing unprofitable firms to list directly on the bourse's main board.
Analysts said the size and valuation are lower than expected, and that GoTo likely aimed to avoid a repeat of the experience of e-commerce peer PT Bukalapak.com Tbk.
Bukalapak raised $1.5 billion in July selling 25% of equity after initially targeting $300 million. Its stock debuted strongly but tumbled 25% within days and has halved from its IPO price.
GoTo priced its shares at 338 rupiah ($0.0235), the high end of its indicative range.
Its investors are subject to an eight-month lock-in, or two years for those with multiple class voting shares. With Bukalapak, though there was an eight-month lock-in, some funds could sell up to 10% of holdings immediately.
GoTo will become Indonesia's fourth most-valuable firm at $28 billion, with analysts estimating an index weighting of up to 9%.
""Once you're in the index, all the local funds buy quasi automatically,"" said one GoTo investor. The IDX is at a record high and is Asia's best-performer this year at 9%.
GoTo President Patrick Cao said weak markets prompted caution with pricing. Still, the firm expects listing to support fundraising and plans to list overseas within two years.

""It is a very challenging environment in the public market now, with market caps of DiDi Global Inc, Grab, DeliveryHero and many others falling below the target valuation of GoTo,"" said Jianggan Li at advisory Momentum Works.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said it is boosting starting pay for its 12,000 long-haul truck drivers who deliver merchandise to its stores and Sam's Clubs locations amid a U.S. shortage of drivers that threatens to prolong supply chain snarls and merchandise shortages. 
Qualified drivers -- who tend to be in their late 40s and 50s, according to government and industry officials -- remain in short supply. Federal limits on daily working hours, the COVID-19 pandemic and other hurdles have prompted many truck drivers to quit.
Walmart Inc is also following rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in incentivizing employees in other roles to retrain for in-demand transportation jobs required to ease supply chain bottlenecks and support their online operations. 
Walmart's drivers were already among the best compensated in the nation. Now the world's biggest retailer is upping the ante by resetting truck drivers' starting salaries to $95,000 to$110,000 a year, from $87,500 previously. 
That far exceeds 2020's median pay of $47,130 for American big-rig drivers, whose ""real"" earnings have lagged inflation and effectively remain at about 70% of what they were in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 1.9 million big-rig drivers ply the nation's roads, according to the bureau. 
Walmart's move could strengthen its competitive advantage at a time when safe, experienced 18-wheeler drivers are in short supply and as Amazon builds its own network of trucking contractors.
""We're proud to announce pay raises to ensure Walmart remains one of the best companies in the world to drive for,"" said Karisa Sprague, Walmart's senior vice president for supply chain human resources said in a statement.
Consumer demand for everything from food to furniture soared during the pandemic. That overwhelmed resources -- from truck availability and seaport capacity to warehouse and distribution space -- snarling the flow of goods and fueling higher costs.
At Walmart alone, supply chain costs were $400 million higher than expected in the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28 that included the all-important holiday shopping season, the company said.
Recent data suggests pandemic demand may be cooling.
Commerce Department data released last week suggested that pandemic-fueled purchases of physical goods may have peaked as consumers resume spending on travel and entertainment. [Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3IPvXEI] 
Walmart continues to invest aggressively in Walmart.com, and is following Amazon in creating a pathway for employees to shift to transportation jobs to support e-commerce logistics. 

Walmart's 12-week, in-house trucking training program enables employees to earn their commercial driver's license and become full-fledged Private Fleet Walmart drivers. Walmart picks up the roughly $4,000 to $5,000 cost of that training. 
The company, which pays signing bonuses that can exceed $10,000, hired a record 4,500 truck drivers last year, bringing its trucker workforce to around 12,000. It already has graduated 17 new drivers from classes in Texas and Delaware, and plans to expand the program this year with the goal of training between 400 and 800 drivers to move goods to its more than 5,300 U.S. Walmart and Sam's Club stores.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Friday, with investors continuing to digest the prospect of tighter monetary policy, the ramifications of more sanctions on Russia, and potential French political turmoil.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.9%.
Despite these gains, European equity markets are set to end the week largely lower, with the DAX down around 2.5% so far, the CAC 40 down 3.3%, and the pan-Europe STOXX 600 index 0.7% weaker.
The prospect of aggressive global rate hikes has rattled investors this week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling that it was prepared to act more quickly than previously guided to contain rampant inflation. 
The policymakers at the European Central Bank were not as hawkish, but still appeared keen to unwind stimulus, according to the accounts of their March meeting, released Thursday.
""A large number of members held the view that the current high level of inflation and its persistence called for immediate further steps towards monetary policy normalisation,"" the accounts showed.
Elsewhere, the war in Ukraine continues, with many Ukrainians being evacuated from eastern cities before an anticipated major Russian offensive.
Russian troops have been accused of committing atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, something denied by Moscow. This has resulted in the United Nations General Assembly suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.S. Congress removing its ""most favored nation"" trade status, and the European Union agreeing to ban coal imports, the first time that sanctions have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues.
Also on the radar is the risk of a political upset in France, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen very close to incumbent Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s first round of the French presidential election.
Oil prices edged higher Friday but are still heading for weekly losses of over 3%, weighed by the decision of a number of major consuming nations to release massive amounts of crude from emergency reserves as well as China’s worsening demand outlook as its COVID outbreak persists. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced earlier this week that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180 million barrel release announced by the United States last week, in order to try and replace the output lost in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Additionally, China’s COVID-19 outbreak appears to be worsening, with new case numbers topping 21,000 on Thursday. Shanghai’s lockdown was supposed to end earlier this week but is still in place, and traffic congestion levels at peak hours are 40% lower than a year ago.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $96.56 a barrel, on course for a loss of 3.7% this week, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $100.94, down 4.3% so far this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,931.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0868."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will make a ""dedicated"" self-driving taxi that will ""look futuristic,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Thursday, without giving a timeframe.
The 50-year-old billionaire, wearing a black cowboy hat and sunglasses, made the comments at the opening of Tesla's $1.1 billion factory in Texas, which is home to its new headquarters.
""Massive scale. Full self-driving. There's going to be a dedicated robotaxi,"" Musk told a large crowd at the factory.
Musk has several times missed his targets of full autonomy. In 2019, he said robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020. 
In January he said he would be ""shocked"" if Tesla did not achieve full self-driving that is safer than that of humans this year.
Tesla will expand its ""Full Self-Driving"" beta software to all North American FSD subscribers this year, he said on Thursday. 
Tesla now sells the advanced driver assistance systems for $12,000, with a promise of more features. It says the software does not make its vehicles autonomous, and requires driver supervision.
The beta version, launched in late 2020, aims to enable cars to navigate city streets better. By January, it had been installed in nearly 60,000 vehicles in the United States. 
Musk said Tesla had started deliveries of Texas-made Model Y electric sport utility vehicles, with a goal of producing half a million a year at the Texas factory, which he said would be the biggest car factory in the United States. 
He gave no details of such Model Ys, but they are likely to be lower-priced versions to better take on cheaper competitors. 
Tesla will start production next year of its Cybertruck as well as a humanoid robot, Optimus, Musk said.
The firm's new giga factories in Texas and Berlin, which will make vehicles and its own battery cells, face challenges of ramping up production with new processes https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musks-plan-tesla-built-batteries-has-an-acceleration-challenge-2022-03-11, analysts have said. 
Musk said Tesla was simplifying car making by making a car using three major parts. 

Despite record deliveries in the first quarter, a recent COVID-19 spike in China has forced Tesla to suspend production at its Shanghai factory for several days. 
Thursday's event comes after Musk surprised the market this week by revealing he had bought a stake of 9% in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and will join the board of the social media network.

JetBlue made an unsolicited offer of $33 per share in cash earlier this week, beating a near $25 per share cash-and-stock bid from Frontier made in February.
""We look forward to engaging with the Spirit Board to finalize our combination, to create a national low-fare challenger to the four large dominant U.S. carriers that will result in lower fares and better service for customers,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said.
Frontier did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spirit said the discussions with JetBlue would be in keeping with the terms of its merger agreement with Frontier. 
Denver-based Frontier and JetBlue are in a tug of war for Florida-based Spirit to capture a larger share of the leisure market and better compete with legacy carriers.
The moves towards consolidation come at a time when the pandemic battered airlines industry is working through higher fuel and labor costs to keep up the demand from travelers.
Either deal is sure to invite a close scrutiny from U.S. antitrust authorities, who have taken an aggressive stance under the Biden administration toward deals that reduce competition and raise prices.

JetBlue is already facing an antitrust lawsuit over its partnership with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. The suit filed in September alleges the deal would lead to higher fares in busy northeastern U.S. airports.
Shares of Spirit have lost 1.5% since JetBlue made its bid on April 5, while those of JetBlue have dropped 11.4%.

The Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 3% in Friday early trading, with video streaming firm Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. among the worst performers. Meituan was also a drag on the gauge, following news that Sequoia Capital reduced stakes.  
Read: Tencent Closes Game Streaming Site After Beijing Blocks Merger
Tencent’s decision comes more than a year after Beijing blocked a merger between its investees, an entity which the soon-to-be closed platform Penguin Esports was expected to be folded into. China tech stocks have come off a record low in mid-March, but yet to stage a sustainable rally amid regulatory risks.
Shares of live-streaming platforms led a decline in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks on Thursday. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closed 4.5% lower.  
“The falling of tech shares here today are mainly following the overnight ADR moves, and Sequoia Fund’s selling of Meituan shares could also hurt sector sentiment,” said Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong.
Tech shares have been hit especially hard recently, following Beijing’s crackdown on the live-streaming sector’s tax evasion and a series of hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve. 
Chinese authorities have repeatedly vowed to add policy stimulus and stabilize markets, but that’s done little to soothe investors worried of a spillover from higher U.S. interest rates, among other risks.    
On Friday, China’s regulator said it will start a campaign until early December to curb violations in internet companies’ algorithm. 
The Hang Seng Index also headed for a third day of declines, shedding as much as 1.1% on Friday. China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index also fell.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, while U.S. equity futures steadied amid cautious trading. Investors continue to monitor both the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plan to tighten its monetary policy and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.19% by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the current account n.s.a. was JPY1.648 trillion ($13.31 billion) in February, while the adjusted current account was JPY520 billion.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.09% while in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.62%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.53%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.69% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.95%.
U.S. shares saw modest gains on Thursday, and global equities are set for a weekly loss as concerns that the Fed’s policy could lead to a recession continue.
U.S. Treasury yields retreated, and the bond curve remained steeper, as the impact of the Fed’s hawkish tone in the minutes from its latest meeting continues. In the minutes, released on Wednesday, the central bank outlined plans to pare its balance sheet by more than $1 trillion annually.
Oil was mostly on a downward trend, with the International Energy Agency and the U.S. planning to release millions of barrels of crude from strategic reserves and China’s COVID-19 outbreak dampening fuel demand.
The prospect of sharp Fed rate hikes alongside a reduction in its bond holdings, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and China’s COVID-19 outbreak, with the city of Shanghai topping 21,000 daily cases, are all dampening investor sentiment and risk appetite.
“Stocks have had a little bit of a harder time this week digesting the fact that interest rates are going to be higher” amid a major shift in expectations around monetary policy, Ameriprise Financial Inc. global market strategist Anthony Saglimbene told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, a slew of Fed policymakers chimed in on policy moving forward at separate events on Thursday.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he prefers hiking the policy rate to 3% to 3.25% in the second half of 2022. However, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and his Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said that they favor hiking rates to neutral while continuing to monitor the economy.
The Reserve Bank of India will also hand down its policy decision later in the day.
Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine that started with Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 could last weeks, or even years, the U.S. warned. The European Union also reached an agreement to ban coal imports from Russia, the first time that the bans have targeted Russia’s crucial energy revenues."

Benjamin Hall was riding in a vehicle with Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova last month when it was struck by incoming fire near Kyiv. Zakrzewski, 55, and Kuvshynova, 24, were killed.
""To sum it up, I've lost half a leg on one side and a foot on the other. One hand is being put together, one eye is no longer working, and my hearing is pretty blown,"" Hall said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post along with a photo of himself on a stretcher, wearing an eye patch.
""But all in all I feel pretty damn lucky to be here - and it is the people who got me here who are amazing!,"" Hall said.

Zakrzewski was a veteran war-zone photographer who had covered multiple conflicts for Fox News, including in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Based in London, he had been working in Ukraine since February.
Kuvshynova had been helping Fox's crews navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking with sources.

(Reuters) - Graincorp said on Friday it expects underlying profit for fiscal 2022 to be around 2.5 times that of last year, as the Australian agribusiness firm benefits from supply constraints due to the Ukraine war, sending its shares to a record high. 
Australia, the world's sixth-largest wheat exporter, is set to ship a record volume this year as buyers look for suppliers to replace cargoes from Russia and Ukraine. [nL3N2VB1MM] 
Shares of Graincorp soared as much as 8.9% to A$9.46, their highest ever.
""The conflict in Ukraine and resulting trade disruptions in the Black Sea region have created uncertainty in global grain markets, with buyers looking for alternate sources of supply,"" Graincorp Chief Executive Officer Robert Spurway said.
The company said its ports were operating near capacity despite disruptions caused by flooding on the east coast.
Shipping slots on the eastern and western coasts of the country have been booked up since March, following a second straight year of a record wheat crop, which has kept a lid on Australian wheat prices.
""GNC continues to benefit because ultimately their (logistical) assets act as a bottleneck to exports, which allows them to control price - extremely advantageous when other supply chains are tight"", analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.
Graincorp expects annual underlying net profit after tax between A$310 million and A$370 million ($231.82 million - $276.72 million), up from its previous forecast of A$235 million to A$280 million and far higher than the A$139 million reported last year. 
The upgraded forecast also trounced Refinitiv analysts' expectations of A$266.2 million net income for the year. 
The company added that its processing business was also performing strongly, with oilseeds benefiting from strong global demand for crude and refined vegetable oils. 

It also pointed to higher export supply-chain margins and a good crop season, both supporting its higher profit outlook.

Kinder Happy Moments Chocolate Assortment and Kinder Mix Chocolate Treats basket are being recalled because they were manufactured in a facility where salmonella was detected, Ferrero North America said on Thursday. 
The voluntarily recall comes after Ferrero recalled its Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs from the UK stores earlier this week, adding that the affected chocolate was manufactured in Belgium and the recall may be extended to other countries. 
""While there are no reports of illness in the United States to date, Ferrero is voluntarily recalling the products out of an abundance of caution due to reported cases of salmonella in consumers that consumed products in Europe that were manufactured at the same facility,"" the statement said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. government health plan for people age 65 and over on Thursday issued its final coverage policy for Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, moving forward with an unusually strict plan limiting it to patients in clinical trials.
For drugs similar to Aduhelm, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would allow coverage if the medication is approved after a standard review by the Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA approved Aduhelm last June under an accelerated approval pathway, finding that the drug's ability to clear amyloid plaque from the brain offered enough evidence that it would likely help slow cognitive decline for Alzheimer's patients.
Medicare, however, disagreed with that assessment. The agency in January said it had significant doubts about the potential benefits of Aduhelm and proposed restricting use to clinical trials for it and similar experimental treatments.
Biogen, in an emailed statement, said the ""unprecedented CMS decision effectively denies all Medicare beneficiaries access to Aduhelm,"" and said it is ""carefully considering its options"" as it evaluates the business impact of the decision.
Because Alzheimer's is an age-related disease, around 85% of people who might use the medicine are in the government plan.
Medicare's action ""likely spells the end for Aduhelm ... though we believe this outcome was expected by most,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note on Thursday.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd each have plaque-clearing drugs in late-stage development.
Under Medicare's final decision, drugs approved by the traditional FDA process that show clear patient benefit would not have any subsequent clinical trial requirements.
Both Lilly and Eisai, which is partnered with Biogen, have said they plan to seek accelerated approval of their Alzheimer's drugs. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wall Street analysts had projected last year that Aduhelm - the first new Alzheimer's drug to win U.S. approval in 20 years - would be a multibillion-dollar product. But sales have been marginal following the backlash over the FDA's controversial approval decision.
Wall Street currently estimates 2022 Aduhelm sales of just $69 million, according to Refinitiv.
Thursday's decision comes despite significant pressure from patient advocates and drugmakers seeking wider access to the drug. They argued that Medicare's trial requirement would unfairly restrict use of a drug approved by the FDA for a broader patient population.
Alzheimer's Association Chief Executive Harry Johns in a statement said, ""Denying access to FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments is wrong,"" adding that the patient group was ""very disappointed"" with Medicare's decision.
Patient groups last month launched a public advertising campaign aimed at persuading Medicare to loosen its proposed restrictions. They had also been meeting with lawmakers and Biden administration officials.
Others, including some prominent neurologists, have praised Medicare's plan, citing concerns over the approval of Aduhelm after only one of two late-stage trials showed that it helped slow cognitive decline for people with early Alzheimer's.

Investigations have been launched into the FDA's decision taken over objections of its own outside advisers, and doctors have held back on prescribing Aduhelm.
Roche and Eisai each expect to report results from late-stage Phase III trials later this year. Lilly anticipates Phase III results by mid-2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York's attorney general on Thursday asked a state judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt of court for not turning over documents she subpoenaed for a civil probe into the former U.S. president's business practices.
In a court filing, Attorney General Letitia James said Trump failed to honor a court order that he comply ""in full"" with her subpoena for documents and information by March 31.
James asked that Trump be fined $10,000 a day, and perhaps more, until he complies.
""The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J. Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,"" James said in a statement. ""Instead of obeying a court order, Mr. Trump is trying to evade it.""
Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and called the probe a ""witch hunt.""
“We are prepared to adamantly oppose the frivolous and baseless motion filed by the attorney general's office,"" Trump's lawyer Alina Habba said in an emailed statement. ""Our client has consistently complied with the many discovery requests served by the attorney general’s office over the years.""
James' three-year probe and a parallel criminal probe led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.
Last week, James said her probe had found ""significant evidence"" suggesting that for more than a decade the company's financial statements ""relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits.""
James has questioned how the Trump Organization valued the ""Trump brand,"" as well as properties including golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump's own penthouse apartment in midtown Manhattan's Trump Tower.
On Feb. 17, Justice Arthur Engoron of the New York state court in Manhattan ordered Trump to produce documents covered by the subpoena by March 3, and for Trump and his adult children Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump to be questioned under oath.
Trump later obtained an extension through March 31 to produce documents. He and his children asked a state appeals court to overturn the ruling requiring their testimony.
'THE SHIP HAS... SAILED'
In a March 31 filing, another lawyer for Trump objected that the subpoena was ""grossly overbroad"" and unduly burdensome, and sought information protected by attorney-client or executive privilege.
But James said on Thursday that Engoron's order was not an ""opening bid"" entitling Trump to renegotiate the subpoena.
""The ship has long since sailed on Mr. Trump's ability to raise any such objections,"" she wrote.
James said that given Trump's ""purported meticulous involvement"" at his company, ""it seems incredible that now virtually no documents exist"" suggesting he had a personal role in reviewing asset valuations.
And while James has received Trump's personal tax returns from 2011 to 2018, she said Trump has stonewalled on providing other materials, including documents or notes in his own handwriting.
In February, Trump's longtime accounting firm Mazars USA cut ties with him and the Trump Organization, saying it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements.
The Trumps have called James' probe ""a politically-motivated gambit that was commenced in bad faith,"" and intended to advance her career at their expense. 
James, a Democrat, is seeking reelection in November. Trump, a Republican, may seek a second White House term in 2024.
The status of Bragg's criminal probe has been uncertain, following the resignation in February of the two senior prosecutors who had led it.
According to the New York Times, Bragg, who took office in January and inherited the criminal probe from fellow Democrat Cyrus Vance Jr, has expressed doubts about charging Trump.

In a statement on Thursday, Bragg said his office's investigation is continuing and defended his handling of it.
""Prosecutors fulfilling their duties cannot and do not bring only cases that are 'slam dunks,'"" he said. ""I pledge that the office will publicly state the conclusion of our investigation - whether we conclude our work without bringing charges, or move forward with an indictment.""

""We've been trading in relatively thin liquidity the last two weeks, which makes it easier to have (bigger) moves both up and down."" 
St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, said the Fed remains behind in its fight against inflation despite increases in mortgage rates and government bond yields. A day earlier, minutes released from the Fed's March meeting suggested the U.S. central bank's balance sheet reduction could start next month. 
U.S. Treasury yields have jumped along with expectations of faster policy tightening by the Fed and other central banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.06 points, or 0.25%, to 34,583.57, the S&P 500 gained 19.06 points, or 0.43%, to 4,500.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.48 points, or 0.06%, to 13,897.30.
The S&P 500 ended lower for the last two sessions in a row.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.21% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.11%.
In Treasuries, the 2 year-10 year spread widened as traders sharpened their focus on the pace and scope of the Fed's plans to reduce its balance sheet.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 3.8 basis points to 2.647% while the 2-year note yield was down 4.5 basis points at 2.457%, leaving the 2-10 spread at 18.72 basis points.
The near 27 basis point widening of that spread so far this week is the most for any week back to June 2013. Last week the spread tightened 27.5 basis points in the sharpest weekly tightening since September 2011. The yield curve inverted last week, signaling to some investors that a recession may be coming in a year or two. 
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar index hit 99.823, the highest since late May 2020. The euro hit a one-month trough against the dollar at $1.0871.
The dollar index rose 0.1%, with the euro last unchanged at $1.0878.
The euro has been pressured by what ING analysts called a ""double threat"" from mounting sanctions on Russia and uncertainty about the French election.

France votes on Sunday in the first presidential election round. While incumbent Emmanuel Macron is likely to re-take the presidency, his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen has been closing the gap, opinion polls show.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Joe Biden's pick to be the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, a former official for defense acquisition in the administration of President Barack Obama.
Bill LaPlante, who was head of Charles Stark Draper Laboratories Inc, was approved by voice vote to be the next undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment at the Department of Defense.
Last month, Biden sought a record peacetime national defense budget of $813 billion, including the largest research and development budget in history.
At the same time, the budget slows the Defense Department's purchasing of the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, after Air Force leaders complained that technological improvements to the jet's hardware were too slow.
Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.
Only 61 F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) were requested by the Pentagon, down from a request of 85 last year, though experts believe Congress will increase that figure during the budget process.
The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
The 2023 fiscal budget, which starts on Oct. 1, boasts the Pentagon's largest research and development budget ever, with $130 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A special economic zone on a tourist-centric island on Honduras' Caribbean coast has adopted bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender, officials of the zone said on Thursday.
Called ""Honduras Prospera,"" the special zone was established in 2020 to help encourage investment, and has administrative, fiscal and budgetary autonomy. 
""Prospera's flexible regulatory framework enables crypto-innovation and the use of Bitcoin by residents, businesses, and governments,"" Honduras Prospera said in a statement. 
The economic zone will also let municipalities, local governments and international firms issue bitcoin bonds from the area's jurisdiction.
Honduras Prospera covers parts of the picturesque Roatan island as well as the city of La Ceiba on Honduras' Atlantic Coast.
Neighboring country El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in September, the first country in the world to do so, although the roll-out was bumpy and mired in public skepticism. 

In Honduras, the Central Bank has said it cannot vouch for cryptocurrency transactions.
""Any transaction carried out with this type of virtual asset falls under the responsibility and risk of the person carrying it out,"" the bank said in a March statement sent in response to queries on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Chinese national has been sentenced to 29 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to conspiring to steal trade secrets from agricultural company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) to benefit the Chinese government, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
Xiang Haitao, 44, who was employed by Monsanto and a subsidiary from 2008 to 2017, had pleaded guilty in Missouri federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage.
On Thursday, he was sentenced to 29 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release and a $150,000 fine, the Justice Department said in a statement.
""Xiang conspired to steal an important trade secret to gain an unfair advantage for himself and the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division.
""Economic espionage is a serious offense that can threaten U.S. companies’ competitive advantage, and the National Security Division is committed to holding accountable anyone who steals trade secrets to benefit a foreign government,"" Olsen said.
Federal officials found Xiang in possession of copies of a proprietary predictive algorithm developed by Monsanto as he was waiting to board a flight to China in June 2017, the Justice Department said.

He was allowed to fly to China, where he worked for the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Soil Science. He was arrested when he returned to the United States in November 2019, the Justice Department added.
Monsanto was acquired by  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) in 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House and Senate lawmakers said Thursday they have chosen negotiators to hammer out a deal on a bill to provide $52 billion in government subsidies for semiconductor production after months of discussion.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy named about 80 House lawmakers including the chairs and top Republicans on some key committees that will take part in a process known as a ""conference committee"" to reach a compromise version.
The Senate first passed chips legislation in June that also authorized $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China, while the House passed its version in early February that contained different provisions aimed at boosting competition with China.
A persistent industry-wide chip shortage has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some companies to scale back production.
There are growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors and the White House says funding is an urgent national security concern to ensure long-term U.S. supply of chips.
In 1990, the United States produced 37% of all chips while today it accounts for only 12% of global production.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday they are also both naming 13 negotiators.
""The Senate must now restore a product that reflects what passed this chamber with bipartisan support,"" McConnell said. ""Without major concessions and changes from House Democrats, this legislation has no chance of becoming law.""
The House bill has several trade provisions and would authorize $8 billion in U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established by the Paris Agreement to combat climate change.
Schumer said negotiators will ensure ""the Senate-passed bill stays on track to create more good-paying jobs, boost domestic manufacturing, and spark American ingenuity.""

On Wednesday, the White House held a classified briefing with lawmakers to discuss the ""escalating vulnerabilities"" to the U.S. economy from the chips supply chain.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando said the administration would work to help lawmakers reach consensus, saying the legislation ""brings home manufacturing jobs, secures our supply chains, and helps America stay globally competitive.""

(Reuters) -HP Inc's stock soared to a record high on Thursday after billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it had taken an 11.4% stake valued at about $4.2 billion in the maker of personal computers and printers.
Berkshire revealed in a Wednesday night regulatory filing that it owned nearly 121 million HP (NYSE:HPQ) shares, including 11.1 million purchased this week.
Shares of HP closed up $5.15, or 14.8%, at $40.06, after earlier rising to $41.46.
Companies' stock prices often rise when Berkshire discloses new stakes, regarded as a stamp of approval from Buffett.
Berkshire does not regularly invest in technology companies, despite ending 2021 with a $161.2 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Buffett considers the iPhone maker more of a consumer company that he can understand.
""Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world's most respected investors and we welcome them as an investor,"" HP said in a statement.
Separated in 2015 from the former Hewlett-Packard, HP is benefiting from increased demand as people spend more time working and being schooled at home.
The Palo Alto, California-based company agreed last month to buy audio and video accessories maker Poly, once known as Plantronics (NYSE:POLY), for $1.7 billion.
Buffett has struggled to invest Berkshire's cash, which totaled $146.7 billion at year end, citing high valuations and competition from private equity and other investors.
But in the last month, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate said it has committed approximately $22 billion to major new investments.
These include a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) and an $11.6 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp, Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2016.
Berkshire also owns dozens of businesses including Geico auto insurance and the BNSF railroad.
It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said HP might appeal to Berkshire because HP is aggressively returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and higher dividends.

""HP operates in markets that are challenging to (durably) grow at heightened rates, so focusing on margins and returns are the best way to reward shareholders,"" Cash said. ""Within tech, HP can be considered a value play.""
Berkshire repurchased $27 billion of its own stock in 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) -Qatar Airways and Airbus clashed in court on Thursday over the fate of billions of dollars of jet orders as their 25-year partnership unravelled in scenes resembling a corporate divorce trial.
The two sides have been locked for months in a dispute over damaged lightning protection within the painted skin of the A350 that Qatar says has forced it to ground jets and stop taking deliveries.
Their dispute widened to the industry's best-selling model in January when Airbus revoked an order from Qatar for the smaller A321neo, declaring ""enough is enough"" after the public clash over A350 safety.
On Thursday, Qatar asked a UK judge to freeze the cancellation pending a full trial expected to be months away. The first A321neo is due to be delivered 2023. A lawyer for Airbus said a Boeing (NYSE:BA) jet would be a suitable replacement, a statement which the airline noted was at odds with the plane maker's marketing pitch.
The judge deferred a decision until at least April 26, when a further hearing is due on a separate issue in the intertwined A350 dispute.
The case has illustrated the delicate relations between France, where Airbus is based, and one of its closest Gulf allies. Qatar is a major gas producer and Europe is looking to reduce reliance on Russian gas.
Court filings have also shed light on industrial planning and details of usually secretive aircraft negotiations.
Qatar launched the A350, Europe's answer to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with an order for 80 in 2007 to serve its Doha hub, becoming the jet's biggest operator.
Since last year, however, it has grounded 23 of the jets, voicing concerns over problems with lightning protection exposed by cracked and bubbling paint.
It is suing Airbus for steadily rising compensation that now exceeds $1 billion.
""One would certainly not want to be sitting under a roof in that condition,"" Qatar Airways' lawyer Philip Shepherd told the court, referring to damage on the crown of the fuselage of A350s.
The world's largest planemaker has acknowledged quality problems but insists damage is well within safety tolerances, noting European regulators consider them airworthy and other airlines keep flying them despite various degrees of similar findings.
Lightning strikes jets about once a year and the A350 includes a layer of copper foil to protect its lightweight carbon fuselage.
Airbus told the court relations with the Gulf carrier had ""seriously broken down"" after what it describes as a manoeuvre to win compensation and cover up weak demand for plane tickets.
Qatar says Airbus has failed to honour its promises and insists it desperately needs more planes to host the World Cup this year.
""Airbus considers that Qatar Airways' conduct has broken relations,"" Airbus lawyer Sonia Tolaney said.
The two sides had what amounted to an industrial custody row in court, arguing over whether they could work together on other planes still in the fleet or yet to be delivered.
The issue of co-operation is significant as the judge ponders whether to keep the A321neo deal alive for now.
Qatar also accused Airbus of tilting the argument by increasing the threshold for problems with the anti-lightning mesh allowed in the repair manual.
""That is simply making the goal smaller at their end, half way through the game,"" Shepherd told the hearing. 
Airbus said this misrepresented the facts but confirmed it had increased the maximum gap to 1,000 mm2 from 200 mm2 following engineering analysis.
'NOT UNIQUE'
To decide on Qatar's request for an injunction, the judge will also weigh which side has most to lose and to what extent the plane is unique in its category.
That issue goes to the heart of Airbus's battle for sales with rival Boeing in the busiest part of the market. Arguments in court appeared to contrast with rhetoric at air shows.
Airbus told the court Qatar Airways could replace the cancelled A321neos with the rival Boeing 737 MAX, which it provisionally ordered in December, or Airbus jets that are available from leasing companies.
The MAX has ""comparable if not better range,"" Airbus lawyer Tolaney said.
Last year, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said the A321neo had ""unmatched capabilities (and) operating economics"". Airbus has outsold Boeing four to one at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets.
It was left to Qatar Airways to play up the ""unique"" benefits of the A321neo though the airline faced repeated questions from the judge on whether it could rely on leasing firms or Boeing instead.
Analysts say the largest MAX variant has less range than the A321neo, prompting Boeing to think about designing a new jet.

Airline chiefs contacted by Reuters did not share Qatar's concerns over airworthiness of the A350 but voiced impatience over the plane's sporadic surface problems and the breakdown of an industry consensus over safety.
""It is not good for the industry. They both need to get it out of the courtroom and find an agreement,"" the chief executive of one Airbus customer told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senior officials in the Biden administration and major automotive leaders agree that charging station infrastructure for electric vehicles should offer an interoperable experience based on any car model.
The White House said a virtual meeting was held Wednesday with major automotive leaders, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and General Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra to discuss electric vehicles and charging.
The administration said in a statement ""there was broad consensus that charging stations and vehicles need to be interoperable and provide a seamless user experience, no matter what car you drive or where you charge your EV.""
Musk has often been at odds with the White House, frequently firing off harsh tweets directed at President Joe Biden. In February, Biden publicly acknowledged the role of Tesla in U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing, after Musk repeatedly complained about being ignored.
Congress last year approved $7.5 billion in government funding for EV charging stations, but legislation has stalled for new tax incentives to purchase and build EVs. 
Biden wants at least 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be EVs or plug-in hybrids.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley, Chrysler-parent Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Americas chair Jeremie Papin were among other auto leaders who took part in Wednesday's meeting, which discussed U.S. funding to ""create a national network of 500,000 chargers.""
On Thursday, Farley posted a tweet praising the meeting's focus on charging, including for commercial vehicles.
Also in attendance were Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu.
Granholm said Thursday on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it was a ""very productive meeting - as we roll out EVs and charging infrastructure the CEOs were very forthcoming about government's role as a partner in electrifying the transportation sector.""
Executives from Hyundai Motor America, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) of America, Mazda North America,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) North America Mercedes-Benz USA and Kia Motors America also took part.
Each auto executive received about 90 seconds to talk about their EV plans and spoke about a wide range of issues around EVs, including battery supply chain concerns, one company executive told Reuters. Biden last week invoked the Defense Production Act in a bid to boost U.S. production of minerals needed for electric vehicles.

Last week, automakers backed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new tougher vehicle emissions regulations in a court challenge brought by some states and ethanol groups.
Corn growers, a  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) subsidiary and other ethanol producers said the new EPA rules revising emission requirements through 2026 ""effectively mandate the production and sale of electric cars rather than cars powered by internal combustion engines.""

Mega-cap growth stocks came under pressure earlier this week after comments from Fed policymakers and minutes from the central bank's March meeting suggested a rapid removal of stimulus measures put in place during the pandemic.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank's short-term policy rate should reach 3.5% later this year.
Minutes released on Wednesday showed that Fed officials ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase since 2018.
""The realization for investors continues that the Fed is still not at max hawkishness and we're going to err on the side of them wanting to do more to continue to control inflation,"" said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital Network, an investment marketplace firm.

But now the market enters a fairly quiet period as people head out on spring break vacations, with earnings from large companies expected to roll out later this month.
It appeared to be dip buying investors who pushed the indexes higher on Thursday after they were mixed to down earlier in the session. The Fed plans to start paring back its bond purchases as early as May, when it has its next policy meeting. 
Analysts believe the first quarter will be a good one for tech companies, though higher yields on bonds may take some of the investor momentum out of the space. 
Also taking space on the calendar is next month’s annual meeting of Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb), back in-person for the first time in two years. The event is usually a lively blend of entertainment, shopping and folksy investment advice from Buffett and his long-time lieutenant, Charlie Munger.
Buffett has been making waves lately, late Wednesday disclosing an 11% stake in HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the computer maker after only recently buying the insurance company Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) for $11.6 billion. Perhaps elephant hunting season has finally arrived for the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Wholesale inventories
U.S. month-over-month wholesale inventories data will be released Friday at 10:00 AM ET. Analysts predict wholesale inventories, which gauge the change in the total value of goods held in inventory by wholesalers across the United States, will come in at 2.1%, above the previously reported 0.8%.
2. Signs of life
The U.S. Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count, which is considered a leading indicator of demand for oil products, will also be reported Friday at 1 PM ET. The last count had the number at 531, according to data tracked by Investing.com.
3. Congress recess
After confirming President Joe Biden’s pick for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to become the first Black woman jurist on the high court, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are leaving for recess with some business hanging. That includes the confirmation votes for Biden’s Fed nominees, including Chair Jerome Powell’s second term, and more funds for his Covid preparedness plans, which were stuck in the Senate as of midday Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc., the world's biggest retailer, will face a shareholder vote calling for an independent audit of its treatment of warehouse workers after the top U.S. securities regulator turned down the company's request to skip the resolution.
The decision means Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) investors will get to vote on the issue for the first time, proponents said, taking advantage of guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November that made it more supportive of votes on significant social issues.
Founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, Amazon has drawn increasing criticism in recent years for its treatment of workers, including claims of poor working conditions at its warehouses and its attempts to block workers unionising.
With investors globally pushing companies to look after their workforce as part of an increased focus on social issues, London-based retail investor activist platform Tulipshare helped file a resolution seeking to shine a light on Amazon's practices.
Specifically, the proposal - filed under the name of a Tulipshare investor, Thomas Dadashi Tazehozi - asked the company to commission an independent audit and report on working conditions at the company.
While Amazon asked the SEC to let them refuse to put the resolution to a vote, claiming the issue relates to ordinary business operations, an April 6 letter from the SEC disagreed.
""In our view, the Tazehozi Proposal transcends ordinary business matters,"" said the letter seen by Reuters. 
Amazon declined to comment on the SEC response when contacted by Reuters. An annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled for May 25. 
A separate shareholder resolution seeking an audit on workplace health and safety submitted to the company by investors including the Domini Impact Equity Fund was not backed by the regulator, though.
Noting that the second resolution was ""substantially duplicative"" of the first, the SEC said there was some basis for the company's request that it be allowed to skip the vote, and it would not recommend enforcement action if Amazon were to do so.

Last week some 55% of workers who cast a ballot at a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to form the first U.S. union at Amazon.
In its objection filed with the National Labor Relations Board, Amazon on Thursday accused the union, called the Amazon Labor Union, of threatening to act against staff unless they voted for organising. An attorney for the union called the assertion ""really absurd.""

MILAN (Reuters) -The Benetton family, which controls Italy's Atlantia, has told Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield it is not interested in the funds' takeover approach for the Italian road and airport operator.
In a statement issued on Thursday by Edizione, the family's holding company, the Benettons said the investment in Atlantia is strategic and they want to preserve the group's Italian roots and its integrity.
They also confirmed discussions are under way with Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), as a partner, for their own deal that would strengthen their grip on Atlantia but added that no agreement had yet been reached.
GIP and Brookfield earlier confirmed they had pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia, which operates airports in Rome and southern France and motorways in Europe and Latin America.
Shares in Atlantia, which has a market capitalisation of more than 16 billion euros ($17.5 billion), surged as much as 12% on the prospect of a bidding war also involving Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid soccer club.
They ended up 6.9% at 20.3 euros.
The two funds, which specialise in infrastructure investments, confirmed they met Edizione on March 3 and 23 and presented the proposal to it on March 30. Edizione owns 33% of Atlantia.
The funds have an agreement with Perez's ACS for the Spanish construction company to acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer was completed.
The idea is to create two companies to extract more value, a source close to the funds said, adding Atlantia would be delisted.
GIP and Brookfield are working with Rothschild and another bank while Edizione and Blackstone have enlisted the help of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), two separate sources said. 
GOLDEN POWERS
GIP and Brookfield had cautioned that they might not make a bid for a company, with an enterprise value of more than 45 billion euros once net debt is factored in.
Politics also risk complicating the situation, with the Italian government having veto ""golden powers"" over ownership of the country's airports. 
""The theoretical deal would be markedly complex due to valuation, political and financing considerations,"" Kepler Cheuvreux said in a note, referring to any deal by ACS and its partners.
Alessandro Benetton was appointed chairman of Edizione this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments. Edizione said at the time it deemed its investment in Atlantia to be strategic.
Perez and the Benettons are already linked through their joint ownership of Spanish highway operator Abertis.
Through ACS, Perez previously pursued a bid for Atlantia's Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia but did not manage to secure the backing of the Italian government.

Atlantia eventually sold the unit, focus of a dispute with the government after the deadly collapse of a bridge in 2018, to Italian state lender CDP and allies. It is set to pocket 8 billion euros from the deal this year.

(Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), General Motors and even the U.S. Energy Department are investing heavily in a crop of newer technologies that could revolutionize the way lithium is produced for electric vehicle batteries.
Now those technologies just have to prove they work on a commercial scale.
If they do, miners will be able to boost global lithium production with a footprint far smaller than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds, which often are the size of multiple football fields and unpopular with local communities.
These so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies extract the white metal from brine using filters, membranes, ceramic beads or other equipment that can typically be housed in a small warehouse. But they often use lots of potable water and electricity, and none have worked at commercial scale.
Global automakers, mining companies and investors are pouring millions of dollars into DLE companies, betting they can supply the bulk of the lithium needed to power the electric vehicle revolution.
""It's such a game changer. There's huge opportunities,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told an energy conference last month about DLE.
Granholm's department has given Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc a $15 million grant to test DLE technology at California's Salton Sea, under which sit large geothermal lithium deposits, and is considering funding other DLE projects.
DLE technologies would challenge traditional miners such as  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp, the world's largest lithium producer, and prospective miners such as Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, ioneer Ltd and Piedmont Lithium Inc.
Albemarle is studying various DLE technologies but its executives have said DLE likely works best when engineered for a specific lithium deposit, which could curb enthusiasm.
Large water usage by several types of DLE technologies has raised eyebrows. The technology General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is relying on to supply a ""sizeable amount"" of its lithium from the Salton Sea region uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced.
Privately held Lilac Solutions Inc, backed by BMW and Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, developed that technology and said it could use a desalination plant to filter brackish water to avoid using potable water.
""If needed, we're willing to make those capital investments to ensure we're not jeopardizing anyone's freshwater,"" said Lilac CEO Dave Snydacker. ""New technology is absolutely essential for society to obtain the volumes of lithium that are necessary for electric vehicles.""
Prominent short seller Hindenburg Research issued a 59-page report in February questioning whether the DLE technology from Standard Lithium Ltd even works, despite backing for its Arkansas project from chemical giants Koch Industries Inc and  Lanxess  AG (DE:LXSG).
""DLE is one of those technologies that's been a hope and a prayer, Hail Mary for most, so that's fertile ground for stock promoters,"" said Nathan Anderson of Hindenburg.
Standard disputed the allegations in the report, which erased more than $300 million in Standard's market value in one day and stoked fears about the DLE movement. The stock has partially recovered.
'I'M A SKEPTIC'
There are dozens of DLE-focused companies worldwide, some with their own technologies, some with brine-rich acreage and some with both.
""Direct lithium extraction is becoming a hot subject,"" said Olivier Le Peuch, chief executive of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Inc, which is developing DLE technology with Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp. It hopes to supply Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Nevada Gigafactory, but has acknowledged it must find a way to produce the metal without potable water.
U.S. and global ambitions to go green are at stake. At least 70% of the U.S. lithium deposits are held in brine reserves, according to the Energy Department. Elsewhere, DLE offers a chance to produce lithium in areas where open-pit mines face strong opposition.
In Germany, Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd aims to use DLE the produce the metal for Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) and other automakers from Germany's Black Forest.
""As the EV transition accelerates, we can grow with that market,"" said Horst Kreuter, Vulcan's CEO.
Privately held Luna Lithium Ltd plans to use DLE in Nevada, CEO Emily Hersh said. In Utah's Great Salt Lake, Compass Minerals International (NYSE:CMP) Inc has been trying to chose a DLE technology for more than a year and hopes to make a decision this summer.
Galvanic Energy LLC aims to sell to sell the 100,000 brine-rich acres it controls in Arkansas if it finds a DLE technology that works.
""These companies promote and talk about what they can do, but I'm a skeptic until proven otherwise,"" said Brent Wilson, a former Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) geologist who formed Galvanic in 2018. 
Rio Tinto Ltd paid $825 million last December for an Argentina DLE project, which it said ""has the potential to significantly increase lithium recoveries as compared to solar evaporation ponds.""
Privately held Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, known as EnergyX, has developed a DLE technology that uses membranes to filter lithium, but in some cases, EnergyX's DLE membrane technology may have to be paired with another DLE technology, said CEO Teague Egan.
""Our DLE membrane technology is very good, but DLE doesn't have to mean one technology or another. I think that's what people fail to see,"" said Egan, who aims to take EnergyX public by mid-2023.
EnergyX recently sent a pilot version of its technology to Bolivia in the hopes of convincing La Paz to chose it to develop the Uyuni salt flat, one of the world's largest lithium deposits. 

Lilac, as well as several Chinese and Russian companies, are also competing for the Bolivian project, pointing to the rising global attention paid to the industry.
""DLE is not a magic wand, but it is a very valuable tool in the toolkit,"" said Luna Lithium's Hersh.

(Reuters) -The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said on Thursday it granted  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) an extension to build two pipelines in Texas and Louisiana to connect to a Texas liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, and NextDecade (NASDAQ:NEXT) Corp is also seeking more time to build a Texas LNG project.
Sempra Energy was granted an extension until March 31, 2023, for the two pipelines that will connect to its Port Arthur LNG plant. NextDecade Corp on Wednesday also sought an extension, to November 2028, for its Rio Grande LNG project in Brownsville, Texas.
NextDecade did not reply to a request for comment.
NextDecade on Wednesday also announced it had reached a 20-year deal to supply 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the proposed Rio Grande facility to a unit of China's ENN Natural Gas Co.
Several LNG developers have announced new deals this year that could push ahead proposed plants.  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) signed a 2.7 MTPA deal with ENN while Mexico Pacific Ltd received a 2 MPTA deal from Chinese gas and power supplier Guangzhou Development Co. 

In January, NextDecade said a financial investment decision for the Rio Grande LNG project would be delayed until the second half of the year. It was originally expected to start producing LNG in 2023.
At the start of 2020 and again in 2021, roughly a dozen firms signaled plans for financial investment decisions on proposed projects. But only Sempra's Costa Azul in Mexico started construction in 2020. Numerous others have been pushed into 2022.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Robin Hayes, the ebullient chief executive of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp, was on an Amtrak train on Tuesday coming back from Boston when news broke that his company had made an offer to acquire  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc.
Hayes said the company was not yet ready to go public with its offer for the ultra-low-cost carrier, but the news leak forced its hand. On a conference call the next morning, the reasons were apparent as JetBlue struggled to convince investors of the rationale behind its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid.
The surprise move by the New York-based carrier has baffled Wall Street because it seeks to combine two companies with very little in common other than fleets dominated by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) jets. As a result, the deal is expected to be very expensive for JetBlue, which raises questions about any assumed synergies.
JetBlue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company's stock has fallen about 19% since the news broke. JetBlue shares were down 4.2% at $11.92 on Thursday afternoon.
A main concern of investors is the starkly different business models of the two carriers.
Spirit is a no-frills carrier that relies on fares stripped down to the lowest possible level, supplemented by charges for extras such as booking through a call center, a strategy known as unbundling. 
The success of its business model is driven by a low cost structure that has allowed it to offer low base fares and maintain high profit margins.
In contrast, JetBlue is a premium leisure airline. Its offerings include free checked bags, an assortment of complementary food and private suites.
Hayes is promising lower fares following the deal's completion. Delivering on that promise, however, would be a tall order, analysts say.
JetBlue's costs and fares are already higher than those at Spirit and other ultra-low-cost carriers. Since the company would have to raise salaries of Spirit pilots to bring them in line with its pay structure, the cost pressure is expected to worsen.
Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James, estimates wages for Spirit pilots would need to increase in the range of 7% to 51% to reach parity with JetBlue's current rates.
The company also plans to retrofit Spirit's fleet in order to provide more leg room and a ""superior"" onboard experience to customers, which it said would be a multiyear investment. Industry experts say the move would leave the airline with fewer seats to fill with passengers, resulting in lower productivity.
Equally daunting will be the task of integrating the culture of two airlines that have been following different service models. JetBlue told investors that cultural integration would be critical to the deal's success.
Aviation analyst Robert Mann reckons JetBlue's offer was ""rushed to market."" ""Everybody is kind of somewhere between pulling their hair out and just dismissing it,"" he said.
'A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY' 
JetBlue, however, views the deal as a way to expand its domestic footprint amid persistent labor and aircraft shortages. It tried to buy Virgin America in 2016, but lost out to  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Inc.
Hayes said the company had been thinking about how to pursue growth for a long time. And once budget carrier Frontier Group Holdings Inc announced a deal in early February to merge with Spirit, he said it created ""a window of opportunity that if you don't act in it, it's gone."" 
The company is betting a combination with Spirit would accelerate its growth in Florida and Los Angeles and open up opportunities in Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta and Miami.
Following the deal, the two carriers will have a combined fleet of 455 aircraft, with deliveries of another 220 jets from Airbus expected by 2027. It offers greater flexibility at a time when airlines cannot get new aircraft delivered fast enough.
Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group, said growing in size would also allow JetBlue to attract pilots by offering them better careers.
""Clearly, the airline wants to be more than just a domestic airline,"" Harteveldt said. ""So a combined JetBlue and Spirit would be appealing to pilots who want to work for a growing airline in the future.""
EXECUTION RISK
Despite these potential long-term benefits, industry experts say the deal is fraught with execution risks.
Veteran budget airline investor Bill Franke, who masterminded Frontier's tie-up with Spirit, once said that failing to remain disciplined about the business model and allowing other costs to creep in was the ""path to hell"" for airlines.
Franke stuck to that formula in the deal with Spirit. The two carriers not only have no-frills business models but also have highly complementary networks and both use Airbus jets.
In comparison, JetBlue and Spirit have a high degree of concentration in South Florida, which is expected to draw scrutiny from regulators.
Analysts at UBS said while the merits of a Frontier-Spirit combination were more straightforward, JetBlue's bid was a ""head-scratcher.""
The prospect of a tie-up between ultra-low cost and hybrid business models is reminiscent of Wizz Air Holdings Plc's unsuccessful overtures toward Britain's Easyjet Plc last year, which the latter rejected.

Wizz is also part of Franke's investment stable, though his support for a move that seemingly breaks his own investment rule was unclear. Analysts at the time questioned the mixing of airline types, in what proved to be a precursor of the present debate over JetBlue's strategy.
""It's kind of half-baked, honestly,"" said analyst Mann, referring to JetBlue's bid.

LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity trader Trafigura and other firms are moving to take large amounts of zinc out of London Metal Exchange approved warehouses in Asia, sources familiar with the matter said, fuelling concern about more problems at the exchange after chaotic nickel trading last month.
A Trafigura spokesperson in response to request for comment said ""we don't usually comment on commercial matters"".
The LME, the world's biggest market for industrial metals, suspended nickel trading on March 8 and cancelled billions of dollars in trades after prices spiked by more than 50% in a matter of hours to a record above $100,000 a tonne.
Stocks of zinc, used to galvanise steel, in LME warehouses have fallen 40% since December to 127,675 tonnes.
This week, the proportion of zinc due to be leaving LME warehouses shot up to 65% from 26%, LME data showed. 
Title: LME Zinc Prices Soar, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanboejpa/LME%20Zinc%20Prices%20Soar%20as%20Inventories%20Tumble.png 
An LME spokesperson said: ""We note the current tightness in the zinc market and are monitoring all metals closely to ensure market activity remains orderly.""
Rapid falls of metals in LME warehouses that underpin the exchange's physically-deliverable futures contracts can result in price volatility.
""Some market participants fear that the zinc market could experience similar turmoil as the nickel market has,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Daniel Briesemann said.
Traders said low liquidity on the 145-year-old exchange could also contribute to erratic price movements in zinc, which should be limited by the 15% daily price limits introduced by the LME after the nickel fiasco. 
Trafigura is bringing the metal from Asia to Europe to replace lost production at Belgium's Nyrstar, in which it has a majority stake, zinc market sources said. 
Zinc is leaving the LME system because of significant shortages created by producers cutting output due to record power prices. Production of zinc is energy intensive. 
The problem is especially acute in Europe. Of the 500 tonnes of zinc stored in LME warehouse in Europe, only 25 tonnes is available to the market.
Premiums for physical metal in Europe have soared due to zinc smelter cutbacks, which also affected commodity trader and miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
""It's possible that some of that metal is being pulled out by people looking to take advantage of the premium at the moment or by parties that have commitments and need metal,"" said Duncan Hobbs, research manager at Concord Resources.
The premium for special high-grade zinc at the Belgian port of Antwerp has spiked to a record $460 per tonne from $170 last October before the winter heating crisis kicked in, according to Fastmarkets.
Benchmark zinc hit a record high of $4,896 a tonne last month on escalating worries about supplies. 

Zinc stocks in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses have climbed this year, but logistics issues mean it is not easy to rebalance the market. 
""We've also had these very high freight rates, especially container freight rates, which have impeded the flow of metal from one region to another,"" Hobbs added.

Last year July, California regulators filed a lawsuit, alleging Activision ""fostered a sexist culture.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) turned its back on a takeover approach from KKR on Thursday when it refused to grant the U.S. fund access to its books because it had not confirmed bid terms. 
KKR first approached TIM last November with a non-binding offer valuing the company at 10.8 billion euros ($11.8 billion) but TIM only agreed to open talks last month.
In a statement after a board meeting, TIM said that it cannot grant KKR access to its data room as the fund did not validate the terms of its initial 0.505 euro per share approach, confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters.
""Should KKR submit a deliverable, complete and attractive offer ... TIM Board of Directors would be open to reconsidering its decision in the interest of all shareholders,"" TIM said.
KKR declined to comment.
Leading TIM shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) had said the KKR approach was too low, even though it is well above the current price of 0.31 euros. 
TIM's move comes as new boss Pietro Labriola is pressing ahead with a strategy to revamp the company centred around a split of its wholesale network operations from its services business.
STANDALONE STRATEGY
Details of the Labriola's plan, aimed at unlocking what the debt-laden group calls its untapped value, would be fleshed out by the summer. 
As part of this, TIM has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Italian state lender CDP to start formal talks on potentially combining the phone group's network with that of smaller broadband rival Open Fiber. 
Such a deal, advocated by the government, could entail a role for infrastructure and private equity funds, including KKR, sources have previously said.
""KKR ultimately confirmed its interest in exploring any other transactions in the interest of the company, its shareholders and Italy,"" TIM said in its statement.
KKR is already an investor in TIM's last-mile fixed-line network, having invested 1.8 billion euros to secure a 37.5% stake in a venture called FiberCop.
CDP, which holds a 10% stake in TIM, holds a 60% stake in Open Fiber and aims to secure full control of any combined network entity, sources have said.
Separately, TIM is assessing an approach by European private equity fund CVC which submitted a non binding bid for a minority stake in an enterprise services business that could be spun out of the group. 

Other private equity funds, including Apollo and Apax Partners, are circling TIM with the view to buy into its services business, sources have said.

Tata Neu, which has been in the works for about two years, is a single platform for the group's brands, including Westside fashion, Air Asia tickets, Croma electronics, the Taj group of hotels, BigBasket online grocery and 1mg online pharmacy.
""Our aim is to make the lives of Indian consumers simpler and easier,"" Tata's Chairman N Chandrasekaran said on LinkedIn, adding that its joint venture airline Vistara and recently acquired Air India, as well as watch brand Titan will be available on the app soon.
The 154-year-old group, which raked in $103 billion in revenue in 2020-21, is a leading player in steelmaking, IT outsourcing and utilities but arguably best known internationally as the owner of British luxury car brand Jaguar Land Rover. It also makes cars at home under its own brand. 
Tata also has an expansive offline retail portfolio, including a joint venture with  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). Its fashion and watch stores are ubiquitous on Indian high streets and it operates stores for  Inditex  (MC:ITX) fashion brand Zara.

Despite launching the Tata CliQ online marketplace in 2016, the group has been a minnow in an e-commerce market widely projected to be worth $200 billion by 2026. With Tata Neu the group is determined to change that, sources told Reuters last year.
Tata Neu will offer a membership program and a cross-brand loyalty scheme where customers can earn and redeem rewards while making purchases on the app.

642,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 01:16PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble firmed sharply in Moscow trade on Thursday to levels last seen before Russia sent tens of thousands of soldiers to Ukraine, while stocks indexes jumped higher, shrugging off a new round of sweeping western sanctions.
The rouble ended the day 5% higher at 75.75 against the dollar after briefly touching 74.2625, its strongest level since Feb. 11.
Moves in the rouble were jittery and trading volumes on the Moscow Exchange were small compared with levels seen before Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The rouble has recently been steered by mandatory conversion of dollar and euro revenues by export-focused companies, while demand for forex has been limited by capital controls that the central bank imposed as the rouble crashed to record lows in March.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that his ministry together with the central bank were working on measures to make the rouble exchange rate more predictable and less volatile.
Against the euro, the rouble firmed more than 6% to 81.45 after touching its strongest level since late October of 80.69.
On the interbank market the rouble was weaker. Banks offered to buy dollars at 76.75 and sell them at 81.75. The euro/rouble rates stood at 83.50 and 88.95, respectively.
The Russian currency has so far shrugged off fears that Russia was edging closer to a potential default on its international debt as it paid dollar bondholders in roubles and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves were blocked by sanctions.
On the stock market, the rouble-based MOEX Russian index climbed 0.9% higher to 2,635.4 after falling the day before when shares took a hit from new sanctions. 
The United States on Wednesday announced a new round of penalties targeting Russian financial institutions, as well as Kremlin officials and their family members.
The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 5.6% to 1,092.4 points, its highest since Feb. 23.
""Non-residents are still not taking part in trading, while a ban on short selling remains in place. We expect a mixed dynamics of the indexes in the near future... Volatility will stay,"" Sberbank Asset Management said in a note.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department stepped up its crackdown against Russian airlines on Thursday, slapping Aeroflot , Azur Air, and UTair with enforcement actions for violating American export controls issued after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The enforcement action denies the three Russian cariers export privileges and targets the entire airlines, not just specific planes. The U.S. government believes the actions will over time make the carriers largely unable to continue flights.
Previously, the United States had identified more than 170 Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes that Russian airlines were operating in violation of U.S. sanctions, including about 40 Aeroflot Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes, 21 Azur Boeing planes and 17 UTair Boeing aircraft.
The export controls bar companies around the world from providing any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services to the identified airplanes.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said the message was clear: ""Defy our export controls at your own peril.""
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said the government believes ""Aeroflot, Azur Air and UTair and their fleet of aircraft will over time largely be unable to continue flying either internationally or domestically as they are now cut off from the international support and the U.S. parts and related services they need to maintain and support their fleets.""
The airlines did not immediately respond to request for comments.
""Our export controls are working,"" Graves said, adding U.S. exports to Russia of items subject to new licensing requirements have decreased by 99% by value.
The orders prohibit service for maintenance contracts and the use of any U.S. parts to service identified planes but the Commerce Department could approve safety-critical parts on a case-by-case basis.
The Commerce Department said that after it placed the planes on restrictions in March, Aeroflot continued to fly them to Beijing, Delhi, Antalya and Istanbul, Dubai, and on some domestic Russian flights.
Azur Air continued to fly to Turkey, Dubai and Vietnam as well as some domestic flights in Russia, while UTair flew to Tajikistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan as well as some Russia domestc flights, the Commerce Department said.
Any U.S.-origin aircraft or foreign aircraft that includes more than 25% controlled U.S.-origin content is subject to a license requirement if it is Russian-owned or operated and exported to Russia.

The United States, European Union and other countries have barred Russian planes from U.S. airspace.
Russia’s biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group, said on March 18 it suspended all flights using Boeing aircraft due to Western sanctions. Volga-Dnepr said it stopped operations of two of its subsidiaries - AirBridgeCargo and Atran. S7, Russia’s biggest private airline and second largest overall, also said on March 4 it was ceasing all international flights.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - After two messy, drama-filled weeks struggling to fill the top job at state-run oil company Petrobras Brazil's government turned this week to low-profile technocrat José Mauro Coelho, and investors welcomed the move.
Coelho's record indicates he is not keen on sacrificing Petrobras profits to keep fuel prices low for Brazilian drivers, or to accomplish other policy aims. He was picked on Wednesday, and Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, shot up 3% on Thursday morning.
Last week, energy consultant Adriano Pires backed out of the government's nomination to take the helm at Petrobras, shortly after soccer magnate Rodolfo Landim declined a nomination as chairman. Coelho, whose appointment as CEO needs to be confirmed at a shareholders' meeting next week, is a relative unknown compared to those two. 
But Coelho's stance on fuel prices should allay concerns for investors as President Jair Bolsonaro is under pressure to rein in pump prices ahead of a heated October election contest.
Those views line up broadly with high-profile oil and gas consultant Pires, who withdrew his name from consideration after charges arose of conflicts of interest with longtime clients. 
Late last month, Bolsonaro ousted current Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna amid tensions over rising fuel prices. The government approached Landim and Decio Oddone, CEO of oil independent Enauta Participacoes SA, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, though both declined.
Coelho, a long-time researcher at Brazil's state energy think tank, now serves as chairman of Pre-Salt Petroleum (PPSA), a government agency that receives and sells oil handed over by offshore producers as a condition of their operating concessions. For a year and a half ending in 2021, he also served as the secretary of oil, gas and biofuels at Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry.
Coelho and PPSA did not immediately respond to requests for an interview. In an October interview on state television, he defended the current, market-friendly policy of Petrobras pricing its fuel in line with global oil markets, saying this was necessary to avoid fuel shortages. 
""We have to have domestic market prices related to import prices,"" Coelho said at the time. 
In another interview Coelho granted upon receiving an award in mid-2021, he made the case for Petrobras to keep a narrow focus on deepwater oil production, by far the firm's most profitable division.

Analysts and investors were heartened to see the government settle on a no-thrills technocrat. Still, they warned that the risk of political interference remains significant, particularly if crude prices remain high and Brazilian voters feel pain at the pump. 
""Although we anticipate a positive market reaction tomorrow,"" analysts at Itau BBA wrote to clients in a late Wednesday memo, ""we note that the company could continue to face recurring challenges in ensuring the convergence of prices toward international parity.""

Investing.com -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock traded 1% higher Thursday after the company said it is raising pay for drivers, an effort aimed at retaining and attracting more staff to operate its giant trucks.
In-house truck drivers will now be able to earn up to $110,000 in their first year at the company, the company said in a release. At the high end, that’s 26% higher than the previous average pay for newly hired drivers, Bloomberg said.
Drivers who have been with Walmart longer can earn even more, based on factors like tenure and location, it said.
The retailer also touted a private fleet development program to train and help staff become drivers. Employees in Dover, Delaware, and Dallas have earned commercial driver’s licenses over the course of the 12-week program, Walmart said.
Walmart’s latest exercise reflects the anxiety of retailers as they struggle to stock up their stores and deliver supplies to customers while facing a massive shortage of drivers and other staff.
The company, which employs about 12,000 truck drivers, had to hire 7,000 over the last two years, including a record 4,500 in 2021, the spokeswoman said. The U.S. is short by 80,000 drivers, according to the American Trucking Associations.",,,,,

The $43 billion merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia is expected to close as soon as Friday. The newly formed company will be led by Discovery CEO David Zaslav.
Discovery’s chief financial officer, Gunnar Wiedenfels, will oversee finance at the new company. Jean-Briac Perrette, Discovery’s chief executive of streaming and international, will be the new president of Warner Bros Discovery Global Streaming and Interactive Entertainment, with responsibility for HBO Max and Discovery+. Bruce Campbell, Discovery’s chief development officer, will assume the role of chief revenue and strategy officer. 
Campbell and Perrette played pivotal roles in launching Hulu, the streaming service started in a joint venture of NBC and the former News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). These senior Discovery executives helped execute its $18 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks in 2018, which added Food Network and HGTV to Discovery’s cable portfolio. 
The future chief executive of Warner Bros Discovery retained three key WarnerMedia creative executives, Casey Bloys, who continues as chief content officer of HBO/HBO Max, Toby Emmerich, chairman of Warner Bros Picture Group, and Channing Dungey, chairman of Warner Bros Television Group. They are expected to report directly to Zaslav, reflecting the executive’s preference for a flat management structure.

""Today's announcement combines a strong team of professional managers in a simpler organizational structure, with fewer layers,"" Zaslav said in a statement.
Nine high-level WarnerMedia senior executives, including Chief Executive Jason Kilar and Studios and Network chief Ann Sarnoff, announced their exits ahead of the formation of the combined company.

(Reuters) - The top lawyer at the agency that enforces U.S. labor laws said on Thursday she will ask the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to prohibit businesses from requiring workers to attend meetings discouraging unionizing, which would eliminate a major tool employers use to counter union campaigns. 
Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel of the NLRB, said in a memo that so-called captive audience meetings discourage employees from exercising their right to refrain from listening to anti-union messages, making them illegal under federal labor law.
“This license to coerce is an anomaly in labor law, inconsistent with the (law's) protection of employees’ free choice,"" wrote Abruzzo, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.
Abruzzo said that in a future case she will ask the five-member NLRB to overturn its own precedent going back to the 1940s that says captive audience meetings are legal. The general counsel acts as a prosecutor, filing complaints against businesses that are then heard by the board. 
The NLRB in past cases has said the meetings are a valid exercise of employers' free-speech rights, but Abruzzo said those decisions failed to balance those rights with the ability of workers to freely choose whether to join unions.
The memo comes amid a spate of high-profile union campaigns involving companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), both of which have reportedly held https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/union-says-amazon-continues-interfere-with-election-alabama-warehouse-2022-02-22 captive audience meetings. Some studies have estimated that more than 90% of employers facing union elections hold mandatory anti-union meetings. 
Amazon and Starbucks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday that employers use captive audience meetings to spread disinformation and intimidate workers.
""The question of whether workers want a union should be the workers' choice – not the employers' – free of intimidation and interference,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Conagra Brands Inc cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as multiple price hikes and resilient demand failed to provide a bulwark against inflationary pressures and costs stemming from supply chain snarls.
Global food companies, stretched since the pandemic outbreak by elevated freight and labor expenses, are now staring at higher costs of corn, wheat, proteins, and edible oils as the Russia-Ukraine conflict fuels a rally in commodities.
The maker of Duncan Hines cake mixes expects gross inflation of about 16% for the year, higher than its previous view of about 14%. 
""We've experienced a lot of inflation, but we've also been aggressive in taking the justified actions to offset it,"" Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said in a call with analysts.
The Slim Jim maker now expects adjusted profit to be about $2.35 per share, compared with the about $2.50 it projected earlier.
""Though the guidance reduction itself wasn't exactly surprising, the degree was a bit more than perhaps anticipated,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Like rivals Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Conagra has increased prices in recent months with little to no push back from consumers and expects benefits from its latest hikes to show in the first quarter of its fiscal 2023 year, which begins this June. The hikes will target Conagra's frozen foods and snacks.
Connolly said Conagra would continue to see a lag between the timing of inflation and the benefits from higher prices even as demand remains strong.
""When the consumer has to get more out of their budget, they evaluate all alternatives,"" Connolly said. ""They see our products are better value."" 

He added that Conagra has not seen consumers swapping out their branded products for cheaper store brands. However, the company's spreads business, which includes Fleischmann's margarines and Smart Balance and Earth Balance products, is sensitive to private label pressures, he said. 
Still, the Act II microwave popcorn owner topped third-quarter revenue estimates and raised its annual core sales forecast, riding on the back of higher prices and sustained demand. Its shares were marginally up in a choppy broader market.

654,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 12:07PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Suddenly confronted with the possibility of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning this month's French presidential elections against incumbent Emmanuel Macron, traders are scrambling to hedge portfolios against the risk of market turmoil. 
A Le Pen victory, while still unlikely, is now within the margins of error before the first voting round on Sunday, opinion polls show. While she no longer advocates ditching the euro, markets are uneasy about her agenda of protectionism, tax cuts and nationalisation.
Berenberg analysts, who now assign a 30% chance to a Le Pen win versus 10% previously, said Le Pen would ""throw sand in the gears of the EU. While she would not be able to roll back European integration, further progress would likely stall."" 
Exit polls from the first polling round will emerge between 1800-2000 GMT. There will be a televised debate on April 20 and a second round on April 24.
This is how various assets could react and how traders are hedging against downsides. 
EURO PAINS
A Le Pen win in the first round could send the euro, currently around $1.09, down to $1.05, but if she won the presidency and also the June legislative elections, the euro could fall below parity to the dollar, Nomura analysts warned. 
They said demand for FX hedges was adding to pressure.
Derivative markets show that risk reversals -- or the ratio of puts to calls -- over the one-week period covering the first election round have flipped firmly in favour of puts or option contracts expecting more euro weakness.
Refinitiv data shows investors have bought put options on euro/dollar between $1.07-$1.08 levels in recent days and one trader said it is now 10% costlier than last week to buy a euro put against the dollar at $1.08.
Nomura recommends buying put spreads expiring in a month's time as that covers both polling dates.
Euro implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings, has also pushed higher than broader FX gauges. One-week euro/dollar implied volatility is at a three-week high.
""The rise in the French election risk premium could weigh on the euro until the second round on 24 April,"" said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier in Geneva. 
EATING YOUR OATs
In bond markets, the spread between the yield of 10-year French and German government bonds -- essentially the risk premium on French debt -- has risen to 54 basis points, levels unseen since the 2020 market crash.
Spreads are well below levels seen at the height of the ""Frexit"" worries of 2017, but banks say clients have become more averse to French risk. 
Mizuho rates strategist Peter McCallum noted spillover shorting activity rippling over from French bond futures into Italy. Many investors hedge bond exposure in the more liquid futures market.
Italian bonds actually underperformed French bonds during this week's selloff, widening the spread between the two markets. 
Open interest has risen while prices on both French and Italian bond futures have fallen. That is indicative of a build-up of short positions, said UBS strategist Rohan Khanna. 
""I think there is appreciation of the fact that a Le Pen victory is an EU-level question,"" Khanna said. 
Italian bonds ""become your principal instrument to short given all the fragilities in the Italian system."" 
NATIONALISATION TARGETS FOR SALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) estimates a Le Pen win carries a maximum drawdown risk of 8% on French stocks. But they saw small- and mid-cap firms at greater risk than the internationally exposed CAC 40 Paris benchmark. 
Broader European banks and Italian stocks, highly sensitive to EU integration, would also face extra downside, they added.

However, traders reported little equity hedging activity. The choice, instead, appears to be to sell bank stocks and holders of motorway concessions like Eiffage and Vinci, which may be targeted for nationalisation by Le Pen. 
A chill has fallen over French dealmaking activity, according to one trader, who said, ""none of my contacts has mentioned anything for weeks.""

The event is expected to host 15,000 people and will be held at the new facility from 4 pm till midnight. It will reportedly feature interactive tours, food, and live entertainment. Greg Abbott and Ted Cruz are expected to speak at the event.
According to FOX Business, Tesla has even secured a permit for a fireworks display, conditional on the weather.
Although this party is being held as a launch party, the $1.1 billion factory has begun producing Tesla Model Ys for delivery. The plant is designed to make about 500,000 cars in its initial configuration. Tesla likely will expand the plant in the future and add battery-making capacity on site.
It will take time to ramp up capacity at the new plant. Analysts estimated the plant might produce 100,000 vehicles in 2022. Full production rates should be reached in about a year. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter calculated that Tesla's most productive plant in Shanghai can produce roughly 3,400 vehicles a day. That's about 1.2 million vehicles a year. However, car plants typically can't run full out all year. For example, the Giga Shanghai factory was shut down in late March due to covid restrictions and has yet to reopen.
Tesla bull Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research called the event a ""very strong catalyst"" for the stock. He even said a production schedule update for the Cyber Truck and Tesla Semi is ""very likely."" Chowdhry expects the factory to eventually produce the shell-based vehicular design for the Cyber Truck, which he thinks can be made in just 5 to 6 hours versus 25 to 30 hours per vehicle for traditional automakers.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp set up a special committee on Thursday to resume a strategic review that could see the Japanese industrial conglomerate go private after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan last month.
The 146-year-old company has been under growing pressure from major shareholders to consider a private equity buyout that would allow them a quick exit with potentially solid returns.
The new committee, comprised of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s six external directors, will engage with potential investors and sponsors and also ""identify the privatisation offer that is best for our diverse stakeholders,"" Toshiba said in a statement.
Relevant information about the review will be provided prior to the annual general meeting in June, according to the statement.
The company also said it would temporarily suspend divestitures that were part of the now rejected plan, including sales of its elevator and lighting businesses, as well as its discussions with Toshiba Tec Corp about the fate of the listed subsidiary.
During a five-month review leading to the restructuring plan last year, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers, angering some hedge fund investors hoping for a private equity buyout.

Its top shareholder, Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, said last week that it had agreed to sell its 9.9% stake to Bain Capital if the U.S. private equity firm launched a tender offer.
But sources close to the company have told Reuters that taking Toshiba private would not be an easy task, as the company owns national security technologies such as nuclear power and semiconductors.

Investing.com – Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) stock traded 2% higher Thursday after the company raised its annual forecast for organic net sales despite cost pressures.
The company now expects core net sales for the year to grow by more than 4% compared to its previous forecast of over 3%.
Growing economies and strained supply chains have all combined to push transportation costs higher. Prices of ingredients such as corn, wheat, proteins, and edible oils have touched record highs. Companies have hiked prices to pass on cost pressures and met with mixed success.
Because of the lag in the implementation of the price hikes, the company does not expect to fully offset the cost pressures in the current financial year. With inflationary expectations now pegged higher, it expects adjusted operating margins to take a hit of 1 percentage point to be around 14.5%.
Adjusted profit per share should come in at around $2.35, lower than the previous forecast of $2.5, according to the company’s new forecast.
Challenges notwithstanding, the company grew its net revenue by over 5% to $2.91 billion in the third quarter ended February 27. Margins eroded.
Adjusted profit per share fell 1.7% to 58 cents but was higher than estimates."
660,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 11:18AM ET</span>",,,"(Bloomberg) -- Merger investors expect healthy deal flow to extend into the second quarter, especially in software, as buyers remain hungry and valuations are attractive.
It’s already playing out. CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) Inc., which was named among potential takeover targets in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 event-driven trading desks, fund managers and analysts, was acquired Thursday morning. Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) Inc. also was popular software name on the list. 
Kohl’s Corp. was named by survey participants as the most likely company to complete a deal over the next three months. The retailer is already working with potential bidders amid a push by activist investors to explore strategic options.
The mergers and acquisition market in the U.S. is off to a decent start this year against the uncertain backdrop of rising rates, soaring inflation and the war in Ukraine. The total value of pending and completed deals announced in the first three months of 2022 reached $414 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That’s the best first quarter performance in the past five years, though the pace will have to quicken considerably for the rest of the year to approach 2021’s record run. 
“There are many opportunistic dealmakers and activists pushing companies to explore a sale or bidding for the companies themselves,” said Tyler Silver, a partner at New York-based investment firm Apex Capital. “Acquisitive big tech and private equity firms with loads of cash will help. Some PEs just have an unlimited appetite for deals.”
Software Sweet Spot 
Small to mid-sized software companies are in the sweet spot for consolidation, according to the survey respondents. Merger investors are optimistic that cash-rich strategic and financial buyers will want to take advantage of cheaper valuations caused by the recent tech selloff. The S&P 500 Software Industry index is down more than 10% this year compared with a 5% decline in the S&P 500 Index and a 9% drop in the Nasdaq 100 Index.
Seven out of 20 survey respondents saw a takeover of Zendesk as likely after the company scrapped its acquisition of Momentive Global Inc. and a group of private equity firms was said to line up loan for a refreshed buyout offer. The issue will be price since Zendesk already rejected a bid between $127 and $132 because it was too low. Zendesk closed at $122.58 on Wednesday, down from its February 2021 record high of $158. In addition, two people surveyed said they expect Momentive to also return to the M&A spotlight.
CDK Global was the third most mentioned company in the poll, which was conducted from March 28 to April 1. On Thursday, Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU) announced a $6.4 billion all-cash deal to acquire the auto dealer software provider. Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) Inc., which in September scrapped its planned sale to  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc., also appeared on the list.
Representatives for Kohl’s, Zendesk, CDX Global and Momentive did not respond to requests for comment.
In addition, Wall street analysts flagged a list of software names to watch after PE firm Thoma Bravo in March announced plans to buy cloud-based software maker  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) Inc. for $10.7 billion. Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein touted battered stocks like Datto Holding Corp. and Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) Corp., while Bloomberg intelligence’s Anurag Rana pointed to C3.ai Inc. and  Elastic  (NYSE:ESTC) NV among the potential targets with cratering valuations.
“The tech, and software in particular, space should continue to be a favorite given the need for increased productivity and cost cutting in the context of supply chain issues, among other things,” said Frederic Boucher, a risk-arbitrage analyst at Susquehanna International Group. He added that private equity firms still have plenty of dry powder at their disposal.
To be sure, whether financial buyers pick up the dealmaking pace also depends on the debt markets. Their choppy performance this year has stirred fears about potentially cooling private equity buyouts.
Meanwhile, big tech players with strong balance sheets remain another source of transactions. However, they might grow cautious with any deals that could get caught in the crosshairs of antitrust regulators, survey respondents said. 
M&A desks in U.S. are closely watching the evolving regulatory environment, which has been a constant concern. At the moment, their eyes are on UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH).’s pending acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG) Inc. The pair just extended their agreement as they wait to litigate the Department of Justice’s suit to block their merger plan.

To Aaron Glick, a merger-arb specialist at Cowen & Co., this is an important demonstration of how willing some buyers are to defend their acquisitions in court.
“Companies that entered into deals this year went in eyes-wide-open knowing that the odds of litigation were higher than they had been in prior administrations,” said “Still, each situation is unique.”

The outlay is part of a wider 8.7 billion euro long term plan that Italy announced earlier this year to support its carmaking industry. This allocates 700 million euros in 2022 and 1 billion euros per year from 2023 until 2030.
The wait for incentives, which Rome had announced earlier this year, weighed on car sales in the first months of 2022, with analysts and lobby groups saying buyers were postponing purchases while waiting for the government to implement them.
New car registrations in Italy fell around 23% in February and 30% in March from the year earlier periods.
Rome will subsidise up to 5,000 euros of the purchase price of new electric vehicles costing up to 35,000 euros excluding VAT. 
That includes a 2,000 euro contribution linked to the scrappage of a polluting combustion-engine car, the decree showed.
The purchase of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles costing up to 45,000 euros will be subsidised by up to 4,000 euros, while the plan also includes an incentive of 2,000 euros for state-of-the art combustion-engine (Euro6) cars costing up to 35,000 euros when older vehicles are scrapped.

Funds are also available for incentives to buy new motorcycles and for small- and medium-sized business to buy fully electric vans, according to the decree.

(Reuters) -Citigroup has started to allow holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies to cancel them, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Citi's move follows steps taken by banks such as BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase in the last two weeks. 
After cancelling a depositary receipt, which are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange, clients receive the underlying share in the Russian company.
This is the first step investors must take to liquidate their frozen holdings. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) halted trading in the depositary receipts of Russian companies roughly a month ago after prices plunged due to a slew of Western sanctions slapped on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Still, due to sanctions imposed by Russia, foreign investors are not allowed to sell their shares.

Investing.com – Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) stock traded 3.7% lower Thursday on fears of write-offs owing to the company’s exposure to Russia.
Worries over rising raw material costs, a factor the company countered with price hikes in the first quarter, are also adding to the losses.
The maker of the iconic denim jeans said in a filing it would review assets specific to Russian commercial business for impairment in the second quarter, according to Reuters.
The company last month suspended operations in Russia, including new investments, following the country's invasion of Ukraine.
Levi’s first-quarter sales and profit topped estimates, driven by strong demand for its jeans, tops and jackets, and price hikes.
Cost pressures notwithstanding, the company improved its gross margins. It attributed this to selling more to consumers directly, lower promotional expenses, lower share of discounted sales and price increases.
The company recorded double-digit sales in every market, led by Americas, Europe and Asia in that order.
""We're not seeing any real pushback on pricing at all at this point,"" Reuters quoted CEO Charles Bergh as telling analysts in the earnings call, adding that there was room for stronger pricing in the second half of the year.
First-quarter revenue rose about 22% to $1.59 billion. Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh said supply chain-related issues cut revenue opportunities by about $60 million, or 5%, primarily in the U.S.
Adjusted profit per share for the quarter ended February 27 was 12 cents higher at 46 cents.

MADRID (Reuters) - Banks and supervisors are concerned about implementing sanctions against Russian oligarchs as they vary in scope and in who they target across different jurisdictions, Bank of Spain Director General for Supervision Mercedes Olano said on Thursday.
""For internationally active banks it's a puzzle because sanctions are not the same in Europe as in the U.S. or in Britain or Japan,"" she said, adding that talks were being held to clarify how financial institutions should act. 
""Which sanctions do the banks have to comply with, the European ones, the American ones, all together, separately?"" Olano asked herself during a press briefing.
Targets of wide-ranging Western sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have already included banks, oligarchs and investment. On Thursday, Ukraine renewed a call for financial sanctions crippling enough to force Moscow to end what it refers to as its ""special operation"" in the country. 
Olano said lenders, banks and market supervisors were trying to determine which sanctions should be applied, and how. 
""In broad terms, we all know what to do, but then when you have to actually include it into your (daily) operations, to set up systems (...) so that you are warned if you are not complying with a sanction, that's complex,"" Olano said.
It was not a question of whether sanctions were being implemented in time but rather a question of ""how difficult it was to make sanctions compatible,"" she added.
Last week, the European Central Bank said euro zone banks' direct exposure to Russia was relatively minor but sanctions could still reverberate through the financial system through volatility in energy and commodity prices.

Spanish banks in general rank among those less exposed to Russian credit, with Spain's central bank estimating their credit risk at just above 700 million euros.
Olano said that meant they should be less affected by the implementation of sanctions.

By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 84 points, or 0.2% at 34,413 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1%, however, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. That still represents only a modest bounce after two days of heavy losses as the market adjusted to signals from the Fed that interest rates will have to rise faster than previously expected in order to bring inflation down. 
One of the main reasons for that is the tightness of the labor market, which was underlined again in data released earlier by the Labor Department. Initial jobless claims fell to 166,000, while previous weeks' data were also revised down to reflect changes to the process of seasonal adjustment by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Layoffs are now running at their lowest in over 50 years, while vacancies are close to record highs and the unemployment rate is down to a paltry 3.6%.
Elsewhere, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who has been the most outspoken and earliest advocate for tightening monetary policy at the Fed, said the central bank is still well ""behind the curve"" in fighting inflation, and indicated that the fed funds rate may need to rise to around 3.5% or more to bring inflation down. That's the latest in a series of warning from Fed officials in the latest week that have prepared the market for bigger rate hikes and a faster balance sheet reduction than its top leadership had wanted last year. 
HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock was the biggest mover in early dealings, soaring 16% after Warren Buffett put a $4.2 billion bet on the maker of laptops and other electronics hardware. The deal is the third big one in quick succession for Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb), and suggests that the world's most famous 'value investor' is no longer as concerned about U.S. stocks being overvalued.
Elsewhere, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) stock fell 4.3% despite the maker of denim wear reporting better-than-expected quarterly numbers and upholding its previous guidance for sales growth of around 12% this year. Citigroup analysts cut their target price on the stock to $27 in a note released to clients earlier, but the stock still trades nearly 33% below that. 
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs fell 3.6% after the Chinese e-commerce giant said its founder and CEO Richard Liu has stepped down with immediate effect. He's been succeeded by Lei Xu, a long-term executive at the company who has most recently served as its president.
The social media space remained buzzy, even two days after Elon Musk's acquisition of a 9.2% stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Reports suggested that Facebook owner Meta Platforms is working on a Plan B for digital assets after the failure of its Diem stablecoin project. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock eked out a gain of 0.3%, but it remains the most pressured of the tech megacaps, against a backdrop of tightening regulation and a likely slowdown in ad spending as inflation bites into consumer spending power. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock, a more established play on the prospects for monetizing the so-called Metaverse, fell 1.1% despite  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts rating it as a buy after its recent selloff. The stock has lost two-thirds of its value since its November peak."

The move will provide Pfizer with access to experimental therapies developed to combat the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus that infects the respiratory tract and leads to symptoms similar to a normal cold.
ReViral is developing four RSV therapies, two of which are currently in mid-stage studies, including its flagship therapy candidate sisunatovir.
This is the second buyout deal for Pfizer in less than six months after the U.S. biopharmaceutical giant acquired Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion in December.
The RSV prevention market is expected to grow by 14x to $6.3 billion in the period between 2020 and 2030, according to GlobalData, urging global drugmakers to capitalize on the opportunities in this market.
BMO analyst Evan Seigerman said that he would have liked to see something more impactful for Pfizer's nearer-term P&L. Still, he added that the ReViral acquisition doesn't prevent Pfizer from doing a bigger M&A.
With a potential of $1.5B in peak sales from these treatment assets (64M infections annually, 160k deaths globally), the company must continue with BD to expand the pipeline. We're interested in assets such as Trikafta/CF, Tepezza/Krystexxa, Vyvgart, assets in targeted oncology (adagrasib), neuroscience (Nurtec's US rights), and dermatology (e.g., Opzelura), the analyst said in a client note.
Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas commented:
We see this acquisition of a -1) Ph1/2 POC; 2) private company; 3) with pipeline in an area of unmet need, as a potential return to M&A, especially in an environment where companies seem to face hurdles going public.
Pfizer stock closed at $52.87 yesterday.

The analyst expects PYPL to deliver on Q1 expectations with the Street calling for revenue growth of 6.2% and EPS of $0.88. However, he sees risk to the FY22 guidance.
""Management also said on the 4Q21 call that to achieve the upper part of the ˜15-17% revenue growth guidance range for '22, the macro backdrop would need to improve. But that was before inflation worsened and the Russia/Ukraine war broke out. As a result, we think the risk of PYPL falling short of its '22 guidance has increased, as macro headwinds may simply not enable the company to achieve its planned 2H trajectory of top-line acceleration (ie, targeting 20%+ revenue growth in 4Q), as discretionary e-commerce spending among the lower-income cohort could face incremental pressure,"" Kupferberg said in a client note.
For these reasons, and especially due to limited visibility, Kupferberg said he remains Neutral-rated on PYPL shares.
When it comes to the recovery, Kupferberg says that the success of new initiatives will ultimately be a major determinant of PYPLs ability to achieve its stated target for a 20% revenue CAGR from 22-˜25.
As a reminder, PayPal introduced a set of new initiatives to fuel faster growth, including Pay in 4, crypto services, and new features for Venmo.

(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc said on Thursday it would buy privately-held ReViral Ltd in a deal worth as much as $525 million including milestone payments, to gain access to experimental drugs against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
The deal marks the U.S. drugmaker's second acquisition in less than six months to boost its drug portfolio, after a $6.7 billion takeover of Arena Pharmaceuticals in December. 
RSV, a common respiratory virus that causes cold-like symptoms, is a cause of pneumonia in toddlers and the elderly. 
London-based ReViral has four RSV therapies in its pipeline, with lead product candidate sisunatovir and another treatment currently in mid-stage studies. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s own RSV vaccine candidate is in late-stage studies now. 
""Currently, treatment options for RSV are extremely limited and focus primarily on supportive care,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, chief scientific officer of Bacterial Vaccines and Hospital at Pfizer.

Evan Seigerman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says the deal is encouraging for M&A activity in biopharma, but not so impactful for Pfizer in the near-term. ""The transaction does not materially impact Pfizer's ability to do a larger transaction or other smaller deals."" 
The acquisition could potentially signal a return to M&A for biopharma companies, especially in an environment where companies seem to face hurdles going public, said Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. consumer watchdog plans to ramp up enforcement actions against lenders that illegally charge credit card late-payment fees and may rewrite its rules that set thresholds for such fees, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The development marks an escalation of a broader crackdown by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on what it calls ""junk fees,"" a catch-all for overdraft, credit card late-payment fees, bounced check fees, and other charges. 
Banks and credit unions pulled in more than $15 billion in overdraft and related fees in 2019 and $12 billion in late credit card fees in 2020, according to CFPB estimates. 
The agency's director, Rohit Chopra, says lenders have become too reliant on such fees. He has also said the fees appear to be excessive, not transparent to consumers, and in many cases act as penalties rather than compensation for a legitimate service.
In January, the CFPB issued a request for public input on how banks and companies charge such fees and the impact they have on American families, the deadline for which is April 11. The agency has not yet said how it plans to proceed.
One of the sources said the agency would review the comments, but it would be taking a tougher line on enforcement with respect to such fees and expected to rewrite some rules.
Card issuers generally charge a late-payment fee when a customer misses their minimum payment deadline. The current rules contain a legal safe harbor which allows lenders to charge late fees provided they do not exceed a ""reasonable and proportional"" regulatory cap which is set annually by the CFPB.
The agency is considering rewriting the rules on how it calculates that threshold, according to the two sources. 
The CFPB is also exploring how it can bring more enforcement actions for potentially illegal fees under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which protects consumers from unfair practices by credit card issuers, the sources added.
""Every year, junk fees hit millions of Americans with expenses they do not expect and did not consider when choosing their financial institution,"" Brian Shearer, a CFPB senior adviser, told Reuters in a statement, without commenting on the agency's plans. 
INDUSTRY DEFENSE
The banking industry has launched a united defense against Chopra's ""junk fees"" scrutiny, saying most lenders are not overly reliant on fee revenue and that the CFPB is wrong to suggest lenders hide the fees or that the fees show banks are not offering competitive services. 
The Consumer Bankers Association (CBA) and the American Bankers Association, among other groups, are preparing comment letters highlighting the slew of existing rules requiring banks disclose such fees, according to two other industry executives.
Creating those rules required the government to perform extensive focus-group testing, an expensive process that the CFPB has not proven is worth repeating, they argue. They add that overdrafts and other lending products are critical services for most Americans. 
""America's leading banks have always listened to their customers and are taking proactive steps to help them avoid unintended fees while protecting their access to a much-needed emergency safety net,"" said Richard Hunt, the CBA's chief executive.
Several big banks have recently changed their policies on overdraft and nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees - penalties charged when a customer bounces a check or automated payment. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which declined to comment for this story, have said they would stop charging NSF fees and have changed their policies on charging overdraft fees.

The industry says those changes show banks are trying to compete on such fees. 
""Recent announcements on overdraft fees by some of the largest banks show that real change is possible, and we are going to keep pressing to increase competition and save Americans money,"" said the CFPB's Shearer.

The Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce giant initially targeted an IPO valuation of $50 billion and planned to pursue its listing in 2022. However, the company has reportedly delayed the IPO for 2023 as it wants to further increase its valuations by focusing on its two new units - online healthcare and travel bookings, as per the report.
Furthermore, Flipkart's IPO plans have also been affected by the current market uncertainty as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Last year, the e-commerce company purchased an Indian travel booking platform Cleartrip and introduced its Health+ app this week to provide medicines, but also healthcare-related products and services.
In December, analysts asked Walmart CFO Brett Biggs about Flipkart's timeline, to which he replied that the company was performing almost exactly like we thought, adding the initial public offering is still very much in the cards.
Biggs did not provide a clear timeline for the IPO, though the reports now say that the company is eyeing the early-to-mid period in 2023.
Brick-and-mortar retail companies in India have been raising concerns over the past years that Flipkart and Amazon have been evading federal regulations, encouraging Walmart to pursue IPO plans for Flipkart.
Furthermore, the Indian government is expected to introduce new e-commerce regulations that could further repel foreign companies.

Under the agreement, which requires a judge's approval, the payment will be made to settle claims brought on behalf of those who bought the company's shares between March 28, 2013 and Sept. 20, 2013.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the company was planning to settle the lawsuit to avoid trial in the United States.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court granted a request from the company's lawyers and shareholders to adjourn their planned trial to negotiate a preliminary settlement.
Shareholders accused the company of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.
Lawsuits accusing companies of misleading shareholders are common in the United States, but few go to trial.

While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, it never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones, which led to BlackBerry's decision to stop making phones in 2016.
The Canadian company now has shifted focus to cybersecurity and making embedded operating systems widely used in cars.

Total comparable sales came in at +17.2% to crush the estimate of +11.2%. U.S. comparable sales, excluding fuel and currencies, were reported at +12.7%, better than the estimate of +9.2%. For the five weeks to April 3, net sales rose 19% Y/Y to $21.5 billion.

""We anticipate the company will continue to invest in price and e-commerce to reinforce its value proposition, which we view as key to sustaining favorable comp and traffic trends and continued outperformance of peers.

The analyst notes that the overall reduction in earnings estimates is fairly modest and brings J.P. Morgan mostly in line with the consensus for FY2022. Chatterjee cut the street-high iPhone volume outlook for CY22 to 245 million from 250 million. This is mostly led by the reduction in estimates for iPhone SE3, from 30 million to 24 million.
Our estimates for iPhone 13 remain largely intact as we expect the combination of recent color variant launches, as well as a higher than typical inventory level in the channel against the backdrop of existing supply chain constraints to provide offsets to lower customer spending, Chatterjee said in a client note.
Chatterjee's actions come after the bank removed Apple from its Analyst Focus List amid a more cautious view on the consumer spending outlook, led by lowered growth forecasts for the smartphone market.
We remain above consensus expectations for FY23 and FY24, led by our forecasts for better than expected growth in Products as well as margin and earnings trajectory on the back of robust growth in Services. Our positive view on the shares, long term, leads us to maintain our Overweight rating, Chatterjee added.
The analyst notes a slowing services momentum against tough comparables.
Gross app store revenue, new downloads, as well as gaming revenue, worsened in relation to y/y growth trends in C1Q22, which while partly on account of tough comparables is also the first q/q sequential moderation in gross revenue since C4Q19. We expect the slower engagement on the App Store to limit Services revenue growth in the +15%-20% y/y range in FY22 and thus we lower our estimates on our expectations for more modest sequential growth in Service revenues through the fiscal year.
Still, J.P. Morgan remains bullish on Apple as the company is well-positioned to deliver resilient performance in product revenue growth, led by share gains of hardware products.",,,

Investing.com – ADRs of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) traded 2% lower in premarket Thursday after the company said its founder Richard Liu has stepped down as chief executive officer.
Xu Lei, who was recently promoted to president after more than a decade, takes the helm at China’s second largest online marketplace immediately.

JD.com had a market cap of over $90 billion at close Wednesday. The stock is down over 29% in the last year, still escaping the burn at most Chinese shares.
While most Chinese tech and online firms have been hit by the sweeping campaign to rein in Big Tech in the mainland, the company has benefited by complying with the new rules. It has added new or seen the return of brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) to its platform.

(Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta has removed hacking campaigns, influence networks and scam operations amid the war in Ukraine, according to a report released on Thursday by the social media company, which also said it was reviewing additional steps to address misinformation from Russian government pages.
""We're constantly reviewing our policies based on the evolving situation on the ground and we are actively now reviewing additional steps to address misinformation and hoaxes coming from Russian government pages,"" said Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, on a call with reporters.
Russia has battled big tech companies to control online information flows after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" It has banned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram, and throttled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by slowing its service. Twitter said this week it will not amplify or recommend Russian government accounts to users.
In its first quarterly adversarial threat report, Meta said government-linked actors from Russia and Belarus had engaged in cyber espionage and covert online influence operations, including an influence operation linked to the Belarusian KGB. 
It said there had been other continued attempts from networks it had previously disrupted, including further efforts by the threat actor Ghostwriter to hack the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukraine military members. 
Meta said in the report it had also removed a network of about 200 accounts operated from Russia that coordinated to falsely report people, mostly in Ukraine and Russia, for violations like hate speech or bullying. 
The mass reporting was primarily coordinated in a cooking-themed Facebook Group which had about 50 members when Meta took it down in March. 

Meta said it had also removed tens of thousands of accounts, pages and groups trying to use the war in Ukraine to scam users and make money by driving people to ad-filled websites or selling them merchandise. It said spammers around the world had used tactics such as streaming live-gaming videos or reposting popular content including other people's videos from Ukraine to pretend they were sharing live updates from the crisis. 
Meta detailed other takedowns including the removal of two cyberespionage operations from Iran, an influence campaign in Brazil that posed as environmental activists defending deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and a network in the Philippines that claimed credit for bringing down and defacing news websites.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The likely huge insurance claims related to the cancellation of aircraft leases in Russia is already leading to ""horrendous"" hikes in the cost of renewing policies, the chief executive of major lessor BOC Aviation Ltd said on Thursday.
Over 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion remained in Russia after a March 28 deadline to cancel the contracts in line with Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, leaving lessors facing heavy potential writedowns or a long insurance battle.
In a trading update on Thursday, BOC said the net book value of the 17 owned aircraft it was in the process of recovering from Russia - net of all cash collateral held in respect of the aircraft - was $589 million or 2.5% of its total assets.
All letters of credit held in respect of the aircraft had been successfully drawn, it added.
""Because there are going to be huge claims on these insurances this year for confiscation or theft if the aircraft aren't given back, this will then have a knock on effect on insurance costs,"" Robert Martin told an aviation conference.
""This is one of the unforeseen circumstances that is going to hit us later this year and I'm hearing some horrendous numbers for some of the near term renewals due at the end of March. We fortunately don't go until January next year.""
The world's top aircraft lessor AerCap said last week that it had submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets stuck in Russia, the largest exposure in the sector.
BOC's Martin said the consequences of the battle ahead may force the aviation business to completely rethink how it does insurance and that having too much concentrated on one single market is not healthy.
Martin said BOC had taken out ""some"" aircraft it manages from Russia. The Singapore-based lessor said on Thursday that one managed aircraft remains in Russia as well as the 17 it owns.

""We will continue to gradually take the other aircraft out. The only way is by negotiation, there is no magic wand, and I feel sorry for our Russian customers, they've been put in this situation not because of something they've done,"" Martin said.
""Whatever doesn't get resolved will end up in an insurance claim.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) chief Luca de Meo wants to press ahead with plans to create separate divisions for electric (EV) and combustion engine vehicles despite potentially costly uncertainty over its interests in Russia, three sources told Reuters.
Playing catch-up with rivals like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the French automaker first outlined its strategy shift in February, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying its turnaround plan was ahead of schedule. 
An internal assessment on progress will be made in three months, two of the sources said. The Renault group's top selling EVs are the Dacia Spring and the Renault Zoe - long a market leader but becoming an ageing model.
""Despite the Russian x-factor, Luca de Meo wants to move quickly on the creation of the two entities,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
Several working groups are actively working on the creation of two separate legal structures, codenamed ""Ampere"" for the electric and ""Horse"" for the thermal and hybrid assets, two of the three sources said.
Renault declined to comment. 
The war in Ukraine has resulted in Western powers imposing extensive sanctions against Russia, leaving Renault, majority owner of Russia's biggest carmaker Avtovaz, faced with what de Meo has called a ""very complex situation.""
POTENTIAL COSTS 
Renault in late March said it would cut its forecast for operating profit and cash flow and is considering a 2.3 billion euro ($2.4 billion) non-cash writedown to reflect the potential costs of suspending operations in Russia. 
According to the three sources, Renault plans to make progress on the split between electric and conventional engines within the next three months. An internal assessment of the progress made is due in July, two of the sources said. 
Talks with unions should start by the summer, the third source said. 
The growing preference among investment managers for companies focused on low-carbon technology has helped Tesla become the world's highest-valued automaker, and led some investors and analysts to urge other carmakers to consider separating their combustion and electric businesses.
One of the sources said Renault is still pursuing a previously announced plan under which a ""pure electric entity"" could be based in France, while a separate one for combustion engine and hybrids could be based abroad and open to partnerships. 

Several media outlets reported this week that management had told analysts that all options were open regarding the envisaged split, including a stock market listing of the electrical part.
Shares in Renault, which plans a capital markets day of briefings for analysts and investors in the autumn, have lost around 30% of their value since the start of the war.

Shares in Atlantia, which has a market capitalization of over 16 billion euros ($17.5 billion), surged 10% on Thursday as the company finds itself caught in a potential bidding war also involving the Benetton family and Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid soccer club.
Here's what you need to know on the company:
WHO ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS?
Benetton's holding Edizione owns 33% of Atlantia's shares.
Its control is equally divided among four holding companies, each relating to one of the four Benetton siblings who founded the family's economic empire.
New governance rules approved in January envisaged a lock-up period of five years and mechanisms, including pre-emption rights, to ensure that control of Edizione remains in the hands of the Benettons through the generational transition.
GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, has a 8% stake in Atlantia, Italy's market watchdog figures show.
Italian banking foundation CRT has a 4.5% stake in Atlantia, and is among the long-time investors in the group.
WHAT ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN BUSINESSES?
Atlantia runs five airports and nearly 10,000 kilometers of motorway around the world, the group's figures show https://www.atlantia.com/en/about-us/the-group. 
The holding company owns a controlling stake in the Nice airfield and nearly 100% of Rome's two airports. 
Atlantia also owns 50% plus one share of the equity of Abertis, the first national operator of toll roads in countries such as Spain, Chile and Brazil. Perez's ACS is a co-investor in Abertis.
Atlantia also owns 51% in digital toll payment company Telepass and 15% of Eurotunnel operator Getlink .
In June, Atlantia signed an agreement to sell its controlling stake in the Italian unit Autostrade per l'Italia (Italian motorways) to a consortium which includes state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and investment funds Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Macquarie.
The deal is worth more than 8 billion euros and Atlantia expects to pocket the cash by May.
LATEST FINANCIAL DATA
On March 11, Atlantia reported a 4 billion euro EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and proposed a dividend of 0.74 euros per share. In 2021 the overall motorway traffic was up 21%, the company said in the last annual report.

WHICH ARE ATLANTIA'S MAIN 2024 TARGETS?
In the last financial report, the company saw core profit reaching 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) by 2024, matching the figure it plans to invest over the same period. The conglomerate also expected revenues to rise to 7.7 billion euros by 2024. ($1 = 0.9191 euros)

For the full fiscal year, SoFi expects adjusted net revenue of $1.47 billion, compared to its previous guidance of $1.57 billion and consensus estimates of $1.53 billion. The personal finance company expects FY adjusted EBITDA of $100 million, down from the previous forecast of $180 million and missing the analyst expectations of $176.8 million.
SoFi expects Q1 adjusted net revenue in the range of $280 million to $285 million, short of the consensus projection of $287.8 million. It expects adjusted EBITDA from $0 to $5 million in the first quarter, compared to analysts expectations of $2.79 million.
The guidance cut comes after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration ordered the extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium from May 1 until August 31.
Separately, the fintech company announced that three members of its Board of Directors will be stepping down, including Clay Wilkes (the Founder of Galileo Financial Technologies), as well as SoftBank's Michel Combes and Carlos Medeiros.
Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev cut the price target to $14.00 per share (from $17.00) on Buy-rated SoFi stock following changes to the guidance and a less hospitable environment for FinTech multiples in general.
""The specter of an extension has been weighing on the stock for weeks. Many investors believe the guide-down includes additional weak spots; however, our analysis shows the drag on the P&L is only due to extending the moratorium. We see no incremental weakness. With the three board members stepping down, including Galileo's founder, we see this as more of an optics issue than an indication of a problem.. Our long-term views of SOFI remain unchanged. Buy,"" Dolev said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck is more cautious than Dolev as she pays special attention to boardroom changes. Graseck also lowered estimates to in-line with the new guidance.
""SoftBank is the top shareholder of SOFI. This announcement is likely to act as an additional overhang on the stock in the near-term,"" Graseck said in a client note.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed on Wednesday that it has purchased nearly 121 million of HP’s 1.05-billion share base. The holding is valued at about $4.2 billion based on the personal computing company's closing stock price on Wednesday of $34.91.
The HP stake is Berkshire's third big investment since February 26, when Buffett said in his annual shareholders letter that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and little ""excites us"" in equity markets. He recently said that American stocks were overvalued.
On March 21, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion in cash. Earlier in the same month, Berkshire revealed a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), spending over $6 billion for its stake in the energy firm.
Buffett has mostly shied from investing in technology companies even though his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investment has been one of his “Big Four” companies, others being Berkshire's insurers, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Buffett has pledged to keep at least $30 billion of cash on hand, according to Reuters."

Generali is locked in a battle with rebel investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, who wants to shake up Europe's third-largest insurer and has proposed an alternative board and CEO.
Generali's top shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) backs the insurer.
Shareholders vote on the make-up of the board at an annual general meeting on April 29.
""I am in favour of the current management team,"" Union Investment's Reiner Kloecker told Reuters by phone, adding that the existing team ""has done a good job over the last years. It has replenished the balance sheet after the last financial crisis, it has reduced the debt ratio, it has over-delivered on the three-year business plan and nicely increased the dividend"".
Union Investment is the number 16 investor in Generali, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The battle may be tight, Kloecker said. 
With a stake of more than 9%, Caltagirone is the second-biggest investor in Generali, behind Mediobanca, which owns just under 13%.
The challenger plan forecasts earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, of more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period, compared with a 6-8% target under the strategy Donnet presented in December.
The rebel camp has been building up its stake, pushing shares in Generali, which has a market capitalisation of 32 billion euros ($34.84 billion), to a 13-year high of 21.55 euros.
The share price could be at risk after the AGM, Kloecker said.
""If the Caltagirone pack wins, then Generali is likely forced to do much more M&A, which is bad for shareholders,"" he said.
""If Mediobanca wins the vote, then we have the risk (of) some stakes being unwound.""

Caltagirone could mount a legal challenge if he loses by a narrow margin, a candidate for the chairman's role told Reuters.

TSLA is in a downtrend, and has bounced off upside resistance three times now (a dynamic that solidifies the trendline is significant “ i.e., when rejected three times, the trendline become significant,"" Johnson said.
His comments come after the report emerged that Tesla is recalling 127,785 Model 3 units in China due to manufacturing defects. Tesla's Model 3 vehicles, both imported and China-made, were reported to have minor manufacturing differences in their rear motor inverter power semiconductor parts, as per CnEVPost.
As a result, the defect may cause the inverter to malfunction after the car has been used for a certain period.
The recall includes 34,207 imported Model 3 vehicles and roughly 93,578 China-made units, produced between Jan. 11, 2019, and Jan. 25, 2022.
Tesla plans to update the motor control software in the defective vehicles using the remote vehicle upgrade (OTA) technology, free of charge.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, more than previously disclosed, while soaring oil and gas prices boosted trading activities in the first quarter, the company said on Thursday.
The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, Shell said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. 
Shell, whose market capitalisation is around $210 billion, had previously said the Russia writedowns would reach around $3.4 billion. The increase was due to additional potential impacts around contracts, writedowns of receivables, and credit losses in Russia, a Shell spokesperson said.
Shell shares were down 1.2% at the start of London trading.
The start of 2022 marked one of the most turbulent periods in decades for the oil and gas industry as Western companies including Shell rapidly pulled out of Russia, severing trading ties and winding down joint ventures following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shell said it will exit all its Russian operations, including a major liquefied natural gas plant in the Sakhalin peninsula in the eastern flank of the country.
Shell did not provide any guidance on the future of its stakes in Russian projects.
Benchmark oil prices soared to an average of more than $100 a barrel in the quarter, their highest since 2014, while European gas prices hit a record high.
The unprecedented volatility in commodity prices in recent months has pushed several traders to the brink as they scrambled to sharply increase downpayments for oil and LNG cargoes.
Shell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, said earnings from LNG trading were expected to be higher in the quarter compared with the previous three months. Earnings from oil trading are set to be ""significantly higher"" in the quarter.

Cashflow in the quarter would be negatively impacted by ""very significant"" outflows of around $7 billion as a result of changes in the value of oil and gas inventories.
Shell's fuel sales averaged 4.3 million barrels per day in the quarter, down from 4.45 million bpd in the previous quarter, Shell said. LNG liquefaction volumes were slightly higher on the quarter, averaging 8 million tonnes.

LONDON (Reuters) -A rebel investor in Generali (MI:GASI) could mount a legal challenge if his bid to appoint new top executives at Italy's largest insurer loses by a narrow margin in a shareholder vote this month, a candidate for the chairman's role said.
In an interview with Reuters, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna said Generali investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone could challenge in court a victory by the opposite side at the April 29 AGM called to elect a new Generali board if the margin is less than 6%.
The tussle for control of Europe's third-largest insurer not only threatens the stability of the Italian giant - which as a major holder of the country's government debt is considered a cornerstone of the financial system - but calls into question the reappointment of CEO Philippe Donnet, who was put forward by Generali's board for a third mandate. 
It also shines a spotlight on the legacy of cross shareholdings that for decades has dominated the country's ""salotto buono"" - the fine drawing room - a system based on influence and connections interlocking Italy's biggest companies. 
Costamagna - who has been proposed by Caltagirone as the insurer's new chairman - said the Italian tycoon's camp was ""hopeful"" of securing the vote of Italy's Benetton family, which owns around 4% of Generali and is yet to take sides in the feud pitting the construction magnate against Generali's board and its main investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
The Benetton family could not be reached for comment.
With a stake of more than 9%, Caltagirone is the second-biggest investor in Generali, behind Mediobanca which owns just under 13%.
To counter Caltagirone's weight and that of fellow Italian billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, who is Generali's No. 3 investor with a stake of around 8%, Mediobanca has borrowed shares in Generali to give it a 17.2% voting stake at the AGM.
Mediobanca can also count on the vote of Italy's De Agostini group, which plans to sell its 1.4% stake in Generali only after the AGM and has expressed appreciation for Donnet.
Costamagna said Caltagirone would challenge a victory that reflected merely Mediobanca's borrowed shares and the De Agostini stake.
""They have about 4.5% borrowed and ... the De Agostini stake is already sold ... which means the day after the AGM they have 6% less,"" Costamagna said.
""If they win by a margin of less than 6%, they're not going to be legitimate anymore,"" he added.
Caltagirone and Generali declined to comment.
The International Securities Lending Association (ISLA) advises against using borrowed shares to vote at shareholder meetings. 
A source close to the matter told Reuters that ISLA, which in 2018 said that it ""has never condoned the practise of borrowing securities for the sole purpose of voting,"" had written to Mediobanca in this respect.
Mediobanca said in an emailed comment that ISLA, whose rules are not binding, was reiterating provisions in the UK's money market code.
""The share lending in question is a market transaction aimed at protecting an investment worth nearly 4 billion euros where the interest of Mediobanca coincides with that of other Generali shareholders,"" Mediobanca said.
Union Investment, also a Generali shareholder, told Reuters on Thursday it supported existing management.
'CHERRY ON THE CAKE'
Costamagna said acquisitions in key areas including asset management would play a role in boosting Generali's growth, but dealmaking wouldn't be the main priority.
""We have the cash to do it, but it's the cherry on the cake and we have to find the cherry and the cake has to be ready,"" he said.
""If there is the right target, which can bring us what we're lacking and can really complement our business, I have no problem in going ahead and trying to do it,"" he added.
The challenger plan forecasts earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, of more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period, compared with a 6-8% target under Donnet's current strategy. 
Detractors say Caltagirone's estimated earnings are too ambitious without sizable acquisitions. 
However, Costamagna said the focus was mainly on technology, cost cutting and overhauling Generali's holding structure while keeping dividend payments as retail investors - including wealthy families - had expressed concern over possible cuts to payouts. 
""We stressed the M&A side a bit too much… and people thought they're going to acquire the world,"" he said.

Yet, he said asset management deals would be pursued, despite hefty valuations.
""We are very careful, but you know, Bernard Arnault at LVMH has created one of the best companies in Europe and has always overpaid for all his targets, always.""

(Reuters) -News of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk taking a board seat at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media firm's ability to moderate content, company insiders told Reuters. 
Within hours of the surprise disclosure this week that Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" acquired enough shares to become the top Twitter shareholder, political conservatives began flooding social media with calls for the return of Donald Trump. The former U.S. president was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter after the Jan 6. Capitol riot over concerns around incitement of violence. 
""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK TRUMP!,"" tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on Monday. 
Despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful content. 
With Musk on the board, the employees said his views on moderation could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a place of healthy discourse, and might allow trolling and mob attacks to flourish. 
In the wake of Trump's ban from Facebook and Twitter, the billionaire tweeted that many people would be unhappy with U.S. tech companies acting ""as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""
MUSK'S INTENTIONS
Musk has not articulated what he wants to do as a new board member but he has telegraphed his intentions with his Twitter activity. A week before Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter, he polled his 80 million followers on whether the site adhered to the principle of free speech, and the majority voted 'no.'
The employees, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, point to Musk's history of using Twitter to attack critics. In 2018, Musk came under fire for accusing a British diver who had helped rescue children trapped in a cave in Thailand of being a pedophile. 
Musk won a defamation case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-musk-lawsuit-idINKBN1YA13U brought by the diver in 2019. 
When asked for comment, a Twitter spokesperson repeated a statement from Tuesday that the board ""plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service,"" but daily operations and decisions are made by Twitter's management and employees. 
""Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,"" the spokesperson said.
Some employees that Reuters spoke to were not so sure about the company's commitment to this. 
""I find it hard to believe (the board) doesn't have influence,"" said one employee. ""If that's the case, why would Elon want a board seat?"" 
But other employees Reuters spoke to said that Musk's involvement could help quicken the pace of new feature and product launches, and provide a fresh perspective as an active user of Twitter.
Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment.
Twitter's board figures prominently in discussions within Twitter, more so than at other tech companies, one employee said. That is because unlike Meta Platforms Inc, where founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls the company through a dual class share structure, Twitter only has a single class of shares, making it more vulnerable to activists like Musk. Teams within Twitter often consider how to communicate a strategy or decision to the board, for instance, the employee said.
On Thursday, Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1511982702819520512?s=20&t=icqGAAlqCZdXjrowWZk0zw an image from 2018 of him smoking weed on the Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), with the text: ""Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit.""
TRUMP'S RETURN?
One employee familiar with the company's operations said there were no current plans to reinstate Trump. A Twitter spokesperson said there were no plans to reverse any policy decisions. 
But a veteran auto analyst who covers Musk's operating style at Tesla said such a decision may only be a matter of time. 
""If Donald Trump was actually rich, he would have liked to have done the same thing but he couldn't afford it. So Elon is doing what Trump would have liked to have done,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. 
""I wouldn't be surprised"" if Twitter restores Trump's account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company,"" he said.
Longer term, employees said Musk's involvement may change Twitter's corporate culture, which they say currently values inclusivity. Musk has faced widespread criticism for posting memes that mocked transgender people and efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, and for comparing some world leaders to Hitler.

Several employees were alarmed by the warm welcome Musk received from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and cofounder Jack Dorsey, which prompted them to hit the job market this week.
""Some people are dusting off their resumes,"" one person said. ""I don’t want to work for somebody (like Musk).""

(Reuters) -Ladbrokes owner Entain saw a rise in first-quarter revenue, boosted by a rebound in its retail betting shops and an expansion of its U.S. joint venture, but shares slipped as online sales fell for the second straight quarter.
The London-listed gambling company, which also owns Coral betting shops and the bwin and partypoker online brands, said on Thursday total net gaming revenue jumped 31% for the three months to March 31 despite an 8% fall in revenues from online. 
Shares in the company listed on the FTSE 100 index were down 1.5% at 1030 GMT.
Gambling firms profited during the lockdowns as stay-at-home punters went online for entertainment, but online demand has slowed since economies reopened and people ventured out again, with inflation worries also pressuring spending. 
Many firms, including Entain, are also turning to the U.S. market as it opens up to sports betting. Entain's U.S. joint venture with MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), BetMGM, is now live in 23 markets with four new additions in the period, Entain said. 
""In the U.S., BetMGM is firmly established as the number two operator, and our market launches during Q1 mean that we now have access to over 41% of the U.S. adult population,"" Entain Chief Executive Jette Nygaard-Andersen said in a statement. 
BetMGM is expected to turn a core profit this year compared to a loss a year ago on revenues of more than $1.3 billion, Entain said in January.

""Very impressive BetMGM looks to be ticking over nicely,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Matt Britzman said, adding that increased online demand, which brings in better margins, also seems to be faring well for Entain despite the return to retail.
Entain, previously known as GVC, has withheld dividend payments in the past two years, and last month said it would use excess cash on acquisitions. It said in January it was considering developing products for virtual reality systems.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, rebounding after a losing streak, with investors cautiously digesting signals of aggressive central bank policy tightening and the likely impact on economic growth.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 65 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed lower Wednesday, the second consecutive losing day, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 150 points, or 0.4%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite over 2%. 
These losses followed the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in March, the gathering which saw the U.S. central bank hike interest rates for the first time since 2018.
The Fed policymakers signaled they were prepared to act more quickly than previously suggested, planning to shrink its balance sheet by more than $1 trillion a year while raising interest rates “expeditiously” to counter rampant inflation. 
The central bank next meets in May, and investors will likely study the employment and inflation data carefully ahead of this, starting with weekly jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This release is expected to show claims of only 200,000 last week, indicative of a vibrant labor market. 
Additionally, FOMC members James Bullard, Raphael Bostic, and John Williams are scheduled to offer their thoughts on the economic outlook during the session.
In corporate news, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) will be in the spotlight after the jeans retailer impressed with its quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday, while HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock is seen sharply higher premarket after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed it had bought a $4.2 billion stake in the company.
Oil prices rebounded Thursday after Wednesday’s sharp losses on the back of International Energy Agency member countries confirming that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180-million-barrel release announced by the United States last week.
Adding to Wednesday’s woes, data from the Energy Information Administration showing crude inventories rose by over 2 million barrels last week, the first climb in three weeks, raising questions about energy demand in the world’s largest oil-consuming country.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $97.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $102.57. Both benchmarks settled more than 5% lower on Wednesday, falling to a three-week low.

OSLO (Reuters) - Belgian oil tanker group Euronav (NYSE:EURN) and smaller Oslo-listed rival Frontline (NYSE:FRO) plan to merge in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.2 billion that they said would cut costs and help in their low-carbon transition.
Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, the largest owner of Frontline and the second biggest in Euronav, said the deal would establish a market leader and position the group for continued shareholder value creation.
Euronav's owners will get 59% of the combined group and will also receive a cash dividend before the deal closes, while Frontline owners will hold the remaining 41%, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.
The merged company will use the Frontline name and will be led by Euronav CEO Hugo De Stoop.
Euronav's shares were up 9.5% at 1011 GMT while Frontline's were down 4.8%.
The combination offers economies of scale that will facilitate increased fleet utilisation and ease a transition to digitalisation of logistics and the adoption of lower-carbon fuels for tankers, the companies said.
""The combination would be a leading global independent oil tanker operator,"" KBC Securities wrote in a note to clients, while cautioning that there were no assurance yet that a definitive merger agreement will be reached.
The rise of Euronav's share price on Thursday, and Frontline's fall, reflected the planned exchange ratio of the two shares compared to Wednesday's stock market closings, Arctic Securities analyst Lars Bastian Oestereng said.
""You can implicitly buy Frontline shares through buying Euronav shares cheaper ...It's an arbitrage opportunity,"" he said.
The new firm would have a fleet of 146 tankers, including 69 very large crude carriers (VLCC) and 57 Suezmax vessels.
""I am very excited and give my full support and commitment to this combined platform,"" veteran shipping investor John Fredriksen said.
The 77-year-old owns 39% of Frontline and 9% of Euronav according to the firms' websites, and is set to control around one fifth of the new firm's stock, according to a Reuters calculation.

The transaction remains subject to agreements on the transaction structure and terms, due diligence and regulatory approvals.
Euronav was advised on the deal by Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), while Frontline used ABG Sundal Collier. In addition, independent directors on Frontline's board retained DNB Markets.

ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - What happens when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plops over 1,000 new jobs in one of the hottest blue-collar job markets in the country?
The RV Capital of the World is about to find out.
Like many other manufacturing hubs around the United States, this patch of northern Indiana about 100 miles (161 km) east of Chicago has struggled to fill factory jobs throughout the pandemic, due in large part to an unprecedented boom in the recreational vehicle industry that dominates the local economy. 
New U.S. manufacturing jobs were minted at a rate of about 32,000 a month over the past year - the swiftest clip in more than a quarter century - but the regional variations are sizable. Around Elkhart, whose population is about 52,000, the share of the total workforce that is employed in factories and manufacturing is 51.5%, compared with a share of 8% nationally, according to the Labor Department.
The region's jobless rate sank to 0.9% in December, the lowest rate in the country, according to the Labor Department, though it has since edged up slightly. 
That is why when Amazon announced in October it would open a sprawling fulfillment center as well as a smaller last-mile delivery station in town, many of Elkhart's existing employers winced.
""I'm not 100% clear on the thinking of putting another 1,000 jobs in this tight labor market,"" said Bob Martin, chief executive of  Thor Industries  (NYSE:THO) Inc, the country's largest RV maker, which has plants dotted around Elkhart.
The new jobs have roiled all types of employers. Amish Shah, chief executive of Kem Krest, a distributor of automotive chemicals and accessories such as paint pens used to touch up scratches on cars at auto dealerships, said, ""The community at large is up in arms."" 
Shah estimates his 700-employee company is short 100 workers, despite constant recruiting, and noted he has gone to new extremes to retain employees and keep them happy. The company recently opened a free medical clinic at its main warehouse, for instance, and last week held a contest for workers with six months of perfect attendance. Top prize? Free use for a year of a new Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV, which typically retails for over $26,000.
""We have people who have already gotten calls from Amazon, saying 'come work for us,'"" said Shah, adding that no one has jumped ship for Amazon just yet.
RV BOOM
Amazon's new warehouse is rising from a muddy field in one of the most prominent spots in the county - just across the freeway from the RV Hall of Fame and Museum, a local landmark. When it opens next year, it will have space equal to 14 football fields. The other facility, designed for last-mile deliveries, has yet to break ground but is also expected to open in 2023.
Amazon declined to discuss whether it worried about filling jobs in Elkhart's tight labor market - or whether it expected to pay more than usual to attract willing hands.
The company, which has faced tough criticism for working conditions in its facilities and is battling labor unions seeking to organize its workers, has said only that its jobs come with an average starting pay of $18 an hour. Just last week workers at an Amazon facility in New York City voted to form a union despite the company's campaign against it. 
The company often emphasizes the other benefits it offers when it creates new jobs, including health benefits and aid for continuing education.
""Amazon is proud of this job creation and we also think employees will be excited to grow their career at Amazon in the Elkhart community,"" said spokesman Andre Woodson, in a statement.
Elkhart's tight job market is driven largely by the booming RV industry, where demand has soared as Americans sought new ways to travel while staying away from strangers during the pandemic.
An estimated 30,000-40,000 workers commute to Elkhart County each day for work, giving the otherwise rural-looking roadways regular doses of heavy traffic. The county's total workforce is about 115,000, according to the state's Department of Workforce Development, so the commuters are vital to filling existing jobs, which numbered just under 140,000 at the end of September, federal employment data showed.
""Just looking at the numbers, it doesn't make a lot of sense. They already have far more jobs than workers,"" said Michael Hicks, an economist at Ball (NYSE:BLL) State University who studies Indiana's industrial economy.
WHO WILL COME?
A key question is what the Amazon jobs will ultimately pay. Many local officials expect the company will need to pay more than the $18 an hour average, given the extremely tight labor market. Elkhart County ranked No. 4 among the largest 344 U.S. counties in year-over-year weekly wage growth as of the third quarter of 2021, the latest Labor Department data shows.
""I think they'll do what they have to do to meet demand (for labor),"" said Chris Stager, president of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County.
Stager and other local officials said the region faces a daunting challenge even without adding a big new employer. Housing is in short supply and more companies in Elkhart have started expanding in other regions simply to find enough workers.
Thor Industries is one of them. The company is building several factories about 30 miles away in Sturgis, Michigan, as part of its latest expansion and recently acquired a company in Alabama that gives it access to a more plentiful pool of labor.
""Amazon is competition, and sometimes competition makes you a better company,"" said Thor's CEO, Martin.
But analysts believe the big RV makers are more insulated from losing workers to Amazon than many other types of employers. The RV industry uses a wage structure that offers production-driven incentives on top of relatively low hourly rates that can massively boost factory wages during good times, as is the case now. It is not unusual for assembly workers in plants to make the equivalent of $50 or more an hour.
One question is how long the boom lasts.
""The music is going to stop at some point,"" said Pete McCown, president of the Community Foundation of Elkhart County. High gas prices and rising interest rates could put a damper on the industry, though there is no obvious sign yet of a major slowdown.
'A GLOW'
To be sure, there remain many workers in Elkhart who would likely get a raise by jumping to Amazon - including many who earn less in restaurants and other lower-paid service industries.
As of May 2021, the county had about 6,500 food-service workers earning an average of $12.46 an hour, Labor Department data released last week showed. In all, about half the county's workers then earned less than $19 an hour. While that wage has certainly risen since then given the competition for limited workers, it would still leave tens of thousands in the county earning less than the $18-an-hour starting average that Amazon promotes.
Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), the largest parts supplier to the RV industry, said companies in the region that offer competitive pay and good working conditions should not worry. He includes LCI in that group.
""The restaurants are the ones who always get blitzed,"" he said, ""because they have the lowest pay.""

He thinks Amazon will burnish the region’s ""glow.""
""Others will look at the county and say, 'Wow, this big tech company went there, so there must be something good in Elkhart.'""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bankers have long talked about how higher interest rates will deliver additional revenue from loans and higher-yielding securities.
Now that rates are rising, bankers must confront the downside: as yields rise the bonds they already own lose value and erode their capital.
For the biggest U.S. banks, this means less excess capital to fund share buybacks. Fewer buybacks mean less growth in earnings per share, which puts more pressure on stock prices. 
The S&P Banks Index has declined by 11% since the start of the year, almost double the 6% decline of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period.
""You're going to see a lot lower buybacks than you did last year in the U.S. banking system,"" said bank analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) could show one of the biggest capital declines from falling bond prices when banks start reporting quarterly results next week, analysts said, since it moved more aggressively than others to invest extra cash in securities last year.
""I'm pretty sure you will see that they have slowed their buybacks considerably in the first quarter and primarily due to this issue,"" Peabody said.
Bank of America declined to comment.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
The lost capital should eventually be compensated by higher rates improving net interest income. But the timing is inconvenient for buybacks, analysts said.
""Rising interest rates are a double-edged sword for the banks,"" Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin wrote in a report.
In the first quarter, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 0.83 of a percentage point to 2.34%. A full 1-point increase would have shaved Bank of America's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a key regulatory measure, to 10.2% from 10.6%, Usdin estimated.
That would leave the bank close to the 10% to 10.5% level that Bank of America executives have said the bank will maintain to keep a cushion over its 9.5% requirement from regulators.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) would have had its CET1 ratio reduced by 0.22 of a point while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) would have seen a 0.15-point cut, Usdin.
Citigroup and JPMorgan have additional reasons to reduce buybacks, Peabody noted. Citigroup probably will have to take some losses on its Russian assets and it has said those could rise to nearly $5 billion in a ""severe"" scenario.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a letter to shareholders on Monday that his bank's buybacks ""will be lower in the next year or so"" because it faces higher capital requirements and needs to invest in businesses it recently acquired.
When banks post results, analysts will examine how each one has changed its mix of cash and securities to increase interest income and managed the risk of unrealized losses on securities. 
Banks have been taking steps to reduce damage from the unrealized losses, including hedging holdings as Bank of America does.
Banks can also make an accounting choice that tempers the risk. They can classify some bonds as ""held-to-maturity"" (HTM) and not be required to count changes in value if they commit to keep the securities until they are repaid.
Or, banks can keep the bonds as ""available-for-sale,"" (AFS) which means having to count unrealized losses against capital but being free to sell the securities, such as to raise money to make more loans.
Bank securities portfolios have shifted to 47% held-to-maturity from 28% two years ago, according to Usdin.
Most banks are small enough that regulators don't require them to count the changes in AFS securities toward their capital requirements.
Whether AFS or HTM, the unrealized losses do not reduce earnings.

Peabody expects investors will focus more on changes in capital in coming quarters if bond prices continue to fall. That's because changes in capital, also known as book value, can be a better indicator than earnings of whether companies are creating value for shareholders or piling up losses to be realized later.
Usdin estimated that book value per share for 20 banks he covers would decline an average of 4% with a 1 percentage point increase in 10-year yields.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Benettons, who control Atlantia with a 33% stake, are united in ruling out any transaction that would involve a break-up of the Italian infrastructure group, one source close to the family told Reuters on Thursday.
Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIPC) pitched a possible takeover of Atlantia last week after talks with the family, the two funds said, adding they were also working with Spain ACS on the deal. 
 
"
699,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 05:52AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Atlantia jumped almost 12% to their highest levels in over two years after Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIPC) pitched a possible takeover of the Italian road and airport operator.
The funds have an agreement with ACS under which the Spanish construction company could acquire a majority stake in Atlantia's toll road concessions if any offer was completed.
The two funds said they had pitched a potential takeover of Italian road and airport operator last week after meetings with its main shareholder, Benetton family's Edizione.
However, the Benetton family, investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and other long-time investors in Atlantia are studying a counter-move to buy the company, three sources with knowledge of the matter said late on Wednesday. 
COMMENTS: 
KEPLER CHEUVREUX:
The potentially very large size of the transaction, given Atlantia's capitalization vs. ACS's one, as well as hypothetical interest from other investors, led the broker to ""think that the theoretical motivation could be, for example, the break-up of the Italian company.""
""We believe that for this hypothetical transaction to succeed, ACS and its potential partners would need the support of Atlantia's main shareholder, the Benetton family. Even on this assumption, the theoretical deal would be markedly complex due to valuation, political, and financing considerations.""
SANTANDER:
Based on current information, ACS is interested in Atlantia's toll road assets, but probably also the Italian's company 16% stake in Hochtief; joint offer with funds ""could mean a final shareholding for ACS below 50%, and ACS would avoid the consolidation of Abertis.""
ALANTRA:
""The deal (for ACS) looks big, complex, difficult to execute, and could be expensive especially if a bidding war takes place. In addition, this would be the second time that ACS makes a move for Atlantia, which raises the chances of it paying up to succeed.""
JBCAPITAL: 
""At this stage, it is unclear if there will be a bidding war for Atlantia. If it is the case, ACS will have to explain how a competing bid can add value for its shareholders,"" it says.
""The competition to acquire top-quality infrastructure assets is very high, particularly from infrastructure funds and pension funds. Consequently, we expect ACS to try to leverage its relationship with the Benetton family and Atlantia to test waters ahead of a potential deal with any of the former two.""
EQUITY SALESPERSON AT AN ITALIAN BANK:
""If stock is up 10-15% in the next few sessions I would be more a seller than a buyer as this is going to be another special situation with politics involved"" and, with Benetton controlling one-third of the capital, any hostile bid would be ""quite hard to materialize.""
BANCA AKROS:
Any combination with ACS may lead to further synergies on Atlantia's Latin America business. The broker adds however that given stake that Benetton hold in Atlantia, and the ongoing buyback, ""a hostile bid could be challenging.""
INTESA SANPAOLO:
Analysts at Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) agree that an unfriendly bid of ACS seems ""unlikely to succeed and it would also put into question the partnership with Atlantia on Albertis.""
BESTINVER:

Bestinver says instead that a possible war for control of Atlantia ""would undoubtedly benefit minority shareholders but would risk becoming too costly for the contenders."" 
Hence, the brokerage does not rule out that the Benetton and Florentino Perez, who owns ACS, may come to an agreement, jointly delisting the Italian group and then proceeding with a break-up.

(Reuters) -British online gambling firm 888 will pay a smaller price to buy William Hill's international assets from U.S.-based owner Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment, the companies said on Thursday, citing changes in economic and regulatory conditions.
Shares in London-listed 888 soared nearly 30% after the British company also said it would have to raise less capital to partly fund the purchase.
Las Vegas-based casino operator Caesars bought British bookmaker William Hill in a $4 billion deal last year and agreed in September to sell William Hill's non-U.S. assets to 888 for 2.2 billion pounds ($2.88 billion).
The purchase, 888's largest since listing in London nearly two decades ago, will give the online pure-play company access to William Hill's 2 million active UK customers and 1,408 betting shops across the UK.
The two companies have agreed that the assets now have an enterprise value of between 1.95 billion pounds and 2.05 billion pounds.
That means 888 will have to pay a cash consideration of about 585 million pounds, nearly 30% below the previously agreed 834.9 million pounds, 888 said.
William Hill is subject to an ongoing licence review by the UK's gambling commission and is addressing action points raised by the regulator in relation to its ""social responsibility and anti-money laundering obligations"", 888 said in the statement.
The review comes at a time when British businesses are facing rising inflation and consumers are struggling with a cost-of-living squeeze.
888, which has online sports betting, poker and casino platforms, said it now plans to issue up to 70.8 million new shares, which represents about 136 million pounds as of Wednesday's close, versus prior plans to raise about 500 million pounds.
Analysts at Jefferies said in a note they believe the deal ""makes strategic and financial sense"", adding that this will materialise in 888's balance sheet.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by June 2022.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's top court on Thursday cleared the way for passengers to seek compensation for delayed flights from non-EU airlines operating flights on behalf carriers from within the bloc.
The ruling from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the latest to boost passengers' rights to be reimbursed for flight delays or cancellations.
Thursday's case concerned three passengers, who made a single reservation with Lufthansa via a travel agency for a flight from Brussels to San Jose in the United States. The flight was entirely operated by United Airlines.
The three travellers arrived at their destination with a 223-minute delay and subsequently sued United Airlines in a Dutch court for compensation.
The CJEU backed their claim, saying United Airlines could then seek compensation from third parties.
""Passengers of a delayed flight may claim compensation from a non-EU air carrier where that carrier operates the entirety of the flight on behalf of an EU carrier,"" judges said.

""The operating air carrier (United Airlines) which is obliged to compensate a passenger retains the right to seek compensation from any person, including third parties, in accordance with the applicable national law."" 
The case is C-561/20 United Airlines.

LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus and Qatar Airways are set to face each other in court as a dispute over billions of dollars of jets enters a theatrical phase and rattles some airline leaders.
The Gulf carrier will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend an order that prevents Airbus revoking a contract for 50 A321neo jets, pending fuller hearings.
Airbus took the exceptionally rare step of halting the order in January in retaliation for Qatar's refusal to accept delivery of larger A350s, citing a breakdown in relations that has the makings of a corporate divorce trial.
Qatar has grounded 23 of the A350 jets, voicing concerns over the safety impact of gaps in a layer of lightning protection left exposed by cracked and bubbling paint.
It says it will not take further deliveries until the cause is formally explained and is suing Airbus for steadily rising compensation that now exceeds $1 billion.
The world's largest planemaker has acknowledged quality problems with the jets but insists the damage is well within safety tolerances, noting that European regulators consider them airworthy and other airlines continue to fly them.
Airline chiefs contacted by Reuters did not share Qatar's concerns over airworthiness of the A350 but voiced growing alarm over the scale of the dispute which has disturbed a broad industry consensus over safety and generated a trail of intricate filings.
""It is not good for the industry. They both need to get it out of the courtroom and find an agreement,"" the chief executive of one Airbus customer told Reuters.
Several industry players have offered to mediate but so far there are no signs of such a breakthrough, though neither side has definitively closed the door to discussion and Airbus has said it wants an ""amicable"" settlement.
Thursday's hearing, which is due to start at 0930 GMT, will be the first in-person clash after procedural sessions were held online because of COVID-19 restrictions.
'DANGEROUS GAME'
Statements filed in advance of the unusual hearing shed new light on industrial planning and details of aircraft negotiations that are typically kept under wraps.
The case has also shone a spotlight on delicate relations between France, where Airbus is based, and one of its closest Gulf allies at a time when Qatar's role as a gas producer has come to the fore as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russia.
In order to decide on Qatar's request for an injunction, a judge will weigh which side has most to lose if the A321 contract is scrapped and to what extent the plane is unique in its category. That issue goes to the heart of Airbus's battle for sales with rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the busiest part of the market.
Airbus has outsold Boeing about four to one at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets and Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said last year the A321neo had ""unmatched capabilities (and) operating economics"".
In statements pre-filed to the court, however, Airbus said Qatar Airways could replace the cancelled A321neos with the rival Boeing 737 MAX, which it provisionally ordered in December, or Airbus jets available from leasing companies.
The case has also given a glimpse of the stakes involved as leasing companies handle an uneven recovery while waiting for lease rates to catch up with the levels they planned before the pandemic.
Airbus told the court leasing companies are looking for homes for 80 A320s and 48 A321s in 2023 - a relatively high number a year before delivery, according to market sources.
""It shows that lessors believe the lease market is going to move up and are holding back before placing airplanes acquired before the pandemic - but it's a dangerous game,"" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
Qatar Airways, in turn, revealed normally closely held details of product plans for the A321neo, including pedal controls for seats and toilets adapted from those on the luxurious A380 superjumbo. Such details are usually jealously guarded until airlines are ready to reveal them in a highly competitive travel industry.

After the glare of proceedings at the High Court in London this month, the two sides are heading for a potentially uncomfortable meeting at the airline industry's largest annual event in June, relocated to Qatar because of travel restrictions in China.
Willie Walsh, the head of the International Air Transport Association, said on Wednesday he did not expect the dispute to distract from the meeting which is likely to focus on the impact of the Ukraine conflict.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses on the aggressive stance by Federal Reserve policymakers, but the U.K. market underperformed with oil major Shell (LON:RDSa) lifting the cost of writing off its Russian assets.
By 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, while U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.
The major corporate news Thursday came from the much-watched oil sector, as U.K. energy giant Shell stated it will write down up to $5 billion following its decision to exit Russia, higher than previously disclosed.
The post-tax impairments of between $4 billion and $5 billion in the first quarter will not impact the company's earnings, the company said in an update ahead of its earnings announcement on May 5. It had previously estimated the Russia write-downs would reach around $3.4 billion.
Shell’s stock fell 1.1%, dragging BP’s stock down 1.4% as the rival also has substantial interests in Russia to unwind. The losses of these two highly-weighted stocks resulted in the FTSE 100 index underperforming its European peers.
Elsewhere, the major European indices rebounded after posting sharp losses on Wednesday, weighed by the expectation the U.S. central bank is prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the U.S. economy to contain rampant inflation.
Investors remain concerned the meatier interest rate hikes from the Fed down the line to combat inflation will severely cut growth in the world’s largest economy, and the major global driver. 
Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank became the first big bank on Wall Street to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023. 
German industrial production rose 0.2% on the month in February, better than expected but still a hefty drop from the gain of 2.7% the previous month. Eyes will now turn to the release of Eurozone retail sales data for February.
Investors are also continuing to keep an eye on developments surrounding the war in Ukraine, after the United States announced new measures on Wednesday to punish Moscow, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters and Russia's Sberbank, and a ban on Americans investing in Russia.
Oil prices rebounded Thursday after the previous session’s sharp losses on the news that a number of major consuming nations will release crude from emergency reserves to offset supply lost from Russia. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced Wednesday that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180-million-barrel release announced by the United States last week.
Adding to Wednesday’s woes, data from the Energy Information Administration showing crude inventories rose by over 2 million barrels last week, the first climb in three weeks, raising questions about energy demand in the world’s largest oil-consuming country.

Xu, who has worked at JD (NASDAQ:JD).com for more than a decade, will start the top job immediately, the company said in a statement, adding that he will also join the board as an executive director. 
Xu's appointment comes as JD.com deals with slowing growth, with competition rising and consumer spending shrinking amid tightened regulations in China that have targeted e-commerce platforms.
JD.com has been cutting jobs recently and expanded layoffs in March, according to local media, as have other Chinese technology companies that are slashing their workforce to cut costs in a weaker, pandemic-ravaged economy. JD.com's U.S.-listed shares have nearly halved since their peak in February 2021.
Reuters reported last month that Chinese internet giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) are preparing for layoff rounds this year that might cut tens of thousands of jobs.
JD.com's core e-commerce business remained solid and the job cuts were happening at its marginal businesses, said Liu Xingliang, president of tech consultancy China Internet Data Center.
""Richard Liu is handing over the baton to Xu Lei, who will take care of the everyday business,"" he said.
Richard Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998 and a few years back had called out what he said were ""slackers"" in his firm, will spend more time mentoring younger management and focus on the company's business in rural areas.
With 80% of its voting share as per the company's 2020 annual report, and a nearly 14% stake, Liu will remain chairman of the board. 

Liu's control of the company became a focus after he was arrested in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in 2018 following a rape allegation. He denied the allegation and was not charged with a crime. 
Last September, JD.com had said Liu would step away from the day-to-day operations, handing those responsibilities over to Xu and switching his focus to JD.com's long-term strategy.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Indian e-commerce company Flipkart has internally raised its IPO valuation target by around a third to $60-70 billion, and now plans a U.S. listing in 2023 instead of this year, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters. 
Flipkart, which competes with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in India's booming e-commerce space, had earlier set an IPO valuation goal of $50 billion, Reuters has reported.
The main reason for waiting for the IPO is due to Flipkart's internal plan to boost valuations further by focussing on two of its relatively new businesses -- online healthcare services and travel bookings, two of the sources with direct knowledge said.
Two separate sources familiar with Flipkart's plans said the ongoing global market turmoil sparked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis also forced the Indian company to reconsider its timeline.
Flipkart acquired Indian travel booking website Cleartrip in 2021, and this week launched a ""Health+"" app to offer medicines as well as other healthcare products and services. 
""Flipkart thinks there is an even bigger upside of valuation than originally envisaged ... The travel business has started showing great signs already for them,"" said the first source. 
The first source said the IPO valuation target could be as high as $70 billion, while the second said it could be between $60-65 billion.
Flipkart didn't respond to a request for comment. 
Asked about the IPO's timeline, Walmart CFO Brett Biggs told an analysts conference in December that Flipkart's business was ""performing almost exactly like we thought"" and an ""IPO is still very much in the cards"", without specifying when the company will list.
The listing, according to sources, is now being planned for early-to-mid 2023. Flipkart is incorporated in Singapore and wants to list in the United States, they added.
The IPO planning comes amid growing protests from Indian brick-and-mortar retailers that Flipkart and Amazon bypass federal regulations and favour select sellers, allegations the companies deny. India is also working on a slew of e-commerce sector regulations that could spook foreign giants. 
Walmart acquired a roughly 77% stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion in 2018 - its biggest deal ever - and said later that year that it could take the company public in four years. 
Just last year, Flipkart raised $3.6 billion in a funding round, giving it a valuation of $37.6 billion.
That fund raising helped bolster the company's financial position, and it had enough cash right now for expansion, meaning an IPO wasn't a necessity at this stage, said one of the sources. 

India's IPO market has slowed after having boomed as enthusiastic retail investors and a pandemic-induced flood of easy money pushed prices to record highs, encouraging a slew of Indian tech companies like Paytm and Zomato to go public.
More than 60 companies made their market debut in India in 2021 and raised a total of more than $13.7 billion, which was more than the previous three years combined.

Financial markets finally appear to be waking up to the reality that the Federal Reserve will soon start taking the axe to its asset holdings in another aggressive step to put inflation back in its bottle. 
So in addition to the prospect of an aggressive half-point rate hike in May, minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed, officials agreed to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central banks asset holdings. That move could also begin next month.
No need to imagine how the spectre of a faster tightening in financial conditions than anticipated went down.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index fell over 2% for a second straight day. Wall Street ended broadly lower, futures suggest another day of selling. European shares are also expected to open lower, Japan's blue-chip Nikkei fell 1.5%. 
Bond markets are calmer today, but they'd already sold off as comments from Fed officials earlier in the week highlighted a debate about reducing the Fed's balance sheet, worth roughly $9 trillion.
Signalling about recession risks from the 2-10 year segment of the yield curve have also eased. But note  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) now believes geopolitical upheaval, soaring inflation and hefty Fed tightening will likely tip the U.S. economy into a recession by late next year.
Minutes from the European Central Bank's March meeting meanwhile are out later, just a week ahead of the ECB's next gathering. In the euro area too calls to take action against inflation are only getting louder. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said on Wednesday rates may have to rise soon. 
And with French bonds coming under pressure, a government bonds auction later may be worth watching as a gauge of investor sentiment before the April 10 first round presidential election.

Investing.com -- Shell (LON:RDSa) expects a hit to earnings of as much as $5 billion after-tax in the first quarter as a result of its abrupt exit from Russia, the energy giant said Thursday.
Europe's biggest oil and gas producer announced it would divest Russian businesses almost immediately after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. While it continued to buy Russian oil for its trading operations, it soon had to discontinue that, too, after outrage at its participation in an export tender by one of the country's largest producers. 
The company said its adjusted earnings will still accurately reflect the company's performance, which will be heavily influenced by the surge in oil prices during the quarter. A $10 rise in Brent generates roughly $2.5 billion in Shell's adjusted earnings from oil and another $1 billion in earnings from gas, according to its latest estimates.
Trading profit is expected to leap as its indicative refining margin widened to $10.23 a barrel from $6.55 three months earlier. Shell's refineries also operated at a slightly higher level in the quarter, at a utilization rate of between 72% and 74%. However, its cash flow from operations is expected to show a $7 billion outflow due to the soaring cost of replacing inventory and other factors.
Shell said it expects to report production of between 1.9 million and 2.05 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down around 50,000 boe/d due to the transfer of its Canada Shales assets to Integrated Gas. Underlying operating costs are seen at around $2.5 billion.
Its other main profit driver, chemicals, will report margins roughly unchanged from the previous quarter (due to higher feedstock costs) but will be supported by the fact that its chemicals plants, like its refineries, ran at slightly higher utilization rates.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - A month of the war in Ukraine briefly erased a year's worth of gains for European equities but the continent's bourses have quickly recovered as investors have poured money into sectors such as energy and defence which are poised to benefit from one of the deepest policy shifts in the region in decades. 
The largest war in Europe since World War Two has suddenly awakened governments to the urgent need of making their economies less reliant on oil and gas imports from Russia and building their own military security capabilities.
After initially plunging to 12-month lows amid record outflows on worries the war could cause a stagflation shock, European equities have swiftly recovered. Shares in German defence company Rheinmetall are worth twice as much as before the conflict while shares of wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems have jumped around 40% so far. 
The broader market has recovered 11% in one month, and is within striking distance of a record high on Jan. 4 with overall valuations at a 34% discount to the U.S. market. 
""The TINA argument (""There is No Alternative"" to stocks) is not as strong as it was but ... the yields you can get on many parts of the equity space - particularly energy, materials and financials - are still your better source of income at the moment,"" said Benjamin Jones, director of macro research at Invesco. 
Graphic: Europe PE discount to U.S.: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzybzykvw/Europe%20PE%20discount%20to%20US.PNG 
Investors' shopping bag has changed dramatically since Feb. 24 when Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
""Europe will transition to be more independent and redefine many of its sectors and economic paradigms,"" said Eric Lopez, head of EMEA Equity Research at BofA Global Research. 
""The consequences will range from the development of new industries, the acceleration of existing ones, additional infrastructure and technologies, while reaching independence and leadership for some,"" he said. With its costly REpowerEU plan, the European Commission wants to replace over 70% of Russian gas imports this year by ramping up liquefied natural gas purchases, green energy and gas storage. Investment flows at a regional level continue to be in negative territory for Europe with net outflows of $17.9 billion so far this year, according to BoFA. 
But Morningstar data showed 2.1 billion euros of fund inflows to the European energy sector this year, while shares of a handful of European defence companies have attained double-digit returns since the start of the war. 
Graphic: European defence shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkbexxvq/European%20defence%20shares.png 
Germany and Sweden said they plan to sharply increase spending on defence to around 2% of their economic output. 
BofA estimates 200 billion euros ($218.08 billion) of incremental annual spending in the sector if all European countries moved to devote 2% of their gross domestic product spending on defence. 
Commodity-linked stocks alongside financials shares have been the preferred sectors since the start of the war as oil and other commodity prices surged. Healthcare is back in vogue for its defensive traits.

""SO AWAY FROM THESE INDEXES""
Lale Akoner, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management, said her top picks are commodity-rich London FTSE 100 and the Norwegian index. She is avoiding Germany's Dax, for its heavy exposure to Russian energy. 
""What I'm saying to clients is that you have ... to understand the nuances on which country is more dependent on natural gas and energy supply from Russia,"" she said. ""So away from these indexes"". 
There is a lot of investor interest in Europe's energy sector with the REPowerEU plan expected to be positive for pure renewables players like RWE, Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and EDP Renováveis.

Plans to speed up the development of alternative gas supplies and LNG will need supporting infrastructure, which could put E.ON, Italgas, Snam, Terna, Red Eléctrica and Enagás in the spotlight for potential network development. 
""What's happened in Russia and Ukraine all of a sudden meant that the energy transition from fossil fuels to more renewables alternatives is now not just an environmental issue, it is also now a security issue as well,"" Invesco's Jones said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Thursday, continuing the sharp losses from the previous session with investors wary after U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers suggested the need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The Fed signaled in its minutes on Wednesday that it was prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the economy to contain rampant inflation, including pare-down of its balance sheet of bonds more quickly than originally anticipated.
This news pressured the major averages on Wall Street, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite the hardest hit, dropping 2.2% on Wednesday. The major European indices also suffered, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both closing around 2% lower.
Investors are concerned the likely meatier interest rate hikes down the line–with ”many"" policymakers now prepared to lift interest rates in 50-basis-point increments at coming meetings–will severely cut growth in the world’s largest economy, and the major global driver. 
Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank became the first big bank on Wall Street to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023. 
Investors are also continuing to keep an eye on developments surrounding the war in Ukraine, after the United States announced new measures on Wednesday to punish Moscow, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters and Russia's Sberbank, and a ban on Americans investing in Russia.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West to do more, in his daily video address early on Thursday, seeking sanctions that are economically destructive enough for Russia to end its war.
Looking at economic data, German industrial production rose 0.2% on the month in February, better than expected but still a hefty drop from the gain of 2.7% the previous month, ahead of the release of Eurozone retail sales data for February.
In corporate news, Credit Suisse is likely to be in the spotlight after the Swiss banking giant published restated historical financial information, reflecting its new divisional reporting structure that was announced in November.
Oil prices rebounded Thursday after the previous session’s sharp losses on the news that a number of major consuming nations will release crude from emergency reserves to offset supply lost from Russia. 
International Energy Agency member countries announced Wednesday that they would release 60 million barrels of oil, adding to the 180-million-barrel release announced by the United States last week.
Adding to Wednesday’s woes, data from the Energy Information Administration showing U.S. crude oil inventories rose by over 2 million barrels last week, the first climb in three weeks, raising questions about energy demand in the world’s largest oil-consuming country.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $97.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.9% to $103.03. Both benchmarks settled more than 5% lower on Wednesday, falling to a three-week low.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,922.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.0913."

TOKYO (Reuters) -A Japanese battery start-up said on Thursday it would launch a commercial fleet service using electric vehicles from China's Geely Holding Group, joining a growing field of services aimed at helping companies reduce their carbon footprint.
Yokohama-based 3DOM Inc, a university-led venture set up in 2014 to develop separators for batteries, said it would offer the carbon neutral EV service through subscription or lease so that users could avoid high purchase costs.
Companies are under increasing pressure from investors and the public to reduce their carbon footprint, and Chinese automakers have led the way in Japan through their relatively low-cost battery electric vehicles.
Leading Japanese delivery firm Sagawa Express Co plans to start replacing all 7,200 of its commercial mini-vehicles with EVs supplied by Guangxi Automobile Group this year. Another firm, SBS Holdings, has plans to use electric trucks produced by Dongfeng Motor group.
3DOM said the electricity that would power Geely's light commercial van would be produced from wind power and other green sources in partnership with utilities. The running cost for the service to lease the vans would be on a par with a gasoline-powered fleet, it said.

3DOM said the fleet would comprise about 7,500 vehicles and several companies including delivery services and supermarket operators were considering its service. It did not elaborate.
Among Japanese automakers, Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp provides EVs for the postal service, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has a trial service with convenience store operators to use its fuel-cell hydrogen electric vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rebound that saw U.S. stocks surge from last month's lows has started to falter, as investors factor in faster monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, soaring inflation and ongoing geopolitical upheaval stemming from the war in Ukraine. 
The S&P 500 is down 7% from its recent high after about cutting its year-to-date loss 50% in a dramatic rally during the final weeks of March. Volatility in both stocks and bonds is once again on the rise and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) earlier this week became the first big Wall Street bank to call for a U.S. recession, predicting a downturn by the summer of 2023 and a ""transitory"" 20% decline in stocks. 
Still, markets have proven resilient in the past, and April has historically been one of the best months of the year for equities. With corporate earnings around the corner, here is a look at where markets stand less than a week into the second quarter of 2022. 
GRAPHIC: Rebound- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwqgzbpo/Pasted%20image%201649252797681.png
The S&P 500 is down 6.5% year-to-date after a swoon of nearly 13% earlier in the year, though that rebound appears to be running out of steam. 
The index's recent wobble has come alongside forecasts for big rate hikes from Wall Street and a hawkish tilt from policymakers, as well as an inversion of key parts of the Treasury yield curve – a signal that has preceded past recessions.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, released Wednesday, appeared to set the stage for meatier interest rate hikes down the line, as well as a $95 billion per month trimming of the Fed's balance sheet later this year.
GRAPHIC: U.S. Financial Conditions- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvneqmyzpl/Pasted%20image%201649268280384.png
The worries about the outlook for stocks come amid a tightening in financial conditions – the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding in the economy. 
GRAPHIC: Different roads- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjbnwnve/Pasted%20image%201649252054580.png
Meanwhile, volatility is picking up in stocks. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, which slipped as equities rallied last month, has inched higher in recent sessions, though it remains about 12 points below its early March closing high. Treasury market volatility has remained elevated, as yields have continued their steady move higher. 
GRAPHIC: Short stack- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/REBOUND/lbvgnmmqkpq/chart.png 
At the same time, bearish bets against the S&P 500 have declined from recent peaks, though they remain near recent highs. Some market watchers believe high short interest, along with other signs of defensive positioning such as hefty levels of cash, to be a contrarian indicator presaging stronger stock performance. 
GRAPHIC: AAII Sentiment Survey- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykjlywpg/Pasted%20image%201649252971512.png
Many have argued that a recession is by no means inevitable and said signals such as yield curve inversions are poor tools for timing stock performance. 
The S&P 500 has risen by an average of 11% in the 12-months following five out of the past seven inversions, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, in a recent note. 
Sentiment among retail investors appears to be growing more positive as well. For the first time since January, the percentage of investors who are bullish on the market is larger than those who are bearish, a weekly survey held by the American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey (AAII), showed.
GRAPHIC: Seasonally strong- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/REBOUND/myvmnqygapr/chart.png

At the same time, the S&P has logged an average gain of 1.5% in April since 1928, making it the second strongest month of the year for stocks, and has now been a positive month for equities for nine straight years. 
This year, much may hinge on how corporate results come in over the next few weeks. Analysts note that growth expectations have not moved much in recent months, despite the upheavals in the stock market: first-quarter earnings growth is forecast to be 6.4%, down from 7.5% at the start of the year, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd reported on Thursday an estimated 50% jump in quarterly operating earnings to post its highest first-quarter profit since 2018, beating expectations as solid demand underpinned prices for memory chips.
Earnings at the world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker were also supported by brisk smartphone sales in the quarter, along with a disruption at a rival NAND Flash chip plant, analysts said.
Samsung (KS:005930) put its first-quarter profit at 14.1 trillion won ($11.6 billion) in a preliminary earnings release, versus a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 13.3 trillion won. Revenue likely rose 18% from the same period a year earlier to a record 77 trillion won, also above market expectations. 
""The guidance beat market expectations, probably due to memory chip shipments and prices being better than expected,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
Although memory chip prices dipped in the first quarter, analysts said solid demand from data centre clients as well as cautious investment spending by chipmakers and limited capacity expansion buoyed Samsung's chip earnings, which make up about half of its total profits. 
The chipmaker also likely benefited from a disruption at a rival NAND Flash chip plant owned by Japan's Kioxia and American firm  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) due to contamination of raw materials.
""After the contamination issue at Kioxia, I think there were rush orders for NAND Flash chips made to Samsung for products that were meant to be secured from Kioxia,"" Park said.
The disruption at the Kioxia plant in early February is expected to drive up NAND Flash prices by 5%-10%, offsetting the effects of modestly high inventories maintained by buyers, data provider TrendForce said. 
Samsung shipped an estimated 72 million smartphones in the first quarter, Counterpoint Research said, down some 11% from a year earlier, mostly due to a later than usual release of its newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22. 
The Galaxy S22 series globally sold some 50% more in the first week after its late February launch than its previous model S21, according to Sujeong Lim, an associate director at Counterpoint. 
Samsung is estimated to have shipped slightly over 6 million units of the S22 series by the end of March, Lim said, adding that sales were in line with initial expectations. 
Samsung is due to release detailed earnings on April 28, when investors will be interested to hear any comments on its M&A plans, how it plans to operate its memory chip business to boost profitability, and chip demand outlook. 

Samsung shares fell 0.2% in morning trade, versus a 0.9% drop in the wider market.

(Reuters) - More than half of the European population support legalization of adult use of cannabis and around 30% of them are interested in purchasing it, according to polling data by industry consultants on Thursday.
Europe's liberal approach could reap multiple financial and economic benefits as seen in the United States, which has witnessed a surge in cannabis use during pandemic-induced lockdowns.
While majority of Europeans support regulated cannabis shops, most do not favor growing the plant at home, according to the report by London-based consultancy Hanway and pot producer Curaleaf International.
The report comes a week after the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a bill to end the federal ban on marijuana, which has created legal headaches for users and businesses in the states that have legalized it.
""We see the European market as three to four years behind (the U.S.), but it actually looks like Europe may initiate sweeping reform before the United States,"" said Boris Jordan, executive at U.S.-based Curaleaf.
Many European countries, including Germany, have legalized cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, while others have decriminalized its general use. Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and personal use of cannabis.
The European cannabis market is expected to cross 3 billion euros ($3.27 billion) in annual revenue by 2025, up from about 400 million euros last year, according to a report from research firm Prohibition Partners. Germany has been the biggest market in the continent so far.
""There is clear political desire and willingness in Germany to legalize recreational use,"" Joe Bayern, chief executive officer of Curaleaf, told Reuters.

""Given it (Germany) is the largest economy in Europe, we think it will lead the way and create a domino effect for rest of the continent,"" Bayern said.

(Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX meant for China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) subsidiary Shanghai Airlines landed in Shanghai on Thursday, flight tracking websites showed, amid uncertainty over when the model will resume flying in China.
Flight BOE631 from Guam came more than three weeks after the first 737 MAX bound for a Chinese customer since a 2019 grounding began its journey from Seattle to Boeing's completion plant in Zhoushan.
The plane, painted in Shanghai Airlines livery, had been stuck on the ground in Guam since March 15 due to a minor technical issue. It landed at 12:02 p.m. Shanghai local time (0402 GMT), tracking websites showed.
Boeing said it was bringing the plane to its facility in Zhoushan to be closer to its customer and support a smooth and convenient delivery process. 
""The airplane will be delivered only when the customer is ready,"" Boeing said in a statement.
China Eastern did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The flight to Shanghai, which is in the middle of a strict COVID-19 related lockdown, came as Chinese authorities scrutinise China Eastern's safety processes following the crash of a 737-800 on March 21 that killed all 132 people on board.
While that model is the predecessor to the MAX, analysts have expressed concern it could set back Boeing's efforts to regain ground in the world's biggest aircraft market and deliver more than 140 737 MAX jets already constructed for Chinese customers.
China's aviation regulator in early December provided airlines with a list of fixes required before its return to commercial flying, which it predicted would occur by the beginning of this year. So far, however, there have been only test flights.
China Eastern has grounded all 223 of its 737-800 planes as a precaution while the crash is investigated. Chinese authorities are leading the investigation but the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is helping them to read the plane's black boxes.

Depending on the results of the probe, China Eastern risks consequences including fines, aircraft groundings and unfavourable treatment when applying for new routes and airport slots, Morningstar analyst Cheng Weng said.
China Eastern has not released any forecast of when it expects MAX deliveries to resume, though rival China Southern Airlines said last week it could take some of the planes this year.

719,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 11:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Several Chinese lenders have been told they can file legal cases against China Evergrande Group in local courts, in an apparent easing of a restriction that required all such lawsuits to be handled in a single court, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move may help onshore creditors gain control of assets ahead of a looming debt restructuring. At least three lenders in Zhejiang and Shandong province were told by courts last month that they can file the cases against the embattled developer in their own jurisdictions rather than to a court in Guangzhou, where Evergrande was based for decades, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Some cases have already been accepted, said the people.
Creditors have filed hundreds of lawsuits to the Intermediate People’s Court of Guangzhou after China’s Supreme Court in early August ordered all cases against Evergrande and its affiliates to be processed there. The backlog and protracted process have led to slow progress for many banks, trusts and suppliers to seize assets and recover their losses.  
Evergrande, started 28 years ago by billionaire Chairman Hui Ka Yan, officially became a defaulter in December and aims to provide creditors with a preliminary overhaul proposal by the end of July. Both onshore and offshore investors are closely watching the development of what could be one of the nation’s biggest restructurings, as they are prepared for a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains.
Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Calls to the Supreme Court and the Intermediate People’s Court of Guangzhou went unanswered.  
The August order to centralize cases had given Evergrande some breathing room as it helped hold off creditors’ attempts to freeze accounts while allowing the developer to complete more than one million unfinished homes. Smaller rival Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. in November flagged it was also resorting to this approach to prevent assets being frozen by courts under numerous lawsuits.
However, the Guangzhou court alone can’t deal with hundreds of filings from the country, the people said. As of Dec. 9, it has accepted 367 cases with claims totaling 84 billion yuan ($13 billion), the Financial Times reported in December citing official records. 
The latest change may allow creditors to gain faster control of Evergrande’s real estate projects, many of which were being pledged for borrowings, said the people. 
Signs have already emerged that Evergrande is speeding up on disposing of stakes in some property projects. At least three trust companies have bought stakes in at least seven projects from Evergrande this year.

In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.59% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.1%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.4% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.69%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts fell on Wednesday, with technology shares leading a retreat that saw the Nasdaq 100 post its worst two-day loss in almost a month.
U.S. Treasuries rose, with the yield curve steepening, as investors continue to digest Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting. In the minutes, the Fed said it is considering half-point interest rate hikes and reducing its massive bond holdings at a maximum pace of $95 billion per month to tighten financial conditions.
The central bank’s plan to trim its near $9 trillion balance sheet could pose risks to economic growth and introduce further volatility into the market. Some investors are also concerned that a recession is inevitable.
“This job of orchestrating a soft landing is going to be difficult,” Wells Fargo Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Reuters.
“We’ve only seen quantitative tightening once before and it was to a lesser degree than it will be this time, and it ended shortly after it started.”
A slew of Fed policymakers, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at separate events later in the day.
Contrary to the Fed’s hawkish stance, China again signaled its intention to loosen monetary policy as the country deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak and a slumping property market. Officials will use monetary policy tools at an “appropriate time” and consider other measures to boost consumption, according to the readout from a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, commodity markets continue to be roiled by the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia also edged closer to a technical default after foreign banks declined to process around $650 million of dollar payments on its bonds.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Cinctive Capital Management is expanding beyond its bread-and-butter stock trading and has hired former Brevan Howard trader Giles Coppel to lead a team that will bet on interest rates and currencies as global macro investments find new favor.
""We are moving to a different paradigm and this is a time for macro investing,"" said Richard Schimel, who co-founded Cinctive with Larry Sapanski in 2019, confirming the moves.
Fresh market volatility coupled with a spike in inflation and an expected end to generous central bank stimulus are combining to create ideal conditions for these types of strategies after a period of lackluster returns.
Cinctive, with more than $3 billion in regulatory assets, according to recent filing, hired Coppel to lead the team as the firm's anchor investors and others said they wanted to put money into macro strategies as making money in stocks becomes harder.
Since January, macro-oriented strategies delivered some of the hedge fund industry's best returns, gaining 2% in the first two months of 2022, according to Hedge Fund Research data. At the same time, the average hedge fund lost 2% and the broader S&P 500 stock index tumbled 8%.

The shift in conditions prompted Schimel and Sapanski to expand with a team of five. Coppel, who joined in February, will be Cinctive's macro chief investment officer. He cemented his reputation at Brevan Howard and ran his own firm, Phillimore Investments. Macro strategist Greg Kaldor, who worked with Coppel at Phillimore, also joined Cinctive in February.
Joining this month will be Raymond Wang, as a portfolio manager responsible for macro rates trading and global relative value after working at BlueCrest Capital Management; Mitch Nadel, the former head of America's Macro Trading at MUFG Securities; and Rak Natrajan, an execution trader who previously worked at Autonomy Capital.

The benchmark CSI 300 gauge has gained more than 2% since the financial hub of Shanghai introduced a two-stage lockdown early last week. An index of Shanghai-listed developers and a Bloomberg gauge of Chinese real estate firms have both climbed more than 10% during that period.
Bets are mounting that China’s policy makers will deploy more stimulus to shore up growth before President Xi Jinping seeks to secure a third term before year-end. A weak services sector report on Wednesday highlighted the risks for the world’s second-largest economy, with holiday spending figures pointing to more damage ahead amid widespread Covid curbs.
“We’ve seen and quelled such outbreaks so many times before and have plenty of experience, it’s only a matter of time once the nation sets its mind on it,” said Chen Shi, a fund manager at Shanghai Jade Stone Investment Management Co. “Looking in retrospect to 2020, the largest returns in stocks came in tandem with the period of the greatest uncertainties over the virus in the first two quarters.” 
Chen, who has been confined to his compound for more than 20 days, expects policy loosening to translate into better valuations even if earnings are impacted. The wider range of treatment options, more extensive testing and a lower fatality rate indicate that the outbreak can be contained, he said.
The domestic optimism contrasts with growing concerns from market participants elsewhere over China’s worsening outbreak. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) slashed their target for the CSI 300 Index by 16% last week, citing risk factors such as property defaults and city-wide lockdowns, according to a research note.
In terms of stimulus, the Chinese authorities have a variety of tools at their disposal, including cutting rates and taking steps to boost the property sector. Officials will use monetary policy tools at an “appropriate time” and consider other measures to boost consumption, according to the readout from a meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.
China Vows to Use Monetary Policy Tools at Appropriate Time (2)
Beijing loosened home-buying rules in more than 60 municipalities in the first quarter, abandoning restrictions on the number of residences households can own to stimulate demand. 
Hopeful investors may be waiting for a repeat of the dramatic rebound in 2020, when the CSI 300 Index gained nearly 40% in the four months between a low in March - when Wuhan was still in lockdown - and July, when daily cases had dwindled to the single digits.
“There has to be loosening at this rate, and hopes are mostly around more relaxation for the property sector, as it’s the most important part of the economy,” said He Qi, fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management. 
“There are long-term goals for property, then there are imminent emergencies, and the task now is first to make it through this.”

(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed on Wednesday that it has purchased nearly 121 million shares of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the latest in a series of large investments by the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett.
The investment gives Berkshire a roughly 11.4% stake in HP, worth about $4.2 billion based on the personal computing and printing company's closing stock price on Wednesday of $34.91.
Shares of HP rose 9.9% to $38.38 in after-hours trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
HP, based in Palo Alto, California, had about 1.06 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31.
Neither HP nor Berkshire immediately responded to requests for comment.
The HP stake is Berkshire's third big investment since Feb. 26, when Buffett said in his annual shareholders letter that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and little ""excites us"" in equity markets.
On March 21, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion in cash, adding to its portfolio of insurers including Geico.
Earlier in March, Berkshire revealed a 14.6% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), which cost well over $6 billion to amass.
Before announcing the Alleghany purchase, Buffett had gone six years without a major acquisition, leaving Berkshire with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Buffett has pledged to keep at least $30 billion of cash on hand.
Berkshire did not say whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are responsible for the HP stake, though Buffett normally handles larger investments.

Buffett is chiefly responsible for Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), calling the iPhone maker one of the ""Big Four"" companies accounting for much of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's value.
The other ""Big Four"" companies are Berkshire's insurers, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Energy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The West's punishment of Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine ramped up this week following the discovery of civilians shot dead at close range in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, seized from Russian forces. 
Below are details on Western sanctions so far:
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS
The U.S. imposed ""full blocking sanctions"" on Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfabank, the country's fourth largest financial institution. That means U.S. persons cannot do business with the lenders, while any of their assets that touch the U.S financial system are frozen.
Britain also on Wednesday froze Sberbank's assets.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday was set to sign an executive order prohibiting new investment in Russia by U.S. persons, which includes a ban on venture capital and mergers, U.S. officials said. 
Previous sanctions by the U.S., Britain and other Western allies in the days following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which it calls ""a special military operation,"" kicked the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of those countries, although some activities were allowed to continue. 
U.S. banks were required to sever correspondent banking ties, which allow banks to make payments between one another, with Sberbank. Russian lenders VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank, were also subject to full blocking sanctions. 
European Union sanctions hit 70% of the Russian banking system.
INDIVIDUALS
The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's wife and daughter, and senior members of Russia's security council.
Separately, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday said it charged Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev with violating existing sanctions, saying he provided financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea.
The U.S. government on Feb. 25 joined European countries in slapping sanctions on Putin and Lavrov.
More than 100 Russian elites, including members of Putin's inner circle, members of the Russian parliament, and Russian executives and businessmen, have been sanctioned since Feb. 24 by Western nations.
SWIFT BAR 
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada in February and March blocked certain Russian lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system, preventing the lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide.
The move also placed restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves, the nations said in a joint statement.
SWIFT is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS 
This week, the United States stopped the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at U.S. banks. 
Under earlier sanctions, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. lenders were frozen, but the Treasury had allowed Moscow to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis. On Monday, Washington decided to cut off Moscow's access to the funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson.
In late February, Britain, the European Union and the United States put new restrictions on dealing in Russian sovereign debt. 
Britain announced a ban on Russian sovereign debt sales in London, the European Union banned EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds, and U.S. investors, who were already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly, were banned from purchasing it in the secondary market from March 1.
ENERGY 
U.S. President Biden on March 8 imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022.
Berlin on Feb. 22 halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany. The following day the United States imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building the pipeline.
The United States and the EU already had sanctions in place following Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea on Russia's energy and defense sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
CURBING TECHNOLOGY
Sanctions proposed by the European Union on Tuesday, which the bloc's 27 member states must approve, would bar Russian imports worth 9 billion euros ($9.8 billion) and exports to Russia worth 10 billion euros, including semiconductors and computers, and stop Russian ships entering EU ports.
The EU earlier vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software. 

The U.S. Commerce Department imposed export controls that severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities. 
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former McKinsey & Co partner who helped advise  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on its recent purchase of fintech lender GreenSky Inc was sentenced on Wednesday to two years in prison for insider trading on the takeover. The defendant, Puneet Dikshit, 41, had pleaded guilty in December to a securities fraud charge.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon, who imposed the sentence in federal court in Manhattan, also ordered Dikshit to forfeit $455,017, representing his illegal profit. 
Dikshit admitted that he bought GreenSky call options, a bet that the company's stock price would rise, shortly before the $2.24 billion merger was announced on Sept. 15, 2021, and said he was ""profoundly sorry.""
Prosecutors said the Manhattan resident purchased his 2,500 call options without receiving pre-clearance from McKinsey, and sold them soon after the merger was announced. 
Dikshit had led McKinsey's unsecured lending practice in North America and been a lead partner advising Goldman, prosecutors said.
The married father of two young children will be deported after serving his sentence. A native of India, Dikshit had lived in the United States for more than a decade. 
""This conviction shows Wall Street and Main Street that corporate advisors who steal information entrusted to them anduse it for their personal gain will be caught and prosecuted,""U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan said in a statement. 
Lawyers for Dikshit did not immediately respond to requestsfor comment. 

GreenSky's share price rose 53% on the day the merger wasannounced. Goldman announced on March 29 that it had completed the merger. The bank was not charged or accused of wrongdoing. 
The case is U.S. v. Dikshit, U.S. District Court, SouthernDistrict of New York, No. 21-cr-00760.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday, with steep declines in tech and other growth stocks, after minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting sharpened investors' focus on the U.S. central bank's plans to fight inflation.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq logged a decline of over 2% for a second straight day.
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting showed policymakers rallying around plans to cut the central bank's massive balance sheet as soon as next month.
Wall Street's main indexes already had been solidly lower ahead of the minutes' release, building on declines from a day earlier when Fed Governor Lael Brainard's comments raised concerns about more aggressive Fed action to fight inflation.
""The Fed is determined to rein in inflation, and we just hope and pray that there will there will be a soft landing of the economy and not a hard landing that sends us into a recession,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 144.67 points, or 0.42%, to 34,496.51, the S&P 500 lost 43.97 points, or 0.97%, to 4,481.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 315.35 points, or 2.22%, to 13,888.82. 
The technology and consumer discretionary sectors both fell about 2.6%, while the S&P 500 growth index dropped about 2%. 
Defensive sectors gained, led by a 2% rise for utilities and a 1.6% increase for healthcare and real estate.
Wall Street's indexes already had been down sharply for a second straight day before the closely watched minutes, as investors continued to digest Brainard's remarks from Tuesday.
Brainard said she expected a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.
""She is one of the more dovish members of the FOMC and so for her to come out as aggressively in stamping out inflation pressures with really more aggressive rate tightening and policies, I think that took the market off guard a little bit and I think you are seeing that continue today,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise.
The prospect of a more hawkish Fed led to a rocky start to the year for equities, and in particular tech and growth shares whose valuations are more vulnerable to higher bond yields. The Ukraine crisis has added to concerns, particularly about worsening inflation as commodity prices spike.
In company news, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) shares fell 8.7% as it mounted a vigorous defense of its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid to acquire ultra-low-cost carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE).
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.56-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 202 new lows.
About 12.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 13 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government has severed banking and trade ties with Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but a tobacco company in which it owns a one-third stake is still operating there and churning out Winston and Camel brand cigarettes. The government's inaction on  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) Inc's puts the administration in an awkward position as it steps up sanctions. 
Here's what's at stake:
WHY IS RUSSIA SO IMPORTANT TO JAPAN TOBACCO?
Japan's population is shrinking, and domestic smoking rates are declining, making revenue overseas increasingly important for Japan Tobacco (JT).
Russia, the world's fourth-biggest tobacco market, is JT's biggest overseas market, generating an estimated 12% of group revenue and 20% of operating profit. JT has the largest market share in Russia at almost 40%, with 4,000 employees in four factories, producing brands including Winston, Camel, and Mevius, formerly known as Mild Seven.
HOW HAS JT REACTED TO RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE?
JT said soon after the invasion that it had halted production at its factory in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, saying at the time that its 900 employees were safe.
Last month, the company said its Russian subsidiary would suspend investment, marketing, and the launch of a heated tobacco product. But it said manufacturing would continue, although those activities could be suspended amid ""unprecedented"" challenges.
Other Japanese companies are taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach as well. Trading houses Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp are holding on to stakes in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia, from which Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc has announced plans to exit.
WHY IS THIS A POLITICAL HOT POTATO FOR THE GOVERNMENT?
Japan has joined with Group of Seven economies in a steady escalation of sanctions to try to pressure Russia to end hostilities.
But its stance has come in for criticism; on the one hand it says it stands by Ukraine, but on the other hand it controls a major company doing business in Russia and reaps a large portion of the profits of that enterprise.
JT is one of Russia's biggest individual tax payers, accounting for 1.4% of the nation's total budget revenue in 2020, the company's website says.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INVESTORS?
JT's shares have sunk more than 5% since Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, as business prospects in the region darken. The benchmark Nikkei index has gained 5%.
The company's shares have lagged the broader market's performance for the last five years, but remain popular among investors for their ample dividends. JT pays out about 75% of profits compared to an average 30% among other Japanese companies. That provides about 100 billion yen ($815 million) to the Japanese government each year, based on Reuters estimates over the past three years.
WHAT NEXT?
JT is the third-biggest tobacco seller in the world and some analysts believe it will have to exit Russia eventually as other major brands pull out. Rivals British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) and Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) have announced their intention to exit the country.
Such a decision doesn't come without risk though. The company could face huge losses if Russia decides to seize its assets, so a less risky option would be to sell its assets to a Russian partner.
Even if JT stays on, trade sanctions could interrupt its business, especially if it isn't able to import tobacco leaves.
WHY IS JAPAN IN THE TOBACCO BUSINESS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

JT is a legacy company from Japan's history of government-controlled monopolies in tobacco and salt. The company operates a museum in Tokyo dedicated to the history of those commodities in Japan.
JT in its current form was founded in 1985, and while the government has reduced its stake over time, the Ministry of Finance is mandated to hold at least one-third of its shares in a business that the government sees as important for fiscal revenues and the wider economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House held a classified briefing on Wednesday with some U.S. lawmakers on the dire risks to the American economy from semiconductor supply chain issues as it pushes Congress for $52 billion in funding to subsidize production. 
White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told reporters ""the best estimates are the lack of available semiconductors probably took a full percentage point off of GDP in 2021.""
The briefing included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to ""discuss the urgent need to invest in made-in-America semiconductors as well as research and development that will protect our economic and national security,"" the White House said. 
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production. There have been growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors.
""A significant interruption to our supply of semiconductors could cause historic damage to the U.S. economy – damage far greater than the impact of chips shortages on the American auto industry right now – and would undercut our technological competitiveness and military advantages over adversaries globally,"" the White House said.
The White House has been pushing Congress to approve U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing after months of discussions.
The Senate first passed $52 billion in chips funding in June that also authorized $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China, while the House of Representatives passed its version in early February. Deese said he hopes both the Senate and House will appoint negotiators this week to ""quickly"" begin a formal process to finalize a compromise bill.
""The risks are profound,"" Deese said of what would the U.S. economy face with a severe disruption. Deese cited ""economic moves by key competitors - most notably China around the escalating vulnerabilities we have from the semiconductor issue.""
A Commerce Department analysis that was prepared for the briefing seen by Reuters noted semiconductor fabs take years to construct.
""There is no quick fix in the face of emergency,"" it said, adding private sector investment in U.S. chips production is not enough and ""will not be sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the current U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities.""

The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
The Biden administration notes the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips in 1990 while today it accounts for only 12% of global production.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed legislation to provide the U.S. Postal Service with about $50 billion in financial relief over a decade, paving the way for future reforms as the service aims to overturn years in the red.
Struggling with diminishing mail volumes despite having to deliver to a growing number of addresses, USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. In February, it booked a quarterly net loss of $1.5 billion.
""The Postal Service is central to our economy and central to rural America,"" Biden said at a White House ceremony.
The new bill enacts some measures proposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in a March 2021 reform plan that aims to eliminate $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade.
In particular, it eliminates a requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a condition faced by no other business or federal entity, saving $27 billion over a decade. Future postal retirees must now enroll in government health insurance, a move that will save it $22.6 billion over 10 years.
On the day of the signing, USPS filed notice with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) to raise prices of first-class mail stamps from 58 cents to 60 cents and raise First-Class Mail prices approximately 6.5%.
Asked in an interview why USPS was seeking the price hike, DeJoy was blunt: ""Because we need money.""
Even after the legislative changes and PRC pricing changes approved in 2021, USPS still needs to cut more red ink, he said, speaking after the White House event.
""I've still got about $80, $90 billion to do and we have a lot of plans to keep moving that forward,"" DeJoy said. ""Now it's really about improving our service, reducing our cost from waste, investing in our facilities and employees and growing our business.""
Biden last month also proposed $5 billion for USPS to handle election mail over the next decade. His predecessor Donald Trump criticized voting by mail that was used by a record 46% of 2020 voters.
""The Postal Service delivers democracy,"" Biden said on Wednesday.

Still, the postal service has faced criticism from the White House and Democrats in Congress over a decision to buy mostly fossil fuel powered vehicles for its next-generation delivery fleet from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense.
USPS ""needs to do more to modernize and electrify its fleet of vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to save money,"" Biden said.

The move, which is reported to be in its early stages, comes as Meta grows its focus on services centered around the metaverse, a virtual environment where people interact, work and play.
If implemented, it could also give Meta a new revenue channel and control over transactions in its suite of apps and services, which include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, WhatsApp and the Meta Quest virtual reality platform.
Meta's cryptocurrencies, internally dubbed ""Zuck Bucks"", are intended for the metaverse and may not be based on blockchain, the FT report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Meta could introduce in-app tokens that would be centrally controlled by the company, the report said, and such tokens could be used to pay favorite creators on Instagram or reward people who make meaningful contributions in Facebook groups.
""We have no updates to share today,"" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that the company is focused on building for the metaverse ""and that includes what payments and financial services might look like.""

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, said last month that Instagram will introduce non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the ""near-term"".
Earlier this year, Meta joined the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a group of companies led by Jack Dorsey's Block Inc that has pledged to promote open access to cryptocurrency technologies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackBerry Ltd plans to settle a more than eight-year-old lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by inflating the success and profitability of its long-discontinued BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) 10 smartphones.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court granted a Wednesday request by lawyers for BlackBerry and the shareholders to adjourn their planned trial so they could negotiate a preliminary settlement in the class action.
Jury selection had been scheduled to begin on Thursday. Any settlement would require the judge's approval.
Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. BlackBerry and its law firm did not immediately respond to similar requests.
While the BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, it never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones.
This led to BlackBerry's 2016 decision to stop making phones. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company now focuses on cybersecurity.
Shareholders accused BlackBerry of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013, resulting in an inflated share price.
The lawsuit began in October 2013. Other defendants include Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins, former Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka and former Chief Legal Officer Steve Zipperstein.
Lawsuits accusing companies of misleading shareholders are common in the United States, but few go to trial.

From 1997 to 2021, less than 1% of federal securities class actions went to trial, while most were settled or dismissed, according to Cornerstone Research.
The case is Pearlstein v BlackBerry Ltd, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07060.

MILAN (Reuters) -Atlantia found itself at the centre of a potential bidding war on Wednesday between Spanish tycoon Florentino Perez and the Benettons, the Italian infrastructure group's main investor.
Perez's construction company ACS said it was interested in buying Atlantia's motorway concessions business, teaming up with two investment funds.
But Italy's Benetton family, investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and other long-time investors such as Italian banking foundation CRT were studying a counter-move to buy the whole infrastructure company and shield it from the attack led by the Spanish billionaire, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Atlantia has just finalised a deal to sell its controlling stake in Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia and will pocket 8 billion euros by end-June from a consortium led by Italy's state lender CDP.
""The Benettons are united to shield the group and may decide to delist it to protect the cash due to arrive from Autostrade deal,"" one of the sources said. 
In a statement after the market close, ACS said it has an exclusive agreement with two investment funds, GIP and Brookfield, for the potential acquisition of a majority stake in the motorway concession business of the Italian infrastructure company.
""No decision has been taken to date"", ACS said in the statement where it did not clarify if it has discussed the eventual offer with Atlantia's board or main shareholders, the Benetton family.
""Atlantia is and will remain a strategic long-term asset for Benetton Holding Edizione"", a source close to the Benetton family told Reuters. 
Earlier on Wednesday, shares in Atlantia surged almost 9% after a Bloomberg News report that Spanish tycoon Perez was weighing an offer for the Italian roads and airports group.
Any bid for Atlantia, which has a market capitalisation of more than 15 billion euros ($16.4 billion), would need the backing of Edizione, the holding company of the Benetton family, which recently increased its stake in the group to 33%. 
Atlantia was not immediately available for comment.
Alessandro Benetton was appointed chairman of Edizione this year, tightening the family's grip on its investments, including at Atlantia. Edizione said at the time it deemed its investment in Atlantia strategic.
EXISTING TIES
Perez, the president of Real Madrid soccer club, and the Benettons are already linked through their joint ownership of Spanish highway operator Abertis.
Perez's ACS, which itself has a market capitalisation of 7.2 billion euros, has been Atlantia's partner in Abertis since the two groups' joint acquisition of the company in 2017.
As well as motorways, Atlantia also operates airports in Rome and southern France and is investing in technology to help regulate traffic flows.

Through ACS, Perez previously pursued a bid for Atlantia's Italian motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia but did not manage to secure the backing of the Italian government to go ahead with a binding offer. 
Atlantia eventually sold the unit, the focal point of a dispute with the government following a deadly collapse of a bridge in 2018, to Italian state lender CDP and allies. Following the divestment, Atlantia kept highway assets in Spain, France and Latin America. ($1 = 0.9168 euros)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock indexes fell on Wednesday and the U.S dollar surged to a nearly two-year peak, after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its last meeting that reinforced views the central bank may tighten aggressively to curb inflation.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose, but was off its session high after the minutes, while oil prices fell sharply on the day.
Trading was choppy on Wall Street following the minutes, with stocks briefly paring losses and then extending them. The Nasdaq ended down more than 2%, leading declines among the major indexes.
""There's nothing new here from what I see... But clearly we've got rate hikes ahead of us, and we have a shrinking balance sheet ahead of us,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.
""The Fed is determined to rein in inflation, and we just hope and pray that there will be a soft landing of the economy and not a hard landing that sends us into a recession.""
According to minutes of the March 15-16 policy meeting, Fed officials ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings as another tool in the fight against surging inflation, even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase.
In March, the Fed raised rates for the first time since 2018 and pivoted away from an easy monetary policy during the coronavirus pandemic.
The United States imposed more sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, as Russian forces bombarded cities in Ukraine.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 144.67 points, or 0.42%, to 34,496.51, the S&P 500 lost 43.97 points, or 0.97%, to 4,481.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 315.35 points, or 2.22%, to 13,888.82.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.53% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.22%.
In the Treasury market, the yield on the 2-year note, which moves with rate hike expectations, was little changed on the day after rising and falling about 8 bps in each direction. The 10-year yield held most of the session's gains, and the 2-10 yield curve steepened.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was last up 5.5 basis points to 2.609% while the 2-year note yield was unchanged at 2.504%, leaving the 2-10 curve at 10.28 basis points, after starting the week inverted.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against six major currencies, climbed to 99.7780, its strongest level in nearly two years. It was last up 0.1% at 99.588.
Europe's single currency benefited earlier from strong euro zone producer prices for February, which surged 31.4% year-on-year in February.
The euro was last slightly down at $1.0896, after briefly touching a nearly one-month low of $1.0874.

Oil futures fell sharply as the dollar rose after the Fed minutes and as the oil market girded for member states of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to release 120 million barrels from strategic reserves to quell price gains.
Brent crude futures settled down $5.57, or 5.2%, at $101.07 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell $5.73, or 5.6%, to $96.23 a barrel.

The first ads will air on Thursday during Major League Baseball's opening-day games, following Monday's resumption of Bolt production at its plant in Orion Township, Michigan. 
Bolt could finish with the second highest media spend this year for Chevy behind the Silverado pickup, Chevy marketing director Steven Majoros said on a conference call, without disclosing detailed spending plans. GM spent $3.3 billion on advertising and promotions last year.
The Bolt ads shown to reporters on the call did not address the recall, which Majoros said had not damaged GM's reputation.
He forecast record sales for Bolt this year and even more in 2023, topping the previous high of 23,300.
GM had previously stopped sales and widened its recall to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules after a series of fires in parked vehicles. It said in August it had recalled all Bolt vehicles built since production began in 2017.
The Detroit automaker had conducted two weeks of limited production at Orion in November to provide courtesy transportation vehicles for customers during recall repairs.
U.S. safety regulators said they had reviewed reports of 24 Bolt fires, while GM previously said it suspected 18 fires were linked to the battery issue. 
GM previously said its deal with LG Electronics and LG Chem, which owns GM's battery partner LG energy Solution, allowed it to offset most of the estimated $2 billion in recall costs.

On Tuesday, U.S. safety regulators said they had opened a review to ensure all defective batteries produced by LG Energy Solution had been recalled by automakers.

(Reuters) -Levi Strauss & Co quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, helped by price increases and strong demand for its jeans, tops and jackets as more people venture out and attend social events.
Shares of the jeans maker, which reaffirmed its revenue and profit forecast for 2022, rose about 2% in extended trading.
Levi has benefited from price increases aimed at mitigating the impact of supply chain disruptions, inventory shortages and inflationary pressures, while an accelerating trend for high-rise jeans and loose-fitting clothes has also helped drive sales in companies such as Levi and Wrangler.
Double-digit sales growth in every market helped the company offset some of the headwinds, and more full-price sales and lower promotions boosted the company's performance, Telsey Advisory Group retail analyst Dana Telsey said.
Levi first-quarter revenue rose 21.8% to $1.59 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

The San Francisco-based company's net income for the quarter ended Feb. 27 rose to $195.8 million, or 48 cents per share, from $142.5 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, Levi earned 46 cents per share, above estimates of 42 cents per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated two new commissioners to serve at the nation's securities regulator in a move that will help the agency regain its full strength amid vacancies. 
The two Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hopefuls would first need to be confirmed in the Senate before they can assume office.
Jaime Lizárraga has been nominated to fill a Democratic seat currently occupied by commissioner Allison Lee, who has said she plans to leave the agency once a successor is in place.
Mark Uyeda, an SEC staffer who has been temporarily on detail to the Senate Banking Committee, has been tapped to replace a January vacancy created by former Republican commissioner Elad Roisman.
Biden's nominations of the new SEC officials would bring the five-member commission to a full voting capacity and Democrats would maintain an even larger majority. 

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, applauded the selection of Lizarraga. ""As Commissioner, Jaime will be a force in safeguarding the interests of the investing public, improving transparency in our financial markets and building a more equitable financial future for all,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in hedging to protect against aggressive Federal Reserve tightening has caused liquidity problems in the interest rate options sector, reflecting a trend that has been going on in some parts of the bond market. 
Strong demand has hoisted volatility on so-called swaptions, or options on interest rate swaps, which give the buyer the right to enter into a contract in the future at a pre-determined price. Swaptions are one segment of the roughly $490 trillion over-the-counter interest rate derivatives market.
Volatility or ""vol"" is a key measure of how much risk is perceived, and is a major input in the price of an option. Demand for options for hedging or speculation tends to lift vol and the higher the vol, the greater the perceived uncertainty over a given time frame. 
In rate markets, swaps, a gauge of the cost of exchanging fixed-rate cash flows for floating-rate ones over a specific period, are often used by investors to bet on where Fed policy rates are headed.
The surge in hedging in the swaptions market has come from fixed-income investors and equity portfolio managers who would normally not hedge using rate options, market participants said. They have been doing so in the last few months since the Fed shifted its stance on inflation and telegraphed that it would soon start tightening, which it did for the first time in 3-1/2 years last month.
Analysts said the appetite for rate options increased further after Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the National Association for Business Economics on March 21 that the Fed must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched.
""Equity managers understood very well the risks of a tighter Fed and tighter financial conditions to portfolios and found a decent hedge in the rates vol space,"" said Bruno Braizinha, director, U.S. rates strategy, at BoFA Securities in New York.
""Not only did equity guys buy vol, they bought directional vol. That created a bit of a one-way market - you have rates clients buying that vol and you have equity clients buying that vol as well,"" he added, which he said caused liquidity issues.
Liquidity has also been an issue in the U.S. Treasuries market, with the spike in yields.
In an illiquid market, the bid-offer spreads on options widen because dealers need to take into account the difficulty in hedging a position.
Traders said investors bought ""payer swaptions"" involving U.S. one-year and two-year swap rates, with expiries from anywhere between six months to two years.
Payer swaptions give the buyer the right to enter into an interest rate swap where the buyer pays fixed rate and receives a floating rate. The buyer therefore benefits if rates rise.
Normalized volatility on shorter-dated swaptions such as one-year at-the-money options on one-year swap rates, that part of the curve in which Fed policy is being priced, soared to 145 basis points on Tuesday, from 110 basis points at the start of March. 
In late March, normalized vol hit 152 basis points, the highest since at least February 2013, according to Refinitiv data. Since Powell's hawkish speech on March 21, vol on one-year swap rates surged about 17 basis points.
""Liquidity tends to be poor when volatility is high,"" said Amrut Nashikkar, managing director and senior rates strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""But then, there's also some contribution the other way, where illiquid markets cause volatility."" (Graphic: Swaption volatility - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxojgmnpx/image-1649216195437.png) 
VOLATILITY SURROUNDING FED'S TERMINAL RATE
That volatility reflects how investors view uncertainty around the Fed's terminal rate, or the peak of the U.S. central bank's rate-hike cycle.
The U.S swaps forward market sees the terminal rate hitting between April 2023 and April 2024 at roughly 3%, based on the one-year and two-year forwards of one-year swap rates, analysts said..
The 145 basis-point volatility on one-year at-the-money options suggested that the terminal rate could hit 3% sometime in the fourth quarter of 2023, but that rate could land at either 1.5% or 4.5%. 
""That's a huge gap to navigate and lot of uncertainty as to where the Fed is going to land over the next year,"" said BoFA's Braizinha, which he said therefore creates the need for protection.
The spike in volatility, though, benefited asset managers like pension funds who bought options for risk management purposes during the pandemic when vol was subdued and premiums were low, as the Fed cut rates to zero. 

""Real money bought a lot of upside protection in the last two years when vol was much, much lower,"" said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Philadelphia.
""They were buying for hedging purposes. But now, it's like they bought lottery tickets and won the lottery.""

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn boosted subscription revenue by 8% after arming its sales team with artificial intelligence software that not only predicts clients at risk of canceling, but also explains how it arrived at its conclusion.
The system, introduced last July and described in a LinkedIn blog post https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/the-journey-to-build-an-explainable-ai-driven-recommendation-sys on Wednesday, marks a breakthrough in getting AI to ""show its work"" in a helpful way.
While AI scientists have no problem designing systems that make accurate predictions on all sorts of business outcomes, they are discovering that to make those tools more effective for human operators, the AI may need to explain itself through another algorithm.
The emerging field of “Explainable AI,” or XAI, has spurred big investment in Silicon Valley as startups and cloud giants compete to make opaque software more understandable and has stoked discussion in Washington and Brussels where regulators want to ensure automated decision-making is done fairly and transparently. 
AI technology can perpetuate societal biases like those around race, gender and culture. Some AI scientists view explanations as a crucial part of mitigating those problematic outcomes.
U.S. consumer protection regulators including the Federal Trade Commission have warned over the last two years that AI that is not explainable could be investigated. The EU next year could pass the Artificial Intelligence Act, a set of comprehensive requirements including that users be able to interpret automated predictions.
Proponents of explainable AI say it has helped increase the effectiveness of AI’s application in fields such as healthcare and sales. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud sells explainable AI services that, for instance, tell clients trying to sharpen their systems which pixels and soon which training examples mattered most in predicting the subject of a photo.
But critics say the explanations of why AI predicted what it did are too unreliable because the AI technology to interpret the machines is not good enough.
LinkedIn and others developing explainable AI acknowledge that each step in the process - analyzing predictions, generating explanations, confirming their accuracy and making them actionable for users - still has room for improvement.
But after two years of trial and error in a relatively low-stakes application, LinkedIn says its technology has yielded practical value. Its proof is the 8% increase in renewal bookings during the current fiscal year above normally expected growth. LinkedIn declined to specify the benefit in dollars, but described it as sizeable. 
Before, LinkedIn salespeople relied on their own intuition and some spotty automated alerts about clients' adoption of services.
Now, the AI quickly handles research and analysis. Dubbed CrystalCandle by LinkedIn, it calls out unnoticed trends and its reasoning helps salespeople hone their tactics to keep at-risk customers on board and pitch others on upgrades. 
LinkedIn says explanation-based recommendations have expanded to more than 5,000 of its sales employees spanning recruiting, advertising, marketing and education offerings.
""It has helped experienced salespeople by arming them with specific insights to navigate conversations with prospects. It’s also helped new salespeople dive in right away,"" said Parvez Ahammad, LinkedIn's director of machine learning and head of data science applied research.
TO EXPLAIN OR NOT TO EXPLAIN?
In 2020, LinkedIn had first provided predictions without explanations. A score with about 80% accuracy indicates the likelihood a client soon due for renewal will upgrade, hold steady or cancel. 
Salespeople were not fully won over. The team selling LinkedIn's Talent Solutions recruiting and hiring software were unclear on how to adapt their strategy, especially when the odds of a client not renewing were no better than a coin toss.
Last July, they started seeing a short, auto-generated paragraph that highlights the factors influencing the score.
For instance, the AI decided a customer was likely to upgrade because it grew by 240 workers over the past year and candidates had become 146% more responsive in the last month. 
In addition, an index that measures a client's overall success with LinkedIn recruiting tools surged 25% in the last three months.
Lekha Doshi, LinkedIn's vice president of global operations, said that based on the explanations sales representatives now direct clients to training, support and services that improve their experience and keep them spending.
But some AI experts question whether explanations are necessary. They could even do harm, engendering a false sense of security in AI or prompting design sacrifices that make predictions less accurate, researchers say.
Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said people use products such as Tylenol and Google Maps whose inner workings are not neatly understood. In such cases, rigorous testing and monitoring have dispelled most doubts about their efficacy.
Similarly, AI systems overall could be deemed fair even if individual decisions are inscrutable, said Daniel Roy, an associate professor of statistics at University of Toronto.
LinkedIn says an algorithm's integrity cannot be evaluated without understanding its thinking. 
It also maintains that tools like its CrystalCandle could help AI users in other fields. Doctors could learn why AI predicts someone is more at risk of a disease, or people could be told why AI recommended they be denied a credit card. 

The hope is that explanations reveal whether a system aligns with concepts and values one wants to promote, said Been Kim, an AI researcher at Google.
""I view interpretability as ultimately enabling a conversation between machines and humans,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Vaccine-related blood clots tied to gene, antibody variants
New research may help shed light on a rare but serious blood-clotting problem associated with the COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). 
Five unrelated people with this clotting complication, known as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, all had unusually-structured antibodies against a protein called PF4 that is involved in blood clotting, the researchers found. Furthermore, all five had a specific version of a gene responsible for producing these antibodies, they reported on Monday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.22272975v1 ahead of peer review. ""The combination of a variant in a gene and the evolution of this antibody towards targeting in a highly deleterious manner the PF4 protein... leads to this disastrous complication,"" the researchers said. The prevalence of this gene varies and is highest in people of European descent, according to the report.
The finding ""paves the way for a potential genetic screening tool to identify patients carrying this gene variant who are at risk of this severe complication"" after receipt of these vaccines, said Tom Gordon and Jing Jing Wang of Flinders University of South Australia, two of the study's authors. ""Additionally, this provides a unique opportunity for targeted, specific therapy development aimed at neutralizing this highly damaging but very specific antibody.""
Concentrated antibodies may help immunosuppressed patients
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are severely immunocompromised may benefit from treatment with a purified, highly-concentrated form of antibody-rich blood plasma from previously infected people known as hyperimmune globulin, according to a small trial.
Netherlands-based researchers measured the need for mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, readmission for COVID-19 after hospital discharge or lack of clinical improvement among 18 subjects four weeks after administration of either SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin or immune globulin that did not contain antibodies to the coronavirus. These adverse outcomes occurred in 20% of patients who received the hyperimmune globulin with COVID-19 antibodies, compared to 88% of those who did not, according to a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.04.22273314v1 ahead of peer review. The trial participants were organ transplant patients taking strong immunosuppressive drugs and others with diseases or medication regimens that impaired the function of immune cells called B cells.
In severely immunocompromised patients, SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin ""may reduce the risk for severe COVID-19 and can be used when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available,"" the researchers concluded.
Glasses wearers may have lower COVID-19 risk
People who regularly wear glasses have a moderately lower risk of contracting COVID-19 while contact lenses offered no added protection, according to a large study that highlights the importance of the eye as a route of coronavirus infection.
More than 19,000 participants in the Virus Watch study in England and Wales responded to a questionnaire on the use of glasses and contact lenses. Starting as early as June 2020, participants had been reporting weekly on their COVID-19 status, and more than 11,000 provided monthly blood samples to show whether or not they had been infected with the coronavirus. After taking other risk factors into account, the researchers found a 15% lower risk of infection for those who reported wearing glasses always for general use compared to those who never wore glasses. The protective effect was reduced in those who said their glasses interfered with mask wearing, and there was no protective effect seen for contact lens wearers, according to a report posted on Monday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.29.22272997v1 ahead of peer review.

""Protective eye wear should be considered as part of broader strategies to prevent community transmission of infection and may be valuable to consider in the event of future pandemics and in high exposure occupations including healthcare,"" the researchers said.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the report.
Amazon has been repeatedly accused of knocking off products it sells on its website and of exploiting its vast trove of internal data to promote its own merchandise at the expense of other sellers. The company has denied the allegations.

Invesitng.com - Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) reported Wednesday first quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates as higher demand offset the impact of the supply chain disruptions.     
Levi Strauss rose 0.5% in afterhours trading following the report. 
Levi reported fiscal Q1 EPS of 46 cents, up from 34 cents a year earlier, as revenue rose to $1.59 billion from $1.31 billion a year earlier. That topped Wall Street forecasts for EPS of 42 cents and revenue of  $1.55 billion. 
The beat on the top and bottom lines come even as the company flagged supply-chain woes that led to $60 million in loss sales. 
But the company said it was building up inventory to offset the supply chain risks and meet demand. 
""Total inventories increased 20% compared to the end of the corresponding prior-year period as the company builds core inventory through the first half of the year to mitigate supply chain risk and capture consumer demand,"" Levi said. 
Looking ahead, the company maintained its guidance for full-year fiscal 2022 EPS in a range of $1.50 to $1.56 on revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion."

While a survey of 7,200 teens showed that 43% consume or are willing to consume plant-based meat, that number declined from 47% in the Fall 2021 survey and 49% in Spring 2021.
Furthermore, out of the 86% of teens surveyed who do not eat plant-based meat, 34% are willing to try it. However, this is another decline from the 38% who said they were willing to try it in Piper's Fall 2021 survey.
When it comes to brand preference, Beyond Meat was the second most mentioned brand with 32%, according to Piper.
Michael Lavery, an analyst at Piper Sandler, reiterated an underweight rating and a $29 price target on Beyond Meat shares, which are down about 25% year-to-date."

Investing.com -- The Dow slipped Wednesday, as tech was pressured by rising Treasury yields after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting signaled that central bank members were in favor of stepping up the pace of the monetary policy tightening next month.
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.42%, or 144 points, the S&P 500 fell 1%, and the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.
The Fed is “well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May,"" the Fed minutes showed on Wednesday.
Under the plan, the Fed would allow about $60 billion in Treasury securities and about $35 billion in agency MBS to roll off its balance sheet, which current stands at nearly $9 trillion.
Fed members also discussed the prospect of 50-basis-point rate hikes at one or more up coming meetings, but this was less hawkish than market expectations of 50 basis points at most meetings. 
""The commentary from the minutes on the 50 basis points hikes was maybe a little less hawkish because we had seen the market price in 50 basis point at several of the meetings or most of the meetings for the rest of the year, but they [Fed members] only discussed one or more 50 basis hikes,"" John Luke Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday. 
""I think that also maybe led to a little bit of softness in the front end of the yield curve,"" Tyner added. 
The 10-year yield topped 2.6% to surged to more than three-year highs, while the 2-year yield, which is more sensative to rate hikes, cut gains to end the day lower.  
Growth sectors of the market like tech, which are less attractive in periods of rising rates and inflation, continued to creep lower, pressuring the broader market.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) led big tech lower, down more than 3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell more than 1%.
Chip stocks also struggled, pressured by a nearly 6% slump in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and weakness in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).
Intel fell 1%, however, after the chipmaker said it would end or scale back operations in Russia following the latter's invasion of Ukraine.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell more than 3% as electric vehicle reportedly doesn’t expect to resume production at its Shanghai factory until at least Friday following a Covid-led shutdown.
On the deal making front, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fell more than 8% a day after the airline’s $3.6 billion takeover bid for rival  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. workers and labor groups filed 57% more petitions to be represented by unions in the last six months as high-profile organizing campaigns at  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other companies have taken off.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) received 1,174 such requests during the first half of its fiscal year 2022, from Oct. 1 through March 31, versus 748 during the first half of fiscal 2021, it said on Wednesday.
If that pace continues for the full year, it would be the highest annual total in at least the last 10 years.
""There is a surge in labor activity nationwide,"" said NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo in a statement.
Baristas at more than 170 U.S. Starbucks locations have asked the NLRB for union elections since August, with at least 10 locations voting in favor of the Workers United union.
And after employees won a vote to form a union at an Amazon warehouse in New York's Staten Island on Friday, workers at 50 more locations across the country contacted organizers.

Once employees petition the NLRB for an election, eligible workers can vote on whether they want to join the union. 
Abruzzo said Congress needed to provide the agency with more staff and funding to handle the growing case loads, which also include an increase in unfair labor practice charges and other filings.

754,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 04:17PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden drew loud applause at a labor event on Wednesday when he turned a spotlight on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) while touting his administration's efforts to promote unions. 
After highlighting a government task force on worker organization he launched a year ago “to make sure the choice to join a union belongs to workers alone,” Biden called out the online retail giant, whose own workers at a New York City warehouse voted last week to unionize.
“And by the way, by the way, Amazon here we come. Watch. Watch,” he said during a speech to the North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) Legislative Conference.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. 
Widely considered the most pro-union president in decades, Biden has swiftly ousted government officials deemed by unions to be hostile to labor and reversed rules of past President Donald Trump that critics said weakened worker protections.
Asked at a briefing with reporters whether Biden was endorsing unionization at Amazon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said he was not sending a message that he or the U.S. government would get involved directly in such efforts.
""What he was conveying is his long-time support for collective bargaining, for the rights of workers to organize, and their decision to do exactly that in this case,"" she said. 
Last week some 55% of workers at a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to form the first U.S. union at Amazon, America's second-largest private employer, building on recent grassroots successes by labor activists pushing into new industries. 
Amazon has said it may file objections, due on Friday, before the election outcome is certified.

Employees at 10 U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) locations have likewise voted to unionize as well.
Biden's task force, which includes more than 20 heads of agencies and Cabinet officials such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, seeks to help reverse decades of declining union membership and power, labor experts said.

Investing.com – Stocks anticipated more aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve as early as May, sending them into a tumble before recovering ground late in the afternoon.
The Fed signaled in its minutes on Wednesday that it was prepared to act more quickly to tighten the reins on the economy to damp inflation. That includes acting to pare down its balance sheet of bonds more quickly than originally anticipated.
The central bank next meets in May, after it has the chance to see another set of jobs and inflation data for the month of April. With Russia’s war on Ukraine throwing uncertainty into the mix, and volatile energy prices, investors will be closely scrutinizing the earnings reports that start rolling out next week from major U.S. companies.
In the meantime, data on jobless claims comes out on Thursday, with the recent trend showing a drop in joblessness not seen since the late 1960s.
The Senate is expected to vote on President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, this week before Congress sets off on a two week Easter holiday. Also pending on Capitol Hill is a $10 billion spending package for Biden’s Covid planning efforts.

Investing.com --  Frontier Group Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:ULCC) said it remains ""committed"" to its combination with  Spirit Airlines  Inc (NYSE:SAVE) after news broke yesterday evening that JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) had made an alternative bid for the carrier. 
In February, Spirit and Frontier announced a combination that would have seen Spirit shareholders receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each existing Spirit share they own.
However, with JetBlue making a bid for Spirit, that move could be scuppered. 
Nevertheless, Frontier remains focused on the merger. In a regulatory filing, the company disclosed a letter sent to employees which said they are confident the proposed transaction ""is in the best interest of consumers and team Frontier.""
""Together we would create America's most competitive airline, offering more ultra-low fares to more travelers in more destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Nothing changes today as a result of this news,"" the letter read.
The company added that the agreement remains in place, but the next steps will see Spirit and Frontier's board of directors review the proposal from JetBlue. "

In letters sent to the chief executives of four of the biggest U.S. consumer banks, James said the majority of overdraft fees are levied on ""the most vulnerable consumers with the lowest average account balances.""
James's letters come as banks are facing increased scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for charging overdraft and other fees on consumers.
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the federal consumer watchdog, launched a campaign earlier this year to address what it calls ""junk fees,"" a catch-all for overdraft, credit card late payment fees, mortgage closing costs and other charges.
The banking industry earned $17 billion in overdraft fee revenue in 2019, according to a report commissioned by the industry group the Consumer Bankers Association. 
In January, the CFPB issued a request for public input on whether banks and companies charge excessive fees on top of their upfront price -- as well as the financial impact of fees on American families -- the deadline for which is April 11. The agency has not yet said how it plans to proceed, however.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America,  Citigroup  and Wells Fargo & Co have stopped charging non-sufficient funds fees - a penalty charged for bounced checks or automated withdrawals that overdraft a customer's account. The banks have also changed their policies on charging overdraft fees, each in different ways.
In her letter, James asked the four banks to eliminate overdraft fees altogether, citing Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) as an example of a bank that eliminated these fees.

The banks did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Last month, a group of U.S. Senate Democrats -- including Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown -- sent letters to seven large banks pressing them to scrap or significantly reduce overdraft and other fees they charge customers. [L2N2VS1GA]

758,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday confirmed that a preliminary investigation linked to tax fraud had been launched into the French arm of US consultancy firm McKinsey by France's national financial prosecution office PNF. 
PNF earlier on Wednesday said launched a tax fraud probe linked to consulting firms without specifying which firms were the target of the preliminary investigation.
""We will know at the end of this judicial investigation if there had been fiscal fraud by this company or not,"" Macron was cited as saying in an interview with paper Le Figaro. 
The use of private consultants by the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has lost momentum in opinion polls ahead of the first round of presidential elections on Sunday, has emerged as a surprise issue in the campaign.
McKinsey said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to respond to all questions that French authorities may have and that it respects French fiscal and social regulations.
""McKinsey's fiscal approach is ... in line with OECD directives and has been shared with the French tax administration,"" the firm said.
The French Senate, which is dominated by the conservatives, in March had launched legal action against McKinsey, alleging that a company executive gave false testimony when he told senators McKinsey was paying corporate taxes in France.
The controversy comes as rivals of President Emmanuel Macron accuse the government of lavishly spending taxpayers' money on international consultancies during its term.
According to a French Senate report last week, French ministries have more than doubled spending on outside consultants from 379 million euros ($417 million) in 2018 to 894 million euros last year.
Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who in the last days ahead of the first vote on Sunday has been gaining momentum, called the controversy a ""state scandal"".
Macron in the Figaro interview denied political responsability for the controvery around the government's hiring of consultancies. 

He said that ""it is not the president who signs the contracts (with consultancies)"", adding ""it is the responsability of the administrations, ministers and service providers.""
According to the latest opinion polls, Macron would beat Marine Le Pen in the country's presidential election later this month, though Le Pen has significantly gained ground.

The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which in June last year upsized its offering from $1.5 billion, did not disclose the reason for the withdrawal.
Spinning Eagle joins a slew of companies which have canceled offerings this year at a time when volatility in the U.S. market has jumped due to rate hike concerns, geopolitical tensions and a sell-off in technology stocks. 
Last year, another blank-check vehicle backed by Sloan and Sagansky agreed to take biotech firm Ginkgo public at a $17.5 billion valuation. Ginkgo shares have shed over 50% of their market capitalization so far this year. 
Investor sentiment around the alternative route to list that had taken Wall Street by storm in 2020, has recently seen a pullback in interest, and heightened regulatory scrutiny after shares of several companies which merged with SPACs tumbled after going public.

(Reuters) -JetBlue Airways Corp on Wednesday mounted a vigorous defense of its unsolicited $3.6 billion bid to acquire ultra-low-cost carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), saying the company is ""highly confident"" of securing regulatory approval for the deal.
The New York-based carrier on Tuesday surprised Wall Street with a $33 per share cash offer, potentially derailing a $2.7 billion merger plan between Spirit and Frontier Group Holdings Inc.
Frontier on Wednesday said it remained committed to its merger with Spirit as that would create the country's ""most competitive"" airline and offer more ultra-low fares to consumers. 
JetBlue's proposed deal is widely expected to attract close antitrust scrutiny from President Joe Biden's administration, which has taken a tough stance against mergers that may reduce competition and increase prices for consumers.
The carrier said while it expects a lengthy regulatory process, it is counting on its track record of lowering fares and increasing competition to get the nod.
""We are convinced... that average fares come down more when JetBlue flies into a legacy market than when an ultra-low-cost carrier does,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes told investors on a call.
Some analysts, however, are not sure the administration will buy the argument that the acquisition would translate into lower consumer costs as JetBlue's fares are higher than Spirit's. JetBlue also has plans to remove some seats on Spirit's planes.
White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese on Wednesday declined to comment on JetBlue's bid, but said the Biden administration takes ""very seriously"" the impact of industry consolidation.
JetBlue and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc are already facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice over their Northeastern Alliance.
The partnership, announced in July 2020, allows the carriers to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs in a move aimed at helping them better compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.
Hayes said the company would not sacrifice the Northeastern Alliance in order to secure regulatory approval for the Spirit deal.
COSTS & BENEFITS
Analysts are also questioning the benefits of JetBlue's Spirit bid. 
Raymond James downgraded the company's stock, calling its offer for Spirit an ""indecent proposal.""
While both carriers have fleets dominated by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), any potential cost savings from the deal will be diluted by JetBlue's need to bump up the pay of Spirit pilots, who are on a lower band, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, said, adding that execution risk is higher in JetBlue's proposed deal than for the potential Spirit-Frontier merger.
JetBlue does expect higher labor costs as a result of the deal. But it said the transaction would result in certain economies of scale, producing savings of $600 million to $700 million within three years. It also expects the transaction to be accretive to its earnings in the first year.

The company committed to maintain compensation and benefits for Spirit employees for at least 12 months. 
Shares of Spirit were off 1.7% at $26.45 in afternoon trade, suggesting investors were skeptical of the deal going through. JetBlue stock was down 8%, while Frontier was off nearly that much.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum (Amplats) has received enquiries from manufacturers and carmakers seeking palladium in the wake of Western sanctions on top producer Russia, CEO Natascha Viljoen said on Wednesday. 
Palladium users with no existing contracts with the company have contacted Amplats about ""potential alternative sources of palladium"", Viljoen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the PGMs Industry Day, a platinum group metals (PGMs) mining conference in Johannesburg. 
Uncertainty is causing ""desperation"" in the market as metal consumers try to pin down reliable supply, Viljoen said.
Russia produces 25-30% of the world's supply of palladium, a metal used by automakers in engine exhausts to reduce emissions.
""Where we can accommodate them [new customers] after looking after our long-term customers, we will obviously try as much as possible,"" Viljoen said, adding however that ""we can't make any firm commitments"".
Miners typically utilize long-term contracts, making surplus supply scarce. 
It would take at least five years for South African palladium to ramp up to replace Russian production of the metal, and it may never fully get there, Viljoen said. 
Russian metal can reach the market through other avenues, like China, so the supply chain is likely to shift rather than Russian supply fully stopping, she said.

Instead, the sanctions on Russia may result in a premium on South African palladium, while there may be a discount on palladium being sold into China, Viljoen said.
The world's biggest producer of primary platinum group metals (PGMs), Amplats produced 4.3 million ounces of PGMs in 2021.

""We are thrilled to welcome Main Event to the Dave & Buster's family,"" said Kevin Sheehan, board chair and interim CEO. ""This is a transformational combination for both brands.""
Once the deal is closed, the companies expect $20 million in cost savings from store support and supply chain efficiencies during the first two years. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) said Tuesday it made an unsolicited $3.6 billion bid for  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), potentially snarling merger plans between the ultra-low-cost carrier and Frontier Group Holdings.
JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said the deal would make the New York-based airline a stronger competitor to the so-called four legacy U.S. airlines that control nearly 80% of the U.S. passenger market.
""The number one complaint we get is why don't you fly to more places,"" Hayes said in a Reuters interview late Tuesday. ""What we want to do is create a bigger JetBlue"" that can serve more consumers.
JetBlue, the sixth largest U.S. passenger carrier, would operate Spirit under the JetBlue brand and he does not think any divestitures are needed.
The move comes as airlines face higher fuel and labor costs, and work to attract more leisure travelers, who have returned at a faster rate than business travelers since pandemic restrictions were relaxed.
JetBlue offered $33 a share all cash, about 33% higher than Frontier's offer of 1.9126 shares of stock and $2.13 in cash, which would value Spirit at $24.93 per share as of Tuesday's closing price.
Shares of Spirit closed up 22% at $26.92, their highest level since mid-February. Sprit's 52-week high is $39.19. Just before COVID-19 lockdowns became widespread, Spirit shares traded around $45.
Spirit declined to comment beyond a written statement that it would review the offer.
Hayes said he expects a vigorous antitrust review from the U.S. Justice Department that could last into 2023.
""We've had unprecedented amounts of consolidation, which the DOJ has approved and now it's about how do we make sure the rest of us can continue to discipline the legacy carriers and create that competition,"" Hayes said. ""We believe ultimately this is the best deal out there that is going to really drive more competition.""
Andre Barlow of Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC said the Biden administration ""is concerned about consolidation that could lead to higher prices. This one impacts consumers, so I think it gets a tough look.""
The Justice Department declined to comment.
The department filed an antitrust lawsuit last September against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports. Hayes said JetBlue is ""very committed"" to its alliance with American regardless of whether it was successful in acquiring Spirit. 
Hayes said he expects the litigation over the American Airlines alliance will be completed before the Spirit deal review is completed.
He is speaking with analysts and reporters on an 8 a.m ET call Wednesday to tout the proposal that he says would boost operations in key markets such as Florida and access to constrained hub airports like Atlanta, Detroit, Miami and Chicago. 
Meanwhile, Frontier said it was ""surprising that JetBlue would consider such a merger at this time given that the Department of Justice is currently suing to block their pending alliance with American Airlines."" American did not immediately comment. 
JetBlue said the deal if completed is expected to deliver $600 million-$700 million in net annual synergies and that the combined airline is projected to have annual revenue of about $11.9 billion based on 2019 revenue.
Frontier said its Spirit offer ""is in the best interest of consumers and shareholders and would deliver $1 billion in annual savings for consumers"" and argued ""significant East Coast overlap between JetBlue and Spirit would reduce competition and limit options for consumers."" 
In February, Frontier and Spirit proposed a merger that would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline. 
Spirit's customer service has often faced criticism and the airline canceled 35% of its flights Monday amid weather issues.

""We don't think customers should have to choose between a low fare and a good experience - they should have both,"" said Hayes, noting JetBlue's presence in markets typically prompts larger airlines to lower airfares in what he called the ""JetBlue Effect."" But larger carriers do not always lower fares to match prices from ultra-low cost carriers like Spirit or Frontier. 
The Spirit-Frontier deal faced criticism from some lawmakers and public interest groups warned in March that a merger between the carriers ""would destroy competition in the only competitive market segment of the highly consolidated airline industry.""

772,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 12:41PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament has passed in a third and final reading on Wednesday a bill on delisting of companies that are registered in Russia and have depositary receipts traded on foreign bourses.
Their depositary receipts will be converted into equities traded in Russia, the bill showed.
Several major Russian companies have listings abroad, which has always been a matter of prestige for them. But since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, Western bourses have halted trading of Russian securities.
The new bill obliges companies that are registered in Russia and have foreign listings to take steps to dissolve agreements that allow trading of depositary receipts outside Russia. 
""It is not allowed to place and/or organise the circulation of shares of Russian issuers outside the Russian Federation by placing, in accordance with foreign law, securities of foreign issuers that are certifying rights in respect of shares of Russian issuers,"" the bill published on the Duma website said.
The bill will not affect companies with Russian roots that carried out initial public offerings (IPOs) on foreign exchanges, such as  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) or TCS Group.
Lawmakers approved the bill after the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in the depositary receipts -- which represent shares in a foreign company -- of Russian companies in early March after prices crashed to record lows.
In London, depositary receipts in Russia's largest lender Sberbank fell to almost zero days after Russian sent thousands of its troops to Ukraine.
In Moscow, Sberbank shares in Moscow rose 8% to 141.6 roubles ($1.77) per piece in the past 10 trading days after Moscow Exchange gradually resumed trading following a nearly month-long hiatus.
The new bill needs to be approved by the upper house of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law.

The central bank said last month Russian stock exchanges will keep listings of securities of foreign companies with Russian roots even if they delist from foreign bourses.

PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus delivered between 140 and 142 aircraft in the first quarter, up almost 13% from the same period last year, industry sources said on Wednesday.
Airbus declined comment ahead of monthly orders and deliveries data due on Friday.
The figures imply March deliveries of some 62 jets, at least some of which came from long-term storage, the sources said.
Airbus is in the midst of planned production increases of single-aisle jets, but faces growing concern over manufacturing supply chains.
Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie this week estimated total quarterly deliveries of 139 aircraft but said ""production challenges"" and demand were under scrutiny.
According to an Airbus court filing connected to a legal dispute with Qatar Airways, as of March the planemaker was producing 50 narrowbodies a month, including 27 A321neos.
It plans to increase this to 61 a month by end-2022 of which 33 will be A321neos, the filing said, adding that the planemaker ultimately aims to raise production above 70 a month by 2025.
""This is clearly a challenging target, and the pressure on suppliers to keep pace is high,"" it said.
Airbus has so far publicly committed to raising output to 65 a month by the summer of 2023, without giving interim steps.
It has said it is asking suppliers to be ready for output of 70 a month by the first quarter of 2024, if a decision to raise output again is taken, while exploring rates up to 75 by 2025.
QATAR DISPUTE
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in February Airbus was on a trajectory to reach 65 a month by summer next year. Higher rates beyond 2023 were ""still in the assessment phase"".
Analysts say production of the larger wide-body A350, which competes in the weaker long-haul market, remains uncertain though Airbus this week reiterated its guidance.
Bloomberg News reported this week that Airbus may delay a planned increase in A350 production because of Russian sanctions and the dispute with Qatar Airways, which is refusing to take A350s in a row over damage to the surface of the jets.
Airbus has begun efforts to remarket some of the A350s at the centre of the dispute to new customers including Air India, industry sources said. 
Airbus declined to comment. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Airbus has more than 20 A350s on order from Qatar Airways but is revoking them one by one as the airline rejects delivery on safety grounds. So far, three A350s have been cancelled by Airbus, which says there is no safety issue.

Qatar is suing Airbus for $1 billion of A350 compensation, with Airbus making a counter-claim to claw back millions of dollars of credits connected to the original A350 contract.
The two sides will square off in court on Thursday when Qatar Airways will seek to freeze an Airbus decision to revoke a separate contact to supply A321neos. The feuding firms disagree on whether deals for the two models are contractually linked.

The United States on Wednesday announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions, as well as Kremlin officials and their family members, in response to what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The new sanctions hit Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfa Bank, the country's fourth largest financial institution, U.S. officials said. But energy transactions were exempted from the latest measures, the officials said.
U.S. Treasury said transactions with Sberbank and Alfa Bank need to wind down through April 12 and May 5, respectively.
""The sanctions will not have a significant impact on the bank's operations and will not affect service to Russians as the system has already adapted to the previous restrictions,"" Sberbank said in a statement.
Shares in Sberbank tumbled on the Moscow Exchange after the sanctions were announced and ended the day 8.1% lower at 141.60 roubles ($1.79) per piece.
Washington said earlier on Wednesday that energy transactions will be exempted from the sanctions on Sberbank.
Alfa Bank said it will temporarily halt transactions in U.S. dollars with its counterparts but will continue transactions in roubles, euros and other currencies.
An Alfa Bank representative told Reuters it was not immediately clear what would happen to U.S. dollar accounts that its clients had with the bank.

(Reuters) - European equity funds faced their first monthly outflow in two years in March as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising energy prices hurt prospects for profit growth and margins this year. 
According to Refinitiv Lipper, European equity funds witnessed an outflow of $27 billion last month, their first outflow since March 2020.

At the same time, U.S. equity funds received $20 billion, and Asian equity funds obtained $8.7 billion in March, the data showed. 
The divergence in flows highlights investors' reluctance to be exposed to markets deemed vulnerable to the ongoing conflict and on account of Europe's higher trade links with Russia and Ukraine. 
Analysts expect higher inflation levels will raise companies' input costs and squeeze their profit margins.
Euro zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March, as the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel and natural gas prices to record highs. 
""The growth outlook is slowing,"" Sarah McCarthy, analyst at Bernstein, said in a note. 
""It is easy to raise prices to counteract increases in input costs when the economy is roaring, less easy in a slowdown.""
The data showed Zwitserleven Duurzaam Index Aandelenfonds Europa had outflows worth $912 million, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) European Dynamic A Acc and iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF faced outflows worth $503 million and $468 million respectively last month.
Last month,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lowered its earnings per share growth forecast for Europe to 3% in 2022 from its earlier forecast of 10%. 
""With real GDP growth set to fall below inflation in 2022, margins could fall about 100 basis points this year,"" the brokerage said.

The Japanese automaker's new outlook of 15.5 million vehicles was down from its prior forecast of 16.5 million, Bob Carter, executive vice president of sales for Toyota Motor North America, said on a conference call.
""The supply-chain challenges that we're seeing ... will remain with us for a while,"" he said.
The global auto industry had already been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shortage of semiconductor chips even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine snarled parts of the supply chain and contributed to soaring prices of raw materials such as aluminum and nickel.
Carter said the U.S. industry's sales rate in the first quarter was an annualized 14.3 million, but he is ""reasonably confident"" in the new forecast. However, he said there is a ""downside scenario"" of 14.9 million to 15 million sales if the supply chain struggles continue.
Carter emphasized that the U.S. sales outlook is not based on demand as a sales rate in the mid-16 million range could be achieved if automakers could build that many vehicles.
""That is an adjustment that quite frankly is not based on consumer demand,"" he said. ""It's based solely on what our projections of the supply environment is going to be."" 
Carter said Toyota expects U.S. sales this year for its Toyota and Lexus brands to finish at about 2.35 million vehicles.
While Carter expects some of the higher raw material costs to be passed on to consumers, he does not see vehicle affordability being an issue this year. He said it will take six months for inventory rates to normalize after the supply chain recovers.

Toyota's day's supply of vehicles in the U.S. now stands at less than two versus an historic rate of 40 to 45 days. He expects that to recover to 30 days as the supply chain recovers.
""The vehicles are being sold literally before they are built,"" he said.

Investing.com – Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock traded 2% higher Wednesday, a day after Stifel upgraded it to ‘buy’ with a 12-month target of $84, more than 43% higher than the high of $58.52 so far in today’s session.
Even after more than a 120% rise in the last year due to record-high crude prices, Stifel analyst Michael Scialla believes the stock is attractively priced owing to an under-appreciated low carbon business.
The stock has attracted much attention lately after billionaire Warren Buffett came to acquire more than 13% of the company.
“An emerging low carbon business centered around direct air capture is largely underappreciated, in our view, due to its reliance on voluntary and compliance offset markets for hard to abate emissions and the consensus opinion that it will generate low returns,” he wrote in the report, according to StreetInsider.
According to Scialla, the pace of offset market expansion could surprise investors while the improvement in enhanced oil recovery resources and margins positively impacts direct air capture economics.
A rapidly deleveraging balance sheet and share repurchase program should also support the stock, he wrote."

San Francisco (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) unit Woven Planet has joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in trying to advance self-driving technology without expensive sensors such as lidars. 
Woven Planet told Reuters it is able to use low-cost cameras to collect data and effectively train its self-driving system, a ""breakthrough"" that it hopes will help drive down costs and scale up the technology. 
Gathering diverse driving data using a massive fleet of cars is critical to developing a robust self-driving car system, but it is costly and not scalable to test autonomous vehicles with expensive sensors, it said. 
Tesla has been betting on cameras to collect data from over 1 million vehicles on the road to develop its automated driving technology, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo and other self-driving car firms added expensive sensors like lidars to a small number of vehicles.
""We need a lot of data. And it's not sufficient to just have a small amount of data that can be collected from a small fleet of very expensive autonomous vehicles,"" Michael Benisch, vice president of Engineering at Woven Planet, said in an interview with Reuters. 
""Rather, we're trying to demonstrate that we can unlock the advantage that Toyota and a large automaker would have, which is access to a huge corpus of data, but with a much lower fidelity,"" said Benisch, a former engineering director at  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s self-driving division, which Toyota acquired last year. 
Woven Planet uses cameras that are 90% cheaper than sensors that it used before and can be easily installed in fleets of passenger cars. 
It said using a majority of data coming from low-cost cameras increased its system's performance to a level similar to when the system was trained exclusively on high-cost sensor data. 
He said, however, Toyota would still use multiple sensors such as lidars and radars for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to be deployed on the road, as this currently seemed to be the best, safest approach to developing robotaxis. 
""But in many, many years, it's entirely possible that camera type technology can catch up and overtake some of the more advanced sensors,"" he said.

""The question may be more about when and how long it will take to reach a level of safety and reliability. I don't believe we know that yet."" 
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said it can achieve full autonomy with cameras this year after missing his previous targets several times.

Launched in 2019, the company is operated by BAM Trading services, the U.S. partner of Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange by trading volume. Binance.US and Binance have a licensing agreement but operate as separate legal entities.
Binance.US said RRE Ventures, Foundation Capital, Original Capital, VanEck and Circle Ventures were among the investors that participated in the fundraise, which was its first external funding round.
It added that the funds would be used to invest in its spot trading platform and toward the development of new products and services.
Last month, Binance rejected calls for a blanket ban on all Russian users after Moscow invaded Ukraine.
Its decision last month to stay in Russia, which was a divergence from mainstream finance firms such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Holdings Ltd and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), had irked the Ukrainian government.

Binance has also been trying to deepen links with the United Arab Emirates as the country tries to style itself as the world's new digital assets hub.
The crypto industry continues to face the wrath of regulators internationally, who worry about how a meltdown in crypto assets, seen as highly volatile and opaque, will feed into the wider financial sector, leading to a global push for more regulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union must cut its heavy reliance on derivatives clearing in London in the same way as the bloc is ending its dependency on Russian energy due to the war in Ukraine, EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said on Wednesday.
The EU has agreed to allow clearing houses in Britain, such as the London Stock Exchange's LCH arm, to continue serving banks and asset managers in the bloc until June 2025 to give time to build up clearing capacity inside the EU.
McGuinness said she would propose legislation in October which could include incentives for banks to clear inside the bloc, and disincentives, such as potential capital charges, when clearing in London.
Pension funds and public entities could be required to clear their derivatives in the EU, she added.
""It's time now for Europe, the EU of 27, to make very strong decisions on the financial stability and the financial system, just as we are doing today very critically and very urgently around our over-dependency on energy from Russia,"" McGuinness told a European Central Bank event.
LCH clears the bulk of euro denominated interest rate swaps, long a bone of contention with EU authorities and the European Central Bank, but pressure on banks to voluntarily move clearing from London to Frankfurt has made little headway.
""There is some resistance to change because people say today the system works so why would we change it,"" she said.
The EU must cut overdependence on UK clearers in the medium term to build up its own capital market and avoid threats to financial stability, she said.
""Ideally, I would like this one to happen faster,"" she said, adding that she wants the ""heavy lifting"" done by the time her term as commissioner ends in 2024 to ensure a smooth transition.

Feedback from a public consultation now closed will be used to create a balanced legislative proposal.
""This isn't about us trying to take the business from the United Kingdom... I see this potentially as a win-win for the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" McGuinness said, adding that a stronger EU capital market is good for global markets.

Investing.com -- Mullen Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:MULN) shares have jumped 241% in the past month, but they have dipped slightly on Wednesday after Hindenburg Research released a short report on the electric vehicle firm. 
Mullen stock is down 3.68%.
Hindenburg Research, a short-selling firm, wrote in a report titled ""Mullen Automotive: Yet Another Fast Talking EV Hustle"" that the company has made ""bold claims of ground-breaking technology, near term production of its EV vans, and a major as-yet-unnamed Fortune 500 customer.""
However, they add that a recent update about its battery technology is a ""rehash of testing the company had already announced in 2020,"" and Mullen ""apparently misrepresented the test results, according to the CEO of the company that performed the tests.""
""Mullen’s battery claims were based on technology licensed from a 1-year-old Chinese battery technology company. After hyping the importance of the relationship, Mullen made one payment under the deal and promptly terminated the relationship. The Chinese company’s website no longer works,"" stated Hindenburg.
Hindenburg also goes on to claim that two electric cargo vans Mullen says it will be manufacturing are ""actually Chinese EVs rebranded with a Mullen logo,"" while it also has other production hurdles such as no EPA certificates for its vans or any vehicle, and it hasn’t begun significant hiring.
""We have seen this story before, but Mullen strikes us as one of the worst. With echoes of Nikola, Lordstown, Kandi and Ideanomics, we think Mullen is just the latest in a long line of EV hustles,"" said Hindenburg."

The company did not specify the number of flights that would be cancelled.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airlines will pass on rising oil prices to passengers through higher fares relatively quickly, but the spike in energy costs will worsen the industry's overall outlook in 2022, the head of the International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday. 
Speaking after JetBlue launched a counter-bid for U.S. budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), Director General Willie Walsh also said he saw further scope for consolidation among airlines in the United States.
""It clearly took the market by surprise,"" Walsh told a regular industry news briefing.
""It is evidence that the financial strength of U.S. airlines does stand out from the rest of the world,"" he said, adding that consumers had benefited from major investments in new products.
IATA said global passenger traffic rebounded in February as the impact of the Omicron variant retreated outside Asia. The war in Ukraine has yet to feed through into monthly data. 
In February, passenger traffic stood at 54.5% of levels seen in the same month of 2019, up from 50.6% in January but below the 55.1% seen in December. Cargo volumes were at 111.9%.
Airlines are grappling with a rise in oil prices which accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a move Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"". 
The rise has worsened an outlook already expected to include an industry-wide loss in 2022, although some airlines will make a profit as the world stages an uneven recovery, Walsh said.
In the past, the rule of thumb was that oil prices would take six months to feed through to airfares, he added.
But that could happen more quickly because of the market's dramatic volatility as well as lower-than-usual levels of forward bookings already in the system following the pandemic.
Walsh also said airlines and airports were moving to tackle staff shortages after a spike in demand, but some factors were outside their control.

Thousands of holidaymakers have seen getaways disrupted or cancelled because airlines and airports do not have enough staff to meet the recovery in demand as pandemic restrictions are eased in Europe.
""The challenge the industry faces is bringing back front- line staff where they require background security checks,"" Walsh said, adding that a process which used to take five to six weeks is taking ""much longer now"".
