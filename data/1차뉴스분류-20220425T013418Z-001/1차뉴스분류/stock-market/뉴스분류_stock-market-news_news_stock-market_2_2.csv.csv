(Reuters) - Foreign-listed Chinese shares rallied on Wednesday after Beijing vowed to keep markets stable, soothing overseas investors' nerves after a sell-off due to worries over differences between China and the West in the Russia-Ukraine war.
Remarks by China's Vice Premier Liu He that Beijing would roll out support for the economy and keep markets stable sparked a bounce from 21-month lows for local equities, fuelling a rally for U.S.- and Europe-listed Chinese shares.
In U.S. trading, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com jumped 39.4%,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) gained 36.8% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) rallied 56.1% in the biggest daily percentage advances ever for those shares. They fell to multi-year lows https://tmsnrt.rs/3u4Xtsk during Tuesday's sell-off. The iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund rose 20.9%.
Similarly, gaming company NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) rose 25.7%, online video platform IQIYI jumped 50%, music-streaming company Tencent Music gained 29.3%, and mobile game publisher Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) advanced 47.6%, while Amsterdam-listed Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which owns a 29% stake in the Chinese tech giant Tencent, also gained sharply.
""It was an utter surprise to the market that this is something (China is) even thinking about,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""That's what made the rally so strong.""
Still, ""there's going to be a discount on all of these stocks for a while,"" he said, noting the recent JPMorgan Chase downgrade. Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) downgraded 28 Chinese stocks listed in the United States and Hong Kong.
""You need some follow-through here. It's not enough to have one Chinese official say something really positive,"" Meckler said.
Citibank's Asia-Pacific trading strategist in Hong Kong, Mohammed Apabhai, likened the moment to the Federal Reserve's market backstop in 2020 or then-ECB chief Mario Draghi's ""whatever it takes"" speech that staunched the eurozone crisis in 2012.
""It's not quite of that order of magnitude, but it's not that far away either,"" he said. ""It seems like China has realized that the need to do something to support the economy, something proper."" 
Chinese equities have seen severe selling pressure in recent days. Hong Kong stocks fell to a six-year low on Tuesday.
""Although it is still a volatile and somewhat opaque market, I think this is the right moment to look at Chinese stocks because valuations are good and macro data are recovering,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.
Frankfurt-listed depository receipts for Alibaba were among the most traded stocks on the Tradegate and Lang & Schwarz platforms, suggesting interest from German retail investors.
According to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, which tracks retail flows, appetite for China ADRs has picked up the most since September 2021, with net purchases over the last 10 trading sessions topping $500 billion, the highest level in over six months.
Separately, China's securities regulator said it would continue to communicate with U.S. regulators and strive to reach an agreement on China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation as soon as possible. 
The speed at which Beijing has responded to this week's sell-off would suggest it does not want to let things drift out of control, said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould in London.
""Its key goal is common prosperity and stock markets matter because a lot of Chinese retail investors have money in equities, so their wealth is at stake if shares are plummeting in value,"" he said. 

Some analysts see Chinese stocks as a possible good long-term investment, following a torrid 2021 amid a crisis in the real estate sector and a severe regulatory crackdown on tech giants. 
The MSCI China index was trading at a valuation discount of more than 30% to world stocks and twice as much the 20-year average discount, per Refinitiv data.

Investing.com - Homebuilder  Lennar  reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped estimates as rising home prices boosted margins an offset costs at time when demand for first homes remained robust.   
Lennar (NYSE:LEN) was up nearly 2% in after-hours trade.
Lennar reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.70 a share, up from $2.04 a share a year earlier, on revenue of $6.2 billion, from $5.33 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.58 on revenues of $6.16 billion.
The better-than-expected results come as higher margins offset a jump in costs. 
""Both gross margin and net margin remained strong, even as materials costs and wages have increased, and home prices have continued to rise while remaining affordable even as interest rates have ticked up,"" the company said. 
Deliveries increased 2% to 12,538 homes, while new orders were up 1% to 15,747 homes.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, the company sees deliveries of 16,000-to-16,300, and average sales price of about $470,000.
For 2022, the company forecast 68,000 deliveries, average sales price in a range of $470,000 to $475,000."

Investing.com – Stocks surged after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which was widely expected, as it signaled more of the same at future meetings.
The Fed raised rates for the first time in more than three years and indicated seven rate hikes for this year to bring inflation under control. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously.
More rate increases were appropriate, the Fed said, despite uncertainty caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine and a newly resurgent strain of Covid-19. The U.S. is fighting inflation that is running the hottest in four decades.
Powell said the Fed would like wage gains to slow as he pledged to do what could be done to tame inflation.
The increase also abruptly changes the Fed’s pandemic-era stimulus as widespread lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus put a halt on economic activity. Markets have been anticipating rate hikes for months, but the ebb and flow of concern about them has injected a newfound volatility in stocks.
Retail sales for February showed a gain in spending from the prior month, though a touch less than expected. Oil continued to fall on demand worries after several cities in China shutdown amid a new surge of Covid cases.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
2. Oil in focus
Crude oil prices continued their fall on news out of China — the largest oil importer — with the country facing Covid outbreaks in Shenzhen, a city of around 17 million. This space will continue to be closely watched this week.
The city, which is a manufacturing hub, has been put into a stringent lockdown. U.S. oil stockpiles rose more than expected in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude oil inventories rose 4.345m barrels last week, compared with analyst's expectations for a draw of 1.375 million barrels.
2. Starbucks CEO 3.0
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s longtime former CEO Howard Schultz is coming back for a third time, to lead strategy as the coffee retailer faces a growing push by employees to unionize across the country.
Shares rose 5% on Wednesday and will continue to be in play on Thursday. Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987 and expanded internationally.
3. Walmart hiring spree
Retailer Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)wants to hire 50,000 U.S. workers this spring for its stores, clubs, office parks and supply chain facilities. The current quarter ends in April. Shares dipped 0.3% on Wednesday after data showed retail sales rose in February but at a slightly slower pace than expected.

""Thyssenkrupp remains convinced that the independent positioning of the steel business offers very good prospects for the future. Nevertheless, a statement on the feasibility is at present not possible due to the current economic conditions,"" it said.
Although the group's sales in Russia and Ukraine are negligible at less than 1% of total sales, Thyssenkrupp said it expected business to be hit by the far-reaching macroeconomic and geopolitical consequences of the war in Ukraine.
Last month, Thyssenkrupp had said it expected free cash flow before M&A to break even for 2021/22.
""Against this background - in particular due to rising raw material prices - Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG) suspends its forecast for free cash flow before M&A for fiscal year 2021/2022,"" it said, adding the exact extent of consequences of the war were very uncertain.
Until the start of the war, business in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year were going according to plan, it said.

In February, Thyssenkrupp said it expected an adjusted EBIT between 1.5 billion euros and 1.8 billion euros and net income of at least 1 billion euros for 2021/22.
""In March, initial negative effects occurred primarily in the steel and automotive supply businesses,"" it said, adding the board still expected adjusted EBIT for the second quarter to be above the previous quarter.

(Reuters) -A new Russian law on leased aircraft showed Moscow could ""confiscate"" planes and such a move might help it claim insurance, Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp said at a time when leasing firms risk writing off jets stranded in the sanction-hit country.
""It (the law) helps the insurance question because it demonstrates the intent to confiscate which is, I think, a critical aspect of our war-risk insurance,"" Air Lease chairman Steven Udvar-Házy said on Wednesday.
The new law allows Russian airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register and has raised fears of a mass default by jetliners.
Global leasing companies have been scrambling to repossess more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines, who have mostly been unresponsive to demands for surrendering the jets.
That has thrown up the possibility of a long-drawn tussle between lessors and insurers, who could face multi-billion dollar payouts.
The law has prompted AerCap Holdings NV, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, to notify insurers of a potential $1 billion loss, according a report in The Insurer.(https:// AerCap declined to comment. It is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on March 30. Russia said the law aims ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". Air Lease's finance head Gregory Willis also raised the prospect of the United States and European Union (EU) governments stepping in to support the leasing industry if insurance payments became an issue. ""I can very easily see government stepping in at some point in time as they've done,"" Willis said during a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference. Cowen analyst Helane Becker said she did not believe either the United States or the EU will step in to provide support. ""Large western lessors with exposure to Russia should be able to handle the situation without government support,"" Becker said. Shares of Air Lease closed 3.7% higher after it allayed fears arising from its exposure to Russia as all of its planes are with privately-owned carriers in Russia who prefer to continue doing business with western firms. 
The company also has ""very strong security deposits"" on leased aircraft, Udvar-Házy said. Air Lease, which had less than 5% of its fleet by net book value on lease to customers in Ukraine and Russia, said it was making ""good headway"" in cutting exposure to Russia.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, led by tech as investors assessed the Fed’s plan to raise rates seven times this year after the central bank delivered its first hike in more than three years.
The S&P 500 rose 2.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, or 518 points, the Nasdaq rose 3.8%.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously.
The Fed is now forecasting its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% in 2022, well above the 0.9% forecast in December, pointing to about seven 0.25% rate hikes in total for this year.
“We had expected the dots to reflect 5 hikes in 2022 and 5 more in 2023, but instead they reflect a much steeper and higher trajectory for the funds rate than expected, with the median above neutral for 2023 and 2024,” Jefferies said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped sharply following the Fed decision. The 2-year U.S. treasury yield, which is sensitive to rate hikes, rose above 1.9%, pricing in the Fed’s seven rate hikes for this year.
The broader market was initially spooked by the steeper than expected path of rate hikes, but found its footing and regained the momentum seen ahead of the Fed decision following positive news concerning the Ukraine-Russia war. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia have drawn up a neutrality plan to end the war.
Financials, mostly banks, which benefit from rising Treasury yields, were the biggest gainers, up about 2%.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) each rose more than 6%.
Rising technology stocks also pushed the broader market higher despite expectations for steeper interest rates, the enemy of growth stocks like tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) rose more than 6% to lead big tech higher, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) up more than 2% each.
Energy was also in focus, weighed down by falling oil prices as investors digested positive Russia-Ukraine developments and surprise build in U.S. weekly crude stockpiles. 
U.S. weekly oil inventories rose by 4.345 million barrels for the week ended Mar. 10, confounding expectations for a 1.3 million barrel decline.

In an interview with regional TV channel, Bolsonaro said the possibility of replacing Joaquim Silva e Luna as Petrobras CEO exists, although he added ""everyone in the government can be replaced if they are not doing their job at a satisfactory level."" 
""So it doesn't mean that they will be replaced or that they won't be replaced"", said Bolsonaro. 
On Monday, Luna, a retired army general, said he would not leave the company despite facing criticism from Bolsonaro and others over a fuel price hike announced last week.
Bolsonaro appointed him to the job last year after his predecessor, Roberto Castello Branco, was fired due to a disagreement with the president over the company's pricing policy. 

Shares in Petrobras fell as much as 2.3% following Bolsonaro's statement, but were trading 1% down in late afternoon trading. The Bovespa stock Index rose 1.5%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp's longtime former Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will return to lead the company for the third time, taking over as interim CEO and driving strategy for dealing with a growing union drive at U.S. cafes. 
Current chief executive Kevin Johnson will retire, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will look for a new leader, the company said on Wednesday. Shares of the coffee chain were up 4.8%.
Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987. He expanded it into a coffee behemoth that made venti cappuccinos a global phenomenon. 
""Schultz is a revered leader and uniquely well-qualified to steward"" the company, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Lauren Silberman. Schultz will receive $1 of compensation.
The board expects to have selected a new leader by the fall, with help from executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, which it enlisted in 2021. Schultz did not make an appearance during Wednesday's annual shareholder meeting.
Separately, shareholders voted down a proposal for the company to produce annual reports on the prevention of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.
Johnson signaled to the board of directors a year ago that he might retire when the COVID-19 pandemic waned, he said in a company statement.
Johnson, 61, has been at Starbucks for 13 years, the last five as CEO.
Johnson steered the company through the worst of the pandemic, when cafes around the world had to shutter temporarily. While sales initially nosedived, they roared back as customers shifted to to-go and drive-thru and placed orders on Starbucks' mobile app.
The company also shifted its approach to building new cafes and is now adding more smaller stores with less room for seating and more emphasis on to-go orders in urban areas, while adding more drive-thru space in suburban locations.
Under Johnson's watch, Starbucks also lifted wages for employees several times - before most other global restaurant chains. Hourly starting pay will range from $15 and $23 by this summer.
UNION PUSH
The success of the mobile app, however, led to long lines and overworked employees in some areas. That barista burnout, as well as accusations by some workers that they were not getting enough protection from the virus at work, contributed to a surge of union organizing in U.S. locations. 
On Tuesday, a federal labor board accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to unionize their store.
The same day, a group of investors with $3.4 trillion under management urged the company to stop sending anti-union communications to its employees and to adopt a neutral policy towards unions.
The group, led by Trillium Asset Management and SOC Investment Group, said Starbucks risked damaging its positive reputation as a pro-employee brand by fighting the union.
Schultz has long said Starbucks did not need unions because it works so closely with employees, whom it calls ""partners.""
He has already had a run-in with Workers United, the union now representing employees at six stores. Employees at more than 140 stores in 27 states have asked for union elections in the last 7 months.
In November, Schultz spoke to employees who had been ordered to a large meeting with managers in Buffalo, where the first of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. company locations were deciding whether to join the union.
In the meeting, Schultz likened Starbucks' pro-employee stance to Holocaust prisoners in concentration camps sharing blankets, according to media reports. The remarks led to backlash on social media.
""Schultz came to Buffalo to union-bust,"" wrote union organizer and barista Jaz Brisack on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) after the news on Wednesday. ""His takeover is another move in Starbucks' ideological war on unions.""
Johnson took the helm after Schultz resigned in 2017.
In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Johnson said that he has ""fond memories of making beverages together, laughing together, and sharing stories with one another.""
Starbucks will ""attract high-quality CEO candidates given its culture, global brand recognition and strong growth outlook,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik.
Because Johnson had previously worked in technology - at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) - the board's search is likely to be broad. However, ""we prefer to see an incoming CEO with strong consumer industry experience,"" Strelzik said.
The CEOs of Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc and Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Inc also resigned in the last two weeks.

Former Starbucks chief operating officer Troy Alstead, who left in 2016, ""was beloved by the investment community"" and ""ought to be on the short list"" for the CEO role, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.
Several internal candidates could be considered, but ""unionization publicity could be a factor pushing the company to look externally,"" Charles said.

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in more than three years and signaled seven rate hikes for this year to bring inflation under control.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously. 
The start of liftoff on interest rates was widely expected as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that he would favor a 0.25% hike at the March meeting.
The March rate increase is expected to be followed up with several more hikes later this year, as Fed members have turned increasingly hawkish since December.
The Fed is now forecasting its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% in 2022, well above the 0.9% forecast in December, pointing to about seven 0.25% rate hikes in total for this year, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed.
Ahead of the meeting, Wall Street was pricing about six to seven rate hikes for this year.
For 2023, the Fed sees the Federal funds rate at 2.8%, up from its prior projection of 1.6%. The Fed's terminal rate for Fed funds – the rate that coincides with its mandate of full employment and stable inflation – was downgraded to 2.4% from 2.5% previously. 
The start of Fed’s rate-hike cycle hike comes as the central bank looks to step up its fight against inflation to ensure elevated price pressures don’t become entrenched.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, jumped to 5.2% in February, the biggest increase since April 1983.
Many have argued that the central bank has left it too late to tackle inflation, and now finds itself having to play catch up. But tightening too aggressively into an economy that is expected to slow, runs the risk of a recession or even worse, stagflation.
The latest projections from the Fed do little provide comfort against these concerns. Fed members downgraded expectations on economic growth, while the pace of red-hot inflation is forecast to continue.
The economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2022, down from a prior estimate of 4%, the estimate for the unemployment rate was unchanged from December at 3.5%, while the pace of inflation is forecast to accelerate to 4.1% from 2.7% previously.  
In his press conference that followed the monetary policy statement, Powell pushed back against recession fears. ""[W]e feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.""
The road to price stability for the Fed will be long and has been paved with more headwinds in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war pushing prices even higher.
""The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,"" the Fed said in a statement. ""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
“Powell clearly understands that the Fed is going to really have to focus on inflation now as it's gotten far beyond their expectations,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
“But this isn’t something that you can reduce in a short period … it's going to take a while,” Smith added.
The conclusion of the March meeting also draws the curtain on the Fed’s monthly bond purchase programme, or quantitative easing programme, which played a major role in cushioning the economy from the pandemic impact.  
With the QE now in the rearview mirror, the Fed has been weighing options on how to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Powell said ""excellent progress"" had been made on a plan to shrink the balance sheet, which could be implemented ""as soon as our next meeting in May.""
""The shrinkage of the balance sheet ... might be the equivalent of another rate increase,"" Powell added."

Nvidia stock rose 6.6%.
Nvidia shares were added to the list following fellow Wells analyst Aaron Rakers' note on the company earlier in the day. 
Rakers expects upbeat announcements from Nvidia at its upcoming investor day. He added that the recent market downturn had created a favorable risk/reward profile for the stock.
The analyst focused on key areas they are focused on for the company. These include Nvidia's product roadmap update, its expanding software-only offerings, the company's GeForce Gaming GPU installed base, and its auto pipeline expansion.
Rakers currently has an overweight rating and a $370 price target on Nvidia shares. However, the recent market decline has seen its stock lose 18% of its value in 2022.",,,

The company's action was disclosed by its senior vice president of government affairs, Nate Tibbits, in a tweet as a reply to a comment by Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Urging Tibbits to stop supplies to Russia, Fedorov said Qualcomm products are still available in Russia and it ""inadvertently enables this country to kill thousands of Ukrainians.""
In his reply, Tibbits said, ""This is incorrect. Qualcomm has called for a peaceful resolution to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, made direct donations to relief organizations & match employee contributions.""
""We comply with U.S. sanctions & laws are not selling products to Russian companies,"" he said. 
Thanking the move, Fedorov subsequently suggested that the chipmaker can send its satellite phones for Ukrainian rescuers if it wants to help.

While the invasion has drawn the ire of Western nations and resulted in several U.S. companies halting operations in Russia, the country has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Revenue from Russia and Ukraine accounts for less than 1% of its total revenue, Qualcomm had said at its stockholder meeting earlier this month.

The S&P 500 rose 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, or 179 points, the Nasdaq rose 2%.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously.
The Fed is now forecasting its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% in 2022, well above the 0.9% forecast in December, pointing to about seven 0.25% rate hikes in total for this year.
“We had expected the dots to reflect 5 hikes in 2022 and 5 more in 2023, but instead they reflect a much steeper and higher trajectory for the funds rate than expected, with the median above neutral for 2023 and 2024,” Jefferies said in a note.
The broader market was initially spooked by the steeper than expected path of rate hikes, but found its footing and regained the momentum seen ahead of the Fed decision.  
U.S. Treasury yields jumped sharply following the Fed decision. The 2-year U.S. treasury yield, which is sensitive to rate hikes, rose above 1.9%, pricing in the Fed’s seven rate hikes for this year.
Financials, mostly banks, which benefit from rising Treasury yields, were the biggest gainers, up nearly 2%.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) each rose more than 5%.
Rising technology stocks also pushed the broader market despite the expectations for steeper interest rates, the enemy of growth stocks like tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) rose more than 3% to lead big tech higher, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) up more than 1% each."

MILAN (Reuters) - Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) said on Wednesday that its loans to Russian and Ukrainian clients amounted to 5.1 billion euros net of guarantees from credit export agencies, which is around 1% of the total for Italy's biggest bank.
Intesa added in a statement it was analysing its exposure to Russia and Ukraine to understand how to better handle risks in light of the European Union's decision to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027.
Of the overall loan figure, some 4 billion euros are cross-border, with oil and gas firms accounting for half of the total.
Taking into account off-balance sheet items, Intesa's total net exposure to the two countries is 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion), Reuters calculations based on Intesa's figures show.
Almost all of the loans expire by 2027, Intesa said, giving it time to work out a solution before the EU-set deadline.
""Over two-thirds of loans to Russian customers refer to top-notch industrial groups,"" it said, adding these had ""long-established commercial relationships with customers that are part of major international value chains, with a significant portion of their proceeds coming from commodities.""
Intesa's local subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine account for just 1.1 billion euros in loans to customers and sums due from banks, it added.
Some 200 million euros are loans to entities that have been hit by international sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, it said.
Like other major international banks, including domestic rival UniCredit, Intesa has said it is reviewing its presence in Russia, where it serves corporate clients with a staff of around 980 people across 28 branches.
UniCredit on Tuesday said it was considering pulling out of Russia.
Analysts at broker Autonomous calculated a core capital hit of around 75 basis points, lower than its initial estimate of 90 basis points, assuming a 60% loss on cross border exposures.
Intesa, which used to handle more than half of commercial transactions between Italy and Russia, has financed major investment Russian projects, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale of a stake in oil group Rosneft. 
It also employs 780 staff in Ukraine, where its Pravex Bank unit has 45 branches.
Intesa has said it was continuing to provide essential banking services at Pravex branches whenever it was safe to do so, while helping to evacuate employees under threat.
The bank said its local subsidiaries' off-balance sheet exposure amounted to 300 million euros.

For the rest of the group exposures deriving, for example, from untapped credit lines were 1.1 billion euros and covered by 800 million euros in guarantees.

The moves come as a unionization drive at the company's U.S. cafes heats up.
A federal labor board has accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to organize their store and one investor group is urging the company to take a neutral stance toward unionization.
The group, led by Trillium Asset Management and SOC Investment Group, said Starbucks risked damaging its positive reputation as a pro-employee brand by fighting the union.
Schultz has long said Starbucks did not need unions because it works so closely with employees, whom it calls ""partners.""
Following are comments the executive and former U.S. independent presidential candidate, has made about unions over the years:
SCHULTZ COMMENTS PUBLISHED IN 2012 EDITION OF HIS BIOGRAPHY: 'Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time'
""I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn’t need a union.""
SCHULTZ ON MSNBC MORNING JOE IN JANUARY 2019:
""If you look at the history of unions, unions arrived in America because there were a lot of bad actors, bad actors of companies.""
""Unions arrived on the scene because companies were not doing the right thing for their employees. Unions have an obligation and responsibility to protect their employees but they're also very good companies in America, very good managements in America, who recognize that we have to share success, that not every business decision is an economic one."" 
""Unions have a role to play. But unions are not the answer. The answer to inequality is a comprehensive tax reform.”
SCHULTZ IN A LETTER TO U.S. STARBUCKS EMPLOYEES IN NOVEMBER 2021: 
""What the leadership team has done in Buffalo is what we have always done. We listen. We learn. We get better together. No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.""
In November, Schultz shared advice he received from a rabbi to employees who had been ordered to a large meeting with managers in Buffalo, where the first of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. company locations were deciding whether to join the union.

In the meeting, Schultz likened Starbucks' pro-employee stance to Holocaust prisoners in concentration camps sharing blankets, according to media reports. The remarks led to backlash on social media. 
""One person for every six was given a blanket .. .most people shared their blanket with five other people. And rabbi says to me, take your blanket and go share it with five other people. And so much of that story is threaded into what we have tried to do at Starbucks. Share our blanket.""

""Technology is one of our key areas of focus for Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn)'s origination & advisory business globally and especially in the U.S.,"" a spokesperson for the bank said.
The origination and advisory business at Deutsche Bank caters to major corporate clients and financial institutions, and advises on capital structures and sustainability ratings.
Deutsche Bank has been sharpening its focus on technology within the origination and advisory business with some key hires. Prior to Shah, Sean McCarthy and Jusung Kwok also joined the bank to expand its footprint in the tech investment banking space.

Shah, who was a senior managing director at financial services firm Macquarie Capital, will also head the U.S. West Coast software origination unit, the bank said in the memo, contents of which were confirmed by the spokesperson.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is increasing fertilizer shipments to both U.S. coasts from the world's largest nitrogen complex in Louisiana to help offset a decline in exports from Russia after it invaded Ukraine, Chief Executive Tony Will said.
Global fertilizer supplies have tightened and prices have increased from already high levels as sanctions bite Russia and its ally Belarus. Nitrogen fertilizer is one of the most commonly used fertilizers to boost production of corn, canola and other crops. 
Illinois-based CF Industries leased several vessels to transport more fertilizer, mostly liquid nitrogen, from its complex in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, Will told Reuters. The company can ship products up the Mississippi River to the Midwest and load vessels to sail downriver through the Gulf of Mexico to tanks on either coast.
""Historically a fair bit of Russian imports have come particularly to the East Coast, and we're trying to make up for that lack of availability by moving our tons over there,"" Will said.
Russia has previously accounted for 15% of U.S. nitrogen imports, said the Fertilizer Institute, an industry group. Russia is also a major exporter of natural gas, a key input in producing nitrogen fertilizer.
To boost supplies, CF Industries delayed maintenance work at one of its six plants in Donaldsonville until the second half of the year to avoid taking the facility offline, Will said.
""The plant is running less efficiently than it would, but it's still better to have it online,"" he said.
CF Industries has five U.S. nitrogen manufacturing complexes, along with plants in Canada and the United Kingdom. The company's ability to increase production is limited because it tries to operate plants at their maximum rate all year, Will said.
""We're moving as much product as we can right now with the assets that we have available,"" he said.

 Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, another fertilizer producer, has said Russia's invasion of Ukraine could result in prolonged disruptions to global fertilizer supplies.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

Companies hiring gig workers have started imposing these surcharges as drivers on social media protest about high gas prices due to Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil producer.
The fuel surcharge policy kicks in starting next week and will stay in place for at least 60 days, Lyft said, adding that the money will go directly to drivers.

The move mirrors that of rival Uber (NYSE:UBER), which said its customers would have to pay a surcharge of either 45 cents or 55 cents on each trip.

20,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 02:21PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc has started covering travel expenses for employees who go out of state for abortions because of newly enacted restrictions in Texas and other places, becoming the first major U.S. bank to make that commitment.
The new policy is ""in response to changes in reproductive healthcare laws in certain states in the U.S.,"" the bank said late on Tuesday in a public filing ahead of its annual shareholders meeting in April.
The filing said the travel benefits are ""to facilitate access to adequate resources"" and did not specifically mention abortion. Citi will cover transportation and lodging for employees who need to leave states such as Texas for abortions, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Citi has taken stances on controversial issues before, including in 2018 when it enacted restrictions on its clients who sell firearms following several U.S. mass shootings.
""More and more companies are being forced to take stands on issues because of the demands of some stakeholders that antagonize other stakeholders,"" Witold Henisz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and director of its Political Risk Lab. 
""Millennial workers and consumers demand that companies take stands and look to (their) CEOs especially where the government has failed to act or taken a stand of which they disapprove. This will continue to grow as a strategic challenge for companies,"" Henisz said.
Several states with Republican-led legislatures are passing new abortion limits in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court will likely undercut constitutional abortion protections this year.
In Texas, the public can sue anyone who helps women get abortions after six weeks. The number of abortions in Texas dropped by some 60% within the first month after the law took effect on Sept. 1, according to state health department data. 
Idaho's senate has passed a bill banning abortion after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.
The new  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) policy was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

The filing describes employee pay and benefits, as well as environmental, social and governance policies.
While Citigroup does not have consumer bank branches in Texas, it has institutional businesses there and has long employed thousands of Texans in large offices handling data.

The investment would make the facility the biggest plant in the region for the 2023 CR-V Hybrid crossover and includes equal grants of C$131.6 million from the governments of Canada and Ontario, Honda of Canada Mfg said on Wednesday.
Honda's announcement comes at a time when automakers globally have sharpened their focus on producing environmentally friendly vehicles in response to rising demand.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government sees the auto sector as a key part of its efforts to lower national carbon footprint.
Rich in key materials for electric vehicle battery production - including lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel - Canada is trying to woo battery makers to safeguard the future of its manufacturing heartland in Ontario.
""We're positioning Canada as a leader in low and zero emission vehicle manufacturing,"" Trudeau said at Honda's manufacturing plant in Ontario.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's audit court wants more clarification from the government before approving the sale of Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI), sources told Reuters, in a move that complicates a deal worth more than 8 billion euros ($8.80 billion).
Atlantia signed an agreement in June to sell its controlling stake in Autostrade to a consortium comprising state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and investment funds Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Macquarie.
A so-called precautionary legitimacy check from the audit court is needed before finalising the deal.
Its magistrates are seeking more details from the government and have asked top officials to appear before them on Thursday, two sources close to the matter told Reuters asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
This means responses to queries from the court were not considered sufficient, one of the sources said, without providing details on what its objections were.
The transport ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Last week the government replied to some of the issues raised by the court. The second source said Rome was stepping up efforts to secure the court's green light.
Under the Italian law, the court normally adjudicates on whether state agencies have followed correct procedures, without entering into the merits of projects.
In most instances the court rubber stamps the government's plans, but its objections can sometimes be hard to overcome. Last year, for example, it scuppered the launch of an Italian COVID vaccine.
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, said it expected the audit court to clear the sale of Autostrade in the next few weeks and then it would take up to 30 days to close the deal.
The sale of Aspi is the latest development of a dispute between Atlantia and the Italian authorities that started in 2018 after the collapse of a motorway bridge in which 43 people died.

Autostrade per l'Italia has proposed to pay 1 million euros as a settlement and 26 million euros in compensation to the Italian state for a case, while sister company SPEA has offered 810,000 euros.

The first batch of applicants under the expanded scheme comes as Chinese vice premier Liu He said on Wednesday the Chinese government continues to support offshore listings by domestic companies.
China's securities regulator also vowed on Wednesday to keep overseas listing channels open, part of a concerted effort to appease investors worried about a possible financial decoupling amid heightened geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. 
Europe offers alternative offshore listing venues for Chinese companies beyond the United States and Hong Kong. 
Sany, a major Chinese maker of construction and mining equipment, said a Swiss Exchange listing would help accelerate its internationalisation strategy and improve its competitiveness.
""The company hopes to take full advantage of China's capital market reform and strong policy support to connect directly with overseas capital markets,"" Sany said.
Gotion, which makes lithium-ion power batteries used in electric vehicles, and counts Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) as a strategic partner, said it will use the proceeds from the planned listing to fund global expansion.

Lepu Medical also said listing overseas will improve its global branding and market share. 
All three companies said their fundraising plans are still under discussion, and that the issuance requires approval from shareholders and regulators.

Investing.com –  Shoe Carnival  stock (NASDAQ:SCVL) stock traded 7% higher after the footwear retailer issued an optimistic outlook for the year while also approving a 29% dividend increase.
The company delivered double-digit sales growth and triple-digit growth in profit per share during every quarter of 2021. It completed a multi-year store productivity improvement program, its benefits reflecting in the positive cash flow each of its 323 stores generated in the financial year gone by.
The company is now expecting its current-year operating revenue to be $142 million to $154 million, almost thrice its pre-pandemic 2019 level. Profit per share is seen at $3.85 at the midpoint of its guidance range, compared to $1.46 in 2019 as consumers return to stores with greater focus on health while they also re-do their wardrobes after two years of the pandemic. 
Sales in the current year are seen rising by 4% to 7% on top of the over 36% increase in 2021 sales to $1.33 billion.
President and CEO Mark Worden said momentum in the fourth quarter “was very strong."" Store traffic is up 18%.
Net sales in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 29 jumped 23% to $313 million, driven by an increase in store traffic and new customer acquisition. Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to 72 cents to beat estimates.
Merchandise margin rose 5.1 percentage points, driven by fewer margin-dilutive promotions and higher average selling prices.
Working on a plan to accelerate store count expansion, the company aims to add 10+, 20+ and 25+ new stores in the three years through 2024, respectively."

BERLIN (Reuters) -BMW cut its car division's 2022 profit margin forecast on Wednesday and said it expected the chip crisis to drag on throughout the year, the latest automaker to warn of supply chain disruptions exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The German carmaker, which sold a record 2.52 million vehicles last year despite semiconductor shortages, had expected to deliver even more this year, but now expects output on par with 2021.
Still, its goals for higher electric vehicle (EV) production remain unchanged, Chief Technical Officer Frank Weber said. The company intends to more than double EV sales to more than 200,000 this year and reach 2 million fully-electric sales by 2025.
It will set up five new partnerships for battery factories in locations close to where EVs are produced in Europe, China, and the NAFTA region, purchasing chief Joachim Post said, without providing details.
The premium carmaker reported a 10.3% EBIT margin for 2021, its highest since 2017, but averaged lower earnings per vehicle than competitors like Audi and Mercedes-Benz.
It now expects an earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin of 7-9% for its car business rather than 8-10%, due to the Ukraine crisis.
BMW suspended production at some German plants after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but will return to full production next week, production chief Milan Nedeljkovic said. Production of the Mini in Oxford remains suspended.
Schedules were shifted to compensate for lost production time, Nedeljkovic said, with renovation works at certain plants planned for later in the year completed while production was suspended.
The Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 related disruptions in China have forced carmakers from Toyota to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shutter plants and raise prices. Many warn of further changes if circumstances do not stabilise.
BMW said that while it was still able to source some parts from western Ukraine and was engaging suppliers in other locations worldwide to keep up production, further interruptions were to be expected.

Rising raw material prices would likely cost the company a sum in the hundreds of millions of euros this year, finance chief Nicolas Peter said. 
Still, it expected to maintain its Ukrainian suppliers in the middle- to long-term, Post said.

(Reuters) -European stocks closed at over two-week highs on Wednesday after fresh talks of compromise from Russia and Ukraine boosted gains spurred by China's promise to roll out more economic stimulus.
Moscow and Kyiv discussed a status for Ukraine outside of NATO, lifting hopes for a breakthrough after three weeks of war.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 3.1%, at its highest level since Feb. 28.

""China stimulus headlines and Ukraine deal reports will always give stocks a lift, and to get them both on the same day has meant risk appetite has surged in impressive style.""

ARTEIXO, Spain (Reuters) -Sales at Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) surged above pre-pandemic levels at the start of its financial year, though the world's No.1 fast fashion retailer by sales faces a fresh challenge in the months ahead after it stopped trading in Russia. 
Inditex shares tumbled on March 5 after the company closed its 502 shops in Russia and halted online sales there after the country's invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of Western sanctions. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 5% of its sales growth from Feb. 1 to March 13.
""Our objective is to resume operations in Russia and Ukraine as soon as circumstances allow,"" CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras said during a news conference after Inditex published results for its financial year to the end of January.
He said that the company is still paying salaries to employees in Russia.
The Spanish group, brands of which also include Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear, on Wednesday reported that its store and online sales between Feb. 1 and March 13 jumped by 33% from the same period a year earlier and were up 21% from the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. 
Net profit in the year to Jan. 31 more than doubled to 3.2 billion euros ($3.51 billion) as it bounced back from the worst effects of the pandemic the previous year, mirroring the recovery at rivals such as Sweden's H&M. 
Fourth-quarter sales, however, were hit hard by temporary store closures in countries such as Germany and China as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread. Those restrictions knocked an estimated 400 million euros off quarterly sales.
""Inditex results are softer than consensus expectations, mainly due to Omicron effects in the second half of Q4,"" RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company had still made ""a very strong start"" to its new financial year. 
Shares in Inditex, which has 6,477 stores worldwide, were down 0.4% by 1230 GMT.
The group weathered the pandemic in part through its ability to produce more than half of its goods near Spain and deliver them to consumers quickly while also raising the share of online sales to about a quarter of its overall revenue in 2021.
Marta Ortega, the daughter of Inditex founder Amancio Ortega, next month takes over as chairwoman of the group in the last step of a generational handover that began a decade ago.
She will replace veteran executive chairman Pablo Isla in April, joining new CEO Garcia Maceiras in a management team that must contend with inflationary pressures and the uncertainties caused by the invasion of Ukraine. 
Garcia Maceiras said the company plans to make price adjustments in markets affected by inflation without disrupting its business model of accessible fashion. In Spain it expects to increase prices by an average of 2%.
""The rises will depend on the situation and will be selective. We do not plan massive increases,"" he added.
Inditex said the United States became its largest market behind Spain last year and that all markets, with the exception of Russia and Ukraine, have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

""Apparel demand has already been weak in Europe so far this year and any further softness in the demand environment will make it even harder to pass through higher input costs in a deflationary industry,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a recent note to clients.

The report said the company has asked the suitors to submit offers by end of day. The shares touched a high of $63 in today’s session so far.
According to WSJ, Starboard Value had offered $64 per share or $9 billion in January, which Kohl’s found too low.
The retailer has been under pressure from activist investors to consider a sale and unlock value of its real estate. One such investor, hedge fund Engine Capital which owns around 1% of the company, has been urging the department store chain to consider separation of its faster growing e-commerce business.
Oak Street Real Estate Capital has been named as a possible bidder for Kohl’s real estate.

BERLIN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Europeans are stocking up on survival gear like sleeping bags and camping cookers, as well as canned and dried food, in part to donate to refugees arriving from Ukraine and also due to fears of supplies being disrupted and conflict spreading.
Sales of products such as plastic cans, camping gear, batteries, flashlights and cell phone solar chargers jumped as much as sixfold in the past two weeks at Swedish hardware store chain Clas Ohlsson, a spokesperson said.
""It's clear that people want to be prepared for crises. The biggest increase is for products recommended to have at home during a crisis, for example radios,"" he said.
Sales of milk powder, pasta, grains, and canned foods rose by up to 20% in the past four weeks, according to Swedish grocery retailer Ica Gruppen.
Consumers are stocking up for themselves while humanitarian organizations are also buying products to send to Ukraine, according to Ica Sweden purchasing director Andreas Sbrodigliga.
In the Netherlands, Jimmy Bakker at outdoor supplier Dumpstore Amsterdam, has seen brisk trade since the war started. 
""When the war broke out people were buying emergency blankets, emergency food rations, radios and stoves. Last week, people rented vehicles and they were going to drive to Ukraine to hand out there,"" he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that Moscow's nuclear deterrent is on high alert had already prompted people in Central Europe to rush to buy iodine which they believe may protect them from radiation.
In Poland, which has taken in more than half of the 3 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, convenience store chain Zabka reported higher sales of canned goods, rice, groats and bottled water in some regions due to collections for refugees.
Hygiene products like wet wipes, gels, soaps, toothpastes and porridges are also flying off the shelves in Poland, according to drugstore chain Rossmann.
In Germany, where 175,000 refugees from Ukraine have been registered so far, sales of camping products like sleeping bags and mats have jumped in the past two weeks at sports chain Decathlon, a spokesperson said.
The company said it has also donated camping products to humanitarian organisations helping in Ukraine.
TEMPORARY CAP ON OIL AND FLOUR SALES
German wholesaler Metro has temporarily set a cap on the amount shoppers can buy of certain products, such as cooking oils and flour, but said it sees no reason for consumers to stockpile, adding fresh supplies are on the way.
""We are currently observing high demand from our commercial customers for various long-life foods, which can be attributed to the purchase of relief supplies, among other things,"" a spokesperson said.
Ukraine is a major global producer and exporter of grain and vegetable oils, but officials and farmers expect a decline in the 2022 harvest and exports due to the war. 
Germany's BGA trade association warned last week that the Ukraine war could cause bottlenecks in the food trade as well as threaten supplies of toilet paper and kitchen roll, and chemical cleaning agents.
    Transport problems were exacerbated by higher fuel costs and a shortage of Ukrainian truck drivers, it said.
However, most retailers have bolstered their supply chains since COVID-19 lockdowns triggered panic buying in 2020.
""We live in difficult times, but at the moment there is no room for panic,"" Dimitar Margaritov, Chairman of Bulgaria's Consumer Protection Commission, told national radio.

Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize said it saw higher sales at its stores in the Czech Republic due to people buying donations for refugees, but no cause for concern.
""Our supply chain in Europe is quite robust at this point and we have enough products for our customers in stock and at our suppliers,” the company said.

BERLIN (Reuters) -  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and BMW were among the latest companies on Wednesday to warn of disruption to their businesses from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while ad group Publicis said it had handed over control of its Russian subsidiary to protect its staff.
The list of Western companies that have suspended operations or pulled out of Russia is growing by the day after the West imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
Germany's BMW joined other carmakers in detailing the impact of the unfolding crisis in Ukraine on its operations as it downgraded its profit margin forecast. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 related disruptions in China have forced carmakers from Toyota to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shutter plants and raise prices, with many warning of further pain if circumstances do not stabilise.
BMW said that while it was still able to source some parts from western Ukraine and was engaging alternative suppliers to keep up production, further interruptions were to be expected in coming weeks.
France's Michelin, which was the first international tyre maker to start manufacturing in Russia in 2004, suspended production at its plant in Davydovo which employs about 750 people.
""There is a lot of supply difficulties - which means we have disruption of financial flows, and there's a problem of currency instability,"" it said.
Michelin said its priority was supporting affected employees.
Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which has stopped trading in Russia, said on Wednesday its objective was to ""resume operations in Russia and Ukraine as soon as circumstances allow"", adding that it was still paying salaries to employees in the country.
PROTECTING STAFF 
Multinationals from consumer goods companies to professional services suppliers have said they have to consider their staff in Russia and ramifications from any move to cut ties with the country.
Russia has taken the first steps towards allowing the nationalisation of foreign-owned factories that shut operations, a move that further complicates the transfer of ownership of assets for Western companies.
 British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) told Reuters on Friday that exiting its business or stopping manufacturing could be regarded as criminal bankruptcy by Russia and lead to action against local management.
""There's no way, consciously, we can expose our people to criminal sanctions,"" the Camel and Lucky Strike maker said.
BAT (LON:BATS) and rival Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) are looking to transfer their businesses in Russia to local third parties.
French ad group Publicis, which had been quiet about the impact of the conflict, said it was handing control of its operations to Sergey Koptev, founding chairman of Publicis in Russia, effective immediately.
Publicis is among the first Western companies to transfer legal ownership of a Russian subsidiary. 
It said it was ceding ownership with the clear contractual condition of ensuring a future for its employees in the country.

""We were determined to take the necessary time to come up with a solution that was truly people-first, because our 1,200 employees in Russia are our people too. We couldn't just abandon them,"" Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun said.
Bigger rival WPP (LON:WPP) said earlier this month it would discontinue its operations in Russia. It said it would support its staff and work closely with clients and partners as it withdrew from the country.

(Reuters) -The World Trade Organization (WTO) praised a provisional deal to waive patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines after more than a year of deadlock, though drugmakers said the move risked undermining the industry's ability to respond to future health crises.
The United States, the European Union, India and South Africa agreed on Tuesday on key elements for a waiver.
It now needs the backing of the 164 members of the WTO, which takes decisions based on consensus, so rejection by just one country could still block an accord.
""This is a major step forward,"" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said after Wednesday's agreement was announced. ""But we are not there yet. We have more work to do to ensure that we have the support of the entire WTO membership.""
If approved, the agreement would mean countries could permit domestic manufacturers to produce vaccines without patent-holder consent for three or five years. But only developing countries accounting for less than 10% of global exports of COVID-19 shots in 2021 could do this.
That would appear to exclude China but clear India, which banned vaccine exports for much of 2021.
Global drugmakers in the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) said the move could undermine their ability to respond to future crises.
""Biopharmaceutical companies reaffirm their position that weakening patents now when it is widely acknowledged that there are no longer supply constraints of COVID-19 vaccines, sends the wrong signal,"" IFPMA director general Thomas Cueni said.
The People's Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of over 90 campaign groups, said the proposal ignored other intellectual property barriers such as trade secrets and failed to include treatments that could save millions of lives.
""In a crisis, half measures are not acceptable,"" it said.
The provisional agreement says WTO members should decide within six months on an extension to cover diagnostics and therapeutics.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) declined to comment on the initiative and its German vaccine partner BioNTech had no immediate comment. The two have pledged to provide 2 billion doses of their COVID vaccine to low and middle income countries in 2021 and 2022.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), the maker of another major COVID vaccine, also declined to comment.

COVAX, global programme to provide vaccines to poorer nations, has been struggling this year to place more than 300 million doses, as supply and donations have ramped up.
Poorer nations have face challenges ranging from limits on cold-chain shortage to vaccine hesitancy and inadequate funds to support distribution.

Investing.com – Shares of vaccine makers traded higher Wednesday after Pfizer-BioNTech (NYSE:PFE) (NASDAQ:BNTX) sought U.S. FDA’s emergency use authorization for a second booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 65 and older.
The news of the companies approaching the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was first reported by The Washington Post Tuesday.
Shares of  Pfizer  and its partner BioNTech were up 1.7% and 7%, respectively. The development guided rival Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares also higher. They rose 11%.
The submission to the Food and Drug Administration includes data collected in Israel, where a second booster is authorized for many people over age 18.
The vaccine makers have for long argued for more boosters, saying additional doses will be needed for new virus variants that emerge. That reasoning didn’t find much acceptance, given vaccine hesitancy amid questions about how many shots would be enough.
Top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and other U.S. health officials have also extended the case for a fourth shot many times, suggesting one might be needed for the elderly and to prepare for the possibility of another surge.
With fresh infections in China surpassing 2021 levels, the defense for another booster has been bolstered.

(Reuters) -SPACs are turning to costly new tactics to keep investors from jumping ship as market confidence wanes in the once red-hot alternative to IPOs.
Blank-check acquisition firms and the companies they acquire are having to hand over bigger stakes in the ventures to investors in some cases, often at big discounts. Deal managers are also seeking backstop financing from investment firms and plowing in more of their own cash.
Less than three months into 2022, 13 mergers involving special purpose acquisition companies have already fallen through in the United States, according to data from industry tracker SPAC Research. That compares with a total of 18 in the whole of 2021.
In money terms, almost $9.5 billion worth of mergers have been canned this year, according to Dealogic data.
The main cause of deals being abandoned, market players say, is the risk of redemptions - where investors exercise their right to sell shares in the venture back to the SPAC before the merger is completed, and for the price they paid for them. 
""Every transaction is worried about redemptions and every transaction is trying to figure out how to mitigate it,"" said Amir Emami, global co-head of SPAC coverage at RBC Capital Markets.
The approaches being employed by SPACs include offering bonus stock to investors who choose not to redeem shares.
SPACs are shell companies that raise money in an initial public offering and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public. Since investors are unaware of the target company ahead of the IPO, SPACs often grant them the right to redeem their initial investment as an incentive to put their money in the trust.
Yet significant redemptions undermine the viability of such deals. At the same time, shares of many companies that went public during the boom last year have fared poor, leaving some investors nursing losses and making new SPACs look more risky.
Indeed, the deals are drying up.
Only 24 SPAC mergers worth $28.3 billion have been announced so far this year, versus the 93 deals worth $233 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to SPAC Research. Only 48 new SPACs were floated on U.S. exchanges up to the end of February, compared with 214 during the same period last year, according to data from Dealogic. 
""What was an attractive deal, say six months ago, may not be as attractive today given the market has sold off meaningfully since then,"" Emami said. 
'THE ICING ON THE CAKE'
Measures such as offering extra stock have been successful in getting some mergers over the line, yet can come at a heavy financial cost for the SPAC managers, their target companies and their original investors, who become diluted.
""With a high number of SPACs still seeking targets and the skepticism due to the pullback in the market, it has become harder to persuade target companies to want to engage with SPACs and have the related management distraction,"" said Atif Azher, partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.
Bonus stocks, or ""bonus pools"", for investors who eschew redemptions, are typically comprised of founder shares or regular company shares that were reserved for the SPAC managers. 
In January, in the $9.3 billion merger of Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp with lottery operator Allwyn, 6.6 million shares, worth an estimated $65 million, were offered to shareholders who elected not to redeem their shares.
""The best way to maximize participation by SPAC shareholders is to bring to market a highly profitable company with exciting growth prospects at an attractive valuation. The bonus share reward is just the icing on the cake,"" Cohn Robbins co-chairmen Gary D. Cohn and Clifton S. Robbins told Reuters.
DPCM Capital Inc, another SPAC, gave shareholders about 5 million shares for not redeeming their existing holding in its $1.2 billion merger with quantum computing company D-wave Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Inc.
SPACs are also raising additional financings, known as private placements in public equity (PIPEs), to get deals over the line. About a dozen SPACs have raised additional PIPEs in recent months to mitigate the risk of redemptions. 
Some of the fundraising is also done via over-the-counter equity derivative agreements. If investors who buy the shares choose not to redeem them before merger completion, the SPAC agrees to buy back those shares from them at a later date after the merger is safely in the bag. 
MANAGERS PAY MILLIONS
Some investment firms have also stepped in recent months to backstop deals. One of them, Atalaya Capital Management LP, offered Yellowstone Acquisition Company up to $70 million for its $777 million merger with airport hanger manager Sky Harbour in January, five months after the SPAC deal was announced. 
In other cases, it is the SPAC investors who step up. 
Shareholders of SPAC Dynamics Special Purpose Corp, for example, including funds managed by Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and T. Rowe Price, committed $86 million in non-redemption agreements in December to help it complete its merger with biotech firm Senti Bio, in a deal valued at $601 million. 
Some SPAC managers have also chosen to invest more of their own money into deals to make up for redemptions. For example, the parent company of Trebia Acquisition Corp, a SPAC that agreed to merge with marketing platform System1 Inc, agreed to provide a $250 million backstop in January 2022 for the $1.4 billion deal to close.

""Most of the terminations more recently are more market driven,"" said Michael Levitt, partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. 
""They (SPACs) are concerned that the redemptions are going to be too high, and the target company is not going to have enough money to meet its minimum cash condition,"" he added, referring to the specified amount a SPAC must hold upon the deal closing.

LYON, France (Reuters) - When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie decided to let his staff work a four-day week, on the same pay as before, he knew he risked hurting his bottom line. ""Some people took me for a crazy person,"" he recalled.
But a year on, he says the opposite has happened: his LDLC company selling consumer technology has increased its annual turnover by 40% without hiring any extra staff.
The secret, he said, is that the approximately 1,000 people his firm employs feel trusted and appreciated, and so they are more productive.
""At the end of the day, it's brought only good things for the team,"" said 51-year-old de la Clergerie.
As the world emerges from a pandemic that prompted many people to re-evaluate their work-life balance, companies and workers around the world are asking if, like de la Clergerie's firm, they could work less.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gave its 2,300 Japan-based employees Fridays off in 2019, and said it saw productivity rise 40%. Consumer group Unilever (NYSE:UL) launched a four-day week trial for local staff in New Zealand. Spanish telecoms company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has trialled a four-day week for 10% of its domestic workforce.
Johann Peters, who works in one of LDLC's stores near its headquarters in a suburb of Lyon, south-east France, uses the extra day off to head to the supermarket to pick up his weekly shopping. He then takes his daughter, 9-year-old Melissa, to her tennis practice.
""You come into work after your day off much more rested, and more efficient operationally,"" he said.
De la Clergerie said before he embarked on the change, he worked out that even in the worst case scenario, it would add to labour costs by at most 1.5 million euros per year. He said he felt that was a manageable risk.
Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves were down, and that the company had not had to hire new people to offset the reduction in hours worked. 
Though the four-day week was not the only factor involved, de la Clergerie said it had contributed to a jump in turnover from around 500 million euros before the change, to close to 700 million euros ($769.86 million) since then.
Celine Henniaux, a 36-year-old who works in one of the firm's distribution centres, said she had no desire to go back to the way things were before.
""No no,"" she said. ""We've got a taste for having a day off during the week.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The majority of Britain's top companies now have at least one ethnic minority board member, the government-backed Parker Review committee, set up to improve the diversity of UK boards, said on Wednesday. 
Improving boardroom diversity has become a hot topic for policymakers and investors in recent years, as many believe it both helps to address social inequalities and also leads to better decision-making and performance over time.
""Our December 2021 target of every FTSE 100 company having at least one board director from a minority ethnic background has very nearly been met,"" said John Parker, chairman of the Parker Review Committee. 
""We have also secured commitments from many of the outstanding companies which mean it is likely that circa 97% of current FTSE 100 companies will comply with the target by the middle of the year.""
Last year, the number of FTSE 100 companies to meet the voluntary target rose to 89 from 74, and by March 2022, a further five had done so. Three have committed to do so and are in the advanced stages of recruiting.
Of the three companies yet to commit, one is in the process of being acquired and will delist, another is a Russian steel and mining company about to exit the FTSE 100, and the last is a UK subsidiary of a U.S. group, it said.

Most of the positions taken by ethnic minorities are non-executive, with only six in the position of chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, and 16 at a FTSE 250 company. 
Among the FTSE 250, 128 companies now meet the target ahead of an end-2024 deadline, it added. The targets for both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were originally set in 2017.

Lockheed, whose shares were down 6.4% in early trading, said in a statement that it was ""premature"" to speculate about the proposed budget. 
""The Department (of Defense) cannot confirm specific budget details until after the FY23 President's Budget is released,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said. 
Reuters reported last month that U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to ask Congress for a defense budget exceeding $770 billion for the next fiscal year, compared with $778 billion in 2022.
The budget is expected to benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
""This is a significant issue for the program,"" Cowen analyst Roman Schweizer said, referring to the news on request for fewer F-35s. 
Several factors from high operating and maintenance costs to difficult contract negotiations might have contributed to the development, Schweizer said.

The F-35 is one of the world's most advanced fighter aircraft and considered a highly sensitive export, sold only to the closest allies of the United States.
Lockheed Martin delivered a total of 142 F-35 fighter jets to the United States and its allies last year, three more than originally planned.

(Reuters) - Russian airlines have weeks to orchestrate alternative supplies of banned aircraft parts or start grounding jets to avoid safety concerns as Western sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine threaten their post-Soviet revival.
Moscow took a first step this week towards keeping its commercial fleet flying by allowing its airlines to re-register leased planes in Russia, giving local authorities direct control over the certificates of airworthiness needed for each jet.
That reverses a two-decades-old agreement allowing leasing companies to keep hundreds of jets registered in Bermuda because of worries over Russia's legal system - a transfer of authority that has long been a source of irritation to Russian officials.
Sheltered by those changes, Western analysts say airlines may start stripping some of Russia's 500 foreign-leased jets within weeks or even days for parts while shopping around for genuine, but resold, parts from countries such as China.
The licence changes and jet-stripping herald a legal battle with lessors, but Russia's tightly regulated carriers are seen unlikely for now to resort to buying counterfeit parts as Iran was forced to do during decades of U.S. sanctions.
""Russian airport and airline managements are professional, as are the regulators. Everything will in all likelihood be clearly documented if they are allowed to get on with the job,"" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety at Ascend by Cirium.
Flag carrier Aeroflot declined comment. Russia's transport ministry, aviation regulator and other airlines contacted by Reuters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said on Wednesday Russia would accelerate the renewal of its domestic aerospace industry notably by accelerating its MS-21 and SSJ-100 jet projects.
The most recent audit from the UN's aviation body in 2015 found Russia was about in line with the world average for airworthiness and well above the average for accident investigations that play a major role in keeping flying safe, according to an official graphic summarising the results.
Other categories including licensing displayed gaps.
Volodymyr Bilotkach, an associate professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology, said flag carrier Aeroflot and S7 Airlines had safety records comparable with top-tier rivals, although some smaller carriers fared less well.
Whether the world's 11th largest aviation market, which was partly reliant on foreign maintenance providers such as Lufthansa Technik, can keep its skies safe behind a new Iron Curtain is likely to be tested rapidly.
""They will start having problems because of the spare parts and maintenance. So I'm afraid that the Russian safety record is going to worsen,"" Bilotkach said.
MISSING UPDATES
Among the items most likely to be quickly affected are software updates for flight management systems and changes to terrain databases used to give early warnings of a potential ground collision, frequently renewed to include new obstacles.
U.S. supplier Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) has already refused to provide Russian carriers with a database upgrade for such systems, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.
Honeywell had no immediate comment.
Other weak points may be as mundane as aircraft tyres.
""They will need everything,"" a Western supplier said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Very rapidly they will have shortages starting with contact parts like tyres and brakes, which wear out most quickly, or have to repair routine knocks from ground carts.""
Each plane type has a minimum equipment list that can run to 1,500 pages. Some must be replaced at once if faulty, others can be used for a number of days or weeks until a maintenance visit.
A small minority of the world's most cash-starved airlines are adept at bending the rules, for example by swapping a pair of identical parts to start the clock running again on the one that is faulty, two aviation safety sources said.
Bijan Vasigh, an economics professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said Russian airlines can only cannibalise so many parts from other planes. 
""They (the West) really meant to paralyse aviation in Russia and I think they will be successful,"" he said. ""Very soon they will reach the limit of the parts and gradually I think we should see a reduction in flights inside Russia.""
U.S. sanctions allow for potential exemptions where safety is involved, following lobbying by the country's aerospace industry. There are no reports yet that contractors have applied for one. European Union rules allow very limited exemptions.
Russian airline executives say the sanctions will lead to safety problems ""sooner or later,"" but Western industry officials say it is up to airlines not to fly planes at risk.

""Sooner or later, the lack of original spare parts will make itself felt and pilots will have to ignore signals about non-functioning systems,"" one Russian airline executive said.
""At some point, the pilots will simply refuse to fly because it is not safe to ignore it,"" the executive told Reuters.

52,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors grabbing shares in beaten-down companies after a merger with blank-check firms aren’t getting much of a bargain. In most cases, they’re still paying dearly for promises of revenue and profits that remain years away.
The median price-to-sales ratio for companies that merged with special-purpose acquisition companies since the start of 2020 sits at roughly 4.1, even after the sector has shed more than half of its value in the past year. And this counts only the ones with revenue to measure. Over half of the 286 target companies didn’t have any, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
That’s far higher than the benchmark S&P 500 Index, home of the world’s blue-chip corporations, which trades at about 2.8 times sales. While investors routinely pay more for startups because they’re counting on exponential growth, the prospects for some of these nascent companies targeted by SPACs are so shaky that they’ve warned they might be forced out of business.
The rich valuations remind Jay Ritter at the University of Florida of initial public offerings in the 1980s and 1990s, which were typically done by young companies with similarly optimistic business models. “A lot of them turned out to be disappointments for investors, and so far that’s been true with a set of companies that have recently merged with SPACs,” said Ritter, a finance professor who specializes in public-listings data.
Pricey multiples could support speculation that SPACs will overpay in order to guarantee their own self-preservation. Blank-check firms raise cash through public offerings so they can find and buy an operating business, but their structure typically requires a deal to be closed within two years, or else sponsors have to return the money. With that deadline looming, there’s a backlog of more than 600 SPACs still searching for deals.
The SPACs and the companies with which they merge have fallen sharply out of favor. The De-SPAC Index, which tracks 25 such companies, is down more than 60% in the past 12 months.
“Betting on newer, ‘hype’ companies with little realized value pose higher risks than any other type of investing,” said Anderson Lafontant, Miracle Mile Advisors senior advisor. “With the mania of SPACs fizzling, their actual performance is coming into light.”
EV Rout
Many of the high-profile de-SPACs are in the electric vehicle space, like Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) or ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT), while others have used celebrity ties to garner investor interest. Lucid, which carries a $38.6 billion value, booked just $26.4 million in fourth-quarter revenue and sliced its 2022 production targets last month, blaming supply chain disruptions.
To be fair, a bevy of companies already generating millions in sales have gone public via SPAC deals, but nevertheless are coming under pressure because of their blank-check origins. “The issue is how the market is valuing them,” Ritter said.
Metaverse-tied data platform company Matterport Inc (NASDAQ:MTTR) and Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and delivery giant  Grab Holdings  Ltd (NASDAQ:GRAB) are among those Ritter has kept an eye on. Matterport has tumbled nearly 80% from a Nov. 29 record close while Grab has shed $21 billion in value from a December debut.
Companies that might not have been ready for prime time litter the worst performers among former SPAC targets. Clarus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CLAR) has sunk so low it’s in danger of losing its listing and said in a December filing it doesn’t have enough cash to last another 12 months without more capital. 
Other de-SPACs with steep declines in market value include Skillz Inc (NYSE:SKLZ) and Sema4 Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:SMFR), former darlings of Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest.
On the flip side, Highpeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) has more than doubled in the past year amid a rally for commodities while Holley Inc (NYSE:HLLY), a car part manufacturer, is up more than 40% since its debut in July as sales soared nearly 40% in 2021.
Finance chiefs from Matterport and Skillz said their companies were being swept up with other technology stocks that have been under pressure amid expectations that interest rates will rise along with inflation, which tends to depress the current value of future earnings. Skillz Chief Financial Officer Ian Lee said in an interview that the range of companies that went public via SPAC merger have been “put under a negative halo.”
Representatives for the other companies mentioned didn’t immediately respond or provide a comment.

53,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:37AM ET</span>",,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for two days, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, as China tightens COVID restrictions to curb the country's latest outbreak. 
The Shanghai factory runs around the clock, and suppliers and Tesla staff were told on Wednesday in the notice, reviewed by Reuters, that production would be suspended for Wednesday and Thursday.
It did not give a reason for the stoppage at the plant, also known as the Gigafactory 3, which makes the Tesla Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover sport utility vehicle.
Many cities across China, including Shanghai, have been rolling out strict movement controls to stem the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak in two years. The measures have also caused factory shutdowns in parts of the country, putting pressure on supply chains.
Tesla did not have immediate comment. 
Its Shanghai factory produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub to Germany and Japan. It delivered 56,515 vehicles in February, including 33,315 for export, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
That amounts to an average of around 2,018 vehicles a day.
It was not immediately clear whether the suspension of work would apply to other plant operations over the two days.
Two people briefed on the notice said they understood it applied to Tesla's general assembly lines. They declined to be identified because the information was not public.
The notice did not specify whether the measures would correspond to a loss of production, or whether Tesla could make up for any lost output.
Authorities in Shanghai have asked many residents not to leave their homes or work places for 48 hours to as long as 14 days as they conduct COVID tests or carry out contact tracing. 
In a separate notice issued on Wednesday that was also seen by Reuters, Tesla asked suppliers to estimate how many workers were needed to achieve full production and to provide details of workers affected by COVID restrictions. 
It also asked suppliers to prepare workers to live, sleep and eat at the factories in an arrangement similar to China's ""closed-loop management"" process. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn was allowed to resume some operations at its Shenzhen campus on Wednesday after it set up such an arrangement.

Tesla was alerted by one supplier last weekend that its production had been affected by COVID measures, said a person familiar with the matter. That supplier told Tesla that its stockpiles could only last for two days, the person said. 
Any protracted China lockdowns will further rattle Asian supply chains, OCBC economist Wellian Wiranto said in a research note, noting the southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen alone produces 11% of China's exports.

Investing.com – NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) stock plunged 9% Wednesday after Britain's anti-trust regulator said the company’s proposed $8.6 billion purchase of Avast (LON:AVST) needed a deeper probe owing to competition concerns.
Avast stock was down 13% in London trading after the Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software.
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation, and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe, according to Reuters.
NortonLifeLock said it did not plan to propose any remedies, calling the CMA's decision ""surprising"".
Under the deal announced in August, Avast shareholders were to get a mix of cash and newly issued shares. NortonLifeLock expected the merger to result in cost savings of $280 million.
If the deal fructifies, the new company will serve more than 500 million users including around 40 million direct customers.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks rose ahead of the opening in New York on Wednesday, with a sharp turnaround in Chinese markets providing an upbeat start to a day that will be dominated by the Federal Reserve.
By 9:50 AM ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 385 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 2.2%. All three indexes made solid gains on Tuesday as crude oil prices tumbled, taking the sting out of one of the factors that have most hurt markets in the last two weeks. 
The Fed is expected to hike the target rate for fed funds by 25 basis points to a maximum of 0.5%, from 0.25% currently. Analysts expect at least five more such hikes in the course of the year in an effort to bring down inflation which is running at a 40-year high. 
Retail sales data for February rose 0.3%, slightly below expectations for 0.4% for the month. For the 12 months ended in February, retail sales rose 17.6%.
Chinese ADRs are in turbocharged mode after the central bank and government issued coordinated statements pledging support to both the economy generally and financial markets in particular. Chinese cash stock markets had their biggest ever one-day gain in response, after a tumultuous few sessions overshadowed by Covid-19 lockdowns and the threat of forced delisting from U.S. exchanges. 
The prospects for a ceasefire in Ukraine appeared to brighten on Wednesday as Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a neutrality model for Ukraine was on the table that would allow it to keep its own army - a big shift from Moscow's initial position of wanting to change the country's government and demilitarize it. 
Crude oil prices continued to slide, extending Tuesday's losses that were caused by fears for the strength of Chinese demand. China is currently enacting its most stringent lockdowns in two years to grapple with outbreaks of Covid in the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen and the northeastern province of Jilin. Public health measures have also forced Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shut its Shanghai factory for two days, according to the company.
U.S. crude futures fell 0.4% at $96.00 a barrel, further weighed down by a new forecast from the International Energy Agency, which said global demand in 2022 could fall by one million barrels a day on average due to the effects of the war and the Western sanctions accompanying it.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday as a relatively weak retail sales report for February encouraged hopes that the Federal Reserve won't talk too tough after its policy meeting which ends later in the day.
Official data showed that retail sales rose only 0.3% last month rather than the 0.4% expected, while there was a bigger shortfall in core retail sales, where growth of 0.2% was well below expectations of 0.9%. While the monthly numbers are still erratic due to shifting consumption patterns caused by successive waves of the pandemic, they appear to indicate a slowdown from the much more robust spending last year, when households were still enjoying the benefits of stimulus checks. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 460 points, or 1.4% at 34,004 points, the first time it has traded above 34,000 in nearly two weeks. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.8%.
The early mood was also lifted by events abroad, with Russia's Foreign Ministry appearing to make further concessions in peace talks with Ukraine and China's government and central bank intervening verbally to prop up local stock markets after a dismal last few trading sessions. Chinese ADRs advanced broadly, with  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) gaining 16%,  Pinduoduo  ADRs (NASDAQ:PDD) gaining 34% and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs gaining 21%.
The day is, however, set to be dominated by the Federal Reserve's meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM ET. A 25 basis point rate hike - the first in over three years - is widely expected, with a minority still betting on a 50 basis point hike. The latter would signal greater urgency in bringing down an inflation rate that is running at its highest in over 40 years. Of most importance, however, will be the Fed's guidance in the form of its so-called 'dot-plot' of future rate expectations, and in the guidance offered by Powell. 
Powell is likely to highlight not only the inflationary impact of past stimulus and current labor market tightness, but also the risks to growth from sustained high energy prices and global economic disruption due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier made a virtual address to Congress, calling again for a No-Fly Zone over Ukraine. The Biden administration has rejected that on the grounds that it would lead directly to military conflict between the U.S. and Russia, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
Among individual movers early on, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock surged 7.4% after it said that Chief Executive Kevin Johnson will step down at the end of the month, to be replaced as interim CEO by his predecessor - now chairman - Howard Schultz. Chipmakers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) also stood out after receiving brokerage upgrades: Nvidia stock rose 4.0% and Micron stock rose 7.1%.
Among the few losers, NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) fell 10.2% after the cybersecurity firm made an $8.6 billion bid for U.K.-based software group Avast (LON:AVST). The U.K.'s antitrust regulator signaled it will investigate the transaction.  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock also fell 6.2% after Bloomberg News reported that the Pentagon will trim its order for F-35 aircraft next year by 33. It's not clear whether the reduction in the order is linked to developments in Europe, where Germany committed to buying a similar amount of F-35s in an urgent upgrade of its airforce earlier this month."

The investment, which is part of Exor's non-core trading activity on equity, makes it the third-largest shareholder in Veon.
The news was initially reported by Italian daily MF, which said Exor rounded up its holdings at the beginning of March, passing a 5% threshold and triggering disclosure obligations.
Exor declined to comment.
Veon's largest shareholder is LetterOne, the investment vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Fridman stepped down from LetterOne's board on March 3, following his inclusion on the European Union's list of individuals sanctioned following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Veon's CEO Kaan Terzioglu repeated in a letter to investors on Tuesday that the company itself is not subject to sanctions.

Veon gets 30% of its revenue from Russia, but also operates networks in several other countries, including Ukraine, where it operates Kyivstar.
Veon shares have lost half their value since mid-February, when the war in Ukraine started, and are down almost 70% since October.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded 2.2% higher in premarket Wednesday on reports the Pentagon is likely to order more non-stealthy F-15EX jets in its next budget.
According to Bloomberg, the U.S. Air Force will request 24 non-stealthy F-15EX jets, up from 14 planned for the ongoing year that ends September 30.
The EX model carries more ordnance than Lockheed’s F-35 and is estimated to be cheaper to fly.
Boeing touts the jet as having a digital backbone, open system architecture, and one that’s a ready-now replacement for the F-15C. It has the capacity to carry hypersonic weapons, making it a key element of the U.S. Air Force’s tactical fighter fleet, according to Boeing.
The stock had closed 2.5% higher Tuesday after various airlines said travel demand remained robust, notwithstanding the ongoing conflict in Europe. They said they will trim flight frequencies to remain on track toward profits even as fuel prices rise.
Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) raised its annual guidance for the current quarter. The airline now sees revenue for the March quarter at 78% of 2019 levels, an improvement from the 72-76% forecast it gave two months ago.
In another boost for the stock, StreetInsider said Baird analyst Peter Arment has added Boeing to the firm’s list of bullish fresh pick stocks. The 737-MAX deliveries in China are getting closer with analysts expecting it to happen by April."

LONDON (Reuters) - Where you go. What you pass. Where you stop. What you listen to. What you watch. Your good habits. Your bad habits. 
Companies in Europe and beyond are vying for control of the crown jewels of the connected car era: your vehicle's data. 
The contest is entering a pivotal phase as EU regulators look to hammer out the world's first laws for the ballooning industry around web-enabled vehicles, pitting carmakers against a coalition of insurers, leasing companies and repair shops.
European Commission sources said the EU executive should launch an industry consultation on in-vehicle data this week which could lead to legislation later this year - the first of its kind globally. 
Many companies view data as the gold of the new wired world, though for some it's more akin to air or water.
""If you don't have access to data in the future, eventually you'll be squeezed out,"" says Tim Albertsen, CEO of ALD, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s car leasing division, which commands millions of vehicles. 
""You'll not be efficient, you'll not have the right services, you just can't operate at the end of the day.""
Car manufacturers, guarding their gatekeeper role in accessing data from their vehicles, have resisted specific regulations for in-vehicle data, saying that protecting consumers is paramount. 
""Europe's auto industry is committed to giving access to the data generated by the vehicles it produces,"" said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). ""However, uncontrolled access to in-vehicle data poses major safety, (cyber) security, data protection and privacy threats."" 
Yet the companies lined up against them say limiting or charging what they deem unfair amounts for access to in-vehicle data could kill off competition for carmakers who already operate their own leasing firms, car subscription services and repair shops.
In some cases, they say carmakers are already restricting access to vehicle data and charging independent repair shops more for access. 
""The manufacturers are in direct contact with the vehicle, so they get all the data,"" says Sylvia Gotzen, CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors, or FIGIEFA, which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe. 
""They get the full buffet and all we get is some crumbs.""
CARMAKERS: WE SHARE DATA
Vehicle manufacturers have big plans for data.
For example Stellantis, the world's No. 4 carmaker, expects to generate 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) annually by 2030 from software products and subscription services. Such offerings are also central to General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plan to double annual revenue to around $280 billion.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said data is becoming the ""key source of value creation and innovation"", adding that customers have ""full control"" over it, citing vehicle security and customer sovereignty as its main focuses.
BMW rejected suggestions it was withholding data. 
The German company said it can share nearly 100 data points with third parties if drivers requested it and could make more available if companies prove a real business need for them and a willingness to take responsibility for cybersecurity risks. Auto supplier groups like FIGIEFA say carmakers can access thousands of data points. 
A BMW spokesperson said the carmaker would like all sides to sit down with a mediator such as the European Commission and hammer out a list of data points that is acceptable to everyone.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters on Friday that the carmaker aggregated data, which cost money, and so needed to be paid for it. He cited, as an example, data that Stellantis sells to cities to measure how often anti-lock braking systems are engaged at junctions and gauge which are the most dangerous. 
""It is not only collecting the data, it is also about crunching the data in a way that is going to create value for somebody willing to pay for it,"" Tavares said. 
'DATA IS ABSOLUTELY KEY' 
Yet other companies in the auto ecosystem, such as ALD, say they want the European Union to ensure a level playing field
ALD, in the process of buying Dutch rival LeasePlan to give it a combined fleet of 3.5 million vehicles, has a car-sharing platform that needs to run diagnostics, read the odometer, check the fuel gauge and switch cars between users.
It also offers an insurance product that lowers your premium based on good driving behaviour - monitoring how you accelerate and brake. 
""Access to data is absolutely key for us to provide the services we do today,"" CEO Albertsen said. 
To extract car data, ALD plugs a wireless ""dongle"" into the vehicle that transmits information to an in-house developed platform that it pays U.S. startup Vinli to operate. Carmakers running similar services get that data directly, putting ALD at a competitive disadvantage, Albertsen said.
Stellantis, for instance, offers car sharing and rentals through its Free2Move unit. Volkswagen could take over rental company Europcar to take advantage of car sharing and subscription services.
And most major carmakers have their own leasing units, like BMW's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Mercedes-Benz's Athlon.
ALD's Albertsen said major fleet customers were willing to pay for the data but that he wanted regulations to ensure ALD's car-sharing unit paid the same as, for instance, Stellantis charges its own Free2Move division.
RISKS FOR REPAIR SHOPS
Insurers and car repair shops say it is paramount that the EU let drivers choose who accesses their vehicles' data.
    ""There is a need to regulate this, as you cannot leave this in the hands of car manufacturers,"" said Nicolas Jeanmart, industry group Insurance Europe's head of personal and general insurance. ""It should be for each driver to decide what they want to do with their data.""
FIGIEFA's Gotzen said that would allow car owners to link their preferred repair shop to their car and have it run remote diagnostics if they had car trouble, instead of relying solely on the manufacturer's recommendations.
""All of this is technically possible now, but we are hampered because car manufacturers prevent us from doing this,"" she said.
She said FIGIEFA's members are willing to adopt carmakers' cybersecurity processes and requirements, but added cybersecurity could serve as an excuse for carmakers to restrict access.

Richard Knubben, deputy director general of Leaseurope, which represents Europe's leasing and car rental firms, said the longer the EU took to legislate car data, the more independent repair shops are at risk of going out of business because they lack access to it.
""By the time we get legislation we may already be stuck with an imbalance that we can't fix anymore,"" Knubben said.

(Reuters) - US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Corp is interviewing potential candidates for its board as the food distributor tries to fend off a challenge from activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management, two people familiar with the matter said.
The company has compiled a list of director candidates and has been reaching out to them, the sources said. US Foods could try to shake up its 10-member board to persuade investors to back its directors after Sachem Head last month nominated seven candidates.
The sources did not give the identities and number of the board candidates US Foods is considering. It was also not clear when the company may make a final decision on the matter.
A representative for US Foods declined to comment.
A representative for Sachem Head declined to comment.
A month ago, US Foods split its chief executive officer and chairman roles, a move generally seen as trying to appeal to shareholders. CEO Pietro Satriano retained his board seat, while Robert Dutkowsky, the lead independent director, was named non-executive chair.
Sachem Head, which owns 8.7% of the company, has been invested in US Foods since 2018. Last month, its portfolio manager, Scott Ferguson, wrote in a letter to other shareholders that there was ""deep-seated resistance to real change at US Foods, and, in fact, a lack of acknowledgement that there is even a problem."" He said new directors are needed to hold management accountable.
Ferguson said he believes the company is lagging behind peers and has not improved operations as promised. US Foods, in response, said it profitably grew market share and expanded core earnings margins in the four years leading up to the pandemic and has since invested roughly $60 million to hire more salespeople to grow market share.
US Foods, valued at $7.9 billion as of the close of trading on Tuesday, has said that in December, Sachem Head turned down the company's offer to settle the fight by inviting Ferguson onto its board and allowing the hedge fund to help select another director.

""Due to the current volatile COVID situation in China we are temporarily planning on a daily basis,"" the company said in a statement, saying it was its latest update. 
""What we have lost so far in production can be recovered, i.e. via additional shifts, once the situation eases.""

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China is allowing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn's Shenzhen operations and construction sites in Shanghai to resume work on condition that their employees live and work in a bubble arrangement against COVID-19, offering some respite for firms. 
Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is among the companies that called production halts to comply with COVID strictures as China battles its largest outbreak since early 2020, fuelling concern over more disruptions to global supply chains.
U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for two days, Reuters reported on Wednesday, and companies from Chinese automaker BYD to KFC operator Yum China have flagged a hit to their operations.
Manufacturers in Guangdong province, one of the country's key export hubs and home to Shenzhen, told Reuters that factory shutdowns were causing lags in deliveries, while logistics difficulties were making it difficult to ship goods to overseas customers.
Ship owners and logistics firms said the queues of container ships outside major Chinese ports were lengthening, and while these ports remained open and vessels continued to dock, congestion was building and some container ships were re-routing to avoid expected delays.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday said it would as a precautionary measure pause production for another day in Changchun, but resume production in Shanghai after a 48 hour suspension, saying the current ""volatile"" COVID situation mean that it had to plan on a daily basis.
On Wednesday, Foxconn said it was able to restart some production and operations in the southern city of Shenzhen after adopting a ""closed-loop management"" system. 
The system used during the recent Winter Olympics in Beijing kept event personnel tightly sealed off from the public, with regular COVID-19 tests for those within.
It was largely seen as successful in preventing the spread of coronavirus at the Olympics, or in the community. 
""Some operations have been able to restart and some production is being carried out,"" Foxconn said in a statement, adding that the system at its Shenzhen facilities subjected employees living there to the required health measures.
""This process, which can only be done on campuses that include both employee housing and production facilities, adheres to strict industry guidelines and close-loop management policies issued by the Shenzhen government,"" it added. 
On Monday, authorities in the commercial hub of Shanghai, which has also imposed tough COVID curbs, said construction projects there would have to adopt a similar system to resume work. 
Still, such a system is unlikely to be feasible for many companies and large-scale disruption to manufacturing is expected as China tightens curbs. 
The Shenzhen Cross-border E-commerce Association, which groups about 2,800 retailers using platforms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), said its members felt the pain of supply disruptions. 
""There will be some short-term impact on cross-border platforms like Amazon, because we can't sell right now, otherwise buyers will suffer ... as the goods won't be delivered efficiently,"" said association chief Wang Xin.
Justin Jia, general manager of Baimi Tech, which makes equipment for printers from the manufacturing hub of Dongguan, said he was having issues with delivering internationally as his local provider suspended services this week. 

Despite the pains, he supported China's zero-COVID policy.
""If we just abruptly drop this policy, there's the possibility of large-scale transmission,"" he said. ""I feel like it's necessary.""

Investing.com – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock traded 5% higher in premarket Wednesday. The company said Kevin Johnson will step down as chief executive and former long-time CEO Howard Schultz will replace him, albeit on an interim basis as the coffee chain searches for a successor.
The stock also got a boost from J.P. Morgan’s upgrade to ‘overweight’ with a target of $101, up over 21% from its previous close. It cited attractive valuation as a reason for its optimism on the stock.
Johnson will vacate his position and that of board director, with effect from April 4, and will continue in an advisory role to the company through September.
The top-level change comes in at a time when the company is being accused of thwarting attempts to form unions at its various stores in the U.S while it undergoes pandemic-induced upheavals.
Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, has prevailed in six out of the seven unionization votes held at corporate-run Starbucks sites in recent months, establishing a labor foothold at the company. The group has petitioned to represent workers at over a hundred more Starbucks locations, Bloomberg said.
The company is facing soaring costs of raw materials, wages and logistics. Last month, it said its annual earnings per share will fall 4-6% compared to its previous estimate of no more than 4%. The cut in guidance followed after first quarter results fell short of estimates.
The company is raising its wages this year across the U.S. to $17 an hour, one among many retailers to be doing so in their struggle to retain staff.
It also faced a public outcry last month in China for raising coffee prices, the first time in over three years.
As of January 2, Starbucks had 34,317 stores worldwide. China accounted for more than one in seven of those."

Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing would roll out support for the Chinese economy as well as be cautious with measures for capital markets. 
The Xinhua news agency also cited Liu as saying, at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council, that regulators would coordinate better with their counterparts in Hong Kong.
The comments came a day after China stocks slumped to 21-month lows and mainland firms listed in Hong Kong plumbed 2008 lows.
Chinese stocks have been pummelled this year by rising domestic COVID-19 cases, fears about a blowback on China from its dealings with the sanctions-hit Russia, and continued regulatory crackdowns, including the risk of more mainland firms being delisted by U.S. exchanges.
Liu's assurances helped the Hang Seng index claw back all the ground lost on Tuesday and more. The HSI surged more than 9% to above the 20,000-point mark.
The Hang Seng Tech Index logged its biggest daily gain of 22%, recovering a good deal of the ground it had ceded since March 10 as regulatory fears piled up.
""It's quite positive, at least for the moment, as Liu addressed some key concerns in the market, especially regarding the regulatory crackdown,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. ""Liu also demands the PBOC to take action, so I believe the PBOC will do some easing in the next couple of months.""
The blue-chip CSI300 index gained the most since July 2020, rising 4.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 3.5% and the Hong Kong-listed China Enterprises Index gained 12.5%.
The CSI300 had lost 19% in the year to date through Tuesday's close. 
Among Hong Kong index heavyweights, Meituan jumped 32.1%, while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group soared 23% and 27%, respectively, logging their biggest daily gains. Other stocks caught in China's regulatory crosshairs, such as education, also rallied, with New Oriental Education & Technology Group rising 37%.
Liu's comments also helped to ease worries that encouraging economic data for January and February were leading to complacency among policymakers in Beijing.
The central bank surprised markets on Tuesday by not cutting one of its key lending rates, despite growing risks to the economic outlook, including mounting COVID-19 disruptions, increasing global risks from the Ukraine conflict and a weak property market.
Liu also said China encourages long-term institutional investors to increase stock holdings.
""It is quite reasonable for the Chinese government to properly step in, maintain the basic stability of the stock market and avoid further decline,"" Zhang Ming, Deputy Director of Institute of Finance & Banking at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in a note on Tuesday.
Zhang said this round of declines came against a very complex background, hit by ""external geopolitical shocks, China-U.S. game and malicious short-selling by international investors."" 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) downgraded 28 Chinese stocks listed in the United States and Hong Kong on Monday, citing ""China's geopolitical risks"" as ""more and more countries and corporates impose sanctions on Russia.""
""China's tech stocks are underpinned by value, while Liu's speech ignited the rebound,"" said Xie Chen, fund manager at Shanghai Jianwen Investment Management Co.
However, Nomura's Lu said markets might continue to be worried that China is getting isolated due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
""A meeting cannot solve all issues, given the economy is not in good shape,"" Yin Peixin, investment vice director at RBH (Shanghai) Asset Management Co said.
The jump in China shares lifted broader Asian markets, which also benefited from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's comments on Wednesday that peace talks were sounding more realistic but more time was needed.
China's yuan also reacted to Liu's comments and the sharp rebounds in the stock market. The yuan extended early gains and hit a high of 6.3460 per dollar at one point in the afternoon session, up nearly 0.4%.
Mainland China reported 1,952 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 15, the national health authority said on Wednesday, dropping from a two-year high caseload of 3,602 a day earlier.
A recent surge in infections had raised concerns about the rising economic costs of its tough measures to contain the disease.

Later on Wednesday, Xinhau news agency reported China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, citing the finance ministry.
The real estate sector, a key economic growth driver, has slumped as Beijing's campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis at some major property developers, resulting in bond defaults and projects being shelved or left unfinished.

(Reuters) -NortonLifeLock's $8.6 billion purchase of Avast hit a snag on Wednesday after Britain's anti-trust regulator said it would launch a deeper investigation into the proposed cybersecurity merger following competition concerns.
NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) in August proposed to buy London-listed rival Avast in a cash-and-stock cyber deal to create a leader in consumer security software catering to more than 500 million customers. 
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could harm competition and lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software, sending Avast shares tumbling 11%. 
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe. 
NortonLifeLock said on Wednesday it did not plan to propose any 'Phase 1' remedies, calling the CMA's decision ""surprising"". 
Avast said it remained of the view that the deal ""will only benefit consumers in the UK"".
NortonLifeLock said the investigation would delay the completion of the deal, which is now expected to close in mid-to-late 2022 and not April 4 as expected. 
The deal was initially expected to close last month, but the Arizona-based company was awaiting regulatory nods from the United Kingdom and Spain. It later got approval from Spain. 
""We are living more of our lives online and it is vital that people have access to competitive cyber safety software when seeking to protect themselves and their families,"" CMA Executive Director David Stewart said in a statement.
The deal, which would marry NortonLifeLock's strength in identity theft protection and Avast's privacy, has already received the green light in the United States and Germany.
Founded in Prague, Czech Republic, Avast is a pioneer of ""freemium"" software, whereby basic applications are free and subscribers pay for premium features. 

NortonLifeLock, previously known as Symantec, was renamed after it sold its enterprise business to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) in 2019. It has a larger premium business selling products to consumers to combat viruses, spyware and malware. 
NortonLifeLock's stock was down about 6% in premarket trading.

(Reuters) - SiFive, Inc., a RISC-V chip technology startup in Silicon Valley, said on Wednesday it raised $175 million in its latest round of funding and is now valued at $2.5 billion.
RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA), a base for building chips that defines what kind of software can run on the chips. Arm Ltd's ARM and Intel's x86 are the dominant ISAs used today for general-purpose processors, or the brains of computers, and are proprietary.
By comparison, RISC-V is open standard and free to use. Countries like China seeking to build their chip independence have been pushing to develop RISC-V chips.
SiFive's founders invented the RISC-V ISA in the labs of University of California, Berkeley. The company's business model is to build designs using RISC-V and charge money for the designs. Last year it released the P550 - a chip core design that aims to challenge Arm's dominance in smartphone chips, and said it would pair with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s factories to make the design available to hardware makers.
Last month as part of the launch of its $1 billion fund to support companies with disruptive technologies and build up its foundry business, Intel also laid out its path to support the Risc-V ecosystem.
""For the x86, the compute leader on the planet, to put their arm around SiFive and RISC-V and say, we're going to be investing hundreds of millions of dollars ... I think it's historically important for RISC-V,"" said SiFive President and CEO Patrick Little.

The latest round brings SiFive's total funding to over $350 million and was led by global investment firm Coatue. Existing investors Intel Capital, Sutter Hill, and some others joined this latest round. SiFive also counts SK Hynix Inc and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Ventures as investors.
""We're starting now to move towards institutional investors that are on Wall Street that will pull us to IPO,"" Little said.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  stock (NYSE:LMT) slipped 0.7% in premarket Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that Pentagon will request 35% fewer F-35 stealth jets in the next budget.  
According to the report, orders for 61 F-35s are likely to be placed with the defense contractor in the next budget, 33 less than originally planned.
The current budget contains orders for 85 jets, and next year's were due to rise to 94.
The proposed slowdown in purchases may be controversial given that it comes in at the time of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and raises questions around the administration’s commitment to a program projected to cost $398 billion in development and acquisition plus an additional $1.2 trillion to operate and maintain the fleet over 66 years, according to Bloomberg. 
Talks with Lockheed for the next F-35 contract -- for about 400 planes -- are going slower than anticipated, the news agency said. The fighter jet program remains hobbled by flawed execution of a crucial software upgrade and hardware capabilities that’s estimated to cost $14 billion.
The F-35 is currently being deployed to Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced Monday that Germany would buy 35 of the warplanes. The reduction in the Pentagon's orders for next year thus arguably create a space that may be filled by an upgrade to the airforce of a key NATO ally.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's top firms have offered pay rises of more than 2% at annual wage talks that wrapped up on Monday, marking an uptick from the previous year but still falling short of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's request for a bigger increase to spur growth.
Instead, Japanese workers now look set for another lean year. Wages, which have barely budged relative to the cost of living since the 1990s, remain one of the most pressing problems for the world's third-largest economy, forcing households to save rather than spend.
Kishida, who has called for a wider distribution of wealth, pressed companies to boost pay by 3% or more at the annual ""shunto"" spring wage talks with unions. While the negotiations are less important than they were decades ago, they still set the tone for much of the economy.
The average increase for big companies won't be known for a few more days, but economists said it looked likely to be north of 2%, a bump from last year's eight-year low of 1.86%.
""Today's outcome was a little stronger than expected,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute. ""Still, the pace of gains turned out to be moderate and it was not strong enough to boost the overall economy.""
Yamada said he expects the overall increase to be 2-2.5%.
Conglomerates Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp agreed with their unions to raise overall wages by 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively.
Automakers have already agreed to meet union demands in full, led by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co, although they did not disclose rises in percentage terms.
Any boost for workers and the economy is likely to be offset by recent increases in fuel and food prices, economists said.
RIPPLE EFFECT
""The question for us is how much of a ripple effect will this have on small- and medium-sized companies,"" said Tatsuya Sekiguchi, deputy executive committee chair at Tokyo Union, a labour group that represents workers who don't belong to bigger unions.
""If pay rises only at the big companies there isn't much meaning for us."" 
Kishida and Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda have stressed the need for wage hikes in achieving the 2% inflation target. Still, the premier's target of 3% seemed ""too ambitious"", according to Masamichi Adachi, an economist at UBS Securities.
Companies reliant on domestic demand were particularly hurt by COVID-19 related measures, making it difficult for them to increase wages, Adachi said. 
The Rengo trade union confederation went so far as to call for a 4% increase. But, as ever, Japanese firms remain cautious. 
While corporate Japan is sitting on a record $2.8 trillion in cash and deposits, managers point to the Ukraine crisis, spiking oil prices, a weakening yen and the pandemic as reasons to save money.
""It is difficult to assume the shunto wage hikes will help boost private consumption,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Some companies are shifting away from uniform wage hikes towards a more varied approach on remuneration. More of them are adopting merit-based wages, rather than seniority-oriented pay, to lure skilled talent.
The move coincides with structural changes in the labour market. About 40% of workers consist of part-time staff and contract workers, double the proportion seen in 1990, many of whom do not belong to labour unions.

Japan's economic growth likely ground to a near halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs and supply disruptions threaten to derail the country's economic recovery, a recent Reuters poll of economists showed.[ECILT/JP]

Investing.com – Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock traded 4.7% higher in premarket Wednesday on Bernstein upgrading it to ‘outperform’ with a $94 target, around 29% higher than its previous close of $73.11.
Analyst Mark Li earlier rated the stock ‘perform’ with a $58 target.
The stock is down around 18% in the last year against NASDAQ Composite's loss of 3.8% and 7.4% gains in S&P 500. It has lost 27% in 2022 so far.
Li said macro concerns have prompted a selloff, but a correction to the memory market, if any, won't be prolonged and won't change the structure, according to The Fly.
The analyst's base case has the DRAM cycle bottoming in six months. The analyst ruled out notable supply disruption or demand destruction in the near term due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.
DRAM or dynamic random access memory chips, which go into both personal computers and servers, accounted for 72% of the company’s FY21 revenue. The pandemic provided a big boost to the industry as people and corporates pivoted to digital and demand for devices grew. That demand, though reduced from its peak, stays elevated. 
Li noted that valuations in the global memory chip sector have fallen, ""providing a favorable risk/reward tradeoff now.""
The company will declare its second-quarter numbers on March 29.

Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of US-listed Chinese companies were rebounding strongly in premarket Wednesday on reports that the regulators in the two countries are nearing a cooperation plan.
ADRs of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) were up 20% and 21%, respectively, while Tencent Music (NYSE:TME), a unit of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), was up 28%. Shares of Hong Kong-listed Meituan (HK:3690) closed 32% up.

The bounce back is still small compared to the billions of dollars investors have lost in Chinese shares over the last 9-10 months ever since the Chinese authorities began a crackdown on their online firms. The truce between the world’s two largest economies will also mean a closure of that action.
Amid record-low interest rates and unprecedented liquidity over the last few years, several Chinese firms have tapped American investors to list on NYSE and Nasdaq. Many of them are internet consumer companies like Alibaba and JD.com, holding troves of data on Chinese consumers. Authorities in the mainland haven’t been comfortable with the data these companies may have to share with the US regulators to meet compliance norms.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said last week that US-listed securities for five Chinese companies are at risk of delisting. Worries about forced stock delistings from US exchanges had added to investors’ concerns about economic growth. Monday, JPMorgan China Internet analysts led by Alex Yao said they considered the sector “uninvestable” for 6 to 12 months, CNBC said."

TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S.-based aircraft leasing firm owned by Japan's Marubeni Corp and Mizuho Leasing Co Ltd has recovered two of the 12 aircraft it has been leasing to Russian airlines, it said on Wednesday.
Connecticut-based Aircastle Ltd company is one of multiple lessors scrambling to retrieve aircraft leased to Russian airlines before sanctions, imposed in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, take effect on March 28.
So far it has retrieved two of the aircraft, an Aircastle spokesperson said, adding it had leased aircraft to six Russian airlines as of February. 
""It is our best intention that all Russia-based leases be terminated and that all aircraft be returned to our possession,"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson declined to give further details, describing the situation as ""difficult and fluid"".
Russia this week passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners.
Russian airlines have almost 780 leased jets, with 515 leased from abroad.

The Dublin-based aircraft leasing arm of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group  (NYSE:SMFG), another major Japanese bank, has said it has 35 aircraft leased to five Russian airlines.
The book value of those aircraft is around $1.7 billion, SMFG said on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Fears over the Federal Reserve's hawkish shift have combined with geopolitical uncertainty to push the S&P 500 into a correction this year, yet historical data suggests tighter monetary policy has often been accompanied by solid gains in stocks. 
That offers a glimmer of good news to investors, who widely expect the central bank to announce the first interest rate increase in more than three years on Wednesday and are pricing some 180 basis points of tightening by the end of the year.
The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7% in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955. 
An analysis of 12 rate hike cycles overall by Truist Advisory Services found the S&P 500's posted a total return at an average annualized rate of 9.4% during the length of such cycles, showing positive returns in 11 of those periods. 
""Equities have generally risen during periods where the Fed funds rate is rising because this is normally paired with a healthy economy and rising profits,"" Keith Lerner, Truist's co-chief investment officer, wrote in a report. 
Many investors worry that this year may be more complicated than most, however, as markets are faced with soaring inflation which stands to be worsened by surging commodity prices in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine. 
The uncertainty has presented a dilemma for the central bank, with some investors worried policymakers could push the economy into a recession if it raises rates too far as it seeks to tamp down inflation. 
To be sure, rate increases have tended to weigh on stocks in the near-term. An analysis by Evercore ISI of four hiking cycles found that the S&P 500 fell an average of 4% in the first month following the start of the cycle. 
But the benchmark index was higher six months into the cycle by an average of 3%, and 5% higher on average after 12 months, according to Evercore. 
""The Fed doesn't want a recession and it generally takes a whole lot of hiking before the economy is put into position to potentially feel a recession,"" said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI. 
Emanuel said Evercore's ""base case"" is that the market is ""really in the midst of making a near-term bottom that is more likely to deliver the kind of six- and 12-month returns that a typical Fed rate hike cycle has engendered previously."" 
However, with the Fed starting to tighten monetary policy after offering massive support to help the economy endure the coronavirus pandemic, some investors are prepared for potential rockiness. 
The S&P 500 has slid more than 10% to start 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, dropping over 20% from its November all-time high. Tech and growth stocks have underperformed, as the rise in bond yields pressures the value of future cash flows that those stocks valuations' rely on. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) equity strategist Michael Wilson said that if the Fed ""is successful in orchestrating a soft landing"" for the economy as it raises rates this year, it could lead to much higher bond yields, that ""would simply weigh on equity valuations."" 

""The bottom line is the Fed is going to start removing the punch bowl this week,"" Wilson said in a note this week. 
""The question for equity investors is how far can they get on rate hikes given the already slowing growth and additional shock from the war?""

More financial services firms are setting net-zero targets to combat global warming but are under pressure to provide more details on how to get there, including making short-term cuts.
Standard Bank, a top oil and gas lender in Africa, has drawn fire from activists in the past. They said its new fossil fuel strategy, published on Wednesday, did not guarantee emissions reductions or rule out backing projects such as a planned Ugandan oil pipeline. 
Under its new strategy, the bank bans funding for new coal-fired power plants, which it has not financed since 2009, and expansion of existing plants. New mines would be possible in limited circumstances. 
New oil-fired plants or expansion plans would also only be possible in limited circumstances and it would reduce loans for oil exploration and production by 5% by 2030, the bank said.
It said its exposure to gas would grow to 0.91% of its loan book by 2030, before falling to 0.4% by mid-century, saying gas was a transition fuel as it emits less carbon than oil or coal. 
Chief Executive Sim Tshabalala said Africa needed to develop its economies, ensure reliable power supplies and cut poverty. 
""A total or immediate ban on further transitional projects in Africa in order to help reduce environmental pressure in much richer regions would be a cost too far,"" he said.
But campaigners say continuing to fund fossil fuels, including gas, will harm developing countries by driving climate change and make them more reliant on fossil fuels.
Standard Bank said it wanted to mobilise up to 300 billion rand ($19.9 billion) in sustainable finance - potentially including for transition fuels like gas - by the end of 2026 from a targeted 40 billion rand in 2022. 
It set targets for reducing lending to coal, oil and gas as a percentage of its loan book by 2050, and its strategy put it ahead of some local peers.
But Standard Bank did not guarantee an absolute reduction in its financed emissions, unlike global peers such as HSBC and UBS, so lending in this area could grow if its loan portfolio expanded.
Maaike Beenes, an campaigner at BankTrack, which tracks bank finance activities, said the absence of near-term emissions targets and other caveats meant Standard Bank's policy fell short of even some local rivals.

""That makes it even more disappointing that Standard Bank seems to have missed the opportunity to become a climate front runner with the policy announced today.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to rival Reliance Industries, the country's biggest conglomerate.
Amazon and Future agreed to out-of-court settlement discussions this month, but the two sides told India's Supreme Court on March 15 they had failed to resolve the matter.
Following is a guide to the dispute.
THE TRIGGER 
In 2019, Amazon and Future, the No. 2 player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a unit of the Indian group. 
That deal, Amazon argues, came with non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The deal's terms call for disputes to be settled by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
In 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance. 
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court.
THEIR ARGUMENTS
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation if the Reliance deal fails. 
THE STAKES
If Amazon were to prevail, that could set it up to become a bigger force than Reliance in India's $900 billion retail market.
Reliance has 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has around 1,500 and both are expanding fast into e-commerce.
Amazon has invested $6.5 billion in India - a key growth market where it is a leading e-commerce player. The Future partnership had helped Amazon to boost its online portfolio of grocery deliveries by integrating the Indian company's stores on its website.
Keeping Future away from Reliance chimes with Amazon's efforts to combat Ambani's growth plans. In one confidential legal filing, Amazon said Reliance's consolidated position with Future ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
THE WRANGLING
Future last year complained to India's antitrust agency that Amazon was making incorrect and contradictory submissions about the intent of the 2019 deal.
Amazon said it never concealed any information, but last December the watchdog suspended its approval of the 2019 deal with Future, saying there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope"" of the deal and its interest in Future's retail businesses.
In a setback for the U.S. giant, an Indian court in January halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings between the two sides in light of the antitrust decision.
RELIANCE' SEIZURE OF STORES AND FAILED TALKS
On Feb. 25, Reliance, which had not played a public role in the dispute, suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores, citing non-payment of rent it was due.
On March 3, Amazon extended an olive branch during a Supreme Court hearing, saying the ""whirlpool"" of litigation must end and proposed talks which Future agreed to.

On March 15, the two sides told the court the talks had failed. Earlier in the day, Amazon ran newspaper ads accusing the Indian firms of transferring the stores ""in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India."" Reliance hasn't commented, while Future denies any wrongdoing.
Sources said the talks collapsed because Amazon wanted at least $200 million - the amount it had invested in Future's unit - returned. But the Indian company said it wasn't in a financial position to do so.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn forecast an up to 3% fall in revenue for the year in what could be its first annual sales decline in six years, as a shortage of chips squeezes smartphone production and demand cools following a surge during the pandemic.
The Taiwanese company, which had stopped production in China earlier this week to comply with government curbs, said separately that it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campus after meeting government conditions for staff to live and work in a bubble.
The stoppages from Foxconn - the world's largest contract electronics maker - and other companies including Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) have fuelled concerns over how global supply chains could be impacted as China deals with its biggest spike in COVID-19 infections since early 2020.
Chairman Liu Young-way said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday that Foxconn would only have better clarity on supply chain uncertainty in the second half of the year. 
He said the record-high revenue in 2021, boosted by booming electronics demand following the pandemic, would lead to ""stable"" business this year due to a high base last year. 
""The pandemic has not eased, inflation is high and global politics are getting tense - these all further complicate supply and demand and lead to great uncertainty to our outlook,"" Liu said, calling 2022 a ""very challenging year"". 
Still, Liu said he was ""cautiously positive"" about the company's 2022 sales outlook, citing continuous growth from sectors including 5G smartphones and cloud products. 
He had previously warned that he expected the chip shortage to run into the second half of 2022.
Liu said on Wednesday that Foxconn expected limited impact from the war in Ukraine, echoing Taiwan's government which says any impact on the island's supply chains would be small because Russia and Ukraine are not the main import sources of raw materials such as nickel and neon. 
Apple has paused all product sales in Russia in response to the invasion, which Russia calls a special military operation.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said it expected revenue for the first quarter as well as the year to range between a 3% fall and a 3% rise. Analysts expected revenue this year to rise 1.2%. 
The company forecast smartphone revenue to be flat in 2022.
EV PLAN
Foxconn has in recent months announced plans to become a major player in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. On Wednesday, it said it doesn't expect revenue from EVs to be significant until 2023.
Foxconn, which has EVs deals with a variety of companies including Lordstown Motors Corp, forecast an annual production of up to 750,000 units by 2025.
In the fourth quarter ended December, Foxconn's revenue fell 6%, its first decline in five quarters, though still the second-highest for the quarter.
Revenue from its key smart consumer and electronics products business fell between 3% to 15%, in the period. Smartphones account for 60% of this business.
Revenue from its cloud and networking products as well as computing products was flat. Components revenue rose more than 15%.
Foxconn shares closed 0.5% higher ahead of the earnings release, versus a 0.1% gain in the broader market. They have fallen 2.4% so far this year.

Net profit fell 3.4% to T$44.4 billion ($1.55 billion) in the October-December period. That compared with the T$43.32 billion average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz AG won't cut spending on future electric vehicles even as it copes with supply-chain cost pressures exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the German automaker's chief executive said on Tuesday.
Ola Kaellenius, speaking during the company's opening of its first U.S. electric vehicle (EV) battery factory, also affirmed the company's 2022 financial outlook remained in place despite the conflict.
""We always protect the investment into future technology and future products,"" Kaellenius told Reuters. ""That is the seed which we will harvest. Not even in COVID year of 2020 did we cut back on R&D for crucial projects."" 
Mercedes is working with suppliers in Ukraine whose operations have been disrupted, he added, but it was ""too early to tell what the wider ramifications will be."" 
Rocketing gasoline prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine has amplified the challenges for established automakers that still rely on fossil fuel-powered vehicles for profits. And soaring prices for materials used in EV batteries like nickel, heavily mined in Russia, have also hurt the industry.
Kaellenius is trying to accelerate the shift by Mercedes from combustion technology company to a firm whose products do not emit carbon and rely on software and computing power.
Mercedes and other established automakers trail Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in EV sales and in developing computer and software systems to compete with the U.S. firm's stream of new features and updates.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck split from Mercedes in December and Kaellenius said Tuesday he saw no reason for Mercedes to further separate EVs from the combustion-engine operations. Some investors have pushed established automakers to create pure EV units. 
“There is only one Mercedes-Benz and that one company sooner than many people think will be an all-electric company,” Kaellenius said in an interview. 
Mercedes also said on Tuesday that Japanese battery maker Envision AESC would supply battery modules for U.S.-made Mercedes EVs from a new U.S. plant by the middle of the decade.
Alongside the launch of its Bibb County, Alabama, battery plant, Mercedes also previewed a large electric SUV to be built at the nearby Tuscaloosa, Alabama, assembly facility this year.
The EQS SUV and a smaller EQE electric SUV, also to be made in Alabama, join a growing lineup of electric SUVs seeking to challenge Tesla in the United States, China and Europe.
The battery plant, which will employ 600 workers, and the assembly facility are part of a 40 billion euro ($44 billion) drive by Mercedes to go all electric by 2030, where markets allow.
Mercedes, which plans to produce EV batteries in Europe, North America and Asia, aims to have eight cell factories with partners around the world with capacity to produce 200 gigawatt hours a year by the end of the decade.

The Mercedes Alabama assembly plant, which turns 25 this year, can build both electric and combustion vehicles, and is one of the largest Mercedes vehicle-making plants in the world.

Via Ukraine, Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) said it continues shipping gas to Europe in line with customers' requests with volumes set at 95 million cubic metres, down 13% from 109.6 million cubic metres on Tuesday.
Nominations for flows into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point fell to 727,734 megawatt hours (MWh) per day from 828,746 MWh/day on Tuesday, data from Slovakian operator TSO Eustream showed.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened higher on Tuesday on further signs of progress in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, which also brought much-needed relief to global oil markets. 
The mood has also been lifted by a sharp reversal in Chinese stock markets, which rocketed after verbal intervention from the central bank and government promising to keep the stock market stable and support the economy. 
By 4:20 AM EDT (0820 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 100 points, or 2.7%, while the broader Stoxx 600 was up 2.1%. The biggest gainer among major markets was the  French CAC 40 with a 2.6% rise while the FTSE 100  underperformed with a gain of only 1.6%.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had said on Tuesday that Russia had started to show a ""more constructive"" attitude in talks, and repeated his view that NATO membership - a key Russian bugbear - was out of reach for Ukraine.
Late on Tuesday, Ukrainian Presidential aide Mikhaylo Podolyak claimed that Ukrainian forces had started a counteroffensive in several regions. Unverified video footage on Wednesday claimed to show 15 Russian helicopters destroyed or damaged at an airbase outside Kherson.
Away from the battlefield, the day is likely to be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference. A first rate rise in nearly four years is considered all but certain, leaving Powell's guidance as the key variable.  U.S. retail sales data for February are likely to dominate early trading ahead of the Fed.
Elsewhere, investors will be nervously looking at the Russian bond market on a day when it has some big dollar and euro interest payments due. In response to Western sanctions, the Kremlin has enacted legislation to allow it to service foreign debt in rubles, something that will probably be viewed as a default by ratings agencies and bondholders. The ruble nonetheless strengthened nearly 2% in a nod to the ongoing peace talks. 
Technology stocks stood out in early trading, following their Chinese counterparts higher. All eyes were on Prosus (AS:PRX), the Dutch-listed vehicle that holds Naspers' stake in Internet giant Tencent. The start of trading in the stock was delayed due to problems establishing a price. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock rose 1.6%, the positive backdrop outweighing a profit warning from the carmaker due to the Ukrainian war. Like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW is having production problems due to its reliance on wire harnesses that are made in Ukraine.
In the U.K., spread betting specialist IG Group (LON:IGG) stock fell 3.3% after its fiscal third-quarter numbers suffered from a comparison with last year's meme stock craze. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro was up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.0994, while sterling was up 0.1% at $1.3056. The dollar index was down 0.4% at 98.665. 
Crude oil prices bounced after their sharp losses on Tuesday which were validated by a 3.75 million barrel increase in U.S. crude stocks. Brent futures were back above $100 with a 3% rise to $103.03 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 2.4% at $98.73 a barrel.

Under the airline's restructuring proposal, it would pay just 0.5% of debt owed and end its existing contracts. It was approved by its creditors and the High Court of Malaya last year.
The restructuring was proposed to avoid liquidation after the long-haul low-cost airline posted a record quarterly loss last September. It is one of many carriers in the Asia-Pacific region to have entered a court-overseen debt restructuring process to survive the pandemic.
""Cargo has been a strong lifeline for AAX and our recovery is already underway as a combination carrier with equal emphasis on cargo and passenger revenues, "" CEO Benyamin Ismail said.
""In the next two months we will recommence passenger services to several more international destinations in line with borders reopening.""

The completion of the debt restructuring will now pave the way for the proposed 500 million ringgit fund raising, the company said.

93,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 02:53AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) on Tuesday filed an application with U.S. regulators seeking emergency use authorization for a second booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 65 and older.
The submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration includes data collected in Israel, where a second booster is authorized for many people over age 18.
An analysis of data from over a million adults 60 years and older showed rates of confirmed infections and severe illness were lower among individuals who received an additional booster dose of the vaccine administered at least four months after an initial booster (third) dose compared to those who received only one booster dose, the companies said.
The news was first reported by the Washington Post https://wapo.st/3i7nJwO earlier on Tuesday.
U.S. health officials including top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci have raised the prospects of a fourth shot many times, suggesting one might be needed for older people and to prepare for the possibility of another surge of cases.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data has shown that vaccine efficacy wanes over time and that third shots help restore that efficacy, but it has not released comprehensive data based on age or health status.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla has several times in the past week told reporters that a fourth dose of the vaccine will be needed to offset waning protection gained with the third shot.
He told the Washington Post last week that data suggests a fourth dose dramatically improves protection against the dominant Omicron variant of the virus compared to the third dose after three-to-six months. 
The data Israel previously released was mixed.
Israel in late January said a fourth dose doubled protection against infection and increased protection against severe disease by 3 to 5 times compared to those who had received three shots, based on health ministry data. 
That analysis was more favorable than a small study of Israeli healthcare workers. When given at least four months after the third shot, a fourth dose was 30% effective against infection for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 11% for the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccine.
""The elderly and immunocompromised are the groups that would benefit the most from additional boost,"" said Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher. ""I think the data is supportive, but the benefits appear to be relatively small.""
Pfizer is looking at how a fourth dose performs in its own study of about 600 people. It and Moderna are betting additional booster doses will be needed for new virus variants that emerge.
While COVID cases are in retreat in the United State and much of the world, infections are rising in China as the Omicron variant spreads. In the UK and Europe, there has been a reversal in the downward trend of COVID cases as economies have opened up and a second version of Omicron circulates.

Pfizer last month said eventual 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine may not top its current forecast of $32 billion, a 13% decline from 2021 levels.
Separately, the FDA plans to convene its expert advisory panel in early April to consider whether there should be an October or November campaign to encourage some or all adults to get additional boosters, and whether the shots should be the same as current vaccines or be retooled to counter new variants, the Washington Post reported, citing a federal official.

The price increases will take effect from Wednesday, it said late on Tuesday, adding that customers who had paid deposits on vehicles prior to then would not be affected.
""Due to the impact of continued rises in raw material prices, BYD has officially guided Wang Chao Business and Ocean Network Business to adjust prices on relevant EV models,"" it said in a statement on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, referring to its sales channels. 
The announcement comes a day after Tesla raised its prices in China and the United States for the second time in less than a week. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has also said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics.
BYD also raised prices by 1,000-7,000 yuan on Feb. 1, citing the rising cost of raw materials and the cutting of government subsidies for new-energy vehicles (NEVs).
China has been promoting NEVs to help curb air pollution but believes the industry has matured enough to be driven by demand rather than subsidies, and in January slashed subsidies by 30%. 
The cost of raw materials is surging, exacerbated by supply chain disruption following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".

In particular, prices of metals used in cars have soared, including aluminium that is used in the bodywork, palladium used in catalytic converters, and nickel and lithium that power EV batteries.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The cost of insuring against a default in SoftBank Group Corp's debt hit a two-year high on Wednesday and its bond yield also climbed as sharp drops in the value of its tech investments have unnerved investors.
The value of marquee companies in the tech investor's portfolio have tumbled, hit by China's crackdown on tech companies, the prospect of higher interest rates and war in Ukraine. Among them,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Didi Global Inc have slid 35% and 64% respectively for the year to date.
""Debt investors are generally more conservative than equity investors, but if they're worried then equity investors probably should take notice,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry. 
SoftBank's 5-year credit default swaps rose by around 25 basis points, data from IHS Markit showed. The yield on its unsecured eurobond maturing in 2025 closed at 6.767% on Tuesday, the highest in almost two years. That compares with around 3.1% at the end of last year. 
SoftBank shares are trading at two-year lows and were mostly flat on Wednesday morning.
CEO Masayoshi Son said last month ""we will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets"" as he pivoted after the collapse of the sale of Arm to a plan to list the chip designer in the United States. 
SoftBank sold $1 billion worth of Coupang shares last week at a price per share 30% below that of a similar sale in September.
Some analysts have questioned SoftBank's ability to sell down its portfolio in choppy markets, given that many investors have turned sceptical on money-losing companies that lack a clear path to profitability.
""The lack of profitability means there is no clear floor for share prices,"" Mio Kato at LightStream Research wrote on Smartkarma, adding the Japanese company could face the risk of margin calls.
""We are thus unconvinced about their ability to monetise holdings in any significant manner,"" he wrote.
SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Clearing by investors exposed to Russian and Chinese bonds could have contributed to SoftBank's rising yields with the conglomerate seen as a riskier investment than other tech firms, said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners.
Analysts point to potential deterioration of SoftBank's loan-to-value ratio which rose to 22% at December-end from 19% three months earlier. SoftBank has pledged to keep the ratio below 25% in normal times with a 35% threshold in abnormal periods. 

""We believe the environment may be classified as a crisis... which allows SBG to use the 35% threshold instead,"" Trung Nguyen, a senior credit analyst at Lucror Analytics, wrote on Smartkarma.
In the early days of the pandemic, SoftBank's share price collapsed to below 4,000 yen as valuations slid, triggering a record buyback funded by asset sales. They were trading at 4,256 yen on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Days before Thanksgiving, Kris Sidial, a co-founder at volatility arbitrage fund The Ambrus Group, told investors the firm was betting that extreme price moves in some volatility-tracking exchange traded notes were likely to get worse.
The firm bought deep out-of-the-money call options on the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN - relatively inexpensive contracts that had a low chance of making money but stood to explode in value if the share price were to soar.
This week, VXX shares jumped as much as 60% over the course of two trading days.
The firm, which has an estimated $35 million to $55 million under management, is yet to close out its VXX positions, Sidial said. He declined to give details of the trade but said, at the peak of VXX's rise, the firm's percentage gains were in the double digits month-to-date.
VXX shares soared for a second day on Tuesday, a day after British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it had suspended the sales and issuance of the shares due to capacity constraints. 
Sidial believed Cboe Options Exchange's decision in November to extend trading hours on S&P 500 and Cboe Volatility Index options to nearly 24 hours each business day had the potential to spur bigger price swings for some ETNs that seek to track volatility. 
""Call buyers of derivatives on these exchange traded products may get very lucky,"" he wrote to investors in a Nov. 22 letter seen by Reuters. 
Global financial markets have seen a sharp rise in volatility, with big price swings in stocks and commodities, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict spooks investors and the U.S. Federal Reserve gets set to raise interest rates for the first time in three years.
Analysts expect VXX shares to still see wild price swings as the ETN's trading price strays far from its indicative price - where it should be trading based on the value of its underlying securities. 
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. 
But with the suspension of new shares that process can go awry. On Tuesday, VXX traded as much as $14 higher than its indicative price. The shares finished about flat at $28.70 and is up 9% for the week.
""This is essentially scarcity value, i.e. demand for VXX shares that would otherwise have been met with share creation,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading. 
Thompson's firm, which had ""some exposure"" to VXX sold all of it on Tuesday, he said. 
""We don't want to be around when/if they start issuing shares again,"" he said.
Some investors said the recent wild moves in VXX revives memories of another volatility-tracking product - VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN, which collapsed nearly 60% over the course of four trading sessions in March 2012, after the ETN's issuer,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), reopened issuance of shares after a one-month suspension. 
Investors who held a bearish view on VXX, meanwhile, are facing sharp losses after the ETN's surge.
LONG TIME COMING? 
Sidial and some others have long worried about the possibility of price dislocations in ETNs, where much of the price stability of these products depends on the ability of authorized participants' (APs) - typically large banks - to buy and sell shares efficiently. 
Even when share issuance has not been suspended, however, APs have occasionally struggled to keep the price stable, as liquidity dries up during episodes of market stress.
Sidial said the ability to make trades at nearly any hour of the day has the potential to exacerbate volatility by allowing market participants to react immediately to potentially negative news, often worsening market liquidity during market shocks.

The Cboe has in the past said the ability to trade S&P 500 and VIX options nearly around the clock would help investors manage risk more efficiently. 
""This is something we have been tracking for quite some time,"" Sidial said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with Chinese shares easing a selloff. However, market volatility remains due to the conflict in Ukraine and investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.67% by 10:34 PM ET (2:34 AM GMT). Wednesday’s trade data showed that exports grew 19.1% year-on-year and imports grew 34% year-on-year in February 2022. The trade balance was –JPY668.3 billion ($5.65 billion), while the adjusted trade balance was –JPY1.03 trillion.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.75% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.88%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.51%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.43% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.34%. Chinese shares listed in the U.S. also began to slowly climb out from a recent selloff, although fears of a regulatory crackdown and China’s ties to Russia sparking a U.S. backlash continue to weigh on Chinese stocks.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision later in the day, where it is widely expected to hike interest rates. However, further hikes are less certain as the growth risks from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 remain.
“The confluence of events leading into this meeting puts policymakers in a very unenviable position,” Nomura Securities International Inc. executive director Matt Rowe told Bloomberg.
“It’s being publicly debated whether if you create a recession to push the number down to 2%, is that actually a policy error?” he added, in reference to inflation.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday, with the Bank of Japan following a day later. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane will speak at a conference on Thursday.
Ukraine and Russia will resume talks to end the conflict between the two countries later in the day. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted that the negotiations are “difficult” but there is room for compromise. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine’s leadership of not being “serious” about resolving the conflict.
Western sanctions against Russia also remain a risk, with the country highly likely to default as Russian decrees will likely prevent dollar settlements. But Russia also began paying $117 million in interest on dollar bonds.
Meanwhile, Tuesday’s U.S. producer price inflation (PPI) grew 10% year-on-year, and grew 0.8% month-on-month, in February. The core PPI grew 8.4% year-on-year and 0.2% month-on-month. The NY Empire State Manufacturing Index for March was -11.80.
The data compounds the Fed’s dilemma, according to some investors.
“We will be closely watching the Fed’s dot plot, which we expect to signal five or six interest-rate hikes this year, more than December’s projections but in line with market expectations,” New York Life Investments portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin said in a note.
“A dot plot projecting more hiking would likely be a hawkish signal and could result in an earlier yield curve inversion.”"

(Reuters) -Movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it agreed to buy a large stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp for $27.9 million, capitalizing on its popularity with retail investors to provide a financial lifeline to the troubled gold and silver mine operator.
Hycroft, which owns a mine in Northern Nevada, was on the verge of bankruptcy before AMC's investment. Now, it plans to raise up to $500 million by selling shares in the open market over time, Hycroft said on Tuesday. Such a large capital raise is not typically accessible to a small company in dire financial straits.
Yet the fascination of retail investors with so-called meme stocks have made such deals possible. AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on Tuesday said the company raised a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" in 2021 thanks to stock sales snapped up by retail investors. 
Hycroft said on Tuesday it had also attracted ""atypical retail investor interest"" but warned investors that buying its stock could result in losing all or a substantial portion of their money.
Hycroft shares ended trading up 9.35% at $1.52 after almost doubling in value earlier in the day on news of the deal. AMC shares closed up nearly 6.9% at $14.48
Aron said Hycroft resembled the movie-theater chain a year ago, facing a liquidity crisis despite ""rock-solid assets.""
Still, AMC's investment ""is a little baffling"" and its cash would be better used on repaying debt that exceeded $5 billion at the end of December, said Alicia Reese, a Wedbush Securities analyst.
AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott will each invest $27.9 million and receive separate 22% stakes in Hycroft, the companies said. They will also receive an equal amount of shares in warrants exercisable at a price of $1.07 per share.
Mudrick Capital, a Hycroft creditor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with Hycroft in 2020 made it the company's largest shareholder with a 40% stake, helped put together the deal with AMC, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Jason Mudrick, the firm's founder and chief investment officer, called Aron last week asking him to advise Hycroft on how it could launch a stock market offering to stave off bankruptcy, the person familiar with the matter said. 
Hycroft, previously known as Allied Nevada, had filed for bankruptcy before and emerged from it in 2015. More recently, its stock rose after attracting interest from retail investors on social-media platform Reddit. 
Mudrick knew Aron because he had previously invested in AMC and participated in a debt restructuring deal in 2020 that helped keep the movie theater operator afloat.
Aron responded that he was interested investing in Hycroft to diversify AMC's business, and that such a deal could help Hycroft attract more investor interest, the source said.
WHIRLWIND TOUR 
Mudrick chartered a plane on Sunday to fly AMC executives and directors to Nevada for a whirlwind tour of Hycroft's mining operations in the town of Winnemucca the next morning, the source said. 
The deal closed just before 4 p.m. EDT Monday, the source said. Before the negotiations, the company's cash had dwindled to roughly $8 million, the source added.

AMC had no immediate comment on Mudrick's work on the deal, while Hycroft did not respond to a request for comment. 
Sprott and other creditors agreed to push back Hycroft's debt repayments to 2027. The boost in Hycroft's finances may allow it to develop an expensive mill to unearth gold and silver.

The Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 6.3% in early trading on Wednesday, erasing some of the 22% decline since late last week that saw the gauge touch new lows every day. Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. and GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS) Ltd. were the best performers, gaining around 15% each. The move tracks an advance overnight in its U.S.-listed counterparts. 
Investors are weighing cheap valuations following the historic rout against poor sentiment in the sector as regulatory risks linger, including a possible U.S. delisting of Chinese firms. Concerns related to Beijing’s ties with Russia and a lockdown in China’s tech hub Shenzhen are also adding to worries.

New York (Reuters) -The three main Wall Street stock indexes rallied on Tuesday, a day before an expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while oil prices dropped 7% on hopes of an end to the conflict in Ukraine.
Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in three years by at least 25 basis points amid surging prices. Traders will also be closely watching the Fed for details on how it plans to end its bond-buying program.
Ahead of the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year note yields eased from more than two-year highs and were last at 2.1544%, after earlier rising to 2.169%, the highest since June 2019.
""I think the big event this week is going to be Fed discussing what they're going to do with the portfolio and how fast they're going to move. The expectation in the short term of course is going to be the raising of the rates by a quarter of a percent,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund in Wisconsin.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500, which had slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions, rallied, driven by technology, consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.82% to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 gained 2.14% to 4,262.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.92% to 12,948.62.
""What you're seeing is relief rallies on a bear market. There's hopes and expectations that something will start resolving in Ukraine,"" Plumb added. 
European stocks, which had been rebounding in recent sessions, dipped after China reported a jump in coronavirus cases and new restrictions. The ongoing war in Ukraine also weighed on European shares despite continuing ceasefire talks and some positive signs of a breakthrough.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.28% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had closed 2.73% lower overnight.
Oil prices tumbled more than 6% to their lowest in almost three weeks on Tuesday as supply disruption fears eased on Ukraine peace hopes and surging COVID-19 cases in China spurred demand concerns.
Brent futures plummeted 6.5% to settle at $99.91 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 6.4% to settle at $96.44 a barrel. Both contracts settled below $100 per barrel for the first time since late February.

The U.S. dollar lost value to the euro and other major currencies after oil prices fell and ahead of the Fed's expected rate hike. The dollar index fell 0.043%, with the euro up 0.04% to $1.0943.
Safe-haven gold fell nearly more than 1% to a two-week trough. Spot gold dropped 1.8% to $1,915.48 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 1.55% to $1,929.30 an ounce.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Greenland Holdings Corp Ltd, a major Shanghai-based Chinese state-backed property developer responsible for marquee projects at home and abroad, was scrambling for funds late last year, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
In danger of defaulting on a $500 million offshore bond in December, it was rescued after Shanghai authorities told local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to step in and buy new Greenland debt, sources told Reuters.
Greenland's financial straits and subsequent bailout, details of which are previously unreported, mark the first known example where Chinese SOEs have been directly ordered to participate in a property sector bond offering - highlighting more active and targeted action being taken by authorities as they seek to limit risks posed by the industry.
Here is what happened.
Greenland, China's No. 7 property developer and highly leveraged, became swept up in a sector-wide debt crisis that roiled international markets last year amid fears that a large-scale developer collapse could derail the world's second-largest economy.
Like many of its peers, it was reeling from tighter caps on debt ratios introduced in January 2021 that resulted in a liquidity squeeze across the sector.
By October, some long-term lenders such as CITIC Bank were reducing their lending, two people with direct knowledge of Greenland's financial situation said, adding the state of affairs was not helped by downgrades to its debt ratings from credit rating agencies. 
It had sought fresh financing from trust firms and leasing companies but a sharp rise in interest rates was proving to be a stumbling block, they said.
In the fourth quarter, Greenland embarked on more drastic steps - slashing real estate-related headcount by 30% and placing more strategic emphasis on infrastructure construction projects that accounted for half of its revenues, they added.
Even so, it did not have sufficient funds to cover the likely event that many holders of the $500 million puttable bond would seek to exercise their right to redeem it roughly a year early on Dec. 16, they said.
Sources for this article were not authorised to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Greenland said in a statement to Reuters it has always repaid its domestic and overseas debts in full and kept financing costs low, adding that its liabilities reduction plan was progressing smoothly. CITIC Bank did not respond to requests for comment.
WHITE KNIGHTS
Concerned about Greenland's financial situation, Shanghai municipal authorities had sometime during the fourth quarter asked its lenders to be flexible with repayment extensions and to maintain rather than drop existing relationships, said one person with knowledge of the matter.
Then in early December, the Shanghai government's state asset administrator held a meeting with representatives of seven SOEs, ordering them to buy new dollar bonds issued by Greenland, according to four people briefed about the gathering.
Shanghai Municipal Investment Group, Bank of Shanghai, Shanghai Land (Group) Co and Lujiazui International Trust Co were among the SOEs, said two of the four sources.
On Dec. 14, Greenland announced it had raised $350 million in a dollar bond issue. Due August 2022 and carrying a 7.974% coupon, it was a rare developer bond deal at a time when concerns about the sector had dried up new note issuance. The only purchasers were the seven SOES, two sources said.
Three days later, Greenland said it had redeemed 85.9% of the $500 million bond after put options were exercised. 
The Shanghai government's state asset administrator, the Shanghai municipal government and the four SOEs named above did not respond to requests for comment.
China's property sector crisis has posed a high-stakes quandary for President Xi Jinping, who is seeking to secure an unprecedented third term this year. 
On one hand, the government wants to impose financial discipline on an industry known for unbridled borrowing and which by some metrics accounts for a quarter of China's economy. But it also can't afford to derail growth or fuel social unrest. 
Bond defaults by China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer with some $300 billion in liabilities, as well as by other developers, have seen authorities soften their initial stance that market forces would hold sway.
Rules relating to M&A and capital raising in the sector have been relaxed and developers have been given easier access to pre-sale funds held in escrow accounts. At last week's annual meeting of parliament, Premier Li Keqiang signalled more easing was in the works.
Local authorities have also encouraged SOEs to purchase developer assets, sources have previously said, although it is unclear if any SOEs have been ordered per se into an acquisition. 
SHIMAO TOO 
Shimao Group Holdings, a developer which has put all its property up for sale to repay debt, has also had a helping hand from Shanghai municipal authorities. 
Twenty-seven of Shimao's creditors were asked to maintain lending positions and to not publicly undermine Shimao's creditworthiness, said a separate person who attended a creditor meeting. ""Everyone was stony-faced, no one had any reaction,"" said the person.
Shimao did not respond to requests for comment. 
Greenland, however, appears to have had more government intervention than most other developers. The sources who spoke with Reuters were not sure why but noted Greenland is state-backed and has high-profile projects.
It recently built Sydney's tallest residential tower and has billions of dollars worth of projects in London, New York, Los Angeles and Paris. At home, its projects include construction of the tallest building in northwest China and it is heavily involved in building subways, highways and bridges.
The use of government-backed credit support rather than the purchase of fire-sale assets is becoming the preferred policy option for reducing risk in the sector, one government policy advisor told Reuters.
There is also a growing consensus that when deciding which firms will gain government support, it will be size rather than whether a firm is government-backed or private that will be the key factor, the person said, adding the bottom line is to prevent a financial crisis.
Just how far the government will support Greenland remains to be seen. Its financial difficulties are not over. It has $190 billion in total liabilities, and according to Refinitiv data, outstanding bonds worth $7.1 billion, of which $3.7 billion is due to mature this year.
The order to SOEs to support Greenland only pertained to the $350 million purchase of new debt, the sources said.

At one SOE at least, there is fear that Greenland might fall further into financial strife and of the potential fallout if that happens.
The written instructions with a Shanghai SASAC letterhead that ordered the purchase of Greenland's bonds are being kept in a safe place in case Greenland defaults and SOE officials are called to account for their actions, said one person with knowledge of the matter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday and the S&P 500 ended a 3-day skid as another drop in oil prices and a softer-than-expected reading on producer prices helped ease inflation fears among investors, with the focus turning to the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement.
Brent crude settled below $100 a barrel after rocketing higher to more than $139 last week, providing some temporary relief for equity investors that have seen stocks come under pressure this year from surging inflation concerns, uncertainty over the Fed's policy path to tame rising prices and more recently, escalating conflict in Ukraine.
U.S. producer prices increased solidly in February as the cost of goods like gasoline surged, and further gains are in the pipeline following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has made crude oil and other commodities more expensive.
Still, the data for the 12 months through February matched expectations predicting a 10% increase in producer prices, while the producer price index for final demand on a monthly basis increased 0.8%, just shy of the 0.9% estimate and lower than the 1.2% increase registered in January.
The market is now fully pricing in a rate hike of at least 25 basis points when the central bank makes its policy statement on Wednesday. Investors will also be closely watching the Fed's projections for the path of rate hikes this year and in coming years to rein in inflation.[IRPR] 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has recently floated multiple rate hikes this year as the Fed seeks to curb inflation. 
""The fact is (PPI) was weaker than the expectation so therefore the idea that Jay Powell is right going 25 basis points seems to be the way the market feels today, that could change tomorrow,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida. 
""The market is in a very oversold position, there are still going to be bumpy roads ahead but today could just be one of those snap-back rallies like we saw last week.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 599.1 points, or 1.82%, to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 gained 89.34 points, or 2.14%, to 4,262.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 367.40 points, or 2.92%, to 12,948.62.
The S&P 500 slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions and recently joined the Dow, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 in forming a ""death cross"" technical pattern, when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average, which some investors believe signals more near-term weakness is likely.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks leading the way while energy, the sole positive sector on the year, slumped nearly 4% on the day along with crude prices. 
Megacap growth stocks gained with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) up 3.87% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) up 2.97%, providing the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Meanwhile, investors also closely tracked a steep jump in daily COVID-19 infections in China for the possibility of denting global economic growth, and progress in Ukraine-Russia talks to end their weeks-long conflict.
In the latest hint at compromise, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv was prepared to accept security guarantees that stop short of its long-term objective of the NATO alliance membership, which Moscow opposes.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) gained 8.70% and United Airlines jumped 9.19% after the U.S. carriers raised their current-quarter revenue forecasts, even as they trimmed capacity. The Arca Airline index climbed 5.57%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.46 billion shares, compared with the 13.78 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 386 new lows.

Shares in Grupo Aeromexico, which operates the country's main airline and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, fell 27% to 59 cents and have lost about half their value in the past four days.
Analysts have said trading in the shares has not reflected a creditor deal that was approved in January.
""We attribute the movements of the last few months to mere speculation, since it was known that the value of the shares would be practically zero,"" said Brian Rodriguez, a stock market analyst at Monex financial group.
Through the tender offer, which took place between Feb. 15 and March 14, investment vehicle Alinfra purchased 133.2 million shares of the airline at a price of one cent each.
A subsequent share exchange will dilute the company's current capital stock to less than 0.01% of its capital after the restructure.
Aeromexico declared bankruptcy in June 2020 amid a slump in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Its shares were trading at around 15 pesos each in January 2020.

The lawmakers cited the company's previous violation of an agreement with the Justice Department that allowed the controversial merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation in 2010. That was settled with Live Nation agreeing to refrain from retaliating against venues that do not use its Ticketmaster service for every event.
The lawmakers asked the department to assess Live Nation's compliance with the updated consent decree.
""As live events continue to open up, American consumers are confronting skyrocketing ticket prices, opaque terms, and exorbitant fees. Yet live entertainment markets, especially ticket markets, are dominated by one corporation, Live Nation, which cemented its dominance through its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster,"" they wrote to Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division.

The letter noted with dismay that Live Nation had an ""aggressive acquisition strategy"" that included its purchase of Rival, a ticketing startup designed to compete with Ticketmaster.
""We are deeply concerned that the Department’s past enforcement and negotiated remedies in this industry have failed to adequately foster and protect competition in live entertainment and ticketing markets,"" they wrote.

U.S. drugmaker Lilly said it will send medicines for urgent medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes. It is suspending sales of what it called ""non-essential medicines"" as well as all investments and promotions. It also will not start any new clinical trials there.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis also said it would stop investments, marketing activities there and all scientific events organized by the company or external parties in Russia.
U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), which owns blockbuster wrinkle treatment Botox, said it has temporarily suspended operations for all its aesthetics products in the country. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc said it was stopping enrollment in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus as well as any openings of new sites, but was committed to providing essential health products. 
On Monday,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) had pulled back from non-essential spending in the country. Pfizer and Bayer said they would maintain a supply of medicines to Russia.
Western companies have come under pressure to leave Russia, but the healthcare sector has not pulled out because medicine and medical devices and equipment are considered necessary for humanitarian reasons and are excluded from sanctions.
""While it is good to see large corporations, including in the pharmaceutical space, take a proactive stand against war and aggression, any step to suspend medical supplies, even for non-essential items, could end up putting the health of patients in Russia at risk,"" said Anant Bhan, a global health and bioethics researcher.
Getting supplies in has already become tougher. Sanctions have cut off Russian banks from the international financial system, while shipping companies have halted services to the country, interrupting delivery of medical supplies.

In a post titled ""Lilly and Lilly Foundation Provide support for People in Ukraine"" on its website, Lilly said any profit from continued sales in Russia will be donated to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief.
Lilly is the first to exclude drugs it designates as ""non-essential"". The company told Reuters in an email that an example of a non-essential medicine was Cialis, a branded erectile dysfunction treatment available from other sellers as a generic drug. It did not disclose specific treatments affected by the decision.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday, as investors piled into to beaten tech sectors ahead of the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 rose 2.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, or 599 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9%.
Tech found its footing, climbing more than 3% as the recent weakness in big tech and chip stocks appeared to entice dip-buying action.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led the gains in big tech, with both up more than 2% and 3% respectively, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also racked up gains.
Also helping tech, Treasury yields took a breather somewhat from their recent melt-up just as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
With the odds of the 25-basis point nearly fully priced in, investor attention will be focused on the Fed’s summary of economic projections to gauge the shift in interest rate expectations for this year.  
Commentary on how committed the Fed is on tackling inflation will also be closely watched. If the central bank indicates that it favors a wait and see approach that could stoke worries about whether the Fed is able to get inflation under control at time when concerns about a recession ahead continue to increase. 
“I think the market will be disappointed if the Fed strikes a tone that we're going to raise rates by 25 basis points and then see how things go,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
Sentiment on the broader market was also helped by easing concerns that higher for longer oil prices would dent global growth as WTI fell further below $100 a barrel.
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, which was the only sector in the red.
The fall in oil prices wasn’t stemmed by signs that an imminent diplomatic solution to end war appears to be some ways off after Russian President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly said that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude towards finding mutually acceptable solutions.”
Industrials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by the airline stocks after Southwest, United Airline and Delta reported stronger than expected bookings and signaled a quicker than expected recovery in travel demand.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up more than 9%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was up more than 8%. 
In other news, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) increased nearly 5% after it teamed up with Volvo Cars to explore the potential of installing electric vehicle chargers throughout its stores nationwide.
Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) jumped 15% after one of its investors, Mill Road, a private equity firm, urged the board to explore a sale in the range of $55 to $70 per share. The stock closed at $31.99 on Monday."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Wintershall Dea AG said on Tuesday Russian oligarch German Khan, who was sanctioned by the European Union, was stepping down from its board, causing further upheaval at the German oil company with several ties to Russia.
Wintershall Dea said its business activities would be unaffected by the move but it was examining whether LetterOne's shareholding would be affected. 
The oil and gas producer is a joint venture of German chemicals giant BASF and LetterOne, the holding company controlled by Russian oligarch Mikail Fridman, who is also linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and who was sanctioned by the EU last month. 
""No confidential information regarding Supervisory Board topics will be shared with German Khan any longer,"" Wintershall Dea said in a statement.
Khan, alongside Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, was among a new list of business leaders whose assets were frozen by the EU for supporting the Russian state.
That was part of new sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia.
Khan was also among three LetterOne shareholders who last week quit as directors from the London-based investment group they co-founded with oligarch Mikhail Fridman as it tries to distance itself from Russia.
Earlier on Tuesday, Khan also resigned from private Russian lender Alfa-Bank, which he co-owns.
""With regard to the most recent inclusion of German Khan to EU and UK sanctions lists, it is being examined whether this has further consequences for LetterOne as shareholder of Wintershall Dea AG,"" the company added. ""As a matter of precaution, all payments to LetterOne will be stopped for the time being.""
BASF holds 67% of the voting rights in Wintershall Dea, or a total stake of 72.7% when non-voting preference shares are taken into account, with the remainder held by Letter One.
Announcing the sanctions, the EU described Khan as ""believed to be one of the most influential persons in Russia"" who, like Fridman, ""maintains a close relationship with Vladimir Putin and continues to trade significant favours with him.""

Wintershall Dea, which has had a large oil and gas exploitation business in Russia, was also a major financial backer of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was blocked from going into operation by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz shortly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month.
Wintershall Dea, which has relied on Russia for nearly half of its oil and gas production, earlier this month stopped payments to Russia and wrote off its 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) financing in Nord Stream 2.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday raided several automotive companies and associations in several countries on suspicion of breaching the bloc's cartel rules, while Britain's competition authority also launched a probe.
The European Commission also sent companies requests for information, it said without disclosing company names.
""The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans which are considered waste,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) said it ""confirms that it was visited today by European Commission investigators"" and that it was cooperating fully. 
Opel, a brand of world No. 4 carmaker Stellantis, said its offices had been searched by investigators.
""The subject of investigation is the area of recycling end-of-life vehicles,"" Opel said in a statement. ""Of course, we cooperate fully with the authorities."" 
German carmaker BMW said it had received a request for information and would respond.
Mercedes Benz said it did not expect to be fined because it had approached the EU regulator and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority with information as a ""leniency applicant.""
The CMA said it was investigating a number of unnamed automakers and some industry bodies in its own end-of-life vehicle probe, and that it was cooperating with the Commission.Ford said in a statement that it had been served with a notice by CMA ""relating to the recycling of old or written-off vehicles, specifically cars and vans, also known as end-of-life vehicles"".
""Given the situation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to say more at this stage except to state that we will fully cooperate with the CMA's review,"" the U.S. carmaker said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and its premium brand Audi both declined to comment. A spokesman for Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) said the carmaker had not been raided by investigators.
Companies found breaching EU cartel rules face fines up to 10% of their global turnover.

Investing.com – Stocks surged on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates as oil prices plunged for a second day this week.
The Fed is largely expected to raise rates a quarter point when it announces its latest policy moves tomorrow afternoon, followed by a press conference by Chair Jerome Powell, who may be able to shed more light on the Fed’s approach to rates given the turmoil caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The central bank has to strike a delicate balance between fighting inflationary pressures and acting patiently so as not to trigger a slowdown, as soaring energy prices have put a damper on consumer sentiment.
Analysts will focus on the Fed’s projections for how far it will have to raise rates to tamp down inflation.
Reuters reported that data on Tuesday showed U.S. producer prices rose solidly in February, both for the year and month. 
Oil prices are in retreat, down another 6% on Tuesday amid a surge in Covid cases in China, which is locking down regions that include manufacturing centers. That threatens to curtail growth, driving the per-barrel price of crude back below $100.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is holding a meeting next week, calling on the leaders of member states such as President Joe Biden to convene over the escalating Ukraine situation. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Airline stocks
U.S. airline stocks are in for a comeback after several carriers raised revenue forecasts on stronger demand and travel rebounds. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) all rallied on Tuesday.
2. Oil continues to fall
Oil prices continued their tumble for a second straight day, with both U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent tumbling as much as 8% on Tuesday before pulling back some. The drop is even more precipitous — at more than 20% — when compared to the 14-year highs of above $130 a barrel attained by both benchmarks just over a week ago.
3. Fed statement
Of course it’s been well-telegraphed that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates tomorrow, and likely by a quarter-point. That’s half the amount people were thinking just a few weeks ago, before Russia attacked Ukraine. But people will be listening for what the Fed has to say about the outlook now that war has broken out and the economic picture has gotten cloudier.

GM's premium brand already has received 233,000 expressions of interest from consumers, Rory Harvey, Cadillac's global vice president, said.
""We can't tell yet how many of those will translate into orders,"" Harvey told a media briefing. ""Typically, 10% of hard raisers turn into orders - we anticipate a higher order rate"" than usual.
GM told suppliers earlier this year to gear up for production of 25,000 Lyriqs in 2022, up from the previous 3,200 planned, sources told Reuters in February.
Harvey said GM brought forward the production launch of the Lyriq by nine months, reflecting higher-than-expected initial demand.
The Lyriq is the first of an all-new portfolio of electric vehicles that Cadillac plans to roll out by 2030.
The mid-size crossover goes into limited production March 21 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, with the first rear-wheel-drive models heading to dealers in late May, Cadillac sales boss Eric Cunningham said. 
Cadillac will formally open the Lyriq order bank on May 19 and will also take orders for the all-wheel-drive variant, which won't go into production until late 2022.

""We're still working through how many Lyriqs we can build this year and next,"" said Harvey, citing the supply of semiconductors and batteries as potential short-term constraints.
Cunningham said customers will be able to order the Lyriq online through the brand's new digital retail platform, then select a local dealer from which to take delivery.

STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has picked Germany as the site for a huge new chipmaking complex, giving the first details of a $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on imports and ease a supply crunch for manufacturers.
The plan is the latest big investment announcement by a major semiconductor maker as the industry tries to catch up with a boom in demand for chips used in everything from smartphones to cars, though there will be no quick fix as the new German plants won't come online until 2027.
The U.S. chipmaker is spreading its investments in Europe around half a dozen countries, including boosting its existing factory in Ireland, setting up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy. 
The initial spending will total 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros in Germany, where the auto industry is likely to be a prime customer for cutting-edge chips that could use technology as small as 2-nanometers.
German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) highlighted the pain caused by chip shortages on Tuesday, saying it sold 2 million fewer cars than planned last year due to the issue.
Intel's announcement comes after the European Commission last month set out plans to encourage chip manufacturing in the European Union, with proposed new legislation to ease state aid rules for chip factories and enable $17 billion in additional public and private investment. 
Chipmakers are looking to build more factories to make advanced chips for use in premium smartphones like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest iPhones that use chips with 5-nanometer technology. A nanometer is just several atoms wide.
Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon was confident Intel could manage the roll out of investments to match demand going forward, and was positive on expanding with government subsidies.
""(Intel) is using capacity as a strategic weapon ... Part of the strategy right now is to go around the world and beg for money,"" Rasgon said. ""If there's any time to run around the world begging for money to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities now is the time.""
BIG INCENTIVES
Germany has come out as the big winner by cornering the bulk of Intel's investment but CEO Pat Gelsinger declined to say the amount of state aid the company is getting from the country. 
Intel will build two factories in Magdeburg, Germany, creating 7,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs at the company, and tens of thousands of additional jobs across suppliers and partners, it said.
Gelsinger said Intel wants to spend the remaining money from its planned 80 billion euro investment over the next 10 years to build out the complete Magdeburg site and further develop the sites in Italy and France.
The company will invest an additional 12 billion euros in an existing Irish facility which will take its total investment in Ireland to more than 30 billion euros.
It is also in talks with Italy for a chip assembly and packaging plant for a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros, expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027.
In France, Intel plans to build its new European research hub, creating 1,000 new high-tech jobs. 
The company will also increase its lab space in Poland and plans to establish joint labs with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain for advanced computing.
Gelsinger had announced plans in September to spend $88 billion in Europe over the next decade, and the choice of sites comes after some EU governments including Italy offered big incentives to try and woo the chipmaker to invest in their countries. 
Spreading its factories around different locations could help the company get more subsidies from different countries.
But Intel will have to negotiate with each European country where it's locating facilities for state aid, European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists.

He also said the Commission was talking with other chipmakers and hoping to make similar announcements in the coming months, but did not provide details.

LONDON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc and partner Virgin Atlantic said on Tuesday that pent-up demand for international travel meant customers were willing to pay higher fares, spurring a rebound in bookings and helping them cover surging fuel costs. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced the closure of vast swathes of airspace and pushed the cost of fuel higher, applying new pressures to an airline industry that has spent two years battling travel bans and restrictions from COVID-19. 
CEO Ed Bastian told a news conference in London that Delta had enjoyed the busiest booking day in its history last week, even though many Asian routes remained suspended, and he was seeing the strongest demand in his career.
Virgin CEO Shai Weiss said that while he could not predict how consumers would respond to higher prices in the long term, for now it was seeing strong demand for premium leisure travel and a strong recovery in business travel. 
""We really haven't seen any impact at all, in terms of reluctance to travel from U.S. travellers coming to Europe,"" Delta's Bastian said, adding that he was not at ""a point of nervousness"" about rising oil prices.
As Bastian was speaking, Delta raised its current-quarter revenue forecast.
U.S. airlines, which cut capacity during the pandemic, do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. The industry expects fares to rise as demand increases, helping to soften the blow. 
Weiss said Virgin had seen a bit of a dip in demand after the Russian invasion, but that it had since recovered.
""There is a very strong pricing environment right now, which makes sense given the pent-up demand but also of course the high input prices of fuel,"" he said. 

Both airlines also said they had seen a recovery in business class bookings, with Delta saying corporate travel was 60% back, led by demand in the United States, while Virgin's business bookings were at 50% of 2019 levels. 
Delta hold a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, while Richard Branson's Virgin Group holds 51%.

ROME (Reuters) - A leading Generali (MI:GASI) shareholder on Tuesday proposed naming the Italian insurer's head of Austria as its new chief executive, in a challenge to the reappointment of Philippe Donnet.
Generali's outgoing board has put forward Donnet for a third mandate as CEO ahead of a shareholder vote to elect a new board at the end of April.
Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio who are, respectively, Generali's second- and third-largest investors, are opposing the reappointment as they challenge the insurer's single largest investor, investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Unveiling his own slate of nominees for the board, Caltagirone on Tuesday said in a statement he was proposing Luciano Cirina, Generali's current head of Austria and central and eastern Europe, for the position of chief executive.
""Under his leadership, that area has posted the stronger growth in recent years,"" Caltagirone said.
""Hailing from (Generali's hometown of) Trieste, Cirina has more than 30 years of experience in insurance and is considered by many within the group as the natural successor to the current CEO, enjoying great respect by all staff."" 
Under Donnet, Generali has delivered higher total returns for shareholders than rivals such as AXA and Allianz (DE:ALVG) and analysts had said Caltagirone needed a strong name to challenge a CEO who has delivered on targets.
Strengthening Donnet's hand, Generali on Tuesday posted a record operating profit for 2021.
Caltagirone also proposed Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and former chairman of Italian state investor CDP, to chair Generali's board.
Calatagiorne has a stake of just under 8% in the insurer, according to latest available data. After stepping down from Generali's board earlier this year he is no longer obligated to disclose his stakebuilding unless he crosses the 10% threshold.

A representative for Del Vecchio has also quit Generali's board. The two tycoons and a third smaller Generali investor held a combined 16% stake in Generali and had struck a shareholder pact which they have now dissolved to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny.
To counter their weight at the April AGM, Mediobanca has secured a temporary 17.2% voting stake for the April meeting by borrowing shares to beef up its 12.8% holding.

(Reuters) -U.S. carriers on Tuesday said travel demand has roared back after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant and would remain strong enough to help them offset a run-up in fuel costs with higher fares.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said it was seeing an ""unparalleled"" increase in demand, resulting in the highest ticket sales in the company's history last week.
""We've not seen a stronger demand ... in my career,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.
Rivals United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also said the demand is higher than it has ever been. In an encouraging sign for the industry, United said business traffic is rebounding more quickly than expected.
As a result, carriers now expect their revenue in the quarter through March to be stronger than what they estimated in January.
United, for example, said its quarterly revenue would be near the higher end of its forecast, thanks to stronger business traffic. 
While Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced the closure of vast swaths of airspace, Bastian said Delta has not seen any impact on bookings for flights to Europe.
Similarly, JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said the company is seeing a ""spectacular"" rebound in travel demand between the United States and the United Kingdom. 
The NYSE Arca Airline index was up about 4% in afternoon trade, led by gains in shares of Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines. 
Carriers are counting on strong demand to deal with fuel costs, which have surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has termed a ""special military operation.""
Fuel is their second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. airlines do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. The industry typically looks to offset fuel costs with higher fares.
HIGHER FARES
Delta said it needs to raise ticket prices by about 10% each way to cover the fuel costs. It intends to do that in the second quarter.
It is not alone. United is passing along a majority of its fuel cost to customers. The company said the resultant higher fares have not impacted demand, thus far.
Tammy Romo, chief financial officer at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), told an investor conference that the pricing environment has been healthy. The Texas-based carrier has also raised its fares.
Soaring fuel costs have raised concerns among investors about its potential impact on the airline industry, which has spent two years trying to recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19. But industry executives downplayed those concerns.
""We can make money at oil prices of $100 a barrel or higher, and we will,"" said Chief Executive of American Airlines Doug Parker. Delta's Bastian said he was not at ""a point of nervousness"" about rising oil prices.
Capacity constraints at carriers due to staffing shortages and delays in aircraft deliveries along with robust demand have boosted their pricing power. The announcements on Tuesday to trim capacity is expected to further drive up ticket prices and help soften the blow from higher fuel costs.

JetBlue's Hayes, however, sounded cautious about the outlook for travel demand in the second half of the year amid persistent high inflation and expectations of higher interest rates.
""We have to be a little bit cautious as we go into the second half of the year - what do we think the economy is going to do,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of a volatility-tracking exchange-traded note (ETN) soared to a near 10-month high on Tuesday, a day after British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it had suspended the sales and issuance of the shares due to capacity constraints. 
Shares of iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN jumped as much as 45% to a high of $41.61, before paring gains to trade up 16.4%.
ETNs are debt securities that banks issue with the promise to pay holders a return linked to the performance of underlying securities or benchmarks. Investors are particularly sensitive about the product ever since another volatility-tracking ETN called XIV went bust in a matter of days in February 2018, dealing nearly $2 billion in losses to shareholders.
The sharp rise in VXX shares compounded losses for short sellers who had targeted the volatility ETN. 
Short sellers, who sell borrowed shares, looking to make a profit by buying back the shares at a later date at a lower price, on paper were down $463 million, or 74%, for the year-to-date, according to S3 Partners.
That includes about $189 million in losses on Tuesday alone, S3 Partners data showed.
VXX issuer Barclays, which expects to reopen sales and issuances of VXX and another oil-related ETN as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity, said it does not have sufficient capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances.
The suspension of the share creation process means VXX's shares can stray far from their indicative price - where they should be trading based on the value of their underlying securities.
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. But with the suspension of new shares that process can break.

VXX was last trading up at $33.81, about $7.5 higher than its indicative price. At one point it traded $14 higher than its indicative price. 
""(That's a) massive premium ... this is almost like the AMC short squeeze, buyers attacking the name knowing they can't create shares,"" Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, said.

Ukraine is a key exporter of neon gas, which is needed to produce already scarce automotive microchips, while Moscow's invasion is also disrupting transport routes.
""The company has made it clear that ... in recent weeks, the dramatic situation of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with those territories as leading producers of raw material to produce microchips, makes any kind of production planning harder and harder,"" metalworker unions said in a joint statement after meeting the company.
As a consequence, starting from April 4, weekly production shifts will be reduced to 15 from 17, resulting in some 1,500 workers a day being put on furlough, unions said.

The company declined to comment.
The Melfi plant in southern Italy, where Stellantis produces vehicles including Compass and Renegade Jeep models, resumed operations this week after a 10 day stoppage which affected all its over 7,000 workers, amid a global chip shortage and a protest by truck drivers.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Tuesday, led by a rebound in tech ahead of the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%, or 399 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8%.
Tech found its footing, climbing more than 2% intraday as the recent weakness in big tech and chip stocks appeared to entice dip-buying action.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led the gains in big tech, with both up more than 2%, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also racked up gains.
Also helping tech, Treasury yields took a breather somewhat from their recent melt-up just as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
With the odds of the 25-basis point nearly fully priced in, investor attention will be focused on the Fed’s summary of economic projections to gauge the shift in interest rate expectations for this year.  
Commentary on how committed the Fed is on tackling inflation will also be closely watched. If the central bank indicates that it favors a wait and see approach that could stoke worries about whether the Fed is able to get inflation under control at time when slowing growth expectations has increased the risk of recession ahead. 
“I think the market will be disappointed if the Fed strikes a tone that we're going to raise rates by 25 basis points and then see how things go,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
Sentiment on the broader market was also helped by easing concerns that higher for longer oil prices would dent global growth as Crude Oil WTI Futures fell further below $100 a barrel.
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, which was the only sector in the red.
The fall in oil prices wasn’t stemmed by signs that an imminent diplomatic solution to end war appears to be some ways off. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude towards finding mutually acceptable solutions.""
Industrials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by the airline stocks after Southwest, United Airline and Delta reported stronger than expected bookings and signaled a quicker than expected recovery in travel demand.

Volvo, which plans to have a charger installed at every 100 miles, said it expects the installations to be completed by the end of 2022. The charging stations could be used by all EV drivers for a fee. However, Volvo car owners could use these at no charge or at preferential rates.
The move comes as automakers race to overtake EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Monday unveiling plans for seven new electric models that it plans to launch in Europe.

Volvo Cars, which is primarily owned by China's Geely Holding, aims to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade and fully electric cars by 2030.

Barclays also hired a more junior executive from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) to join the team next month, the spokesperson added.

The Barclays hires come as more investors prod corporations to consider spinning off business units or even selling the whole company. Activists are also making ESG demands on executive pay, diversity and board composition. Specifically, they often want all directors to stand for election annually, rather than serving staggered terms. 

The activism defense and ESG advisory team works closely with Barclays's sustainable and impact banking (SIB) group that focuses on sustainable growth strategy and finance.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher in New York on Tuesday, with the market resisting continued downward pressure from large-cap Chinese ADRs.
By 4:08 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 599 points, or 1.8%. The market was cheered by the unwinding of price spikes in oil and other industrial and agricultural commodities. The abrupt rises in commodity prices in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion had stoked fears of inflation and of a broad economic slowdown. 
The S&P 500 rose 2.1% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 2.9%. 
The Nasdaq had underperformed on Monday due to intense selling pressure in Chinese ADRs, amid fears of a Covid-induced economic slowdown and the risk that U.S. authorities may forcibly delist them from U.S. exchanges. That threat is long-standing but has acquired extra urgency since U.S. officials warned China that it would face consequences if it chose to help Russia get around Western sanctions. Seven hours of 'intense' talks between National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi failed to clarify which way China will ultimately jump.
The market is turning its attention to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting which starts later Tuesday and is expected to end with a 25 basis point rise in the fed funds target rate on Wednesday. The Fed is meeting at a time when consumer inflation is running at a 40-year high, while producer price data confirmed that U.S. companies are continuing to raise prices. The annual PPI hit 10% in the 12 months through February, meeting expectations, and rose 0.8% from January, lighter than expected. The Empire State Manufacturing Index fell 11.8, when expectations had been for a reading of 7. 
One company likely to be in the spotlight for its pricing will be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which earlier announced its second price hike in a week in the U.S.
On the plus side, there are signs that commodity markets may be returning to normal after a wild surge in volatility since the invasion of Ukraine. U.S. crude futures were down 7.5%, while Brent was down 7.5%.
Crude oil was trading back below $100 a barrel for the first time in two weeks after Russia's Foreign Ministry talked up the possibility of a breakthrough on lifting sanctions on Iran. The talks had broken down last week after Russia insisted that its trade with Iran not be included under the sanctions imposed by the West on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
Elsewhere, gold futures also retreated 2%, to $1,917 an ounce.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon on Tuesday gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its proposed $8.5 billion acquisition of U.S. movie studio MGM to help it to compete with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
The European Commission said the deal would not pose competition concerns in Europe, confirming a Reuters story on March 9.
The EU competition enforcer said it had looked into overlaps between the world's largest online retailer and MGM in audio-visual content and found that the combined market shares are low and that they have strong rivals.
""The addition of MGM's content into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video offer would not have a significant impact on Amazon's position as provider of marketplace services,"" the Commission said.
Amazon said it was pleased with the EU clearance.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has a mid-March deadline to decide on the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.

Analysts said the deal would boost Amazon's video streaming service and attract people to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which also offers fast shipping and encourages consumers to shop more regularly.
MGM has the rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history having earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union has banned top credit rating firms from rating Russia and the country's companies as part of its latest sanctions package, the European Commission said on Tuesday. 
""These sanctions https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_1761 will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine,"" the Commission said in a statement, adding the package of measures had been ""coordinated with international partners, notably the United States"".
Neither the U.S. Treasury, Britain's Foreign Office nor the UK Financial Conduct Authority which regulates ratings in Europe's largest financial centre responded to requests for comment.
The top three global ratings agencies, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, would risk losing their licences to operate in the EU if they flouted the ban.
All three have already withdrawn or suspended a handful of Russian corporate ratings for firms under the toughest U.S. OFAC sanctions, but Tuesday's step on the face of it would force dozens more.
S&P Global declined to comment on the Commission's announcement when asked by Reuters. Fitch said it ""complies with all relevant regulations for credit rating agencies"", while Moody's did not respond to emails or calls. 
Other measures in the EU's package included an import ban on Russian steel products currently under EU safeguard measures, which it estimated would amount to approximately 3.3 billion euros ($330.15 million) in lost export revenue for Russia. 
There was also an export ban on luxury goods such as luxury cars and jewellery, and an increase in the number of sanctioned wealthy individuals with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The measures also come just a day before Russia is due to make its first international market bond payments since being blanketed by Western sanctions.

If the payments are not made by the end of an April 15 'grace period' Russia would be in default on its international debt for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution over a century ago.

The companies raised spending on share repurchases by 2,182% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, handily beating the second-place 279% increase by financial firms. The energy industry accounted for 2.8% of a record $881.7 billion in buybacks in all of 2021.
The rapid increase in energy buybacks came before this year’s 28% increase in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices, though energy costs had started to increase in May of 2020. The jump in prices and buybacks represents a bonanza for shareholders, though not necessarily for the long-term industry prospects.

The analyst sees a huge opportunity for Zoom as less than 20% of the Global 2000 are currently spending more than $100,000 annually with Zoom.
Zoom was arguably the biggest winner of the pandemic as individuals and corporates turned to its video conferencing app to connect and carry out both personal and official work. As the pandemic waned and more people returned to offices, the need for the services was felt less. The stock is now down nearly 73% in the last year against nearly 6% gains in the S&P 500.

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit is studying ways to exit Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but needs to find a solution for its 4,000 local staff and European companies it serves which are also trying to leave, the Italian bank's CEO said.
With France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and Austria's Raiffeisen, UniCredit is among European lenders most exposed to Russia, where it runs the country's 14th-largest bank.
It has flagged an up to 7.4 billion euro ($8 billion) loss in a worst-case scenario that wiped out its Russian business.
""We're completing an urgent review of the country and we're considering exit,"" CEO Andrea Orcel told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Financial Conference in London.
The former UBS banker said however that leaving was an extremely complex decision which could take time.
""It would be quite easy for me to say that we're leaving Russia. It would be what we all want to do and it is what our minds and bodies demand ... but we need to seriously consider the impact ... of disentangling a full bank from the country.""
UniCredit Russia has around 8 billion euros in loans, locally funded by deposits. 
Relinquishing the business would cost 1.9 billion euros at most. But cross-border and derivatives exposure add up to another 5.5 billion euros to the bill.
Orcel said tackling the latter was a matter of ""unwinding and netting"" and figuring out loan recovery rates at maturity, with clients such as Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) currently paying regularly.
The decision on local operations had wider repercussions, with UniCredit's 1,250 European corporate clients in Russia expecting the bank to ""accompany them in the disentanglement."" 
Exiting ""has an impact on clients and people and that can be very fast if I find a solution or slower if I need to go in another direction which is what we're evaluating,"" he said.
Shutting down its Russian operations would shave 200 million euros off UniCredit's 2022 net income.
STAGFLATION THREAT
Rival Italian heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) is also reviewing its presence in Russia, where it has financed major projects but has no retail business. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are all winding down their operations in Russia.
Less than three months ago, Orcel had looked into swapping UniCredit Russia for a controlling stake in local rival Otkritie, but political risks made him drop the deal. 
Orcel said UniCredit could still deliver on its cash distribution goals, possibly reducing investments and risk weighted assets to offset worsening economic conditions compared with December when he unveiled a new three-year strategy.
""We'll have a shock, we expect recession and we expect inflation,"" he said, adding some of the bank's clients already could not cope with electricity costs and were shutting down.
UniCredit has confirmed its 2021 cash dividends in the worst case scenario. A proposed up to 2.6 billion euro share buyback is contingent on core capital staying above a 13% threshold. [nL2N2VB35N]
""Rough cut, if we recover 40 to 50% of our Russian exposure we will be performing the share buyback in full,"" he said.

With the buyback costing 0.8-1.0 percentage points of core capital, UniCredit could still execute it in part if it recovered less.
Orcel also cautioned that the crisis had further raised the bar for M&A deals given excess capital would be used in part to cushion the shock. ($1 = 0.9094 euros)

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Dispute settlement talks between Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Retail failed over the U.S. group's demand for the return of at least $200 million it had invested in the Indian firm, two sources told Reuters. 
Amazon has for months blocked the $3.4 billion sale of Future's retail assets to rival Reliance, announced in 2020, citing a breach of certain contracts. Future denied any wrongdoing, and hopes had risen recently of an out-of-court settlement after Amazon and Future agreed to talks.
On Tuesday, the two sides told India's Supreme Court, which is hearing the dispute, the talks had collapsed, and Amazon took out newspaper ads criticising both Reliance and Future.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the settlement talks told Reuters that Amazon representatives informed Future the dispute could end if the U.S. company could get back at least $200 million it invested in a Future unit in 2019 - the transaction at the heart of ongoing legal disputes.
Future instead offered a stake of an equivalent amount in one of its remaining group companies after Reliance takes over most of its retail assets, saying it was financially distressed. But Amazon did not accept that, the sources said.
Future and Amazon did not respond to emails seeking comment.
One of the sources said there were more factors at play during the talks, but Amazon's demand for the return of investment was the ""bare minimum"" the U.S. company wanted.
The settlement talks were triggered after Reliance, India's biggest retailer, stunned Amazon when it began taking over key Future Retail outlets on Feb. 25 with its staff suddenly showing up at many of Future's biggest stores to assume control, in what was seen as a de facto takeover.

Earlier on Tuesday, Amazon ran large ads in leading Indian newspapers headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" and alleging actions taken by Reliance and Future had been ""done in a clandestine manner.""
Future, which has $4 billion in overall debt, has said it is staring at insolvency if its deal to sell retail assets to Reliance fails.

LONDON (Reuters) - Coffee traders are scrambling to redirect shipments headed for Russia and Ukraine as trade flows to the two countries collapse due to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow and Kyiv's move to close its ports.
Russia is the world's fourth-largest coffee importer after the European Union, the United States and Japan. 
""(Trade flows) are grinding to a halt. Realistically these contracts will have to be voided. It's as simple as that,"" said a Geneva-based coffee trader at a major international firm.
Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 4% of global coffee consumption.
The two countries largely import robusta coffee beans, which are often used to make instant coffee. The beans are a cheaper alternative to smoother-tasting arabica.
The world's biggest container shipping lines, including the top three - MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM - have temporarily suspended cargo shipments to and from Russia, while Ukraine's ports have been closed since Russia invaded.
""Some (shipping) lines have said they'll still (ship to Russia) but the rouble devaluation has effectively frozen that market. (Russian) roasters can't afford (to buy),"" said a Europe-based coffee trader at an international firm.
The rouble has lost more than 30% against the dollar since the invasion and international roasters still operating in the country fear demand will collapse as local prices have roughly tripled.
""We expect to see a significant drop in consumption in (Russia and Ukraine). The combined effect of the war and very high coffee prices will likely lead to a drop in demand,"" Rabobank said in a note.
A Geneva-based trader said he could not even get hold of his buyers in Ukraine and was having to take unilateral decisions on cancelling the contracts and redirecting shipments.

Three coffee exporters at major export firms in Vietnam, the world's top robusta producer, said there were virtually no shipments to Russia last week, with one exporter saying he was working with Russian clients to cancel contracts.
""Based on the current situation and the government's recommendation, agricultural exports to Russia, including coffee, will fall sharply"", said the exporter, who is based in Ho Chi Minh City.

Investing.com – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock edged 0.8% higher on Tuesday after the chipmaker selected sites in Europe to bolster its efforts at reclaiming its past glory in the hi-tech business.
The company said it will build a big chipmaking complex in Germany, boost existing capacity at its Ireland factory, set up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy.
With an initial investment of 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros for the German plans, the spending will help meet surging demand for chips used in computers, cars, mobiles and other gadgets. Rivals like TSMC, Samsung (KS:005930) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are raising their investments to build capacities at a time when both corporations and individuals are pivoting to a digital life.  
Intel has already committed more than $150 billion in spending on creating new chip-making capacities over 10 years as it attempts to de-risk its business from excessive reliance on China for critical components.
In January, it committed more than $20 billion in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio, a site that could ultimately host eight such units.
At full buildout, total investment in the 1,000-acre Ohio site could be as much as $100 billion over 10 years, making it one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing sites in the world, Intel said.
The company had in September said it will invest $20 billion in building two new factories in Arizona.

Sberbank has been developing its non-financial businesses, such as e-commerce, technology and cloud services, in an attempt to combat shrinking margins, a process it looks determined to continue even as sanctions shutter its operations elsewhere. 
The lender quit almost all its European markets earlier this month, blaming big cash outflows and threats to its staff and property, a move that seemed inevitable after the European Central Bank ordered the closure of its European arm. 
In partnership with electronics retailer M.Video, Sberbank has started selling the televisions, which use the bank's virtual assistant software and offer services such as online streaming and food delivery from its digital ecosystem.

Sberbank does not disclose how much it spends on technology, but the bank has previously told Reuters it is a huge investment and one that it has increased since it shifted its strategy to focus more on technology devices and solutions.
Majority owned by Russia's government, Sberbank's share price has plummeted since Russia began its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and Western nations imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia's financial sector.

U.S. military officials have long stressed Egypt's role expediting the passage of U.S. warships through the Suez Canal and granting overflight for American military aircraft.

Rodent activity and Salmonella contamination at a Family Dollar distribution center in Arkansas recently led to a recall of drugs, cosmetics, human and animal foods from 404 stores in six U.S. states, including Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana.
Dollar Tree said earlier this month it incurred a $34.1 million hit due to the recall.
Rodent contamination may cause Salmonella and infectious diseases, which may pose the greatest risk to infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and immuno-compromised people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last month.
The FDA also said conditions observed during the inspection of the facility included live rodents and dead rodents in various states of decay.
A review of Dollar Tree's internal records also indicated the collection of more than 2,300 rodents between March 29 and Sept. 17, demonstrating a history of infestation, the health agency added.
Dollar Tree's regulatory filing on Tuesday showed the Eastern District of Arkansas requested the production of information, documents and records pertaining to pests, sanitation and its compliance with law.

The grand jury subpoena is a powerful investigative tool of the federal government used to identify and gather evidence about a certain federal crime.
""We intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena and any related investigation, however, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter,"" Dollar Tree said in the filing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday unveiled a new pilot effort to help clear supply chain bottlenecks at congested U.S. ports by getting truckers, shippers, wholesalers, retailers and other businesses to share information.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese launched the Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative ""to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the goods movement supply chain.""
The White House said ""the lack of digital infrastructure and transparency makes our supply chains brittle and unable to adapt when faced with a shock"" and said it was crucial to improve information sharing because a ""lack of information exchange can cause delays as cargo moves from one part of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and increasing goods movement fragility.""
The effort includes 18 initial participants including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS, Albertsons,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) as well as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and Georgia Ports Authority and Ocean Carriers CMA CGM and MSC and Fenix Marine Terminal and Global Container Terminals.
Buttigieg noted U.S. supply chains are mostly private or locally owned and this new effort required a public partnership.
""If it doesn't work on a handshake it doesn't work. Nobody can command this kind of sharing but we also know it needs to happen,"" Buttigieg said at a White House event.
Last week, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said imports at the major U.S. retail container ports are expected to be at near-record levels this spring and summer as consumer demand and supply chain challenges continue to spark congestion.
""Growth rates have slowed down from the off-the-charts numbers we saw last year, but volume is close to the highest we’ve ever seen. Everyone in the supply chain is trying to reduce congestion, but there is still work to be done,"" NRF said.
The White House said the 18 participants will work to develop a ""proof-of-concept freight information exchange by the end of the summer"" aiming ""to ease supply chain congestion.""

President Joe Biden created a task force in June to address high prices and shortages of consumer goods and crucial components, thanks to pandemic-related labor and demand issues.
Buttigieg noted Tuesday that 2021 worst case fears did not materialize. ""Christmas was not in fact canceled."" Buttigieg said.

Investing.com -- J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth told investors in a note that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) data has slowed in recent weeks after a stronger than expected start to the first quarter. 
However, ""Apptopia tracking through early March still suggests NFLX is running ahead of plan,"" said the analyst. Apptopia is a data intelligence platform that provides its users with mobile app analytics.
""If NFLX were to conclude 1Q at its recent pace, we believe Net Adds could be 4M+, down from the 5M+ implied by our regression in mid-February, but above the 2.5M guide,"" stated Anmuth.
He added that the 4 million is before they factored in the suspension of Russia, but they estimate this will reduce subscribers by around 300,000.
Despite the slowdown, Anmuth is still bullish on the stock, keeping an Overweight rating and $605 price target.
Elsewhere, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson lowered his price target on Netflix to $350 from $375, maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock.

BERLIN (Reuters) -A lack of wiring harnesses from Ukraine has overtaken a shortage of semiconductors as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s biggest supply chain headache as the Russia-Ukraine war clouds its prospects for this year, the world's No.2 carmaker warned on Tuesday. 
Rising raw material costs will drive up prices for both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said, with everything from batteries to catalytic converters set to become more expensive.
In light of rising instability in Europe, boosting sales in China - where Volkswagen currently has 16% market share and aims to double battery-electric car sales this year - is an even higher priority than before, CEO Herbert Diess added.
""The war in the Ukraine has put our existing outlook into question,"" Diess said at the German group's annual press conference following Friday's 2021 results, warning commodity markets are likely to remain volatile until 2026.
Rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday raised prices in China and the United States for the second time in days after its CEO noted surging raw materials and logistics costs.
Diess said Volkswagen had become more resilient through the coronavirus pandemic and under normal circumstances would have reason for optimism for 2022.
The group cut overhead costs ahead of schedule last year, leading to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) of benefits compared with 2019, said Antlitz. 
The potential initial public offering (IPO) of sports car brand Porsche will provide additional flexibility, he said, adding an IPO could still happen as soon as the fourth quarter of 2022, despite current market uncertainties. 
However, a halt in supplies of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in a car and are unique to each model, could force Volkswagen to revise its outlook if alternative sources are not found in 3-4 weeks, Diess said.
The carmaker is relocating production from Ukraine to North Africa and Eastern Europe - a process which is not complicated but time-consuming, the CEO said. 
Volkswagen sold two million fewer cars than planned last year due to semiconductor shortages and said that, while the situation should improve this year, there could still be a drag on growth.
The carmaker said on Friday its operating profit doubled in 2021 to just under 20 billion euros thanks to higher prices and a favourable product mix, despite total unit deliveries hitting a 10-year low of 8.9 million.
Looking forward, it expects to increase deliveries by 5-10% in 2022 and boost revenues by 8-13%, it said on Friday. 

Both Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota suspended production temporarily at some plants in China amid COVID-related lockdowns, with Toyota warning on Tuesday the suspensions could last several more weeks.

Investing.com – Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) stock traded 9.5% higher Tuesday after the carrier raised its annual guidance for the current quarter and said travel demand is robust.
The airline now sees revenue for the March quarter at 78% of 2019 levels, an improvement from the 72%-76% forecast it gave two months ago, according to Reuters.
Delta expects capacity in the first quarter to be around 83% though this comes in at the lower end of the 83%-85% range it gave earlier.
The airline said it expects to deliver “meaningful profitability” in 2022.
A separate Reuters report quoted CEO Ed Bastian as saying that Delta had enjoyed the busiest booking day in its history last week, even though many Asian routes remained suspended, and he was seeing the strongest demand in his career.

(Reuters) - Canada's benchmark index extended losses for a third straight session on Tuesday, as weakness in energy and metal prices due to rising COVID-19 cases in China weighed on commodity stocks.
At 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 161.23 points, or 0.76%, at 21,019.55.
The energy and materials sectors fell 4.4% and 1.4% respectively, tracking weakness in commodity prices.
Oil prices dropped to three-week lows and industrial metal prices fell as daily COVID-19 infections in major consumer China doubled from a day earlier to hit a two-year high. [O/R] [MET/L]
""We're going to have a volatile year so there's going to be lots of moving parts,"" said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments.
""TSX is definitely overweight in commodities versus other indices so as long as inflation's a theme it should set the TSX to outperform.""
The commodity-heavy Toronto index has declined 1.1% so far this year, but has outperformed many of its global peers like the U.S. benchmark S&P 500, which is down 11.8% year-to-date, as investors embraced commodity stocks to protect their portfolios from the impact of supply shortages and soaring inflation.
Investors await key consumer price data due later in the week, while the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting due on Wednesday was also in focus.
""There's probably not going be much volume today as investors are waiting for the Fed's signals and see if we get any relief in the move higher in yields and the U.S. dollar,"" Taylor said.

Data showed that home prices surged to a new all-time high last month and housing starts rose 8% in February compared with the previous month.
Among individual stocks,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd fell 0.8% after thousands of workers threatened to strike from Wednesday, potentially disrupting the movement of grain, potash and coal at a time of soaring commodity prices.

(Reuters) -""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson has been confirmed as the next celebrity in line for a ride to the edge of space courtesy of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin astro-tourism company, with his suborbital flight set for next week.
The 28-year-old comedian and boyfriend of socialite and reality TV star Kim Kardashian was announced by Blue Origin on Monday as an ""honorary guest"" joining five paying customers for the company's fourth commercial flight since last summer. 
Davidson, who had no immediate comment on his selection, was reported to have been in discussions with Blue Origin earlier this month.
His five fellow citizen astronauts-to-be are: angel investor Marty Allen, real estate veteran Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon Hagle, University of North Carolina professor Jim Kitchen and George Nield, founder-president of Commercial Space Technologies.
They are slated for liftoff on March 23 aboard Blue Origin's six-story-tall, fully autonomous spacecraft, dubbed New Shepard, from the company launch site outside the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.
The entire flight, from liftoff to touchdown, is expected to last a little over 10 minutes. The crew will experience a few minutes of weightlessness at the very apex of their suborbital joyride, some 350,000 feet (106 km) high, then will fall back to Earth for a parachute landing on the desert floor.
Davidson, a nine-year ""SNL"" cast member who co-wrote and starred in the semi-autobiographical film ""The King of Staten Island,"" is the latest of several celebrities chosen as non-paying promotional Blue Origin passengers.

He follows in the footsteps of 90-year-old ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner, whose October ride made him the oldest person ever to fly to space, and ""Good Morning America"" co-host Michael Strahan, a former NFL star. Strahan flew in December with 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, eldest daughter of the late pioneering NASA astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the Blue Origin rocketship is named.
Bezos himself tagged along on Blue Origin's inaugural crewed flight to space in July of last year with his brother Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian female aviator Wally Funk and 18-year-old Oliver Daeman, a Dutch high school graduate and beneficiary of a $28 million auction sweepstakes.

Investing.com – eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock traded 3.6% higher Tuesday after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) initiated coverage with a ‘buy’ and a target of $145, more than 168% higher than its current level of $54.
According to StreetInsider analyst Lee Horowitz, the market is underappreciating eBay's positioning within secular growth trends. He finds the stock’s valuations compelling.
eBay’s fourth-quarter results had disappointed but weren’t a surprise either given that shoppers were bound to log off the site after two years of the pandemic to step out and shop.
Fourth-quarter gross merchandise volume, a key benchmark defining the total value of goods and services sold on an online platform, fell 10% to go below $21 billion. E-commerce firms’ revenue is derived from a percentage of GMV. 
Annual active buyers on the platform also declined 9% to 147 million in the quarter.
The retailer is forecasting annual revenue of $10.4 billion and adjusted profit per share of $4.3 at the midpoint of its guidance range. GMV is seen between $78.3 billion and $80.5 billion, a guidance the analyst called “conservative”.
As the company’s core operations remain under pressure, CEO Jamie Iannone is banking on advertising and payments businesses to make up for it. The company's advertising offerings surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the year. With the complete transition of all sellers to a new payments platform, the company expects the shift to contribute to profits.
According to Horowitz, the market is also underappreciating the focus on execution that Iannone has brought to the company after taking over less than two years ago.",,,,,

The gold miner is considering raising fresh capital after it caught the attention of retail traders on Reddit in recent weeks, the person said, asking not to be named discussing a private transaction. The decision is not final. 
Retail traders’ online support helped quadruple the shares to $1.39 in the prior session on Monday before the deal was announced. The stock traded as low as 29 cents in February. 
Hycroft went public in early 2020 through a combination with a special purpose acquisition company backed by Jason Mudrick. The company had lost around 80% of its value since its public debut.

RWE earlier reported final results for 2021, which showed a 25% increase in both adjusted net profit as well as generation from brown coal, or lignite, which is among the most CO2 intense energy sources.
""Given the significantly elevated price of electricity RWE's very solid 2021 results come expected,"" Enkraft said, adding a separation from lignite was ""the only way for RWE to become green in the foreseeable future"".

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, as the first lower-than-expected price data in months and a sharp drop in oil prices combined to relieve some of the anxiety around galloping inflation.
The producer price index rose by 0.8% on the month in February, a shade less than the 0.9% expected. But the core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by only 0.2%, well below expectations and its lowest rise in five months. The last time that the core PPI had risen by less was in December 2020. A string of rapid price increases by U.S. companies still leaves the year-on-year PPI at 10.0%, however, an uncomfortable backdrop for the start of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later Tuesday.
The mood was also helped by more conciliatory statements from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talking down the prospects of Ukraine joining NATO, a concession to Russia's security demands that may advance the hitherto fruitless peace talks between the two countries.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151 points, or 0.5% at 33,097 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.3%. All three indices were paring the gains they had made at the open.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.3% after the electric vehicle maker illustrated the problem of producer price inflation at the company level. The company raised its prices for almost all of its output in the U.S. and China for the second time in a week. While it didn't explain why, the moves come after a surge in battery metals Copper and - especially - Nickel since the Russian invasion. Russia is one of the world's largest sources of nickel, and its output would be sorely missed on world markets if Western sanctions bite as they are supposed to. 
Airline stocks rose sharply after Delta (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) all said they intend to work at slightly lower levels of capacity than foreseen earlier.

MILAN/ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) -UniCredit could decide on a costly exit from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, the Italian bank's CEO said on Tuesday, as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) disclosed 4% of its wealth management assets are managed for Russian clients. 
A growing list of financial firms are looking to exit Russia, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) winding down business there. Others are under pressure from investors to detail their financial exposure to Russia.
UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said the bank was urgently reviewing its Russian business, but needed to find a solution for its 4,000 local staff and European companies it serves which are also trying to leave. 
Orcel also said the economic environment had changed because of the Ukraine crisis and the bank was now assuming there would be stagflation - or a combination of low growth and high inflation.
UniCredit's Russian unit has around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in loans, locally funded by deposits.
The loss in relinquishing the business would be 1.9 billion euros at most. Cross-border and derivatives exposure however add up to another 5.5 billion euros to the bill.
UniCredit is one of Europe's banks most exposed to Russia.
TP ICAP (LON:NXGN), the world's biggest inter-dealer broker, also said on Tuesday it had stopped all business transactions with Russian banks. 
Credit Suisse last week detailed a gross credit exposure of 1.569 billion Swiss francs ($1.69 billion) to Russia at the end of 2021, which Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said had been ""reduced materially"" by the end of February.
Gottstein told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Conference in London on Tuesday that the bank had ""roughly 4% of our assets under management in wealth management with Russian clients, (either) Russian-domiciled or Russian nationals who live in the West."" 
The bank had not previously detailed the amount of assets it manages for Russian clients.
Russia is subject to stringent sanctions and has introduced countermeasures following the invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation.""
In a sign of the pressure, the Russian central bank said it would suspend the buying of gold from banks from Tuesday to meet increased demand for the precious metal from households.
Russia's second-biggest bank VTB is closing its London-based investment banking unit VTB Capital, it said.
Russia has $117 million in payments due on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated Eurobonds. Its finance ministry has said it will make the payments in roubles if sanctions prevent it from paying in dollars. 
However, the payment due on Wednesday has to be made in dollars and using other currencies could constitute a default.
Russia's economic crisis is likely to cause credit to go unpaid but euro zone banks' exposure to the country is contained, the European Central Bank's top supervisor Andrea Enria said, adding no blanket ban on dividends was on the cards.
Western governments continue to ratchet up the pressure as three European prime ministers rode a train for Kyiv on Tuesday, the first visit by foreign leaders to the Ukrainian capital since Russia launched its invasion.
The European Union has banned top credit rating firms from rating Russia's sovereign debt and the country's companies as part of its latest sanctions package, the European Commission said. 
Britain imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, banned the export of luxury goods to Russia and said it had stopped all government-backed export finance to Russia and Belarus.

Commercial insurance market Lloyd's of London said it was looking to apply sanctions pressure on Russia through the cyber, aerospace and political risk insurance markets.

The multiplex operator, along with Canadian fund manager Eric Sprott, is investing $56 million in the miner as part of diversification efforts. AMC was up 4% premarket.
AMC Chairman and CEO Adam Aron, who often takes to Twitter to make announcements and seek the public’s views on the company’s plans, said Hycroft has 15 million ounces of gold and 600 million ounces of silver.   
""AMC is playing on offense again with a bold diversification move,"" Aron tweeted, noting that AMC would help Hycroft bolster its liquidity. The multiplex operator and Eric Sprott will each own 21.8% of Hycroft.
The company said the strength from the release of blockbusters like ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ and ‘The Batman’ has helped it recover from the pandemic-led fall.
The theater-owner will also receive an additional 23.4 million warrants in Hycroft at $1.07 per share and has been granted the right to appoint a representative to Hycroft's board.
Investment firm Mudrick Capital Management is currently the largest shareholder, holding a 40.38% stake, according to Refinitiv data.
AMC was at the heart of the meme stock rally that gripped the markets for more than half of 2021. That frenzy saw the company raise funds, retire debt, accept payment in Bitcoin, and launch non-fungible tokens."

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's second-biggest bank VTB is closing the London-based arm of its investment banking unit VTB Capital, it said on Tuesday, as Western sanctions continue to throttle the international operations of Russia's lenders.
VTB Capital plc is ""currently proceeding with an orderly wind-down of its positions and obligations,"" the company said, having laid off some of its staff late last week.
VTB's announcement is the latest sign of how U.S., European and British sanctions are hitting Russian financial firms, after the country's biggest lender Sberbank quit Europe blaming cash outflows and threats to its staff and property.
It shows the pressure Russian businesses face from the unprecedented and coordinated action by Western governments to isolate Moscow over its war on Ukraine, including sanctions on its central bank and the exclusion of some lenders from the SWIFT payments system.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Reuters reported earlier this month that regulators were preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of VTB Bank, amid concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on the bank.
The European Union on Tuesday formally approved another barrage of sanctions, including bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.
ASSETS FROZEN
Britain froze VTB's assets on Feb. 24 as part of its largest-ever package of sanctions against Russia, aimed in part at stopping Russian companies from raising money in London.
As the British-based arm of VTB's investment banking business, VTB Capital Plc lent money to business and advised on mergers and corporate fundraising for Russia-related deals.

It was loss-making prior to the closure announced on Tuesday, a company filing showed, reporting a pretax loss of $213 million in 2020 as it shrank its balance sheet and made provisions for bad loans. 
VTB said that sanctions allowed it to continue paying staff until March 1 next year, as it looks to complete the wind-down of VTB Capital plc.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse is reviewing its operations in Russia, Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said on Tuesday, as he detailed tens of billions of dollars in assets managed for wealthy Russian customers.
""We're now reviewing the situation. It's a very serious situation,"" Gottstein said during  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s European Financials Conference in London, referring to the impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We will see over the coming months what it means for our operations. I have not taken any decision.""
A growing list of financial firms are looking to exit Russia, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) winding down business there. 
The comments from Gottstein come just hours after UniCredit's chief executive said the Italian bank was also urgently reviewing its Russian business.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) last week detailed a gross credit exposure of 1.569 billion Swiss francs ($1.69 billion) to Russia at end-2021, which Gottstein said had been reduced ""materially"" by the end of February.
On Tuesday, he outlined for the first time the extent of Credit Suisse's business with wealthy Russian clients, saying roughly 4% of the assets it manages in its core wealth management business belong to Russian clients.
""We have roughly 4% of our assets under management in wealth management with Russian clients, be they Russian-domiciled or Russian nationals who live in the West,"" Gottstein said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank managed some 1.6 trillion Swiss francs in assets as of end-2021, 827 billion francs of which were related to its wealth management businesses.
While Gottstein did not provide an updated tally for current assets under management, 4% of the year-end wealth management figure would amount to some 33 billion Swiss francs ($35.17 billion) in assets associated with wealthy Russian customers.
The bank last week said it had minimal exposure in terms of loans granted to individuals subject to sanctions in its wealth management division.
Credit Suisse employs some 125 people in its Moscow office across investment banking, wealth management and other operations.

Gottstein said Credit Suisse was also reviewing its broader operations in Eastern Europe.

Investing.com – GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) stock surged 14% in premarket Tuesday after the code-sharing firm’s fourth quarter revenue beat estimates and adjusted loss came in narrower than expected.
Guidance for the current year also boosted the shares.
“We believe these results demonstrate that the market is moving from DIY DevOps composed of different tools to a DevOps Platform. This shift enables organizations to accelerate the time-to-market of their most important software and applications, providing them with a distinct competitive advantage,” CEO Sid Sijbrandij said in a statement.
GitLab’s DevOps platform allows users to work on codes, package them, releasing and monitoring them. The company makes money from its premium products, chargeable on a ‘per user per month’ basis.
Fourth-quarter revenue was up 69% at $78 million as the company signed up new customers and upgraded existing ones which included Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), the US Army, and  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK). Adjusted gross margin improved by a percentage point.
Adjusted loss per share was 16 cents, almost a third of its year-ago level.
In the current year, the company expects revenue to be at least $385.5 million, up around 53%. It could touch $390.5 million as well, according to the company’s estimated range.
Revenue in the current quarter is seen between $77 million and $78 million."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Acquisition platform Acacia Research Corp, backed by activist fund Starboard Value and a recent bidder for retailer Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), appointed one of the hedge fund's senior executives on Tuesday to oversee all aspects of its takeover business.
The firm, which acquires businesses in sectors including technology, retail, and healthcare, appointed Martin McNulty Jr. as its chief operating officer and head of mergers and acquisitions, Acacia Chief Executive Officer Clifford Press told Reuters.
   The appointment comes after global merger and acquisition activity set new records last year. But the pace of takeovers may be dampened by rising financing costs, expectations of greater regulatory scrutiny mount and as geopolitical unrest unnerves investors.
Acacia also promoted Wesley Golby, its chief of research, to chief investment officer. Golby previously co-founded investment firm Seven Canyons Advisors. The appointments are effective immediately.
McNulty, who goes by MJ, had been CEO of Starboard's special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Starboard Value Acquisition Corp, which combined with data center Cyxtera Technologies Inc last year. The deal valued the company at $3.4 billion. 
    ""Adding MJ to our leadership team completes the build out of our core acquisition platform,"" Press said, adding that McNulty's skills in making operational improvements ""will now be applied to current and prospective portfolio companies.""
Acacia agreed with Starboard two years ago that the hedge fund would provide as much as $400 million in capital for strategic investments and acquisitions.
In late January, Acacia offered to buy Kohl's for $64 a share, making an offer that would have valued the retailer at roughly $9 billion. Kohl's rejected this and another initial offer from private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
    Acacia, which declined to comment on Kohl's, remains in active discussions with the retailer's banker as it runs a sales process, according to sources familiar with the matter.

LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) said on Tuesday it had teamed up with digital private asset platform Floww to enter the market for unlisted companies that want to raise capital.
Britain is reforming its capital market after leaving the European Union to ensure London still attracts global investors.
The UK listings regime has already been eased in a bid to attract more technology firms to the exchange, but the finance ministry also wants to make it easier for private companies to access funds and attract more retail investors.
""LSEG will work with Floww to help launch their private primary capital raising facility, while exploring liquidity and secondary market options, including through the use of new technologies,"" the exchange said in a statement.
Floww allows investors to monitor and track their investments in private companies and already features 7,000 company profiles and 70 venture capital firms.
""With LSEG, we are on course to building a connected network for all market players to share and manage their data, deals and opportunities and the ability to trade shares in companies at any stage,"" Floww CEO Martijn De Wever said.
Many smaller companies have turned their backs on a public listing, citing heavy costs and regulatory requirements, according to a finance ministry consultation paper last year.
Building a bridge between private and public companies is seen as a way to build a pipeline of listings.
""By working together, we can support the widest range of companies through their funding lifecycle including helping them transition from private to public markets,"" LSEG said.

""Our ambition is to be the first global exchange group that is genuinely indifferent as to whether a company is public or private, and Floww is another step in this journey,"" it said.
The finance ministry said this month it was still exploring the idea for a new venue for small and medium sized companies, where trading might take place during regular but limited periods, rather than a full session every week day as on the main market.

Insurers and reinsurers based in London have already stopped providing cover to Russian airlines following sanctions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""We’ll keep deploying our expertise, resources and networks – covering crucial areas like cyber, space and political risk – to help deliver an effective sanctions regime against Russian assets,"" Lloyd's said in a statement on its website dated March 14.
While Russian firms typically use local insurers for commercial insurance policies, these are often reinsured through Lloyd's, industry sources say.
Companies take out cyber insurance against cyber attacks, while space insurance covers damage to satellites and rockets.
Political risk insurance is typically an add-on to commercial property insurance and can be triggered in the case of issues such as war or nationalisation.
Lloyd's said it would ""continue the frequent conversations we’ve been having with UK and international regulators since the conflict began"" to ensure sanctions have maximum impact.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Members Exchange (MEMX), the fastest growing U.S. stock exchange, said on Tuesday it plans to launch an options exchange in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval, that will seek to reduce industry costs.
MEMX, which counts some of Wall Streets biggest firms among its investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), launched its stock exchange in September 2020, to address an intense debate over fees between large exchange operators and their customers.
Taking an aggressive approach to pricing, MEMX has gained more than 4% market share, surpassing the volume of some exchanges run by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE). 
""MEMX Options will use technological advancements to increase determinism, reduce costs and drive competitive improvements for our options members, just as we did in equities,"" said MEMX Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner.
The market operator worked with its members on establishing how to add value to the options space, Kellner said. 
Other MEMX investors include BofA Securities,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS, and Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT).
The Jersey City, New Jersey-based exchange was founded after years of complaints by brokers and other market participants over what they saw as unjustifiably high fees charged by most exchanges for things like market data and exchange connectivity.

MEMX began charging for market data in February at a significantly lower price than the large incumbent exchanges.
""As we progress, we look forward to lending our voice to help advance key issues in the U.S. equity options markets,"" Kellner said.

The increases come as costs of raw materials are surging, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Prices of metals used in cars have soared, including aluminum that is used in the bodywork, palladium used in catalytic converters, and nickel and lithium that power electric vehicle (EV) batteries.
The costs have raised concerns about EV economics, as legacy automakers and startups prepare to launch new cars on the back of a long semiconductor supply crunch that is still knocking production at companies including Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has a diversified supply chain, has bought https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/14/tesla-has-bought-aluminum-from-russian-supplier-rusal-since-2020.html ""millions of euros worth of aluminum"" from Russian aluminium giant Rusal, CNBC reported on Monday, citing internal documents.
Rusal's billionaire founder Oleg Deripaska has been sanctioned by Britain.
Tesla bought Rusal aluminum for casting parts at its new vehicle assembly plant outside of Berlin for the Tesla Model Y, among other things, CNBC said.
Tesla received a conditional go-ahead for its 5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) German gigafactory earlier this month after months of delay.
Tesla and Rusal did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyds Banking Group CEO Charlie Nunn has begun a shake-up of the lender's top team and internal structure as he looks to implement a strategy unveiled last month.
The bank will split its three units into five as part of the plan, an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday showed.
Nunn, a former HSBC executive who took over at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) in August, is planning to invest 4 billion pounds ($5.21 billion)over the next five years, targeted at digitising the bank and boosting fee income in areas including wealth management.
Two of the lender's top executives are planning to leave the bank amid various management changes, the memo said.
Group director for retail, Vim Maru, will leave following a handover of responsibilities, while commercial banking boss David Oldfield plans to leave next year.
Maru, who leaves after more than 10 years at Lloyds and had been tipped as a potential candidate for the bank's top role, said in a separate memo he felt like it was the right time to step aside.
A Lloyds spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo.
The bank plans to split its retail division into two, with one focused on consumer lending and the other on current accounts and savings.
The first unit will be co-led by Russell Galley and Jo Harris on an interim basis, while the second will be headed by Jas Singh - all internal promotions. 
The commercial business will also be divided, with one focusing on smaller businesses and the other on larger clients. 
Oldfield will oversee the restructuring of the commercial banking business, while the bank searches for candidates to lead both units.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Ford on Monday unveiled plans for seven new electric models in Europe, a battery-assembly site in Germany and a nickel cell manufacturing joint venture in Turkey as part of a major electric vehicle (EV) push on the continent.
""Our march toward an all-electric future is an absolute necessity for Ford to meet the mobility needs of customers across a transforming Europe,"" said Stuart Rowley, chair of Ford of Europe.
Ford said it would introduce three new electric passenger vehicles and four new electric commercial vehicles in Europe by 2024, adding it plans to sell more than 600,000 EVs in the region by 2026.
This, Ford said, would help it reach its global goal of selling more than 2 million EVs a year and achieving an adjusted operating profit margin of 10% by 2026.
The strategy update for Europe comes shortly after Ford announced a $50 billion investment push to kick-start electrification that also includes running its EV unit separately from the group's legacy combustion engine business.
As part of its push, Ford deepened its existing partnership with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) under which the U.S. carmaker will produce a second electric vehicle for the European market based on its German rival's platform.
Ford will as a result double its planned volume of vehicles to be produced based on Volkswagen's modular electric-drive platform, known as MEB, to 1.2 million units over a six-year timeframe.
This will include investments of $2 billion at Ford's Cologne site in Germany as well as a new battery assembly facility scheduled to start operations in 2024.
Ford also said it has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with SK On Co, a unit of South Korea's SK Innovation, and Turkey's Koc Holding for a joint venture to manufacture high nickel NMC cells for assembly into battery array modules.

Under the strategy update, Ford Otosan, Ford's joint venture with Koc Holding, will buy the U.S. carmaker's plant in Craiova, Romania for 575 million euros ($630 million) to further boost electric and commercial vehicle capacity.

While the final penalty is not known, reports say it could run into billions of yuan.
According to WSJ, there were also lapses in compliance with ‘know your customer’ and ‘know your business’ norms – standard protocols regulators world over mandate entities follow to verify the authenticity of the customer and their eligibility to carry out transactions on the platform.
The breaches were discovered by the country’s central bank in late 2021.
The impending penalty comes as Chinese fintech platforms prepare for stricter regulation of their operations amid their government’s attempts to curb money laundering activities.

""Increasing demand for our hybridised models, supported by (3 billion euros) of sustainable investment in our Crewe factory, will ensure we remain the benchmark manufacturer in sustainable luxury mobility,"" said Jan-Henrik Lafrentz, member of the board for Finance and IT at Bentley.

(Reuters) -Imperial Brands has started talks to transfer its Russian business to a local third party, the tobacco company said on Tuesday, joining British rival BAT (LON:BATS) in exiting the sanction-hit country following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Imperial, maker of Winston cigarettes and Backwoods cigars, last week stopped all sales and marketing activity in Russia and halted production at its factory in Volgograd, citing challenges arising from sanctions on Moscow. 
The group joins a long list of Western companies that have suspended operations or pulled out of Russia after the United States, the European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
Russia has hit back with moves towards nationalising assets of firms that leave the country.
Imperial declined to give further details about the third party it is in talks with, or how the deal might be structured. 
The British company, which employs around 1,000 people in Russia, said it would continue to pay its staff there until the transfer of its business is complete.
Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) last week also said it would transfer its Russian business, which employs around 2,500 people.
BAT said on Friday exiting its business or stopping sales or manufacturing would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia, adding Moscow might under those circumstances take legal action against local management.
Imperial declined to comment on its rationale for transferring the business. 
Imperial, whose operations in Russia and Ukraine accounted for just 2% of its 32.79 billion pounds ($42.69 billion) of net revenue in fiscal 2021, flagged a small hit to annual revenue and profit from the exit. 
It expects revenue growth in 2022 to be flat to up 1% versus a prior forecast of growth of about 1.4% at constant currencies.

Another big tobacco firm, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), last week also suspended investment in Russia and said it planned to scale down manufacturing in the country that accounts for almost 10% of its total cigarette and heated tobacco volumes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several of Wall Street's biggest banks are planning on keeping a limited presence and holding on to banking licenses in Russia for the foreseeable future, even as they wind down their broader operations in the country, sources at those banks said. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) - the three Wall Street banks with the biggest Russian exposures - have said in the past few days that they plan to pull back their businesses in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
The banks will continue to have staff and operations on the ground as they work to extricate themselves and some of their clients from contractual obligations, the sources say.
Even when that work is done, however, they are likely to hang on to their banking licenses in the hope that the businesses can be rebuilt at a later date, sources at two of the banks said.
""They are not going to cut and run when there are potential opportunities when this gets resolved,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO at California-based private equity firm Patriarch Organization and a specialist in risk management strategy. 
A total withdrawal, including handing back licenses, would make it hard for a bank to return, experts say. Obtaining a banking license in Russia is a laborious and lengthy process, experts say, and global banks have often opted to buy a stake in a Russian bank that holds a license.
Citigroup said on Monday it would expand its withdrawal from Russia and not take on new clients as it further cuts its exposure to the country, raising the prospect it could take billions of dollars in losses.
The bank had already planned to exit its Russian consumer business prior to the invasion. It has now decided to expand that exit to include other businesses and to reduce its remaining operations and exposures.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
BANKS TO RETAIN LICENSES 
Citigroup has the most to lose out of U.S. banks withdrawing. It has exposure of nearly $10 billion in Russia, more than any other U.S. bank, and has warned it could lose nearly half of that in the worst-case scenario.
The bank said that its withdrawal would take time to process. It also reiterated a commitment to ""providing assistance to multi-national corporations, many of whom are undergoing the complex task of unwinding their operations.""
Citigroup is likely to keep operations on the ground and retain its banking license in Russia for the foreseeable future, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Citigroup declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs said last week it is ""winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements."" 
But the bank has no current plans to hand back its Russian banking license and, even if it did, would expect that process to take 12 to 18 months, a source familiar with the matter said. 
JPMorgan said last week it has been actively unwinding its business in Russia and is not pursuing new business in the country.
However, it also has no current plans to hand back its banking license in Russia, sources at the bank say.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which faced criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday it would wind down its business in the country, reversing an earlier pledge to stay.
However, it is also planning to keep its banking license in Russia for the foreseeable future, sources familiar with the matter say.
One factor preventing JPMorgan and Citigroup from immediate withdrawals is that they are both securities custodians in Russia, said sources at the banks. That means they have obligations to hold securities there for clients. There is no obvious way out of those obligations, the sources said, given restrictions on securities transactions imposed by the Bank of Russia.
JPMorgan and Citigroup also have transaction and treasury services businesses in Russia. They provide cash management, trade services and finance to multinational companies doing business in Russia. Those services will continue to be provided to companies as they suspend or unwind their businesses, sources at both the banks said.
Banks face a lengthy withdrawal that could take years, Reuters reported last week.
However, the slow exit also has its advantages, some experts say, as that method presents an opportunity for banks to change tack and rebuild if the geopolitical situation changes dramatically.

That would not be possible if they had chosen to walk away from Russia entirely, a move that could be seen as hurting Russian citizens.
""There may be a long-term strategy that you don't tarnish the name of the company too much in Russia to the point where Russia will boycott you,"" said Antonia Tzinova, an attorney in global law firm Holland & Knight's Washington, D.C., office.

Investing.com – Stocks of European retailers such as LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Kering  (PA:PRTP), H&M (ST:HMb), Moncler (MI:MONC) and Hermès (PA:HRMS) were all down around 4% Tuesday after the European Union banned exports of luxury goods to Russia.
The ban covers luxury goods worth more than 300 euros ($329.58) and cars costing over 50,000 euros, according to reports. It follows a similar move by the U.S. on Friday.
The new list is part of the fourth set of sanctions brought by the EU against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Previously sanctioned items include steel, iron ore, and electronic gadgets. 
While Russia is a big market for many of the luxury goods makers, the fear is that China may also get dragged into the sanctions net.
China is one of the biggest makers of these luxury goods, and a key supplier of raw materials that go into making them. The world’s second-largest economy is also a big market for these items.
The bloc is also withdrawing Russia’s ‘most favored nation’ status and pushing for removing the country from the MFN list at the World Trade Organization as well.
The shares were also impacted by a fresh outbreak of Covid-19 in China which has seen several key cities in the country come under fresh lockdowns. These include the economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin.",,,,,

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Manufacturers of everything from flash drives to glass for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone screens are warning of shipment delays as they comply with Chinese controls to curb the spread of COVID-19, further straining global supply chains.
Authorities across China are trying to try stem the spread of the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years, putting millions of people in lockdown, curbing transport and shutting factories. 
Some of the toughest measures have been applied in the key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, as well as the Chinese financial centre of Shanghai, which is home to the world's busiest container port.
Fabien Gaussorgues, who provides contract manufacturing services from a factory in Dongguan, said he was struggling to procure parts needed for electric scooters, warehouse robots and electric toys because of the shutdowns. 
""It's not critical yet but it's getting more difficult every day,"" Gaussorgues said. ""Suppliers in Shenzhen cannot produce, so they're not delivering goods. So next week we don't have material for production,"" he added. 
Lens Technology, which supplies lenses and glass material to customers such as Apple, said on Monday the production and delivery of some products would be impacted after it suspended work at its Dongguan plant.
And Netac Technology, which makes portable hard drives and USB flash drives, similarly warned of shipment delays as its factory in Shenzhen had to stop work. 
While major ports in Shenzhen and Shanghai said they were operating normally, logistic providers said there were trucking delays due to road and testing restrictions and some firms in Shenzhen had stopped their warehouses from accepting deliveries. 
Refinitiv data showed increased container congestion at key Chinese shipping hubs, with the number of vessels awaiting docking in the outer anchorages of the Yangtze Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Zhoushan and Qingdao port more than double the average of March 2021. 
Chinese share prices, which plunged on Monday, slumped to close at 21-month lows on Tuesday as surging coronavirus cases threatened the outlook for the world's second-largest economy. 
Other companies which have warned that the COVID-19 curbs are impacting their businesses include Chinese automaker BYD, KFC operator Yum China, iPhone assembler Foxconn, Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
BYD, headquartered in Shenzhen where most companies have been told to ask staff to work from home, said that there had been some impact on production at its site. 
""We are actively coordinating a response and carrying out epidemic prevention and control,"" BYD said.

Yum, operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China, said on Monday during an earnings briefing that its operations had been significantly impacted by the outbreaks, and same-store sales fell 20% year-on-year in the first two weeks of March. 
""It's a very tough month for every food service retailer in China,"" a source at a large Western catering chain told Reuters.

Israel's flag carrier will pay interest of 5.5% to 7% in the loan, in which final details still need to be worked out, it said in a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv.
El Al will put up its Matmid frequent flier club as collateral for the loan. Phoenix will have an option to buy 25% of Matmid by the end of 2027.
Sales plummeted at El Al amid restrictions imposed during the pandemic to curb the spread of COVID-19. Israel only recently opened its borders to foreign tourists, allowing El Al to narrow its net loss in the fourth quarter to $110 million from $140 million a year earlier.

The loan is part of a government bailout package, in which El Al was forced to lay off one-third if of its workforce and trim its fleet. The state, which gave El Al a $210 million aid package last year, also required El Al to inject more cash into the airline, either by selling a stake in Matmid or securing a loan using Matmid as collateral.
The two parties have 90 days to reach a final loan agreement and El Al is restricted from taking out additional loans.

The majority of investors managing about $1 trillion in assets polled between March 4 and 10 now expect an equity bear market in 2022 and allocations to global equities have dropped to their lowest levels since May 2020. 
Cash levels among investors rose to nearly 6% while allocations to commodities soared to a record 33%. Hedge funds net exposure to stock markets is at its lowest level since April 2020, according to the survey. 
The top crowded trade is long oil/commodities, the U.S. investment bank said in the note, with long technology stocks and long ESG ranked second and third respectively. Nearly half of the investors surveyed expect oil will produce the best returns in 2022.
The European edition of the monthly fund manager survey made for grim reading with investors slashing their growth outlook for Europe in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A net 69% of respondents expect the European economy to weaken over the coming year, the highest share since 2011. The 81 percentage point swing from February's net 12% who still expected to see growth marks the biggest month-on-month drop since BoFA's records began in 1994.
In response to the darkening growth outlook, about 61% of investors think the European market has peaked for this cycle, up from 22% in the previous edition of the survey. 
Investors have also slightly increased their expectations for the number of rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2022 even as liquidity conditions have worsened considerably to their lowest since the coronavirus pandemic hit financial markets in March and April 2020.

""This is notable because central banks have historically been much less inclined to hike when liquidity conditions are very poor,"" BofA said.
A net 44% of European investors expect European inflation to rise over the next twelve months, while last month 38% expected lower inflation. At a global level, a net 5% of investors think global inflation will decline, down from a 13-year high of 56% last month, BoFA said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M reported a 23% rise in first quarter sales on Tuesday, which was in line with market expectations, as the world's second-biggest fashion retailer attempts to build on its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Shares in Sweden's H&M, which did not give any comment in its statement, were down 3% in early trade as analysts focused on the potential impact of the Ukraine crisis on its business in Central and Eastern Europe and wider global repurcussions. 
Net sales in H&M's fiscal first quarter from December through February, its seasonally slowest, were up by 18% in local currency terms, at 49.2 billion crowns ($5.13 billion), compared to an average forecast from analysts polled by Refinitiv of 49.1 billion crowns. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note the figures implied a slowdown in local-currency sales growth to around 14% in February, from the around 20% flagged previously for December-January.
H&M earlier this month temporarily closed its stores in Russia, which last quarter accounted for 4% of group sales, joining a growing list of international companies shunning the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said he had cut profit estimates for H&M for this year and next by around 10%, pointing to the Russia store closures but also the fact Central and Eastern Europe account for some 12% of group sales.
Less than a month before Russia invaded Ukraine, H&M had drawn a line under the pandemic, and several tough years before that, reporting a jump in profit and saying it was hiking investments with the aim of doubling sales by 2030.
Credit Suisse analysts noted that while Russia accounts for a small share of H&M's sales, the Ukraine crisis could result in a material effect on global disposable income and demand. 
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"", has proposed nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave in the wake of economic sanctions.

H&M will publish its full quarterly earnings report on March 31. Its biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, is due to report quarterly results on March 16.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said talks have failed to resolve a bitter dispute over Future Retail stores and accused both it and Reliance Industries of fraud in Indian newspaper ads on Tuesday.
The U.S. e-commerce giant has been contesting a $3.4 billion sale of Future Group's retail assets to the Reliance conglomerate that was announced in 2020, and the case is currently before the Indian Supreme Court.
""I regret to say that we made efforts but I think nothing is possible by way of resolution,"" Amazon's lawyer Gopal Subramanium told the court. ""The conversation is over.""
Reliance, also India's biggest retailer, stunned Amazon when it began taking over prized real estate on Feb.25 with its staff suddenly showing up at many of Future's biggest stores to assume control, sources have told Reuters.
In earlier legal wrangling, Amazon had managed to block the sale of the retail assets.
But Reliance's sudden possession of more than 900 Future stores have landed what some analysts are calling a coup de grace that spoils Amazon's chances of untangling the transfer of Future's assets.
After the first seizures of stores, Amazon proposed talks separate from the Supreme Court hearing to resolve the issue but on Tuesday, lawyers for both Amazon and Future agreed those negotiations had collapsed.
Amazon had at the Supreme Court been seeking to return the legal dispute to arbitration in Singapore after Future had successfully obtained an Indian court order to stay those proceedings. On Tuesday, Future said it was not opposed to arbitration in Singapore.
Earlier in the day, Amazon had run large ads in leading Indian newspapers headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" and saying that actions taken by Reliance and Future ""have been done in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India.""
Future lawyer Harish Salve told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the company did not transfer the stores to Reliance voluntarily. 
Future has said in filings this month that it could not pay rent at many outlets given its distressed financial situation and that Reliance, which had taken over many of its leases, had issued it with termination notices.
Reliance has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. 

The newspaper ads were aimed at alerting all stakeholders, including Future's lenders, that the transfer of assets to Reliance is legally prohibited, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Toyota said it would suspend production on one line at a factory for eight weekdays starting March 22 through the end of the month. That is in addition to the suspension of domestic production at two factories announced last month. 
Production of about 14,000 Noah and Voxy minivans would be affected by the latest suspension, a Toyota spokesperson said.
Last week, Toyota said it would lower production for three months starting April to ease the strain on suppliers, which were struggling with the shortages of chips and other parts.
The news follows Toyota's announcement on Monday that it would halt production at its joint venture plant with FAW Group in the city of Changchun, China, due to fresh COVID-19 curbs. 
Despite the cuts, Toyota would maintain its 8.5 million vehicle production target for the year, the spokesperson said.
A global chip shortage has plagued companies from smartphone makers to consumer electronics firms and car makers, forcing companies including Toyota to repeatedly cut production even as raw material costs rise.
U.S. EV maker Rivian Automotive warned last week that supply-chain issues could force it to cut planned production by half this year. 
German car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday it sold 2 million fewer cars than planned last year due to the chip crunch and warned that ongoing supply bottlenecks, high commodity prices and the Russia-Ukraine conflict could hit growth in 2022.

Toyota, Volkswagen and other automakers have stopped production at their Russian plants due to supply chain disruptions after the country invaded Ukraine.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened lower on Tuesday as a fresh round of EU sanctions, a rebound in Covid-19 cases and more signs of red-hot inflation all weighed on sentiment. 
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), The Euro Stoxx 50 was down 53 points or 1.4% while the broader Stoxx 600 Index was down by a similar amount. Germany was the biggest loser among major markets, the DAX losing 1.3%, while Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed with a drop of only 0.8%.
Among individual stocks, Swedish retailer H & M (ST:HMb) fell 3.1% despite reporting in-line first-quarter sales growth of 23%, while U.K.-based tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) fell 1.1% after it trimmed its profit forecast due to the exit from Russia that it announced last week. 
Overnight, the EU agreed to widened its sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, imposing a ban on exports of luxury goods and cars worth over 50,000 euros. The bloc still shied away from an immediate ban on purchases of Russian energy exports, which are opposed by Germany and some others due to the lack of short-term alternatives. 
The luxury sector underperformed on the news: LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock fell 2.4% while Moncler (MI:MONC) fell over 3%.
The euro, however, rose 0.6% against the dollar to $1.1058, supported by better-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data out of China for February. The numbers suggested that the second-most important export market for European businesses is still holding up, although the numbers have been made somewhat obsolete by the lockdowns imposed this week as China battles to contain the Covid-19 virus. The country has locked down both the manufacturing center of Shenzhen and the whole province of Jilin in northeastern China, keeping some 45 million people at home in the biggest lockdowns in over two years.
The dollar, which eased across the board against developed-market currencies in early trading, hit a two-month high against the yuan on fears of an imminent economic slowdown there. 
Europe itself is struggling with a revival of the virus - the BA.2 strain of the Omicron variant. After rushing to drop unpopular public health measures in recent weeks, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach warned that new infections would likely reach a new all-time high in Europe's largest economy this week. However, the more mild nature of the new dominant strain is ensuring that hospital admissions are still remaining well below previous record highs.
Earlier, the U.K. reported better-than-expected labor market data for February, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9%, below its pre-pandemic level. Average earnings also outstripped expectations, cementing fears of another interest rate hike from the Bank of England this week. If confirmed, that would be a third hike in as many meetings from the BoE. In the Eurozone, French data showed consumer inflation to be still running well ahead of target at 4.2% on the year in February.
Eurozone industrial production data and the German ZEW Economic Sentiment Index are due later, but the main event on the data calendar will be the release of U.S. producer price inflation at 8:30 AM ET."

It was exactly two years ago on March 15 2020 that the U.S. Federal Reserve, in the words of its boss Jerome Powell, ""crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before.""
In the face of a pandemic that threatened recession on a scale not seen since the 1930s, Powell cut interest rates to zero, announced huge asset purchases to deflect bond market stress and opened dollar supply lines for other central banks.
Now, the Fed is about to throw its pandemic emergency measures into reverse. Later on Tuesday, it starts a two-day meeting that should deliver a 25 basis-point rate rise and could signal how far and fast policy tightening might go. 
The challenges, while less monumental than in 2020, are nonetheless daunting. A war is raging, sending food and fuel prices soaring. That could exacerbate inflation, already more than three times the Fed's target; a double-digit factory inflation print is expected on Tuesday. 
A sharp rise in Treasury yields and futures reflect expectations of aggressive policy-tightening ahead, yet stamping on inflation rather than economic growth will be no easy task .
On the other side of the world, China's central bank defied rate cut expectations, perhaps having assessed forecast-beating industrial and retail data. With COVID cases on the rise, and possibly, more lockdowns to come, stocks plunged 4.5% with foreigners especially heading for the exit.
And the prospect of more regulatory hurdles sent Hong Kong tech stocks down as much as 11% in its biggest intraday fall ever.
Finally Europe. Tuesday's UK data showing unemployment falling below pre-pandemic rates and wage gains means a Bank of England rate hike on Thursday is a done deal. A tad later, Germany's March ZEW reading may show a dip, reflecting the confidence hit inflicted by the war. 
And finally, on the Ukraine-Russia front, talks are to continue after Monday discussions yielded no progress. U.S., and European equities are downbeat but oil prices declined further to two-week lows. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
Australia central bank patient on policy despite inflation shock

BEIJING (Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet that took off from Seattle on Monday is en route to the manufacturer's completion plant in China, two industry sources said, in a sign the model is closer to returning to commercial flights there after a three-year grounding.
Flight tracking websites showed the plane, painted in the livery of Shanghai Airlines - a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) - had landed in Hawaii. 
The source, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said it was the first fuel stop of a multi-day journey.
The Zhoushan plant, used for installing interiors before delivery, opened in December 2018, a few months before a second fatal MAX crash led China to ground the model. 
""If this points to a delivery, it will be the first MAX delivery to China since March 2019, which is material as the country historically has represented 17% of deliveries,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.
China, the first country to ground the MAX, is the only major global market where the aircraft is still not in commercial service, and its return is taking longer than expected at a time when domestic demand is declining as COVID-19 cases rise.
China's aviation regulator in early December provided airlines with a list of fixes required before its return to commercial flying, which it predicted would occur by the beginning of this year.
So far, however, there have been only test flights, and deliveries of more than 140 MAX jets already built for Chinese customers that are at Boeing sites in the United States have been delayed as a result, one of the industry sources told Reuters.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said on Jan. 26 that his company was getting ready to deliver those planes as early as the first quarter, once the fleet already in China returned to service.
The industry source said the initial plan was to deliver all 140-plus planes in 2022, but that was doubtful because the Zhoushan plant lacks capacity and many of the planes still required Chinese approvals.
Boeing declined to comment on the MAX flight to Zhoushan.
The planemaker said in a statement that it continued to work with regulators and customers on the MAX return to service worldwide.
Chinese airlines are in no rush to bring back the MAX because of falling domestic demand amid the biggest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years, three other people familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.
""There is less urgency to add capacity now,"" one of those people said.

China Southern Airlines is among the Chinese airlines closest to returning the plane to commercial service and might be the first to do so, the person said.
China Southern did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

""What matters is that French companies implement sanctions,"" Attal told France 2 television, when asked about TotalEnergies, which is under pressure from activist investors and NGOs to exit Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
A fourth package of EU sanctions decided on Monday called for no new investments in Russia, which was what TotalEnergies had already decided to do, Attal added.
TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and has suspended new investments in the country but has not followed the example of British peers BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) which are withdrawing from Russia.
Activist investor Clearway Capital has written to the board of TotalEnergies calling on it to exit its Russian operations in light of the war in Ukraine or face a vote on the issue at its next shareholder meeting.

Two leading French NGOs also plan to take legal action against TotalEnergies over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia, they said in a letter to the energy major's CEO. [L5N2VH4W9]

TOKYO (Reuters) - A decade after Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY)'s cars disappeared from Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s factory floors in Michigan, the Japanese automaker is once again building in the United States - this time with compatriot  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM). 
When the first Mazda CX-50 crossovers rolled off the assembly line at the joint Alabama plant in January, they were packed with efficiencies hammered out by the two automakers, both known for their cost-cutting smarts and manufacturing prowess.
For Mazda, restarting local production with help from Toyota's deep local knowledge and reputation for reliability is the game-changer it hopes will jump-start sales in the world's second-biggest market.
""It's a huge advantage for us to be able to learn from Toyota's vast experience in the United States,"" Masashi Aihara, head of Mazda Toyota Manufacturing U.S.A. (MTM), told Reuters in an interview last week.
Although the 50-50 venture might seem like a David-and-Goliath partnership, it also provides a glimpse into how Toyota aims to glean fresh skills from its growing number of smaller partners. 
As competition heats up in the industry - not least from prospective new entrants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group - Toyota has taken minority stakes in Mazda as well as small-car maker Suzuki Motor and all-wheel-drive specialist Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp in recent years.
Aihara, a 38-year veteran of Mazda, said his selection to lead the $2.3 billion, 300,000-units-a-year factory was evidence that the learning was mutual.
""Under President (Akio) Toyoda, Toyota is constantly looking to change the way it does things, and I think (by putting me in this position) he was saying, 'If there's something to be learned from Mazda, learn it.'""
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) PRACTICES
The Huntsville, Alabama factory, which opened last year and is designed to add electric vehicles in future, contains many firsts for Mazda.
MTM tows components from on-site suppliers on linked-up tractors, saving time on loading and unloading from trucks. 
The order in which the vehicles are assembled was also streamlined and machinery standardised as much as possible so Mazda and Toyota cars could eventually be built on the same line.
""There were times when we both realised that we were doing things a certain way purely out of habit,"" Aihara said. ""And in some cases, we came up with a hybrid method bringing in techniques from both sides. That's something we wouldn't be able to do at Mazda proper."" 
The operation hasn't been without its hitches. 
A tight labour market has meant the plant is still 900 workers short of the targeted 4,000, keeping it running at one shift instead of two. Mazda wants to boost U.S. sales by about a third to 450,000 by the middle of the decade.

An early plan to train six teams at Mazda and Toyota factories in Japan was derailed by COVID-19, the second team forced to cut their trip short. Still, Toyota's U.S. footprint paid off there too: Kentucky and other local plants helped complete training for the rest, Aihara said.
""Ultimately, the No. 1 mission for this factory is to contribute to the growth of our U.S. business,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild swings in asset prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine are prompting some investors to pare risk in their portfolios, fearing that the type of volatility seen in commodities in recent weeks could hit other markets.
At issue is liquidity – or the ease at which investors can buy or sell an asset without affecting its price. While episodes of low liquidity have contributed to sharp gyrations across markets over the last decade, signs of stress have become more plentiful in the last few weeks, exacerbated by everything from sanctions against Russia to expected central bank tightening.
Should liquidity continue to deteriorate throughout markets, investors worry that other assets could be subject to the kind of violent price swings that have wracked commodities this month - which have included a one-day doubling in nickel prices and a surge in oil to 14-year highs. 
""It isn't always clear where the contagion risks lie,"" said Frances Donald, Global Chief Economist at Manulife Investment Management. ""This is why liquidity needs to be monitored, not just daily, but hourly at this point, for signs of challenges.""
Financial indicators are showing increasing signs of stress throughout markets. 
The so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate was recently at its highest level since May 2020, while another closely-watched short-term funding stress gauge, the spread between the U.S. three-month Libor and the overnight index swap rate was at a similar high. Volatility in stocks, currencies and U.S. Treasury yields has also spiked.
In another potential red flag,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Monday suspended sales of two products linked to crude oil and market volatility, which some saw as a sign of lack of liquidity.
Among the assets investors have been cutting are emerging markets bonds, which saw $3.54 billion in net outflows last week, the biggest reduction since April 2020. Treasuries, meanwhile, saw some $5.4 billion in inflows in the past nine weeks, according to BofA Global Research. 
Mike Vogelzang, Chief Investment Officer at CAPTRUST in Boston, said his firm had taken ""aggressive action"" in response to the Ukraine crisis to reduce the risk profile of its portfolios. That included cutting equity exposure and selling mortgages and a number of corporate bonds, replacing them with highly liquid short-term U.S. Treasuries. 
""We're worried about a potential liquidity scare on a global stage,"" he said. ""We were significantly underweight U.S. Treasuries to our benchmarks for years now, and so we really filled that bucket up and reduced the illiquidity potential in our portfolios.""
Vogelzang said events like last week's spike in nickel prices – which came as one of the world's top producers bought large amounts of nickel to cover bets on falling prices and cover costly margin calls - indicate the potential for ""liquidity panic"" in markets.
Investors also highlighted counterparty risk, referring to the probability of defaults in contractual obligations linked, in this case, to an underlying commodity. In a rare warning on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said concentrated positions of prime brokerage counterparties pose particular concerns.
Bill Campbell, Global Bond Portfolio Manager at DoubleLine is concerned about the impact the Ukraine crisis is having on a ""systemically important"" part of global supply chains that affects not only energy prices but also vital commodities such as wheat, of which both Ukraine and Russia are major producers.
Campbell has reduced exposure to Eastern European countries in his portfolios and is looking to differentiate investment between commodity importing and commodity exporting countries to reduce risk. 
""We need to become more comfortable that this crisis is going to be contained to the region,"" he said. 

Ryan O'Malley, a fixed income portfolio manager at Sage Advisory said the conflict had accelerated liquidity concerns in the corporate credit market, pushing him to shift his portfolio increasingly towards more liquid assets such as Treasuries.
""We're trying to get more liquid,"" O'Malley said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refining giant Reliance Industries has acquired the assets of battery maker Lithium Werks for $61 million, its second such deal in less than three months, as it makes a bigger push towards clean energy and transport.
Reliance's investment in Lithium Werks, which manufactures lithium iron phosphate batteries that are mainly used in electric vehicles (EVs), includes funding for future growth, the company said late on Monday. 
The assets, acquired through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy, include Lithium Werks' portfolio of about 219 patents, a manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts and existing employees, it said.
The deal comes as Reliance looks to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemicals business, with plans to invest $10 billion in clean energy projects to boost its green credentials and meet its goal of net zero carbon by 2035.
Reliance agreed in December to buy Faradion, a UK-based sodium-ion battery company, for an enterprise value of 100 million pounds ($130 million). The two companies will give Reliance access to technology that will be key in its plan to manufacture batteries and battery systems in India. 
""Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries,"" Reliance's owner, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said in the statement.
It will allow Reliance to provide ""a high-performance supply chain"" to the growing Indian EV and energy storage markets, he added.

India is offering incentives of up to $6 billion to companies to build EVs and batteries locally as the government looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and renewable energy.

The eurobonds in question, maturing in 2023 and 2043, were both last trading at 20 cents on the dollar or lower and are among the first to have scheduled payments after Russia was hit by sanctions related to its invasion of Ukraine.
The restrictions meant it was unclear whether Russia would be able, or willing, to make the payments.
""This week, on Wednesday, we are due to repay another Eurobond coupon,"" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told state TV on Monday. ""And today, on Monday, we prepared a payment document in foreign currency and will give an order to foreign banks to execute this payment. We will keep an eye on this payment document and monitor how banks will execute our (payment) orders."" 
The finance ministry said payments will be made in roubles if sanctions prevent banks from honouring debts in the currency of issue.
Reuters could not immediately confirm with bond holders that the payment was under way.
Russia has 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding. Around half of the bonds are held by foreign investors. 

Trading in Russian assets has all but halted across exchanges outside Moscow.
Russia's last major external debt default was over a century ago, when Bolsheviks failed to recognise Tsarist debt in the wake of the 1917 revolution.

Data released earlier in the day showed that fixed asset investment grew 12.2% year-on-year, while industrial production grew 7.5% year-on-year in February. Retail sales grew 6.7% year-on-year and the unemployment rate was 5.5%.
The People’s Bank of China will also set the rate for one-year policy loans, while the lockdowns imposed in response to the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in the country pose a risk to demand.

In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.61%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its last meeting. The house price index also grew 4.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Soaring inflation, which was aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, continues to be a cause for concern for some investors.
“The poor stock market just can’t catch a break,” Susquehanna International Group derivatives strategist Chris Murphy told Bloomberg. “You get oil down $8 or $10 and now everyone is worried about U.S. Treasury yields. That just kind of points to, there are a lot of issues to be dealt with. When one goes to the backburner, something else pops up.”
The U.S. Federal Reserve will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday, with the Bank of England to hand down its decision the next day. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane will speak at a conference on Thursday, while the Bank of Japan will hand down its policy decision on Friday.
Meanwhile, investors are monitoring talks between Ukraine and Russia that could ease the conflict. Russia also began the payment process of two bond coupons due within the week. The London Metal Exchange will also resume nickel trading on Wednesday, over a week after trade was suspended due to a historic short squeeze.
Other investors warned that market volatility is likely to continues, as risks including the crisis in Ukraine and central banks making policy errors remain. It also remains to be seen whether Russia can continue servicing its international debt, as sanctions imposed by the West remain in place.
“It’s going to take a while to tame inflation,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Private Wealth Management managing director Kathy Entwistle told Bloomberg. “The regular consumer is the one that is going to feel it the most this year. And they’re the ones who held up the markets last year.”"

""Equity markets are going to be challenged going forward, and today is yet another example of that.""
The technology sector and consumer discretionary were the biggest drags on the S&P 500. Higher interest rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks because their valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows.

(Reuters) -An FBI agent testified on Monday that Chinese nationals brought to the United States under research visas went to work for ZTE Corp (HK:0763) in New Jersey - a possible sign the Chinese tech company violated its probation from a 2017 U.S. plea deal.
At a hearing in federal court in Dallas, FBI special agent Marcus Wondergem said Chinese nationals came to the United States under the guise they would be doing research at the lab of Georgia Tech professor Gee-Kung Chang, but spent little time there and moved to apartments near ZTE in Morristown, New Jersey.
""Is it true that some of these individuals spent months without entering the lab?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney John de la Garza asked Wondergem.
""Yes, it is,"" Wondergem replied.
U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade said he hoped to issue a written ruling in a matter of days. 
ZTE is on probation from its guilty plea in a case tied to illegally shipping American technology to Iran. Kinkeade summoned the company to his courtroom over the possible violation involving an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud. 
ZTE's shares declined after word of the hearing surfaced about a week ago, falling more than 12% last week in Hong Kong and then slipping 7% further on Monday.
Chang and Jianjun Yu, a former ZTE research director in New Jersey, are accused of conspiring to bring Chinese nationals to the United States to conduct research at ZTE between at least 2014 and 2018, according to an indictment unsealed in March 2021. 
The Chinese nationals were in the United States on J-1 visas, which are intended for work and study at sponsoring institutions like Georgia Tech.
During his testimony, the FBI's Wondergem said he checked the door logs for the Georgia Tech lab and produced leases for apartments in Morristown. 
On cross-examination by Dallas lawyer Scott Barnard, who represents ZTE, Wondergem acknowledged that the sponsor of the J-1 visas - Georgia Tech, not ZTE - was responsible for the accuracy of the visa applications and that ""research scholars"" are permitted to work at more than one location.
Wondergem also said that, despite years of investigation in the Georgia Tech case, neither ZTE nor a U.S. subsidiary was indicted.
No other witnesses were called at the hearing.
In closing arguments, Robert Buehler, a lawyer for ZTE, said Yu was a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University and, in many cases, recommended former students to Georgia Tech. He described their work at ZTE as an ""informal internship.""
Buehler also argued that Georgia Tech was responsible for the visas and for the conduct of scientists and engineers in the United States.
""If anyone here should have done more, it was Georgia Tech,"" Buehler said.
De la Garza argued that Yu and Chang conspired to use J-1 visas for people to work at ZTE because it was a ""cheaper, faster, easier way"" to get foreign nationals into the United States. 

""It's a sham,"" de la Garza said. 
Chang has pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Chang, Robert Fisher, declined to comment. Yu's status is unclear. ZTE said he left the company in 2019.

Scharf's compensation consisted of $2.5 million in base salary, a $5.4 million cash bonus, $10.8 million in performance shares awards and $5.8 million in restricted share rights, the filing showed.
The top boss had earned $20.3 million in 2020, a 12% drop from the previous year.
Scharf took over the reins at Wells Fargo in 2019, seeking to turn around the fortunes of the major Wall Street bank which has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers’ names without their permission, to hit sales targets. 

After a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, Wells Fargo recovered last year, with the bank's shares jumping nearly 59% in 2021.

Nubank's U.S.-listed shares were up nearly 2% at $6.04 after market. Despite Monday's bump, however, Nubank's shares have lost nearly 37% so far this year, in line with souring investor sentiment in the broader tech market.

Antitrust agencies in the United States and Europe both have to decide if Amazon's $8.5 billion deal for the nearly century-old studio breaks antitrust law. Amazon announced the transaction in May 2021, saying it offered a trove of content for the company to develop and draw consumers to its Prime fast-shipping and streaming club.
In Europe, EU antitrust regulators are set to clear the planned acquisition without conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. They have a March 15 deadline to act.
Shortly after that, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is approaching its own deadline for making a decision on whether the deal violates antitrust law. The FTC's deadline is in mid-March, at least a day after the European Commission's deadline, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The online retailer substantially complied with the FTC's requests for information about the deal, which started the clock for the FTC to make a decision, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Exactly when Amazon might close the deal, subject to whether or not the FTC attempts to stop the MGM merger, was unclear.
The FTC, whose Chair Lina Khan gained internet fame with a law review article entitled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" has a broader antitrust probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

If Amazon wins approval, the online retailer and cloud-computing giant would be able to ramp up competition with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney +. 
MGM would bolster Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated ""Licorice Pizza"" and a long list of television shows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a rare public warning, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday told broker-dealers and other market participants to ""remain vigilant to market and counterparty risk"" amid heightened volatility and global uncertainties. 
The agency urged broker-dealers to closely monitor counterparty risk, collect ""margin"" or collateral from counterparties to ""the fullest extent possible,"" and stress test their positions. 
Global stock and commodities markets have been unusually volatile in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a slew of Western retaliatory sanctions on Russia's financial system and its oil exports.
Wild swings in the prices of oil, metals and other raw materials last week generated more margin calls at clearing houses and trading firms, forcing counterparties out of the money to stump up liquid collateral they must pledge to secure their trades.
Sudden, large margin calls can put financial stress on counterparties that do not hold sufficiently liquid assets. 
""Staff urges broker-dealers to seek sufficient information to determine counterparties’ aggregate positions in any markets that may experience liquidity concerns and work with the counterparties to mitigate risk,"" the SEC said. 

Regulators are more sensitive to issues with broker dealers’ counterparty risk management controls after several were left nursing around $10 billion in losses last year on derivative trades they had inked with New York family office Archegos. 
On Monday, the SEC said that ""concentrated positions"" among prime broker counterparties ""pose particular concerns"" and that brokers should gather data to determine counterparties’ aggregate exposure, the SEC said

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreak in two years has forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations, raising concerns over supply chain disruptions. 
Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing contagion as quickly as possible, among them the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen.
Shenzhen, China's Silicon Valley, is carrying out mass testing after dozens of new local cases were recorded. Officials have suspended public transport and urged people to work at home this week as much as possible.
White House press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that the Biden Administration was monitoring the lockdown of the tech hub ""incredibly closely."" 
""What we're looking at is of course ... the impact on some of these ports around the impacted areas of China,"" she said in a Monday afternoon briefing. 
China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than it recorded in all of 2021. 
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said its Shenzhen operations would be suspended until further notice, adding it would deploy backup plants to reduce disruption. 
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Foxconn and its subsidiaries' operations in Shenzhen would be suspended for the first half of the week. 
One of the people said the government was allowing companies to operate if they could create a ""closed management"" system where employees would live and work in a bubble. Such a system was in place during the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Other Taiwan companies which said they had suspended Shenzhen operations included chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp, which also supplies Apple and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and flexible printed circuit board maker Sunflex Technology Co Ltd.
Sunflex said its plant would be closed until Sunday.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel declined to comment. 
Paul Weedman, who runs manufacturing consultancy Victure Industrial Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, warned that the restrictions were having a ripple effect beyond Shenzhen to the wider Guangdong province. Production for some of his customers' orders have been suspended, and many factory visits cancelled, he said. 
""Imagine you have a factory of 100 people and all of a sudden you can’t do anything - you can’t fulfil your existing orders, you can’t accept new orders. The impact is not 2 or 3 weeks, but 3-6 months.""
Shenzhen's Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), one of China's busiest ports, said in a WeChat statement it was operating normally, although two companies with warehouses at the port said they needed to temporarily suspend operations. 
CHANGCHUN LOCKDOWN
Other cities have enacted restrictions to varying extents. Officials have locked down Changchun city, the capital of northeastern Jilin province, shut schools in the financial hub of Shanghai and suspended public transport in the manufacturing centre of Dongguan. 
Toyota said on Monday its joint venture with China's FAW Group had suspended production in Changchun, while its Tianjin city operations remained unaffected. 
Volkswagen, which also has a joint venture with FAW, said it had suspended production at its vehicle and component plants from Monday to Wednesday. FAW, which is headquartered in Changchun, did not respond to a request for comment. 

A factory owner in Dongguan, who gave his surname as Lau, said his plant was forced to shut down from Sunday until Tuesday. They were also experiencing some issues in obtaining materials from suppliers due to the virus restrictions, he added. 
""Hopefully they will let us carry on with the production soon,"" he said. ""There's not much we can do. The whole world has moved on, except for China. They should just let go of the zero-COVID strategy.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allowed three pork plants to increase processing line speeds this month as part of a trial program, reviving a policy that started under the Trump administration.
The approvals will allow meat companies to boost pork production when there are ample supplies of hogs. They also renew concerns about worker injuries and food safety at meat plants.
The USDA said it approved faster line speeds at Clemens Food Group in Hatfield, Pennsylvania; Quality Pork Processors in Austin, Minnesota; and Wholestone Farms Cooperative in Fremont, Nebraska. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
Nine plants were eligible to apply for the trial program because they were previously able to accelerate processing under the Trump-era rule.
Last year, a U.S. judge invalidated the 2019 rule after the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union sued the USDA over safety concerns for workers running faster slaughter lines.
The ruling restricted plants to processing 1,106 hogs per hour.
Line speeds are ""unique"" for plants approved for the trial program, the USDA told Reuters on Monday. The agency declined to provide the specific limits.
Plants approved for the trial program can operate at faster speeds for up to a year and are supposed to collect data on how line speeds affect workers.
The UFCW is comfortable with the program in plants it represents because companies agreed to increase staffing when line speeds accelerate to ensure safety, said Mark Lauritsen, the union's international vice president for meatpacking. The union represents workers at Quality Pork Processors and Wholestone Farms.
The Biden administration has criticized the meat industry for being too concentrated and has tried to incentivize new, smaller meatpacking plants to increase output and lower meat prices.

New York (Reuters) - Oil prices fell and European stocks rose on Monday as investors weighed positive comments from ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, while U.S. Treasury yields hit two-and-a-half year highs on expectations of a first U.S. rate hike.
U.S. stocks were mostly lower as investors remained cautious on the Ukraine conflict, with the market focus on this week's Federal Reserve meeting.
Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most upbeat assessments on Sunday of progress in their talks to end the conflict, with some delegates saying draft agreements could be reached within days.
European stocks closed higher on the tentative hopes of progress in the peace talks, while oil prices retreated to their lowest in two weeks on the prospects of increased global supplies.
""Everything seems to be heading towards an acute point where we should have some headway. The fact is neither side has a complete edge and as a result talks are the most sensible outcome, with some type of resolution,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell as traders sold big growth stocks ahead of the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, when the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in three years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05 points to 32,945.24, the S&P 500 lost 0.74% to 4,173.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.04% to 12,581.22.
Investors expect the U.S. central bank to hike rates more aggressively this year, after data on Thursday showed that annual inflation in February rose at the fastest pace in 40 years, forcing Americans to dig deeper to pay for rent, food and gasoline.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rose to 2.1419%, the highest since July 2019.
""The Fed is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points (this week) and you're seeing the 10-yields rise, which is positive from a yield curve perspective and implies the flattening may be coming to an end. We may avoid an inversion and a recession in the near term,"" Hayes said.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.2% while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.74%. Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.58%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department on Monday barred regional carrier  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Inc from ending service to 29 locales until replacement carriers can be found under the government's subsidy program to provide air service to smaller communities.
SkyWest provides regional service for key airlines such as United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). SkyWest operates the 29 routes under the United Express name providing regional service for United Airlines.
SkyWest last week announced plans to end service to the 29 communities under the Essential Air Service subsidies program effective on June 8, saying ""the pilot staffing challenges across the airline industry preclude"" the carrier from continuing service.
The Transportation Department said SkyWest cannot terminate service through July 8 ""and for additional 30-day periods as necessary"" in the event federal officials do not secure another air carrier to provide service under the program at any of the 29 communities.
Some of the communities with United Express flights operated by SkyWest being cut include: Cape Girardeau, Joplin and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; Decatur, Illinois; Clarksburg and Greenbrier/Lewisburg, West Virginia; and Fort Dodge, Mason City and Sioux City, Iowa. Some others include: Muskegon and Houghton/Hancock, Michigan; Hattiesburg/Laurel, Mississippi; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Kearney, Scottsbluff and North Platte, Nebraska; Salina, Liberal, Hays and Dodge City, Kansas; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Victoria, Texas. 
Each route typically has a separate contract. Such contracts. Each contract generally has around $3 million in annual government subsidies.
SkyWest said it is ""eager to work with officials toward solutions that would enable us to reconnect these communities to the National Air Transportation System in the future, and we are committed to remaining flexible and adjusting our plans if the situation improves more quickly than currently expected.""

The Transportation Department said it wants other carriers to file proposals no later than April 11 to offer flights to replace the canceled service.
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told Congress in December the airline had nearly 100 regional airplanes effectively grounded ""because there's not enough pilots to fly them. ... The country is going to need thousands of pilots.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Where you go. What you pass. Where you stop. What you listen to. What you watch. Your good habits. Your bad habits. 
Companies in Europe and beyond are vying for control of the crown jewels of the connected car era: your vehicle's data. 
The contest is entering a pivotal phase as EU regulators look to hammer out the world's first laws for the ballooning industry around web-enabled vehicles, pitting carmakers against a coalition of insurers, leasing companies and repair shops.
European Commission sources said the EU executive should launch an industry consultation on in-vehicle data this week which could lead to legislation later this year - the first of its kind globally. 
Many companies view data as the gold of the new wired world, though for some it's more akin to air or water.
""If you don't have access to data in the future, eventually you'll be squeezed out,"" says Tim Albertsen, CEO of ALD, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s car leasing division, which commands millions of vehicles. 
""You'll not be efficient, you'll not have the right services, you just can't operate at the end of the day.""
Car manufacturers, guarding their gatekeeper role in accessing data from their vehicles, have resisted specific regulations for in-vehicle data, saying that protecting consumers is paramount. 
""Europe's auto industry is committed to giving access to the data generated by the vehicles it produces,"" said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). ""However, uncontrolled access to in-vehicle data poses major safety, (cyber) security, data protection and privacy threats."" 
Yet the companies lined up against them say limiting or charging what they deem unfair amounts for access to in-vehicle data could kill off competition for carmakers who already operate their own leasing firms, car subscription services and repair shops.
In some cases, they say carmakers are already restricting access to vehicle data and charging independent repair shops more for access. 
""The manufacturers are in direct contact with the vehicle, so they get all the data,"" says Sylvia Gotzen, CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors, or FIGIEFA, which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe. 
""They get the full buffet and all we get is some crumbs.""
CARMAKERS: WE SHARE DATA
Vehicle manufacturers have big plans for data.
For example Stellantis, the world's No. 4 carmaker, expects to generate 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) annually by 2030 from software products and subscription services. Such offerings are also central to General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plan to double annual revenue to around $280 billion.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said data is becoming the ""key source of value creation and innovation"", adding that customers have ""full control"" over it, citing vehicle security and customer sovereignty as its main focuses.
BMW rejected suggestions it was withholding data. 
The German company said it can share nearly 100 data points with third parties if drivers requested it and could make more available if companies prove a real business need for them and a willingness to take responsibility for cybersecurity risks. Auto supplier groups like FIGIEFA say carmakers can access thousands of data points. 
A BMW spokesperson said the carmaker would like all sides to sit down with a mediator such as the European Commission and hammer out a list of data points that is acceptable to everyone.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters on Friday that the carmaker aggregated data, which cost money, and so needed to be paid for it. He cited, as an example, data that Stellantis sells to cities to measure how often anti-lock braking systems are engaged at junctions and gauge which are the most dangerous. 
""It is not only collecting the data, it is also about crunching the data in a way that is going to create value for somebody willing to pay for it,"" Tavares said. 
'DATA IS ABSOLUTELY KEY' 
Yet other companies in the auto ecosystem, such as ALD, say they want the European Union to ensure a level playing field
ALD, in the process of buying Dutch rival LeasePlan to give it a combined fleet of 3.5 million vehicles, has a car-sharing platform that needs to run diagnostics, read the odometer, check the fuel gauge and switch cars between users.
It also offers an insurance product that lowers your premium based on good driving behaviour - monitoring how you accelerate and brake. 
""Access to data is absolutely key for us to provide the services we do today,"" CEO Albertsen said. 
To extract car data, ALD plugs a wireless ""dongle"" into the vehicle that transmits information to an in-house developed platform that it pays U.S. startup Vinli to operate. Carmakers running similar services get that data directly, putting ALD at a competitive disadvantage, Albertsen said.
Stellantis, for instance, offers car sharing and rentals through its Free2Move unit. Volkswagen could take over rental company Europcar to take advantage of car sharing and subscription services.
And most major carmakers have their own leasing units, like BMW's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Mercedes-Benz's Athlon.
ALD's Albertsen said major fleet customers were willing to pay for the data but that he wanted regulations to ensure ALD's car-sharing unit paid the same as, for instance, Stellantis charges its own Free2Move division.
RISKS FOR REPAIR SHOPS
Insurers and car repair shops say it is paramount that the EU let drivers choose who accesses their vehicles' data.
    ""There is a need to regulate this, as you cannot leave this in the hands of car manufacturers,"" said Nicolas Jeanmart, industry group Insurance Europe's head of personal and general insurance. ""It should be for each driver to decide what they want to do with their data.""
FIGIEFA's Gotzen said that would allow car owners to link their preferred repair shop to their car and have it run remote diagnostics if they had car trouble, instead of relying solely on the manufacturer's recommendations.
""All of this is technically possible now, but we are hampered because car manufacturers prevent us from doing this,"" she said.
She said FIGIEFA's members are willing to adopt carmakers' cybersecurity processes and requirements, but added cybersecurity could serve as an excuse for carmakers to restrict access.

Richard Knubben, deputy director general of Leaseurope, which represents Europe's leasing and car rental firms, said the longer the EU took to legislate car data, the more independent repair shops are at risk of going out of business because they lack access to it.
""By the time we get legislation we may already be stuck with an imbalance that we can't fix anymore,"" Knubben said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Do you believe in Cathie Wood?
Wall Street's star stock picker has seen her fortunes wane over the past year as her flagship tech innovation fund slid more than 50%, losing $13 billion in market value.
Yet investors have continued to buy into her futuristic vision, according to data from industry tracker Lipper: not only holding tight but plowing more than $2 billion in additional net inflows into the fund at her firm ARK, a name inspired by the Ark of the Covenant, a Biblical vessel of divine revelation.
""People like to bet on somebody and look someone in their face and see their conviction,"" said Tom Lydon, an asset management veteran. ""That has helped override any concerns that this fund is broken."" 
Wood, one of the few prominent female fund managers on Wall Street, is facing one of the greatest challenges of her professional career: how to show the world that she is simply more than the face of what some are calling the pandemic bubble.
While much has been written about the decline of her ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, this story is the first to draw on a range of interviews, with about a dozen ARK employees, investors, and others within Wood's world, to show how she is trying to keep her reputation intact as she navigates the flip side of fame. 
Wood related to Lydon a recent conversation she had with an angry client who had millions invested with her fund and was prepared to pull it all out. She listened to their concerns without interrupting. Finally, it was her turn to speak. 
""We have the same commitment to our strategy that we did at the market top, and if you liked it back then you should love it even more because valuations have become more attractive,"" she told the client from her office high above the palm trees of St. Petersburg, Florida, where she recently moved from New York. 
By the end of the conversation, she had not only persuaded him to keep his money invested with her, but to add more to keep his overall allocation to her fund the same. 
Stirring the belief of seasoned investors may never be more critical for Wood. 
In the space of three years she rose from relative obscurity to being hailed as one of America's greatest stock oracles in 2020 after she made gains of about 150% by piling into shares such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) before they hit the stratosphere. 
Yet inflation soon began to sap the life out of the highly valued tech disruptor stocks she's famed for. From there, gravity seemed to take over, pulling the fund lower and lower last year despite a 20%-plus gain in the broad S&P 500. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine compounding losses, Wood's flagship fund is now down nearly 63% from its February 2021 high. 
While Wood declined to be interviewed for this article, those close to her say she is fielding multiple calls a day from financial advisers and investors to convince them to stick with her. 
At the same time, she is making a conscious drive to appear in more public forums, such as TV interviews and conferences, in order to bolster the confidence of retail investors who make up a significant portion of her fund base. 
SHORTING THE STAR
Her conviction does not waiver in private, said Robby Greengold, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar who regularly speaks with her. ""She doesn't present herself any differently in person than in public,"" he added. 
Wood, a prominent backer of bitcoin, believes technology is advancing at a more rapid pace than many investors realize and will cleave a handful of winners away from a growing trash pile of companies on the losing side of disruption.
Not everyone has faith, though. Not by a long shot.
In fact, a lack of confidence in Wood's long-term prospects led Tuttle Capital to launch an ETF that solely shorts her positions - the first known time that an ETF has specifically shorted the strategy of a single active manager. 
""We wanted to short speculative technology and, lucky for us, ARK had already designed that package,"" said Matthew Tuttle, the head of Tuttle Management, whose fund has swelled to $350 million in assets and is up about 90% since it began trading in November.
More broadly, short-sellers of ARK funds are up $712 million this year through Feb. 16, marked against market prices, a gain that puts them up 22.16% for the year versus a 5.2% gain for shorting the entire domestic ETF market, according to technology and data analytics company S3 Partners. 
On Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, which helped power the retail pandemic trading frenzy of ""meme"" stocks, a recent discussion is entitled ""What's the Consensus on Cathie Wood"".
""She literally took all of the bubble stocks, put them into an ETF, and just expected the bubble to just keep skyrocketing,"" one post says. 
A DAY IN THE LIFE
The interviews with the people close to 66-year-old Wood offer a window upon a day in the life of the celebrated stock picker.
7 a.m: She begins work at her office in a 26-storey tower just a few blocks away from the shimmering waters of Tampa Bay, often listening to earnings calls of companies in her portfolio and potential acquisitions.
8:45 a.m: she joins a call with her analyst team. On Friday mornings, she also holds a two-hour video meeting with her analysts and industry experts on how technology will drive societal change that she occasionally opens to select investors. 
The rest of the day is spent on calls with clients, trading decisions, and increasingly frequent media appearances, whether in the form of a nearly 45-minute grilling of her positions on CNBC or the firm's own YouTube shows and webinars. 
""She is more than willing to speak with any client that's out there to walk through what is happening in the market and just reassure them this is an opportunity,"" said Renato Leggi, a client portfolio manager at ARK. 
Wood might not need to convince her roughly 45-person staff at ARK Invest, where belief in her remains as powerful as the Florida sunshine. 
""People follow and are willing to give their life or entrust in her because of her humility,"" said Alex Cahana, a theme developer at ARK since 2014, helping identify the industry trends that could shape ARK's investment strategy. 
Her conviction in the face of piling losses appears to be resonating with investors.
This year alone, they have entrusted more than half a billion dollars in net inflows to her innovation fund, despite it turning in one of the worst performances of all funds tracked by Morningstar over the same time. 
Despite its recent losses, the fund has returned an annualised average of 27.5% over the last three years, putting it in the top 2% of the 491 U.S. mid-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar. That said, many investors who weren't there from the early days are now underwater. 
The fund's long-term track record is one reason to believe in Wood once inflation subsides, said Jimmy Lee, the head of Las Vegas-based Wealth Consulting Group, which has $2 billion in overall assets under management.
He said his group had added to its ARK investment in recent weeks: ""A lot of their names purchased in the past were way too rich in valuation, but now we're at a good entry point.""
'GO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO'
Woods, who has a deep-seated Christian faith, shot to finance fame relatively late in life after starting her career in 1980 at New York-based investment advisory firm Jennison Associates. She founded ARK in 2014 after other stints at Tupelo Capital Services and AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB).
While the sort of broad, thematic bets that are a hallmark of ARK's investment style has long been a part of her strategy, her willingness to take large positions - approximately 30% of her flagship fund is invested in the shares of five companies - has not always been welcomed at previous firms where she worked.
While she was chief investment officer of thematic portfolios at AllianceBernstein, the firm began to implement new constraints on how she could manage her fund following the market meltdown in 2008, adding limits on position sizes and requiring more sector diversification. 
Frustrated, Wood pitched the idea of a transparent, actively managed ETF to AllianceBernstein in 2013 but was refused, said Leggi. She left the firm and formed ARK Invest the following year. 
""You can't really run a constrained portfolio across innovation. You need to be able to go where you need to go when you want to,"" Leggi said. 
AllianceBernstein declined to comment for this article.
Wood's ability to retain investors despite large losses could be a sign that her fund won't become the pandemic version of the Munder NetNet fund, which soared to more than $11.5 billion in assets in the late 1990s thanks to bets on internet stocks, before falling over 90% once the dotcom bubble burst. Its once-celebrated portfolio manager, Paul Cook, left Wall Street and now works at a human resources software company.

Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF research at CFRA, said he admired Wood and ARK's ability to retain their appeal after a torrid year.
""Performance-chasing is much more common than investors demonstrating loyalty in the face of underperformance,"" he added. ""It is a credit to the shareholder base ARK has built.""

One in four children with COVID-19 symptoms develop ""long COVID,"" according to data pooled from 21 earlier studies conducted in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America.
Among the 80,071 children with COVID-19 in the studies, 25% developed symptoms that lasted at least 4-to-12 weeks or new persistent symptoms that appeared within 12 weeks, researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
The most frequent problems were neuropsychiatric (mood symptoms, fatigue, sleep disorders, headaches, cognitive alterations, dizziness, balance problems), cardiorespiratory (breathing difficulty, congestion, exercise intolerance, chest pain and tightness, cough, irregular heart rhythm), skin-related (excessive sweating, itchiness, hair loss) and gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea). Analyses of data pooled from many different studies with different methodologies cannot yield firm conclusions, the researchers acknowledge. What is clear, however, is that ""children and adolescents have also physical and mental health consequences derived from COVID-19,"" said study coauthor Sonia Villapol of Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas.
""Identifying the main signs and symptoms of pediatric long COVID can help diagnose, develop better treatments, create multidisciplinary teams for optimal clinical management, and find risk factors for prevention.""
Vaccine protection in mother's milk strongest after mRNA shots
Women who wish to pass protective antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines to their babies via breast milk should opt for the mRNA shots from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech, according to a study reported on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
For the study, 124 lactating women each provided 17 milk samples over a period of 100 days.
The women had received either an mRNA vaccine or a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). Researchers measured two types of antibodies in the milk samples - IgA antibodies and IgG antibodies, both of which are thought to play important roles in protecting breastfed infants. Nearly all - 96% to 97% - of the women who received both doses of an mRNA vaccine had detectable IgA antibodies in their milk, while only 39% had antibodies in their milk after two doses of the AstraZeneca shot and 48% after the one-dose J&J vaccine. All the women who received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines had IgG antibodies, compared to only 28% of women who received J&J's shot. 
""An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine is the optimal choice for lactating women when they want to transfer breast milk antibodies to their infants,"" the researchers concluded. 
Omicron is infectious on surfaces longer than original virus
Omicron particles remain infectious on surfaces for longer periods than particles of the original SARS-CoV-2, according to laboratory experiments.
Researchers put droplets of infectious virus from the original coronavirus version and the Omicron BA.1 variant on a variety of surfaces at room temperature.
On smooth surfaces (glass, stainless steel and plastic sheet), Omicron was still infectious after seven days, whereas particles of the original SARS-CoV-2 were no longer infectious on stainless steel and plastic sheets by day 4 and on glass by day 7, the researchers reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.

On tissue paper and printing paper, the original virus was no longer infectious at 30 minutes. Omicron was still infectious at 30 minutes, but no longer after an hour, the researchers said. 
For the most part, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets in the air. While infection via contact with contaminated surfaces is less common, the new study ""highlights the importance of hand hygiene and cleaning on surfaces that are regularly touched by different persons,"" said study coauthor Leo Poon of the University of Hong Kong. ""For surfaces and settings contaminated by a COVID-19 patient, proper cleaning should be done.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said on Monday it had suspended the sales and issuance of two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) with combined assets of about $1 billion - one linked to crude oil and another to a gauge of market volatility - due to capacity constraints, in a move that some investors said could spur big price swings in the products.
ETNs are debt securities that banks issue with the promise to pay holders a return linked to the performance of underlying securities or benchmarks. Investors are particularly sensitive about the product ever since another volatility-tracking ETN called XIV went bust in a matter of days in February 2018, dealing nearly $2 billion in losses to shareholders.
The ETNs affected are called iPath® Pure Beta Crude Oil ETN and iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN . 
Barclays, which expects to reopen sales and issuances of the ETNs as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity, said the actions were not linked to the crisis in Ukraine or any issue with the market dynamics in the underlying index components. The bank does not have sufficient capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances of the ETNs, it said in a statement. 
Barclays declined to elaborate further on the reasons for the actions, which were effective from the opening of trading on Monday.
""My first reaction is that Barclays is probably trying to de-risk,"" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, noting a recent jump in trading volume in VXX.
Some 71 million VXX shares changed hands daily over the last month, about double the average daily volume over the past year, as investors placed bets on stock market volatility as the Russia-Ukraine crises roiled global financial markets.
Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, said Barclays' move could have been prompted by a lack of liquidity in the market.
Analysts warned that the suspension of the share creation process for the two ETNs might cause their trading price to stray from their indicative price - where they should be trading based on the value of their underlying securities.
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. But with the suspension of new shares that process can break.
""The trading price of these securities can 'float' up without any effective constraint above the indicative price,"" said Vance Harwood, who runs the alternative investment website Six Figure Investing and is a consultant focused on volatility-linked products.
VXX finished the day up 9.4% at $28.81, or $1.58 higher than its indicative price, the largest this gap has been in more than a year.
But that can collapse fast, analysts warned.
For instance, shares of VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX) collapsed nearly 60% over the course of four trading sessions in March 2021, after the ETN's issuer,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), reopened issuance of TVIX shares after a one-month suspension. 
SHORT SQUEEZE CANDIDATE
For VXX - a heavily shorted instrument with about 90% of its shares sold short - the halt of share creation makes it a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said.
Short sellers sell borrowed shares, looking to make a profit by buying back the shares at a later date at a lower price. A short squeeze happens when short sellers are unable to find shares to buy to close their bearish bets even as the share price rises.

VXX short sellers are down about $198 million for the year-to-date, according to S3 data.
""VXX shorts are already teetering ... the lack of supply might really put them over the edge,"" Dusaniwsky said.

(Reuters) - The share price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc reached $500,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting the company's status as a defensive stock in a market unsettled by events in Ukraine and rising inflation.
Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has fallen 12%.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.
It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage.
Berkshire specializes in ""on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock.
""They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that.""
Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785.
Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there.
Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States.
Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares.

U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding.
Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) as oil prices soared.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended lower Monday, as energy was hurt by a slump in oil prices and tech wobbled on surging Treasury yields ahead of expectations for the Federal Reserve to hikes rates in the coming the days.     
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0%, or 1 point, the Nasdaq fell 2%. The Nasdaq closed in bear market territory, defined as a 20% loss from a recent peak, for the first time since March 2020. 
Little progress was made on Ukraine-Russia negotiations on Monday, but with talks set to resume on Tuesday, there is hope that both sides' willingness for ongoing dialogue could prove the building blocks toward a ceasefire agreement.
Oil prices, which have been underpinned recently by concerns that a prolonged Ukraine-Russia war would meaningfully disrupt crude supplies, moved sharply lower and took energy stocks along for the ride.     
Sentiment on energy was further soured by downgrades from Morgan Stanley on oil majors including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) to equal-weight from overweight, citing valuation concerns.
With just days to go until the Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin its rate hiking cycle, Treasury yields surged higher. Rising rates, the enemy of growth sectors of the market like tech wobbled. 
“After a 25 basis point hike at the March meeting, we see the Fed delivering an additional five 25 basis point rate hikes this year, followed by four hikes in 2023 to end the year at 2.625%,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the move lower suffering a more than 2% decline amid some worries about a shortage of supplies after Foxconn, one of its major suppliers China, said it would suspend operations in Shenzhen following a rise in Covid-19 cases.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were also 2% lower, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) bucked the trend up less than 1%.
But not all sectors are vulnerable to rising rates. Financials started the week on the front foot as investors bet that banks are set to benefit from a rising interest rates environment.
 Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF), with the latter up more than 5%.

The company, which currently has 30 million members, plans to begin the launch of its Travelzoo META service in April, which will be a paid subscription-based service.
The metaverse destinations and experiences will not be produced by Travelzoo, but they will work with creators to make experiences exclusively available to Travelzoo META members.
Travelzoo said it has been assembling a team of metaverse travel experience scouts in collaboration with a partner since January.

Investing.com – Stocks fell on Monday in volatile up and down trading on continued worries about Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The Federal Reserve is set to meet beginning Tuesday for its two-day meeting, and expectations are that it will cut interest rates by a quarter-point in the first of a series of rate increases this year at it tries to tame inflation.
The effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine on inflation haven’t fully appeared in the data so far, but the Fed will be acting with that uncertainty lingering. Job gains have been strong, but gasoline prices have surged in recent weeks. 
Russia’s aggression has sent global markets into tumult, though oil prices have plunged in recent days, retreating back to the $100 a barrel level.
Despite efforts at negotiating, there is little news out of talks for a ceasefire in Ukraine, where people continue to stream over the border of Poland and elsewhere seeking refuge from the fighting.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Oil seesaw
Oil prices hit their lowest in two weeks, with U.S. crude briefly breaking the $100 per barrel support, on signs that diplomacy might actually win in the Russia-Ukraine war despite Moscow signaling no commitment to abort its intent to conquer the capital Kyiv.
Reports of new Covid-19 lockdowns in China’s Shenzhen and Jilin areas over ramping Omicron cases also stirred risk aversion among investors, many of whom had thought the pandemic to be over for all intent and purpose.  
2. China EV stocks
Stocks and ADRs of Nio (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) slumped on fears the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was taking a tough stand against any Chinese company that fails to meet the audit requirements of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
The act allows the SEC to delist and ban companies from trading on U.S. exchanges if regulators are unable to review company audits for three straight years.
Nio, XPeng, and Li Auto are not named in the list of five companies the SEC cited last week for not meeting the audit norms, but investors fear the automakers could come in the line of fire.
3. TV wars
Amid the streaming wars, companies that gather data to deliver to television advertisers are in focus. Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE:NLSN) shares jumped on Monday on a WSJ report that a consortium of several private equity groups, including Elliott Management Corp, is in advanced discussions to purchase the TV ratings business. Expect more focus on Nielsen shares this week to see if the deal goes through.

Investing.com -- Nielsen shares jumped 37% on a report in The Wall Street Journal that a consortium of several private equity groups, including Elliott Management Corp., is in advanced discussions to purchase the TV ratings business.
The deal would see Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE:NLSN) sold for around $15 billion, including debt, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Discussions with several banks are said to have taken place with a deal possibly completed within weeks. However, there is no assurance that an agreement will be reached, with there still being the potential for negotiations to fall apart.
Nielsen had a market value of $6.2 billion on Monday, with a so-called enterprise value of more than $11 billion due to a large debt of over $5 billion.
Nielsen provides audience estimates for television networks to sell commercial slots. However, with the growth of streaming and traditional TV losing viewers in recent years, the company's services have become less valuable. Elliott has held a stake in Nielsen since 2018."

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up intraday gains Monday, driven by a slump in energy and technology as investors weighed the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the start of the Federal Reserve rate hikes expected later this week.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, or 36 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.6%.
Energy stocks fell 3%, pressured by a more than 6% slump in oil prices amid easing fears of supply shortages after Russia and Ukraine resumed talks on a ceasefire agreement that could pave the way to ending the war.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Shareholders at four U.S. oil companies will vote in the coming quarter on proposals for the firms to meet emissions targets set out in Paris in 2015, said climate activist group Follow This. 
The votes will test shareholder willingness to impose new air pollution restrictions amid high energy prices and new energy security fears following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""We were positively surprised,"" said Follow This founder Mark van Baal. ""This shows that most oil majors accept the winds of change at the SEC."" 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last fall raised the hurdle for companies seeking to exclude environment and social proposals from facing shareholders. 
Follow This is an activist group of 8,000 shareholders who hold stakes in oil companies in Europe and the United States. 
While Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has sought to bar the group's proposal saying the claims have already been ""substantially implemented"",  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) each have not blocked the group's petition, said van Baal. 
Occidental and Phillips 66 declined to comment. Exxon said it considers feedback and input from shareholders. Chevron said it only asks to exclude any proposal that do not comply with SEC shareholder petition rules. Conoco did not respond to a request for comment.
Follow This previously put similar proposals calling for the oil firms to ""substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."" Those petitions last year were supported by 61% of voting shareholders at Chevron, 58% at Conoco and 80% at Phillips 66, according to company filings.
Follow This now proposes that companies set goals consistent with the 2015 Paris accord, an agreement to reduce emissions in half by 2030.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - State-run Brazilian oil company Petrobras is close to reaching an agreement to sell to U.S. private equity firm EIG Energy Partners control of a natural gas pipeline that connects Bolivia and southern Brazil, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, is expected to receive more than $500 million for the 51% stake in TBG, added one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations. The bid could reach up to $1 billion depending on details of the talks.
Under negotiation is Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil (TBG), which operates the Brazilian section of the pipeline, called Gasbol.
The roughly 2,600 km (1,600 mile) pipeline system is the main transportation network for natural gas in the south of Brazil. It generated more than 900 million reais ($180 million) of operating profit for its owners in the first nine months of last year.
Gasbol can transport up to 30 million cubic meters per day (1.1 billion cubic feet per day) of natural gas from Bolivia to consumer markets in Brazil. 
Petrobras declined to comment on the talks. EIG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last year, EIG sold a 27.5% stake in TBG to Fluxys Belgium NV for an undisclosed amount in order to remove a regulatory conflict that could have prevented it from bidding for control of the asset.
TBG will be the third gas pipeline company privatized in recent years in Brazil.
In 2016, Petrobras sold Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS), which runs through southeastern states, for $5.2 billion to a consortium led by Canada's Brookfield Asset Management and Brazil's Itausa SA .

HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chevron Corp. is preparing to take operating control of its joint ventures in Venezuela if Washington relaxes sanctions on Caracas to boost crude supplies after banning Russia's oil imports, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The U.S. oil major has begun assembling a trading team to market oil from Venezuela, two of the people said. If U.S. approvals are received,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) aims to expand its role in the four joint ventures it shares with state-run company PDVSA, they added. 
Chevron has asked the U.S. government for a license broad enough to have a greater say at its joint ventures in Venezuela, a first step to recovering crude output and exports, and to control where oil is sent, the three people said. Since 2020, Chevron has delegated most decision making to state-run PDVSA.
U.S. officials have made clear, however, that any new authorization will depend on whether Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro takes further political steps, two sources said, such as releasing more jailed Americans and setting a firm date for resuming negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition.
Chevron's proposed moves could revitalize Venezuela's oil output and exports after years of underinvestment and sanctions shrank it to about 755,000 barrels per day (bpd) last month from 2.3 million bpd in 2016. Chevron's joint ventures with PDVSA had produced about 200,000 bpd before U.S. sanctions and lack of financing cut their output. 
LOGISTICS TEAM 
A date has not been set for issuing the authorization. But Chevron has begun preparations for employees to get Venezuelan visas in Aruba, ready to head to Caracas if the U.S. Treasury eases restrictions, the people said. 
Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, adding to an array of sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow has called a ""special military operation."" 
Chevron aims to begin moving Venezuelan oil to refineries as soon as next month. Last week's U.S. ban on Russian imports allows oil under existing contracts to arrive in the country through April 22. 
""Since Venezuelan barrels were banned in the United States in 2019, and Colombia and Mexico reduced key exports to the United States, Russian barrels have been feeding the Gulf refiners"", said one person involved in the talks. 
Chevron had vastly reduced its presence in Venezuela after Washington tightened sanctions on Venezuela in 2020. For years, Chevron and other PDVSA venture partners have requested more operating oversight. 
The United States is drafting a new license that would allow Chevron to assume a more active role in Venezuela, a person familiar with the matter said. Washington is considering similar oil-for-debt authorizations for Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and Italy's Eni SpA. They collectively are owed billions of dollars by their Venezuela joint ventures.
Chevron declined to comment, but reiterated in a statement its operations in Venezuela comply with U.S. sanctions and remain ""a constructive presence in Venezuela."" 
PDVSA and Venezuela's oil ministry did not reply to requests for comment.
A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. government ""does not preview sanctions actions"" but added: ""We have made clear that we would review some sanctions policies if the Venezuelan parties made meaningful progress in the Venezuelan-led negotiations in Mexico toward a democratic solution.""
The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
POLITICAL TALKS 
This month, Washington quietly restarted diplomatic engagement with Venezuela, a close ally of Russia. Last week, Maduro released two jailed Americans, and Washington has insisted others also be freed. Maduro has expressed a willingness to resume a dialogue with the opposition after he suspended talks in Mexico in October. U.S. officials want a firm commitment to discussing free elections.
On Sunday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC any sanctions relief for Venezuela must be tied to ""concrete steps"" by Maduro.
The Biden administration had not previously made Venezuela a foreign policy priority. That changed when Middle East and U.S. shale producers would not boost their crude supplies when the White House asked them to do so after the Ukraine invasion.
Congressional Republicans and even some of Biden's fellow Democrats such as U.S. Senator Bob Menendez have opposed any deal that would benefit the socialist president. Washington condemned Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham.
The United States imported 670,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and fuel last year. One of the few countries in a position to replace those imports is Venezuela. Before sanctions, its oil went mainly to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. 
TIMELY APPROVAL 
Chevron-marketed barrels could help PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF),  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) fill their supply gap, the source said. All have operations geared to run heavy oils. 
Chevron has held parallel talks with PDVSA to expand its joint ventures' governance. Any agreements likely would be temporary unless Venezuela enacts deep reforms of its oil legislation, which require PDVSA to be the majority stakeholder in any joint venture. 

While PDVSA President Asdrubal Chavez supports an expanded operating role for Chevron, some Venezuelan top officials resist the change, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Venezuela holds about 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, the world's largest, but has not been able to hit its production targets due to underinvestment, poor maintenance, lack of supplies and U.S. sanctions.

Saudi Arabia is reviewing Foxconn's offer to build a dual-line semiconductor contract manufacturing facility known as a ""foundry"" in Neom, a tech-focused city-state it is developing in the desert, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The company and Saudi Arabia authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, has expanded into areas including electric vehicles (EVs) and semiconductors in recent years.
The company and other Taiwanese firms like TSMC are looking to diversify their production amid U.S.-China trade tensions, which have impacted the semiconductor industry.
Besides Saudi Arabia, Foxconn is also talking with the United Arab Emirates about potentially situating the project there, the report said.

Riyadh wants the company to guarantee that it would direct at least two-thirds of the foundry's production into Foxconn's existing supply chain, according to the report.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has been signing large investment deals, including plans in Taiwan and India. Last year, however, it drastically scaled back a planned $10 billion factory in Wisconsin that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world"".

TORONTO (Reuters) - As Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupts the global economy and drives up oil, gold and industrial metal prices, investors are embracing Canada's commodity-linked stock market to protect their portfolios from the impact of supply shortages and soaring inflation.
Financial markets globally have been rattled in recent months by rising inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic, with matters made worse by the spike in commodity prices after sanctions against Russia, the world's top wheat exporter and second-biggest oil exporter.
Canada offers a hedge of sorts. It produces many of the energy, metal and agricultural products in short supply, while its main stock index, the S&P/TSX Composite, has a 27% weighting in energy and materials, indicating that the earnings of a large chunk of the market are directly tied to rising commodity prices.
Inflation-linked bonds are a more conventional hedge for investors fearing price spikes, but some prefer to maintain exposure to equity markets.
""The TSX is a preferential allocation within global equities, given the relatively cheap valuation still and the more muted macro economic impact of the war on the Canadian economy,"" said Kurt Reiman, senior investment strategist for North America at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
The Toronto market is one of the few major indexes globally that is in positive territory since the start of the year, having advanced 0.5%, compared to a decline of 11.3% for the S&P 500 index, the U.S. equities benchmark.
At 14.6, the 12-month forward price-earnings multiple for the TSX is slightly below its average for the last 10 years, data from Refinitiv Datastream shows, and well below the S&P 500's multiple of about 18.5.
The Toronto market's large concentration of resource shares ""provides a good hedge for global investors against the possibility of a prolonged commodity supply-shock,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri.
Foreign investors have taken notice, plowing a net C$46 billion ($36 billion) into Canadian equities last year, the most since 2016, according to data from Statistics Canada.
Among the companies that investors favor are copper miner Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) Inc, which trades at a forward price-to-book ratio of 1.24 versus the industry average of 1.61, Refinitiv data shows.
Its valuation should play catch-up as the company has ""laid the groundwork"" for growth, said Michael Sprung, president at Sprung Investment Management.
Paul Gardner, a portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, says the gold sector is ""generally cheap"" relative to the price of bullion. He sees Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) Mines Ltd as a long-term buy and expects Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources, the country's biggest oil producer, to benefit from the rally in oil prices.
EYE ON DIVIDENDS
But it's not just resource shares that help differentiate the Toronto market. It's also the market's heavy weighting, at 31%, in financials.
""An inflationary environment generally coincides with rising interest rates, which benefit banks and insurers,"" said Elvis Picardo, portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.
Earlier this month, the Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate for the first time in three years and made clear that further hikes are on the way. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a lift-off in U.S. rates on Wednesday.
Adding to the attraction of financial and energy shares in the current environment are high dividend payouts compared to some other sectors such as technology.

""When there are concerns about global growth, the dividend starts to become more important,"" BlackRock's Reiman said. ""You tend to see Canadian stocks delivering because of that sector exposure.""

Moderna shares rose 17% after the announcement.
Moderna explained in a press release that the open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of experimental HIV trimer mRNA vaccines.
The company's idea is that the trimer mRNA vaccines will be safe and well-tolerated by HIV-uninfected individuals and will produce neutralizing antibodies.
The trial, sponsored and funded by the Division of AIDS of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the National Institutes of Health, will enroll approximately 100 HIV-negative adults aged 18 to 55 years.
""Developing a vaccine regimen that induces sustained protective levels of HIV neutralizing antibodies in humans has been difficult to achieve. At Moderna, we believe that mRNA offers an opportunity to take a fresh approach to this challenge,"" said Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna.

Global companies have decided to step back from Russia as pressure mounts from consumers in the West to take a stand against its invasion of Ukraine.
""Ending delivery of medicines, including cancer or cardiovascular therapies, would cause significant patient suffering and potential loss of life, particularly among children and elderly people,"" Pfizer said. 
The drugmaker, however, will not start new clinical trials or recruit patients for ongoing studies in the country. It would also cease all planned investments towards manufacturing in Russia. 
The invasion has left drugmakers scrambling to get enrollments in clinical trials in Ukraine as millions seek shelter from bombardment and flee to neighboring countries.
Germany's Bayer said on Monday it stopped all spending in Russia and its ally Belarus, which is not related to essential products in health and agriculture, in response to Moscow's actions which Russia describes as a ""special operation"". 
Russia accounts for about 2% of the German group's sales. 
Bayer said on Monday it had already provided essential agricultural inputs to farmers in Russia for the 2022 growing season ""to alleviate additional pressure on the global food system"". 
It would, however, decide over supplies for 2023 depending on Russia stopping its attacks on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Pfizer said it would work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators to transition all clinical trials to alternative sites outside Russia. 

It will continue providing drugs to patients already enrolled in studies. 
Western drugmakers and medical-device companies have warned their plans to keep selling their products to Russia might become complicated due to the sanctions imposed on the country, even though they do not apply to such products.

Instagram access in Russia was cut from Monday in response to Meta's decision last week to allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"". Facebook was already banned over what Moscow said were restrictions on access to Russian media there.
On the eve of the Instagram ban, demand for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that encrypt data and obscure where a user is located spiked 2,088% higher than the daily average demand in mid-February, data from monitoring firm Top10VPN showed.
Russia has been targeted by unprecedented western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine and is battling to control the flow of information, stifling foreign social media firms with traffic slowdowns and, in the case of Facebook and Instagram, outright bans. 
Demand for VPNs had already been on the rise in the region as Russian and Ukrainian websites fell victim to cyber attacks.
Russia banned several VPNs last year, but has failed to block them entirely, as part of a wider campaign critics say stifles internet freedom. 
Top10VPN's data analysis of more than 6,000 entries to Russia's central registry of blocked websites found that 203 news sites and 97 foreign exchange and crypto sites are currently blocked in Russia. 

State communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Monday said the number of cyber attacks against the IT systems and infrastructure of the Russian government had sharply increased since Feb. 24.

Oil prices fell over $9 a barrel today as investors pinned hopes on talks between Ukraine and Russia ending their conflict, while a surge in Covid-19 cases in China spooked the markets.
U.S. crude fell more than $9 to go below $100 a barrel today. The last time it was below that level was on March 1. It later traded at $101.60, down 7%.  
Brent was down by 6.7% at $105 a barrel at 1155 ET amid efforts by Western powers to persuade Saudi Arabia to increase its output.
The stocks were downgraded to equal-weight from overweight at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Analyst Devin McDermott sees Occidental at $52, $3 below its current price at 1155 ET.

The bank is also dropping the mask mandate in it offices for all employees, making wearing masks voluntary for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, according to the memo.
Mandatory testing for unvaccinated staffers, asking employees to report COVID-19 infection and associated contact tracing and notifications will be discontinued on April 4, the memo said.
""We are learning to live with COVID as part of our new normal,"" the bank said in the memo, as cases decline and vaccines continue to offer high levels of immunity.

The shift highlights a growing inclination among corporations and government officials to seek a return to normalcy. The bank, however, said that masking mandates might return if there was another spike in cases.
Employees in New York City must continue to meet vaccination requirements unless the city lifted the order, the memo said, adding the Wall Street giant would also continue to offer complimentary home testing kits.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of five House Democratic lawmakers on Monday asked a federal watchdog to review if the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) complied with environmental regulations in its next-generation delivery vehicle contract.
House Oversight and Reform Committee chair Carolyn Maloney and other lawmakers asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General to review USPS's plan to buy a new multibillion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) that has come under fire from the White House and Environmental Protection Agency.
""Given the potential environmental impact of the (delivery vehicle) contract, it is crucial that the Postal Service conduct a robust environmental analysis prior to moving forward,"" said the letter also signed by Representatives Gerald Connolly, Jared Huffman, Stephen Lynch and Brenda Lawrence. 
USPS on Monday said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""
The lawmakers asked why USPS assumed ""an upfront vehicle cost for an electric (delivery vehicle) that is substantially higher than other electric delivery vehicles being sold to private companies.""
Last month, the White House and EPA urged USPS to reconsider its plan. The EPA asked USPS to hold a new hearing on its 10-year contract with Oshkosh initially worth $482 million that could be worth $6 billion or more to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
In response, USPS said it had completed its environmental obligations and declined to hold a new hearing.

USPS's current plan calls for it to acquire at least 10% of EVs for the new fleet but could boost that with additional funding from Congress.
The EPA last month said USPS's proposed new gas-powered vehicles ""are expected to achieve only 8.6 miles per gallon (mpg), barely improving over the decades-old long-life vehicles that achieve 8.2 mpg.""

ELMS in a regulatory filing after hours on Friday said the SEC was investigating matters discussed in prior filings including disagreements with an accounting firm and compliance with the Nasdaq's listing rules.
The company went public in June 2021 through a merger with blank-check firm Forum Merger III Corp.
ELMS and the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
EV startup Lucid Group, which too went public through merger with a special purpose acquisition company, disclosed in December that it had received a subpoena from the regulator related to an investigation into its blank-check deal.
ELMS also said on Monday that it expects to make its Urban Delivery electric van not before the end of 2022, adding that it would not be able to launch its vehicles without securing additional liquidity.
The company said it has sufficient cash to continue operations through between July and September 2022.

FRANKFURT/LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said on Monday they were cutting back on Russian business as European financial institutions turn their backs on Russia.
The German insurer and Swiss reinsurer join banks Deutsche, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) which have exited Russia following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western government sanctions.
The moves will pile pressure on others to follow.
Allianz said it had put a stop to insuring new business in Russia and was no longer investing in Russia for its own portfolio.
Swiss Re said it was not taking on new business with Russian and Belarusian clients and was not renewing existing business with Russian clients. In a statement sent via email, Swiss Re said it was reviewing its current business relationships in Russia and Belarus.
The decisions follow similar action by other major European insurers and reinsurers, which provide cover for large projects such as energy installations.
Insurer Zurich no longer takes on new domestic customers in Russia and will not renew existing local business, a spokesperson told Reuters on Monday.
Hannover Re said last week that new business and renewals for customers in Russia and Belarus were on hold, while Italian insurer Generali (MI:GASI) said earlier this month it would pull out of Russia.
Insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) also said on Sunday it would withdraw from Russia, following similar moves by rivals Marsh and Aon (NYSE:AON). 
Asset managers have said they will not make new investments in Russia and many Russian-focused funds have frozen because they are unable to trade following the sanctions and counter-measures taken by Russia.
The European Union's markets watchdog ESMA said on Monday it was coordinating the bloc's regulatory response to the Ukraine conflict to ensure markets continued to function in an orderly manner. 
Britain's pensions regulator said the sector had little direct exposure to Russia, but that there were practical difficulties in selling Russian assets.
Ukraine said on Monday it had begun ""hard"" talks with Russia on a ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees after both sides reported rare progress in negotiations at the weekend, despite Russian bombardments.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". 
WINDING DOWN
Deutsche, which had faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, announced late on Friday that it would wind down its business there.
It was a surprise reversal by the Frankfurt-based lender, which had previously argued that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
Britain's  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) also said late on Friday it was suspending all products and services for all customers in Russia, days after suspending the distribution of news and commentary in the country following new laws in Moscow.
Index provider FTSE Russell said on Monday it would delete four UK-listed, Russia-focused companies including Roman Abramovich's Evraz after many brokers refused to trade their shares.
Evraz, along with Polymetal International, Petropavlovsk and Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Property Group, would be deleted from all FTSE's indexes during the March review, it said in a statement.
FTSE Russell said it had received feedback from its External Advisory Committees and market participants that trading in the shares was ""severely restricted"" as brokers refused to handle the securities, hitting market liquidity.

JPMorgan says the majority of forecast risk for European banks from the Russia shock will come from commodity and economic spillover effects, with the sector plunging since the end of February.
European banking stocks have come off their lows in recent days, however, and rose 3.8% on Monday.

(Reuters) - Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels on Monday provided the most concrete details to date about the media company's plans to combine its Discovery+ streaming service with HBO Max once the acquisition of WarnerMedia closes.
Wiedenfels said the services would unite to create a more broadly appealing consumer product, with HBO Max's more ""male skewing"" scripted series complementing Discovery's reality shows, with their heavily female viewership.
""The acquisition power of HBO Max, combined with the retention power of the Discovery content, I think, is going to make for a blowout DTC (direct-to-consumer) product,"" Wiedenfels told the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Annual Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, using the industry's term for streaming.
The melding of the two services, following the completion of Discovery's $43 billion acquisition of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia in a deal announced in May 2021, had long been anticipated. 
Wiedenfels said the company would need to ""harmonize"" the separate technology platforms to offer a single streaming product, with more than 200,000 hours of movies and television episodes. There will be an ad-free service and a less expensive, ad-supported tier. 

The deal, on track to close in the second quarter, last month passed the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust review, clearing another key hurdle toward closing.
Discovery+ has 22 million subscribers, and HBO Max, together with its HBO television network, has 73.8 million subscribers.

""Withholding essential health and agriculture products from the civilian populations – like cancer or cardiovascular treatments, health products for pregnant women and children as well as seeds to grow food – would only multiply the war's ongoing toll on human life,"" the company said.

Same-store sales decreased around 20% from a year earlier for the first two weeks of March and was still trending down in recent days, after falling nearly 4% for the two months combined in January and February, Yum China said.
""Entering March, the situation has rapidly deteriorated with the highly transmissible Omicron variant causing outbreaks across China, including economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin,"" the company said.
The restaurant chain recorded a 1% fall in same-store sales last year, an improvement from the 9% decline in 2020. However, tight curbs on travel and dining out due to the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant have hurt sales this year.
The company projected an operating profit for the first quarter to be in a range of $165 million to $200 million, compared with $342 million a year earlier.
China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than it recorded in all of 2021, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant triggers outbreaks from Shanghai to Shenzhen.

Over 1,100 Yum China restaurants were temporarily closed or offering only takeaway and delivery services, as of Sunday. It had more than 12,000 restaurants, as of February end.
Yum China's shares, which have taken a beating in recent days due to an auditing dispute between Beijing and Washington, fell as much as 10.5% to $33.55, a three-year low.

(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc on Monday followed rival Wall Street banks by accelerating its withdrawal from Russia, saying it is no longer taking on new clients and will further cut its exposure, raising the prospect it could take substantial losses.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s decision follows rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which last week said they were unwinding their operations in Russia and not pursuing new business there. European lenders, such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), have made similar moves.
Citigroup has exposure of nearly $10 billion in Russia, the most of any U.S. bank, and had previously warned it could lose nearly half of that in the worst-case scenario.
Citigroup declined to comment Monday on the financial impact of the decision. The bank's shares rose nearly 2% in early trading, outperforming the broader market. 
The bank had already planned to exit its Russia consumer business prior to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It said last week that it was operating that business on a more limited basis while sticking with its plan to sell the franchise.
""We have now decided to expand the scope of that exit process to include other lines of business and continue to reduce our remaining operations and exposure,"" Edward Skyler, executive vice president for global affairs said Monday.
The decision means Citigroup will also be giving up its institutional and wealth management clients in Russia.
The bank will stop soliciting any new business or clients in Russia, Skyler said. It reiterated a previous commitment to ""provide assistance to multi-national corporations, many of whom are undergoing the complex task of unwinding their operations."" 
Citigroup's withdrawal will take time to execute, Skyler said, citing ""the nature of banking and financial services operations.""
Before Citi issued its statement,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo on Monday lowered his price target for the stock saying he expects Citi will have to book $1.5 billion of charges in the first quarter for expected losses on its Russian loans and business.
Mayo's new first quarter earnings estimate of $1.10 per share is down from $1.60. He had previously estimated Russia charges of only $300 million.

Wall Street analysts currently estimate, on average, that Citi will earn $1.89 in the first quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Analysts have said that losses in Russia could restrict the bank's share buyback plans.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock traded 1.7% higher Monday on prospects of securing an order from Germany for 35 F-35 fighter jets.
The stealth jets will replace the aging Tornado aircraft that Germany plans to phase out between 2025 and 2030.
The Tornado is the only German jet capable of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs, stored in Germany, in case of a conflict.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has decided to sharply increase the country’s spending on defense to more than 2% of its economic output, a decision heavily influenced by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that has forced many countries to revisit their security preparedness and up the defense spending.
Since the end of the Second World War, Germany has long refrained from getting involved in conflicts, resisting pressure to raise its defense spending in the light of its military past, and resulting in strong pacifism within its population.
Scholz’s government has decided to more than double last year’s military investment to 100 billion euros ($109 billion) in the 2022 budget.
As Germany reverses its policy, pressure on governments in other European nations could mount too, considering the heightened geopolitical risks in the region and the lack of unity among countries on critical security issues.
If the F-35 purchase happens, it will be a blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA), whose F-18 was favored by former German defense minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to replace the Tornado, according to Reuters.",,,,,

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Monday recommended that  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp investors elect two of activist investment firm Starboard Value's four director nominees to the chemical maker's 10-member board.
ISS said two Starboard director candidates should be elected to better oversee management after the board for several years failed to hold management accountable for operational stagnation, which translated into a lagging stock price.
James Gallogly, a former CEO of  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB), would bolster the board's independence and Jeffrey Smith, Starboard's managing member, would add the perspective of an independent shareholder, the report said.
ISS acknowledged that Huntsman has made a series of changes, including adding new board members and that its share price has improved dramatically. But ISS wrote that some of these changes were made only after Starboard began pressing for changes.
Investors will vote on March 25.
A Huntsman representative was not immediately available for comment on the ISS report.
""Adding Gallogly and Smith is the least-invasive way to address concerns with management accountability and ensure that the interests of shareholders are prioritized,"" the report said.
Starboard, which owns a 8.6% stake in Huntsman, has argued that the company failed to deliver on its promises and that it would disappoint shareholders again unless its nominees were elected.
Huntsman last year promised to improve margins, return $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, not to spend more than $500 million on a single acquisition and to run a sales process for the non-core Textile Effects unit.
The ISS report came one day after a smaller advisory firm, Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders re-elect all of Huntsman's nominees, arguing that the company is now on the right track and that Glass Lewis analysts do not see the need for more changes after the company already refreshed the board earlier this year.

Starboard wants to replace Cynthia Egan, the lead independent director, and Jose Munoz, who joined the board this year. It also is also targeting Mary Beckerle and Daniele Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), two directors Starboard says have conflicts.
ISS wrote that Beckerle is an accomplished cancer researcher but that there are concerns about her independence from Peter Huntsman, the founder's son who is now CEO and chairman. ISS said Jose Munoz is ""unproven as a director.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday as hopes for a diplomatic settlement to the war in Ukraine evaporated amid signs that Russia is pursuing its goals with increased ferocity, while lockdowns in China revived fears of supply chain disruptions throughout the world.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 155 points, or 0.5% at 33,099 points,. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% but the Nasdaq Composite was essentially flat from Friday's close, trading markedly weaker than index futures had done in the overnight session. All three indices had lost ground last week amid fears that the war may generate both an economic slowdown and sustained higher inflation.
The market is likely to hold off big moves this week until the Federal Reserve's policy meeting concludes on Wednesday. That's taking place against the backdrop of inflation running at its highest in 40 years, and the central bank's assessment of the interplay between growth and inflation in a wartime scenario is likely to be the cardinal factor driving markets for the rest of the week.
In the absence of big domestic corporate news over the weekend, and with the data and earnings calendars relatively empty, early attention was focused on Chinese ADRs, which were under pressure on a number of fronts. First, the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen and the region of Jilin in northeastern China have both announced week-long lockdowns to try to break the surge in COVID-19 cases. The developments appear to validate fears that the Omicron strain - which is largely impervious to the vaccines that have been most widely deployed in China - could force the authorities into heavy-handed measures that will put fresh strain on global supply chains. Among the companies to confirm the closure of their plants on Monday were Foxconn (TW:2354), which manufactures the iPhone for Apple, and Volkswagen.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia shares rose on Monday after Italy's biggest phone group said it would pursue a domestic broadband deal, while also engaging in talks with KKR over the U.S. fund's 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) takeover approach.
After a near six-hour board meeting on Sunday where directors strove to reconcile diverging views on the path to take, TIM said it had asked its CEO and chairman to engage in talks with KKR to find out more about its potential bid.
At the same time, the board renewed its support for a plan which new CEO Pietro Labriola presented in early March and said TIM would continue to explore a tie-up with state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber.
Tim's shares rose as much as 10% to 0.30 euros, after hitting an all-time low of 0.22 euros last week as investors unwound bets on KKR's 0.505 euros per share offer ever materialising.
KKR, which has been waiting almost four months for a response to its preliminary approach, declined to comment.
TIM's largest shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has slammed the offer as too low and the group on Sunday said there was ""untapped value"" in TIM to be considered when weighing alternatives to Labriola's plan.
The long-mooted Open Fiber merger could provide a 1 euro boost to TIM's shares according to internal calculations, sources familiar with the matter have said.
LABRIOLA'S PLAN
Labriola, who got the top job in January with Vivendi's backing, has said his plan is similar to KKR's project. By executing it in-house, TIM would benefit from the gains the private equity firm targets in its turnaround efforts, he said.
Labriola's plan entails separating TIM's services arm from its infrastructure assets, a move that would ease a combination of TIM's network with that of Open Fiber, creating a single wholesale-only broadband provider.
To this end, TIM said it would continue discussions with CDP, Italy's state investor which controls Open Fiber but is also TIM's second-biggest shareholder.
""The KKR potential offer remains the lower probability outcome here,"" Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) analysts said.
""The company are making sure they follow the correct procedures to ensure that they cannot be accused in the future of neglecting shareholders in the future.""
Minority investors in TIM had complained about the company snubbing KKR's offer altogether, and independent directors had also expressed concerns.
Sources have said TIM could seek to reach a compromise with KKR whereby the fund plays a role in the asset revamp without seeking to take control of the group. KKR has already invested 1.8 billion euros in TIM's last-mile network for a 37.5% stake.
TIM had hoped to secure a preliminary agreement with CDP over Open Fiber in time for Sunday's board meeting but discussions over a tie-up that raises competition issues at the European level will require longer, sources have said.
""Management have shifted message ... and are now pushing the Open Fiber merger angle once again,"" Exane BNP Paribas said.

""In the short term the hope of 'something' happening is probably enough to continue to draw a line under the shares.""

The new target is 14% lower than the previous one of $115.
“Our downgrade does not reflect a change in our long-term view of Tyson’s ability to affect internal change through its actions, operational improvements, or capacity expansions, but rather our disciplined approach and a potential reduction to underlying fundamentals outside chicken, particularly beef,” BMO analyst Kenneth Zaslow said in a note.

He previously served in various management positions at German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:MBGn) for nearly three decades and was responsible for setting up the Mercedes-Benz plant in Kecskemét, Hungary.
Klein will be based in Normal, Illinois, where Rivian currently produces its vehicles. The company last year said it would locate its second U.S-based manufacturing facility in Georgia. Production at the Georgia plant is slated for 2024.

Earlier this month, Prada said it had suspended its retail operations in Russia, following a slew of other leading brands, after the European Union and many countries imposed strict economic sanctions on Russia in a response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia accounted for around 2% of Prada's total sales in 2021, it said on Monday. 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2021 jumped to 489 million euros ($535.85 million) from 20 million euros a year earlier and well above the 307 million posted in 2019, before the COVID outbreak. 
Analysts expected a 429 million euro operating profit, according to a Refinitiv consensus.
""Prada Group's start to 2022 has been strong. Our long-term strategy is on track,"" CEO Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement adding he was confident to meet medium-term targets, ""even though it is difficult to predict the impact of the Ukraine conflict on the global economy"". 
The Milan-based, Hong Kong-listed group said it would propose a dividend of 7 euro cents per share, with a payout ratio of 61%. 
The fashion house in January said that sales last year bounced above pre-pandemic levels to 3.36 billion euros. 
In November the group posted a medium-term revenue goal of 4.5 billion euros and said it targeted an operating profit of 20% of total sales in the medium term. 
Last year, operating profit was 14.5% of total sales, up from 9.5% in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. 
Prada, known for its minimalist designs, was in the middle of a shift upmarket and online to revive sales when the coronavirus crisis hit, forcing retailers to shut stores around the globe and depriving them of tourist spending.

But like other luxury groups, the family-owned company has emerged strongly from the pandemic thanks to a desire among cooped-up consumers to pamper themselves with high-end purchases.

“We must remember how much money has already been lost by investors who had substantial amounts of stocks in Russia and then those who lost money on the Chinese stocks impacted by the Chinese government crackdown,” Mobius wrote in an emailed response to questions.
His comments come as China’s close ties with Russia are emerging as another risk for investors in the Asian nation’s stocks, which have already been battered by Beijing’s regulatory crackdown. Panic selling gripped the market on Monday, with a gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares tumbling the most since 2008. The rout followed a report that cited U.S. officials as saying that Russia has asked China for military assistance for its war in Ukraine.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rejected the reports of the Russian request as “disinformation” and “malicious.”
Tech stocks were once again at the forefront of the losses in Hong Kong on Monday, with the Hang Seng Tech Index sinking a record 11%. That’s after the Golden Dragon Index, which tracks American depository receipts of Chinese firms, plunged 10% for two consecutive days last week -- a first in its 22-year history.

Musk in a tweet on Sunday also asked about inflation rate outlook and said his companies ""are not alone"", retweeting an article saying the Ukraine-Russia conflict sent commodity prices to their highest levels since 2008.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a surge in prices of metals used in cars - from aluminum in the bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters to the high-grade nickel in electric vehicle batteries - and customers are likely to foot the bill.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX were not available for additional comments. 
Soaring raw material prices has raised concerns about EV economics, as legacy automakers and startups prepare to launch new cars this year after overcoming problems related to chip shortages.
Additionally, geopolitical challenges arising from Ukraine's invasion have affected factory operations in the United States and made it difficult for raw material suppliers to quote prices.
""Just as hopes the semi-conductor shortage was easing... the invasion has thrown up fresh disruptions to the supply of essential materials and a worrying surge in prices,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said.

Investing.com – Turquoise Hill (NYSE:TRQ) stock surged 30% in premarket Monday after Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) offered to buy the 49% stake it doesn’t already own in the company.
At C$34 in cash offer (around $26.5), Turquoise Hill is valued at about C$6.84 billion.
No agreement has been reached between the parties, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions, Rio Tinto said.
The company’s purchase is expected to breathe life into its much delayed Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia. The proposed transaction follows the recent agreement reached amongst the companies and the Mongolian government to move the project forward.
Rio had in December agreed to write off a $2.3 billion loan to the Mongolian government as part of its plans to accelerate work on the project. The Mongolian government owns 34% of the project company, with the rest held by Turquoise Hill. The financing agreement for the mine was signed in 2015 but the project has been mired in controversy since its inception. Mongolian politicians have often called for the original investment agreement to be renegotiated.
Oyu Tolgoi is one of the largest deposits of copper in the world. Its proximity to the Chinese market, which accounts for over half of global copper consumption, gives the project a particular appeal, given China's status as the world's largest electric vehicle market.
EVs routinely require three to four times more copper than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.
According to a Reuters report, Mongolian Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai has committed to completing the expanded underground section of the mine by 2023."

PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) is bolstering its high-end eyewear division with a deal to buy U.S.-based label Maui Jim, the French luxury group said Monday. 
European luxury companies have shown growing interest in the eyewear business and have tightened their grip on production capacity amid strong demand for luxury products.
Kering, which bought upscale Danish label Lindberg in July last year, expects the Maui Jim deal to be closed in the second half of 2022.
""This has been a sought-after brand for years and it's a significant achievement for (Kering) to add this to its growing portfolio, making it now, by some distance, the (No.) 1 high-end player globally in the space,"" Jefferies said in a research note.
Kering said the purchase of the Hawaiian eyewear label, known for high-end sunglasses, would push the group's annual eyewear revenues above 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and improve its profitability.
The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said the purchase price likely came to around 1.5 billion euros, estimating Maui Jim’s annual sales at around 300 million euros with operating profit of around 20% in 2021. 
The analysts peg the profitability of Kering’s eyewear division at between 13% and 15%.
Kering began building an in-house eyewear division in 2014, and wholesale revenues exceeded 700 million euros in 2021.
It makes glasses for its own labels including Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Gucci, as well as Richemont brands Cartier, Dunhill and Chloe, among others. 
The group intends to expand Maui Jim’s presence in Europe and Asia, including through the travel retail channel, and use its lens technology to develop corrective sunglasses for fashion labels, Kering Eyewear's president and chief executive Roberto Vedovotto said in a call with reporters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T’s financial relationship with One America News is deeper than previously known and will continue even after DirecTV drops the far-right network from its satellite service next month, a new court filing shows.
The court filing, made as part of a lawsuit OAN filed against AT&T (NYSE:T) and DirecTV last week, reveals an exclusive contract for an AT&T subsidiary to sell commercials for OAN.
AT&T owns 70% of DirecTV, which announced in January it would drop OAN, a network known for promoting false 2020 election reports. The move came three months after Reuters revealed that AT&T played a pivotal role in creating OAN and has paid tens of millions of dollars to carry the network on DirecTV.
To read the Reuters Special Report, click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att
OAN’s lawsuit, which seeks $1 billion in damages, alleges that the removal of the network from the satellite service was politically inspired and “could be devastating” financially. Court records show that about 90% of OAN’s revenue is generated from its AT&T/DirecTV deals.
Robert Herring Sr, founder and CEO of San Diego-based Herring Networks, which owns OAN, did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed March 7 by Herring Networks on behalf of OAN in state court in San Diego.
DirecTV and AT&T did not respond to specific queries from Reuters about the advertising pact, but issued statements about OAN’s lawsuit.
“These allegations are completely without merit,” AT&T said. The telecommunications giant denied OAN’s claim that the political beliefs of executives influenced the decision to drop the network. DirecTV called the lawsuit “baseless” and said it was “confident that we have fully complied both with the law and our agreement.”
After the Reuters report ran last year, AT&T issued a statement that said it “has never had a financial interest in OAN’s success.”
But the new lawsuit alleges that in addition to helping to create and distribute OAN, AT&T entered into the advertising deal with the network in 2019.
Under that deal, an AT&T subsidiary called Xandr is OAN’s sole advertising vendor and earns a commission on commercials aired by the network, the lawsuit alleges. A pending sale of Xandr to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will not include the portion of the company that sells commercials for DirecTV or OAN.
After DirecTV drops OAN, said a person familiar with the contract, the AT&T subsidiary will continue to serve as the advertising representative for OAN on other platforms, such as regional cable companies and cable and internet provider Verizon (NYSE:VZ) FIOS.
The pact to sell commercials is separate from the deal to air OAN on DirecTV, and does not expire until 2024.
In the lawsuit, Herring alleged that AT&T’s decision to drop OAN from DirecTV is “part and parcel of a larger, coordinated, extremely well-financed political scheme to take down Herring and unlawfully destroy its ability to operate in the media business.”
The business relationship between OAN and AT&T has become fodder for political activists on all sides.
Following the Reuters report about AT&T’s role in OAN’s creation, the NAACP and left-wing groups called for DirecTV to stop airing OAN. After DirecTV announced in January it would drop OAN, former President Donald Trump honored Herring at a rally and asked supporters who use DirecTV to cancel their subscriptions.
“It is a very popular channel, far more popular than most would understand, and they are being treated horribly by the Radical Left lunatics,” Trump said in a February statement.
In the lawsuit, Herring said OAN ranks in the top 10% of DirecTV programming, ahead of CNBC, Newsmax and CNN Headline News. Reuters could not independently verify this claim, and TV ratings services do not release OAN figures.
Herring, who amassed a fortune as a tech entrepreneur, launched OAN in 2013. His family-owned Herring Networks also owns a lifestyle and entertainment channel called AWE.
In the lawsuit, Herring said AT&T has earned “generous commissions via selling advertising on AWE and OAN.” The advertising deal called for AT&T to sell both traditional commercials, which every viewer sees, and targeted ads, which are tailored “to the individual viewer based on data known about the viewer.” The court filings don’t say how much revenue AT&T has garnered from the ad deal.
OAN alleged that after AT&T signed the advertising contract in 2019, the network “reasonably expected” this was “proof of a commitment” for a long term DirecTV deal, at least until 2024, when the ad contract expires. DirecTV’s decision to drop OAN, the lawsuit said, “stunned” Herring and damaged its reputation.

“AT&T and DirecTV signaled to the public that something was wrong, hurting OAN’s business and standing in the news media business,” the lawsuit said.
This is not the first time Herring has sued AT&T. In 2016, a Herring lawsuit alleged that AT&T reneged on an oral agreement to air OAN on DirecTV, a contention AT&T denied. About a month after that lawsuit was settled in 2017, OAN began airing on DirecTV.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator's move to identify Chinese firms likely to be delisted from New York for not meeting auditing requirements is pushing more fund managers to exit their holdings and dimming the prospect for new listings in the near term.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week identified for the first time five Chinese companies, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC), that could face delisting.
The move, amid a long-running auditing standoff between U.S. and Chinese regulators, revived fears among investors and triggered a massive sell-off in Chinese companies' American depositary receipts (ADRs).
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates that U.S. institutional investors currently hold around $200 billion of exposure to Chinese ADRs.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms.
""The whole sector is becoming uninvestable ... we simply will give up and get out of any U.S.-listed Chinese companies for now,"" said a portfolio manager with a major New York-based hedge fund. 
The fund started offloading Chinese ADRs since late 2019, and plans to sell off any remaining holdings in the coming weeks, said the portfolio manager, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, fell more than 10% for two consecutive days since last Thursday, extending its losses since the start of the year to 34%. The index shed 43% in 2021.
Those with less exposure to U.S.-listed Chinese firms are weighing other options to stay invested in China.
""We have minimal long exposure to ADRs and have been net short ADRs,"" said Ken Xu, chief investment officer of Strategic Vision Investment, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund with more than $1 billion in assets under management.
Xu expects more headwinds for ADRS and has gone long instead on China's onshore shares, seeing significantly higher growth potential in some segments backed by policy support.
The renewed concerns about Chinese companies listed in the United States also comes at a time when appetite for risky assets has been dampened by rising geopolitical risks and a subdued growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy.
China-focused asset manager Krane Funds Advisors said its $4.9 billion KraneShare CSI China Internet ETF aims to convert all Chinese ADRs in its portfolio into their Hong Kong shares in the coming months.
KraneShares, however, said on Friday it expects that a compromise between U.S. and Chinese regulators on the auditing issue was ""still attainable"".
China's securities regulator also gave investors a measure of assurance on Friday saying it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the auditing dispute.
The regulatory uncertainty may further deter new listings of Chinese companies in New York, bankers say, with the outlook on fundraising clouded by uncertainties about the auditing requirements as well as China's new rules on offshore listings.

Yingjie Weng, New York-based managing director of Special Purpose Acquisition Company investment banking at Chardan, told Reuters the outlook for future listings of Chinese companies in the United States remains uncertain. 
Companies that adopt a complicated offshore holding structure, widely used to circumvent foreign investment restrictions, are unlikely to win SEC approval, she added.

Annual inspections by the Reserve Bank of India found that the company’s servers were sharing information with China-based entities that indirectly own a stake in Paytm Payments Bank, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. Paytm Payments Bank is a joint venture between Paytm and its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and its affiliate, Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., own shares of Paytm, according to exchange filings.
An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered. Paytm didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. 
In a statement late Friday, the RBI had cited “material supervisory concerns” for its action, without elaborating. Shares of Paytm, formally known as One 97 Communications Ltd., tumbled as much as 14.7% Monday.
While the RBI had similarly punished companies including  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Banking Corp. and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). for flouting data-storage rules, the concerns around Paytm Payments Bank are particularly sensitive given India’s hostile political relationship with China. 
India has banned hundreds of apps linked to or originating from China over the past two years following a bloody clash at the nations’ disputed border. Paytm Payments Bank, being a regulated financial institution, was required to maintain a so-called service level agreement with its technology vendor that would ringfence the entity from its owners, the person said. 
Paytm Payments Bank had also onboarded thousands of clients without adequate know-your-customer documentation and the concern was that some of these could have been mules for money laundering, the person added. 
The regulator now wants Paytm Payments Bank to appoint a technology auditor in consultation with the RBI, the person said. The company is taking steps to comply with the RBI’s directive, including the appointment of an external auditor, the company said in a statement on Saturday. Existing customers will be unaffected.
The punishment will make it tough for Paytm Payments Bank to be upgraded to a small finance bank, limiting its ability to attract large deposits, according to Macquarie Capital analyst Suresh Ganapathy. ICICI Securities Ltd. cut its price target on Paytm to to 1,285 rupees from 1,352 rupees. The stock was trading at 680 rupees as of 3 p.m. in Mumbai Monday. 
Paytm Payments Bank has over 300 million wallets and 60 million bank accounts, according to its website. The bank said it has over 100 million KYC-compliant customers and has been adding 0.4 million users every month.

(Reuters) -Sanofi's shares slid 5% on Monday after a drug candidate to fight a common type of breast cancer failed to slow progression of the disease in a clinical trial, knocking confidence in the French drugmaker's drug development prowess.
Results from the Phase II AMEERA-3 clinical trial, keenly awaited by  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) investors, showed the drug amcenestrant, given as a pill, did not have the desired effect when compared to standard endocrine treatment against locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, Sanofi said in a statement.
The stock's decline was the biggest on the French bluechip index CAC40 index, which was up 1.8 % at 0920 GMT.
Sanofi said it would continue with two further trials, AMEERA-5 and AMEERA-6, trying to show amcenestrant could help much larger patient groups of women in early stages of cancer.
JP Morgan analysts said Monday's read-out bode ill for those follow-up trials, saying in a note that the ""data will increase the risk in investors' minds"".
The setback puts more pressure on Sanofi to revive its drug development success rate, after it fell far behind in the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines. 
""Today’s negative result is likely to dent sentiment around Sanofi’s pipeline,"" the JP Morgan analysts added.
Amcenestrant belongs to a drug class known as selective oestrogen receptor degraders (SERD) to fight tumours that grow in response to oestrogen, which are estimated to account for up to 80% of all breast cancer cases.
It has the same mode of action as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s injectable Faslodex, also known as fulvestrant, and a range of generic copy products on the market, but a pill would be a more convenient option for patients than painful monthly shots.
The market opportunity for oral SERDs has attracted a range of drugmakers, with Roche, AstraZeneca and Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) Inc in partnership with Italy’s Menarini Group working on similar pills. 

Faslodex sales were $431 million in 2021, down 26% as cheaper copies take hold, but analysts have described a future oral SERDs market as a multi-billion dollar opportunity. 
Shares in Oral SERD contender Radius Health soared last October after it announced positive results from its late-stage study.

Goldman economists in a note on Friday trimmed their year-end target for the benchmark index to 4,700 from 4,900, which would have implied a nearly 3% rise in 2022. Goldman's target still implies a nearly 12% jump for the S&P from current levels.
The S&P 500 had climbed 27% last year and 16.3% in 2020.

Commodity and energy prices have skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, worsening inflationary pressures for businesses around the world.
Goldman also cut the S&P 500's 2022 earnings per share estimate to $221 from $226, and to $233 from $240 for 2023.

Investing.com –  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) ADRs traded 2.5% lower in premarket Monday after an experimental cancer medicine failed to slow the progression of a common type of breast cancer.
The patients who got the drug, rather than endocrine treatment, didn’t live longer without the disease progressing, according to Sanofi.
The oral pill amcenestrant was one of six “potentially transformative” products Sanofi has touted and prioritized and was seen as the French drugmaker’s next blockbuster.
Hopes were also high from the drug, given most of the alternatives in the market are painful injections.
The disappointing result doesn’t mean it’s the end of the road for amcenestrant, but it increases the risk of failure for the other trials, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.
In the Phase II trial, the patients had advanced disease and few treatment options remaining, and the medicine wasn’t combined with another as is often the case in cancer. The company said it would press ahead with other trials.
Other trials of the drug include one called AMEERA-5, an advanced study in which it’s combined with Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) IBRANCE as a first line treatment for breast cancer that has spread.",,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Staff turnover on Wall Street is set to surge in coming weeks as investment bankers who held off job-hunting during the pandemic cash in their record bonus checks and leave for new opportunities in the red-hot labor market, said recruiters.
Bonuses are up 20% to 25% on average across Wall Street thanks to last year's deal-making frenzy, but bankers have been waiting for the checks to hit their accounts -- which typically happens each year between January and March -- to jump ship.
While bonus payouts usually trigger staff turnover, recruiters and experts say 2022 could see twice as much churn as usual due to a confluence of factors: many bankers felt it was too risky to job hop during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now burnt out after working grueling hours on last year's deal bonanza. 
The tight U.S. labor market has also created huge opportunities for bankers and pushed up salaries.
""We have been telling our clients for over a year now that they would have a 'double year' in 2022 in terms of turnover,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consultancy. 
""You're getting two years' worth of people who wanted to quit.""
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) paid bumper bonuses for 2021, with Goldman increasing top-performing bankers' incentive compensation by 40% to 50% and JPMorgan by 30% to 40%, Reuters reported. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised that figure by more than 20%. Overall, 2021 bonuses on average rose by 20%-25%, Johnson Associates estimated.
That jump was largely thanks to U.S. deal volumes nearly doubling to $2.61 trillion in 2021, according to Dealogic, as corporations rushed to raise funds and take advantage of record share prices to snap up acquisitions.
Market volatility this year, which has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has weighed on dealmaking generally and dampened CEO sentiment toward taking companies public. With chances for big 2022 bonuses reduced, some investment bankers have little incentive to stick with their current roles, recruiters added. 
This is especially true for workers who may be considering jobs outside banking, such as in Silicon Valley, where many former finance executives have found lucrative opportunities.
PAIN FOR SOME, GAIN FOR OTHERS
The pain will be felt most by banks whose staff believe they were paid less than their peers, said one New York-based recruiter who works placing analysts and associates.
Those junior bankers, who support senior dealmakers, have been quick to circulate complaints about their pay and working conditions, including 100-plus hour work weeks, on social media, pressuring Wall Street employers to raise their compensation.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are two banks likely to suffer, said the recruiter who asked not to be named discussing sensitive pay issues.
""Litquidity,"" a popular Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account run by an anonymous financial services worker, in late January posted comments it said were from Citigroup first-year analysts complaining their 2021 bonuses were ""significantly lower"" than rival banks. 
Citigroup declined to comment. 
Scandal-hit Swiss lender Credit Suisse meanwhile was so worried about retaining top talent that it boosted immediate cash payouts for senior bankers, provided they stuck around for three years. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment, although the bank has recently made some senior investment banking hires.
""The banks that didn't pay above average are going to lose a lot of talent and are probably going to struggle to recruit new talent,"" said the recruiter, adding that some junior bankers are now beginning their job hunt just six months into their current role. 

However, turnover works both ways, experts and executives said.
""This is the recruiting moment,"" said Marc Cooper, chief executive of the boutique investment bank Solomon Partners. ""We have plenty of offers out, we'll see what happens.""

(Reuters) - Rhode Island is set to square off on Monday against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, as a multibillion-dollar trial begins over whether the Israeli company contributed to an opioid crisis that has caused more than 500,000 deaths over the past two decades.
Rhode Island says Teva created a ""public nuisance"" by downplaying the risks of opioid addiction and promoting the off-label use of powerful fentanyl-based opioids that were approved only for certain types of cancer pain.
Rhode Island is seeking $5.9 billion from the companies, according to a Teva court filing. Rhode Island officials declined to comment on the specific amount. 
Teva subsidiaries  Actavis  (NYSE:AGN) Pharma and Cephalon Inc are also defendants in the case in Rhode Island Superior Court in Providence.
The companies have denied the allegations, saying they sold drugs that were legal and approved for pain treatment.
In court filings by Teva, it calls Rhode Island's lawsuit an improper attempt to blame a wide-ranging public health crisis on ""a small subset of opioid manufacturers"" that make ""niche"" medicines like Actiq and Fentora. According to Teva's filings, those cancer drugs account for just 0.02% percent of all opioid prescriptions in the state since 1998.
The company also sells generic opioids such as oxycodone.
The Rhode Island lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addictiveness of opioid pain medications. The lawsuits also accuse distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that the drugs were being diverted into illegal channels.
The trial will begin as Teva attempts to negotiate a nationwide settlement of its opioid liability. After a recent $225 million settlement with the state of Texas, Teva Chief Executive Kåre Schultz told Reuters the company will likely end up paying $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion to resolve opioid claims.
Other defendants in the Rhode Island case settled before trial, including drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), which joined a nationwide $21 billion settlement.
Purdue Pharma LP, which was also a defendant, won initial approval last week for a $6 billion settlement funded by its Sackler family owners that would resolve litigation over its role in the opioid crisis.
The public nuisance theory has been used with mixed results in cases against other opioid distributors, manufacturers and pharmacies. 
The Rhode Island trial comes more than two months after a New York jury found Teva liable for creating a public nuisance in the state. And a federal jury in November found that pharmacy chain operators CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc created a public nuisance in two Ohio counties, in the first trial against those companies over the opioid epidemic. 

Damages have not yet been decided in either the New York or Ohio cases. 
Courts in California and Oklahoma have ruled the other way, finding in favor of opioid defendants, including Teva and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), in public nuisance cases.

Investing.com – Tencent Holdings stock (OTC:TCEHY) (HK:0700) closed nearly 10% lower in Hong Kong Monday on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the Chinese tech giant faces a potential record fine for violations of some central bank regulations by its WeChat Pay mobile network.
The violations relate to China’s anti-money-laundering rules. According to WSJ, there were also lapses in compliance with ‘know your customer’ and ‘know your business’ regulations – rules implemented by regulators the world over that require entities to verify the authenticity of the customer and their eligibility to undertake that transaction on the platform.
The breaches were discovered by the country’s central bank during a routine inspection that concluded in late 2021. Tencent’s mobile payments network was also found to have allowed the transfer and laundering of funds with illicit transactions such as gambling, the report said.
The impending penalty comes as Chinese fintech platforms prepare for tighter oversight of their business amid the government’s attempts to curb money laundering activities.
The Dutch-listed shares of  Prosus  (AS:PRX), the vehicle that holds South African giant Naspers' Tencent stake, were hurt too. They fell 11% in Amsterdam. NYSE-listed shares of Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME), a subsidiary, were down 5.2% in premarket trading.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday on raised hopes for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine war, but investors remain wary as fighting continues, a number of central banks hold meetings this week and Covid returns to China.
By 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded 1.1% higher and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3%.
The next round of the talks on the war in Ukraine between the two principals takes place Monday, but the noises emerging from the last session were reasonably upbeat.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said on Sunday that Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations, while Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was ""beginning to talk constructively."" 
That said, despite the optimistic tone, the fighting rages on near Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, following Sunday’s bombardment by Russia of a large training base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday.
U.S. officials claimed over the weekend that Russia had asked China for military assistance, potentially heightening the diplomatic tensions significantly. The U.S. and China plan to hold their first high-level, in-person talks since Moscow’s invasion later Monday.
Another factor prompting caution was China’s decision to place the over 17 million residents of Shenzhen, the country’s technology hub, into lockdown for at least a week after Covid cases soared once more. 
This has the potential to weigh heavily on economic growth in China, as well as further disrupt global supply chains.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday as policymakers try to balance the twin threats of inflation, which is running at a four-decade high, and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine. 
The Bank of England is also expected to hike rates again this week, while central banks in Japan, Turkey, and Brazil will also hold meetings.
Back in Europe, Eurozone finance ministers are set to meet later Monday to discuss potential support for the region’s economy, given the risks to growth in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine just as it starts to recover from the pandemic.
In corporate news,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stock soared 8.8% after Italy’s biggest phone group said it would start formal talks with KKR, almost four months after the private equity giant’s approach.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) rose 5.6% after the German lender stated that it would wind down its business in Russia, changing its stance after criticism over its ongoing ties.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia said on Sunday it would start formal talks with KKR to assess the U.S. fund's potential 10.8 billion euro ($11.8 billion) offer for Italy's biggest phone group, almost four months after the approach.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM), however, said it would also explore a possible tie-up with state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber as it pursues an in-house revamp new CEO Pietro Labriola presented in early March.
Discussions with KKR to assess ""the attractiveness and deliverability"" of its proposal would also seek to define the ""length and scope"" of confirmatory due diligence the private equity firm had requested before formalising its non-binding bid, TIM said. 
KKR aims to secure control of the debt-laden former phone monopoly, delist it and attempt to relaunch it by carving out its network infrastructure assets, sources have previously said.
Labriola, whose appointment was sponsored by TIM's largest investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) which deems KKR's initial offer as too low, has presented his own plan to revive the company. Labriola's plan also centres on separating network assets from TIM's services arm.
""TIM's board confirmed the will to execute the business plan and explore the revamp, through a reorganisation of the group's operations and a possible integration with Open Fiber,"" the company said in a statement released after a special board meeting on Sunday.
""The board also confirmed the conviction there is hidden value in TIM ... which must be taken into due consideration when assessing any alternatives to the business plan.""
TIM said Labriola and Chairman Salvatore Rossi would hold formal talks with KKR, following informal contacts between advisers in recent months, to gather more details on the KKR proposals.
TIM has recorded falling revenue and shrinking margins in recent years amid cut-throat competition in its core domestic market. Its shares last week hit an all-time low after the company reported a record 2021 loss and Labriola unveiled his revamp plan.
KKR's bid of 0.505 euros a share is a 75% premium to the stock's closing level on Friday, compared with a 46% premium when it was first announced.
Italy's government, which has special powers to shield companies of strategic relevance for the country such as TIM from unwanted foreign interest, is yet to take a formal stance on KKR's proposal.
The U.S. fund has said it wanted the backing of both TIM and the government. KKR is already involved with TIM, having paid 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in its secondary network.
OPEN FIBER TALKS
Rome has become the second biggest investor in TIM through state lender CDP, which owns 60% of Open Fiber, to oversee TIM's fixed line assets - Italy's biggest telecoms infrastructure.
TIM said it would continue negotiations with CDP and discussions with all relevant authorities over the Open Fiber merger, which would create a single broadband champion in Italy.
TIM had hoped to secure a preliminary agreement with CDP over Open Fiber in time for Sunday's board meeting but discussions over a tie-up that raises regulatory issues will require longer, sources have said.
In an attempt to revive the tie-up with Open Fiber, Labriola has said TIM is ready to relinquish a majority of its prized fixed landline assets.

A merger with Open Fiber could provide TIM's investors with an upside of 1 euro a share versus the current set up, sources have previously said.

There's arguably never a good time for the COVID-19 pandemic to make a comeback but the surging cases in China over the weekend come at a moment when the global economy could do without another layer of stress to its already stretched supply chains.
Ukraine's two leading providers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted operations, threatening to raise prices and to aggravate the semiconductor shortage.
This morning, Chinese stocks fell as domestic COVID-19 cases jumped to a two-year high, prompting Beijing's technology and financial hubs to impose restrictions. 
How severe the outbreak will prove and how much pain it will bring to the global economy is anyone's guess, but the economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already taking a heavy toll. 
Analysts have started trimming corporate earnings' estimates and on Thursday, the European Central Bank cut its 2022 growth target to 3.7% from 4.2% while raising its inflation forecast to 5.1%.
This week all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve and U.S. producer price index (PPI) data expected to show an annual 10% jump on Tuesday, will set the stage nicely for a rate hike. 
A quick look at the fast-ascending popularity of search queries for 'stagflation' on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends confirms that central banks hawks and doves are not the only ones worrying about sky-rocketing oil prices and higher rates slowing the economy.
In the meantime, both the pan-European STOXX 600 and Wall Street's S&P 500 are down over 11% year-to-date but this morning futures are pointing to a positive start of the week. 
With low visibility on the macro front, trading these past weeks has focused on news from the war in Ukraine and on diplomatic efforts to put an end to it. 
On Friday, stocks jumped when Russian President Vladimir Putin noted ""certain positive shifts"" in the negotiations and investors and trading algorithms will be on the lookout for any sign that the crisis could somehow de-escalate as talks continue today.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
- India's February WPI inflation accelerates to 13.11% y/y 
- German February wholesale prices +1.7% m/m, +16.6% y/y
- Euro zone finance ministers meet on fiscal stance for 2023, banking union 
- ECB speakers: President Christine Lagarde as well as board members Fabio Panetta and Frank Elderson

TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund sold shares worth $1 billion in South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang, a filing showed, amid a slump in the value of the tech investment firm's holdings. 
Vision Fund sold 50 million Coupang shares for $20.87 each, according to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Friday, leaving the investor with 461.2 million shares remaining.
SoftBank sold Coupang shares worth $1.69 billion for $29.69 each in September. The conglomerate first invested in Coupang in 2015 before the launch of Vision Fund which holds the stake. 
""They're going to sell the winners,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who estimates SoftBank invested in Coupang at an average of $4.80 per share. ""Selling at a loss isn't going to be very well accepted in this market."" 

The South Korean firm's shares are trading below their listing price as investors turn sceptical on the money losing startups that litter SoftBank's portfolio, which has also been hit by a collapse in China tech valuations.
SoftBank has been trimming stakes in listed companies as it prioritises investing through the second Vision Fund and share repurchases in a $9 billion programme. SoftBank's shares have fallen by almost a fifth year-to-date.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Largely ignored by the growing ranks of Europe's socially minded investors, defence firms see a fresh chance to argue for a place in portfolios after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One asset manager announced last week that it would re-allow investment in defence, a sign that cracks are emerging in widespread opposition to owning defence firms from sustainable investors in Europe. 
Analysts expect more to follow. But for many with a sustainable tilt - defined by some as investing in companies that aim to have a positive impact on the world - it will prove a tough ask.
Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Thales and Airbus have joined a chorus of companies over the last two weeks calling for investors to treat the sector more favourably, arguing security and stability are key to sustainability.
That comes after a year of the industry lobbying European authorities not to exclude defence from an upcoming framework or ""taxonomy"" on socially good investments. 
It also follows years in which investors across Europe have avoided the sector in favour of firms with stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) profiles, hurting defence shares and raising financing costs.
Most of the funds focused on sustainability that Reuters has spoken to remain cold on defence. But some are eyeing the returns on offer from the region's push to raise security spending.
Sweden's SEB Investment Management announced last week it had overturned a blanket ban on any company deriving more than 5% of its revenue from defence for six of its funds, although the majority of its product range is unchanged, including sustainable funds.
SEB attributed the change to pressure from customers for exposure to defence as Russian troops amassed on the Ukraine border, underlining that fund houses must answer to clients as well as their own sustainability promises.
""We are seeing evidence that a number of large European asset managers are re-evaluating the sector,"" said Luke Sussams, head of ESG in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for investment bank Jefferies. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a real wake-up call for ESG investors in general.""
Yet others say the sudden redrawing of Europe's security architecture does not mean makers of fighters, missiles and tanks are suddenly sustainable.
""Sustainable investments must fulfil the criterion ""Do no significant harm"" – this is not the case with armaments,"" said Henrik Pontzen, head of ESG at Union Investment. It is sticking to excluding from its sustainable funds any company that earns more than 5% of revenue from arms.
Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish pension fund PFA, said investors were wrong if they believed they could ensure that any investment in defence went solely towards defending borders.
""What are we going to include tomorrow? Let's include chemical companies that are polluting certain parts of the world, but not the rest. Come on, it's ridiculous,"" he told Reuters.
While funds with a specific sustainable or ethical mandate may find it hard to change tack, others with a looser requirement to ""integrate ESG risks"" have more flexibility.
Sustainable managers typically avoid businesses that earn 5%-plus of revenue from defence, while the vast majority of risk-focused funds just ban those involved with unconventional weapons such as cluster munitions.
UBS analysts noted that rather than outright exclusions some ESG managers prefer engagement. 
According to Morningstar, sustainable funds have a 0.2% weighting to aerospace and defence against the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF's 1.1%. In Europe the underweighting is starker -- 0.2% against 1.6%.
SOCIALLY GOOD OR BAD?
Still, defence lobbyists believe they are now winning the argument, especially after a strong indication that Europe's drive to help funnel investment to socially and environmentally friendly activities would not exclude their industry. 
A report prepared for the European Commission on its 'Social Taxonomy' last month omitted an earlier reference of defence as socially harmful. Lobbyists had feared it would lead to widespread fund exclusions.
With Germany, Sweden and others announcing bigger defence spending since the war in Ukraine, analysts have rushed to upgrade forecasts and share prices have soared.
Calling ESG concerns ""spurious and morally weak"", Agency Partners said in a note that the EU taxonomy debate had clouded the investability and valuations of defence stocks. 
And French warplane manufacturer Dassault Aviation hit out at a ""schizophrenic"" situation that saw European defence spending rising only for U.S. rivals to benefit, because European suppliers were being harmed by the EU taxonomy drive.
""Taxonomy is not an effective weapon against current threats,"" CEO Eric Trappier, who also represents the French defence industry, told reporters. ""It is a weapon used against us, the defence industry, and the proof is that... its small suppliers are starting to have problems with their banks."" 
FIGHTBACK
The defence industry's fight is far from over, however. 
Including defence in the EU social's taxonomy would ""fly in the face of the 'Do No Significant Harm principle'"", said Hortense Bioy, sustainable research director at Morningstar.
European technical advisers are also backing a 5% revenue threshold to exclude defence companies from the bloc's planned 'EU Ecolabel', which is designed to help consumers identify more environmentally friendly and socially good products.
A spokesperson said the Commission would ""carefully reflect on all the implications of those exclusions for defence-related activities"", but stressed no final decision had been made. 
For a fragmented industry that can struggle to compete against rivals in the United States where ESG concerns are less commonplace, winning hearts and minds of investors is crucial.

""Even if some banks and investors are coming back to defence, it doesn't mean they all are,"" said Jan Pie, secretary general of European defence industry lobby ASD, arguing that longer term, defence needed more reliable financial backers.
""It shouldn't be public opinion that decides whether to finance the defence industry.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Monday on raised hopes for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine war at the start of a week dominated by key central bank meetings, including that of the Federal Reserve.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%.
The next round of the talks on the war in Ukraine between the two principals is scheduled for early Monday, but the noises emerging from the last session were reasonably upbeat.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said on Sunday that Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations, while Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was ""beginning to talk constructively."" 
That said, despite the optimistic tone, the fighting rages on with Russia launching a destructive bombardment of a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday.
Away from the events in Eastern Europe, the focus this week will be on policy-setting meetings from a number of key central banks.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday as policymakers try to balance the twin threats of inflation, which is running at a four-decade high, and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine. 
The Bank of England is also expected to hike rates again this week, while central banks in Japan, Turkey, and Brazil will also hold meetings.
Back in Europe, Eurozone finance ministers are set to meet later Monday to discuss potential support for the region’s economy given the risks to growth in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine just as it starts to recover from the pandemic.
In corporate news,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) will be in the spotlight after Italy’s biggest phone group said on Sunday it would start formal talks with KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR). to assess the private equity giant's potential offer, almost four months after the approach.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) could also be in focus after the German lender stated Friday that it would wind down its business in Russia, changing its stance after criticism over its ongoing ties.
Oil prices weakened Monday, extending last week’s decline on hopes for progress in the diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine war as well as traders bracing for higher U.S. interest rates, and thus a likely stronger dollar. 
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.7% lower at $106.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2.4% to $109.97. 
Both contracts have surged since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, with both hitting their highest levels since 2008 last week. However, U.S. crude still recorded a weekly drop of 5.7% last week, while Brent last week was down 4.8%.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank, which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.
Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow..
Deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.
""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.
""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" Deutsche said. 
A day earlier,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.
""The answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.""
Bill Browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in Russia, said that Deutsche Bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""
""I would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" Browder told Reuters earlier on Friday.
The criticism came as Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital and Britain said that Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Fabio De Masi, a former member of the Bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that Deutsche Bank had close ties to the Russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal Russian activity, had to end.
'MONITORING'
Deutsche Bank has said that it has pared down its Russian footprint in recent years. This week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". 
It also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in Russia and opened a new main office in Moscow in December, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market"".
Russia has landed Deutsche Bank in hot water in the past.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating it for years over trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the German bank being fined nearly $700 million. 
Deutsche Bank said on Friday that the DOJ probe ""is understood to be ongoing"".
The row over Russia came as Deutsche Bank disclosed in its annual report that it paid Sewing 8.8 million euros ($9.68 million) in 2021, a 20% increase from a year earlier. 

Overall, the lender paid 14% more, or 2.1 billion euros, in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW are scrambling to find alternative sources of vital parts made in Ukraine from as far afield as China and Mexico, as Russia's invasion halts assembly lines and breaks complex supply chains.
The hunt for new supplies is the latest challenge for an auto industry already reeling from soaring metal and energy prices, supply chains snarled by the pandemic, and a shortage of semiconductor chips. 
The fighting in Ukraine has now disrupted output of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car. Unique to each model, vehicles cannot be built without them. 
As a result, world No. 2 automaker Volkwagen and rival BMW have cut output and temporarily closed some assembly lines, while Mercedes-Benz has warned its production will be affected soon.
VW's premium brand Audi said the entire Volkswagen group is working to get major suppliers to relocate their Ukrainian wire harness production to other plants, or find alternative suppliers. That search includes Eastern Europe, North Africa, Mexico and ""possibly"" China, it said.
""We have been working successfully with various suppliers from these regions for our models for years,"" it said. ""It is possible, for example, that suppliers will split production across several locations.""
BMW also said it is in ""intensive talks"" with suppliers to find alternative sources for parts, while world no. 4 carmaker Stellantis said it has already shifted its sourcing from Ukraine to elsewhere in Europe, declining to say where.
Nick Klein, a vice president at global logistics firm OEC Group, said carmakers who have relied on Ukraine will need to move fast.
""You'll need to order way ahead of time, because you'll face delays, and carmakers will be competing against each other for the same sources,"" said Klein, who specialises in automotive logistics.
'MESSED-UP' SUPPLY CHAINS
Western Ukraine, with its low-cost, highly-skilled workforce and proximity to Europe's car factories and a wealth of raw materials, has grown into a major production hub for wire harnesses, with Japan's Fujikura and France's Nexans among those producing there. 
Some manufacturers, like Fujikura, have suspended Ukrainian production altogether since the invasion, while others are operating at reduced capacity. Neither Fujikura nor Nexans replied to requests for comment on their plans.
Moving production to plants in other low-cost markets with a vibrant wire harness industry, like Romania, Serbia or Tunisia, involves buying new equipment to boost capacity, which could take months to install. 
According to industry sources, suppliers and carmakers are discussing who will foot the bill. Carmakers interviewed for this story would not name their suppliers.
Some wire harness manufacturers in Ukraine, such as Kromberg & Schubert, Japan's Yazaki and Leoni, already have alternative plants in other countries. Leoni declined to comment on its plans, and K&S and Yazaki did not respond to requests for comment.
There is still a trickle of supply out of Ukraine. One wire harness manufacturer in the country's west, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for the safety of workers, said some production continues during the day, though it is shuttered at night due to curfews.
Some trucking companies are hauling wire harnesses south across the border into Romania because for now the fighting has not reached that region, OEC Group's Klein said. That could soon change.
""The number of truckers who are willing to drive those routes as this continues will be less and less,"" Klein said. ""There's going to be a point where you can't get anything out of there safely."" 

Facing a ""messed-up"" global supply chain, European carmakers need as many sources of parts as possible, Klein said.
""Right now you cannot have enough suppliers and you cannot have enough shipping partners, because of the climate we're in.""

(Reuters) - Chinese tycoon Xiang Guangda has to find a way to bail his Tsingshan Holding Group out of a crisis after its bet on nickel prices backfired, fuelling more volatility in a metal essential for the electric vehicles industry. One of the world's top nickel producers faces massive losses on its short positions after prices soared over $100,000 per tonne last week and forced the London Metal Exchange to halt nickel trading.
Tsingshan has to either pay off the outstanding short positions, which could be as high as $8 billion, or prove it has sufficient deliverable nickel to repay in kind. 
Beijing could step in to rescue Tsingshan, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. China could swap some of its high grade nickel reserves for low grade nickel pig iron (NPI) that Tsingshan produces to help it meet LME quality standards. China is estimated to hold around 100,000 tonnes of nickel in state stocks, two analysts said.
Tsingshan and China's state reserves administration did not respond to requests for comment.
Tsingshan has figured in market swings before. 
Last year, it triggered a price drop with surprise news that it would provide nickel matte to battery materials makers, potentially solving a key bottleneck for electric vehicles by boosting battery-grade supply in a cheaper way. 
Betting prices would fall, Tsingshan started building a short position last year. The bet backfired partly as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent metals prices soaring, putting pressure on holders of big short positions, including Tsingshan.
""Markets were sensing that (Tsingshan) were going to make a move, but they probably made it too early ... a quarter or so too early and nobody was anticipating what happened in Ukraine,"" said Angela Durrant, Wood Mackenzie's principal nickel analyst.
Tsingshan has suggested foreign elements may be driving up nickel prices. ""Foreigners do have some actions and we are actively co­­ordinating [with related parties],"" China Business News quoted Xiang as saying on March 8. The market gyrations have had no impact on Tsingshan's Indonesia operations, a corporate mining source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
For Indonesia, Tsingshan is a means to fulfill its ambition to become a one-stop shop for EV battery ingredients and the company has executed projects at lightning speed. Western firms often privately complained about the access and resources Tsingshan got in the country. ""Government has ambition in Indonesia, they want to build the hub for battery for electrical car. That's why you see the policy to support the industry,"" the source said. ""We are affected by COVID, but not affected by this (short exposure)."" Tsingshan is also seen as a poster child in Southeast Asia for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, President Xi Jinping's vast infrastructure programme. 
In contrast to privately-held Tsingshan, several high profile projects led by Chinese state-backed firms have been mothballed amid overpricing, corruption and debt sustainability concerns. https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-belt-road-plans-losing-momentum-opposition-debt-mount-study-2021-09-29
MARKET DISRUPTOR 
Founded in 1988 in Wenzhou, Tsingshan started out in stainless steel production and making automobile windows and doors. 
But its fortunes changed when Xiang, 64, started exploring Indonesian markets in 2009. Over the next decade, it shook the global nickel industry with low-cost nickel pig iron. It set up facilities in Indonesia, the world's largest nickel producer, with output ranging from nickel sulphate to nickel matte, an intermediate product that can be used in both stainless steel and batteries. Tsingshan is spearheading Indonesia’s two major nickel hubs, including the Morowali industrial park, which employs over 40,000 people and spans 2,000 hectares with an airport, mineral processing plants, a port and executive visitors hotel.
The company has said it aims to produce 850,000 tonnes of nickel equivalents this year and 1.1 million tonnes in 2023. ""There was nothing there on that site in 2015 ... so they did something absolutely miraculous,"" Durrant said. ""Getting away from higher Chinese power (costs), moving everything over to Indonesia was a masterstroke for them."" The industry credits much of this success to Xiang. He became known as a market disruptor who could ""take the world by storm"", said Steven Brown, an independent nickel consultant in Canberra who spent two days touring Tsingshan’s production facilities with Xiang in 2014. 
Xiang opposes high nickel prices and is fixed on being a low-cost producer of nickel and stainless steel, Brown said. 
""I don't think this crisis will result in too much of a change in strategy from Tsingshan,"" he added. 
Market sources said though Tsingshan has cut its exposure it is unlikely to have fully covered all its positions. 

State-backed Chinese newspaper Securities Daily said on March 9 that Tsingshan had deployed ""enough spot products"" for delivery by swapping its nickel matte with nickel plates in the domestic market.
The LME allows delivery of nickel cathodes, including plate, and briquettes. ""There isn't much spot nickel product in the market, it's not even likely that Tsingshan could get 100,000 tonnes,"" said a Guangdong-based analyst who declined to be named.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index sank 10% during the previous week, which dampened the mood in Hong Kong alongside the persistently high number of cases in the city’s fifth wave of COVID-19. China is also dealing with a growing outbreak which put the southern city of Shenzhen under a lockdown.
Chinese data, including fixed-asset investment, industrial production, retail sales, and the unemployment rate, is due on Tuesday.
Global shares eased a selloff driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict continue, with senior U.S. and China officials to meet on Monday for discussions.
However, Russian missiles hit a military training facility in western Ukraine close to Poland and U.S. officials claimed that Russia asked China for military equipment. With Russia losing access to almost half of its foreign exchange reserves, it remains to be seen if the country can continue to service its international debt.
U.S. Treasuries extended a downward trend, with the five-year U.S. yield above 2% for the first time since May 2019. This, and a 12% drop in global stocks this year, continue to drive worries that tightening monetary policy and soaring energy, grain, and metal costs could slow down the economic recovery.
“We are experiencing extraordinary volatility in global equities compounded by wavering market sentiment, and the risk of recession intensifies on spiraling commodity prices,” Federated Hermes portfolio manager for global equities Louise Dudley said in a note.
“We expect ongoing swings in the short term as geopolitical uncertainty over Russian crude persists.”
Investors now await the Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Wednesday. However, the central bank “is really stuck between the real economy and the financial economy,” Bain & Co. global head of macro research Karen Harris told Bloomberg.
“You have mainstream struggling with inflation, that’s why we are set to see these rises coming in March. On the other side, we are trying not to prick the financial economy. Either path is deflationary, recessionary.”

The tumble follows a Friday report that Didi Global Inc. has suspended preparations for its planned Hong Kong listing after failing to appease regulatory demands, reigniting fears over Beijing’s crackdown. Also hammering stocks are a growing Covid-19 outbreak, worries over earnings, and a potential spillover from Russia’s war in Ukraine. 
“We don’t see a major catalyst in the near term,” for China stocks, though earnings results may create some share price volatility, said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “For a material re-rating of China tech, we may need to see a shift in regulatory tone, and we didn’t get that from the recently concluded NPC meeting ” he said, referring to the National People’s Congress. 
China’s benchmark CSI 300 index fell as much a 1.9% on Monday, having ended last week with 4.2% losses in the worst NPC performance since 2008.
Both Hang Seng Tech Index and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index have lost more than 60% from their peaks, respectively.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings Ltd. sank more than 5% while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., which is headquartered in Shenzhen, was down 4%.  
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists toned down their optimism on China stocks, slashing their valuation estimates. 
“We stay overweight China on well-anchored growth expectations/targets, easing policy, depressed valuations/sentiment, and low investor positioning,” but lower our valuation target from 14.5 times to 12 times on changes in the global macro environment and higher geopolitical risks, strategists including Kinger Lau wrote in note dated Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors stepped up pressure on corporate climate lobbying on Monday, launching a new 14-point action plan for companies to stick to or risk having their actions put to a shareholder vote.
The Global Standard on Responsible Climate Lobbying urges companies to commit to responsible climate lobbying, disclose the support given to trade groups lobbying on their behalf and take action if it runs counter to the world's climate goal.
That goal, to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms by mid-century, is moving increasingly out of reach, scientists say, with urgent action needed in the short-term to have any hope of reaching it.
Developed by Swedish pension scheme AP7, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management and the Church of England Pensions Board, the standard is backed by investor groups leading on climate talks with companies whose members manage a collective $130 trillion.
""Time must be called on negative climate lobbying. Investors will no longer tolerate a glaring gap between a company’s words and their actions on climate,"" said AP7, Sustainability Strategist Charlotta Dawidowski Sydstrand.
""As active owners we are committed to engaging collectively and individually with companies globally to highlight and improve their climate lobbying accountability and performance and to escalate this stewardship where required.""
In a statement, the investors said that lobbying that sought to delay, dilute or block climate action by governments ran counter to their interests and could result in resolutions being filed at the shareholder meetings of firms that failed to act.

""Corporate lobbying can significantly influence public climate policy,"" said Clare Richards, Senior Engagement Manager at the Church of England Pensions Board.
""We want the standard to set a high bar for companies, and to encourage a move away from ‘negative lobbying’ towards actively engaging in ‘responsible lobbying’ through supporting policies aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.""

(Reuters) - Lawyers for ZTE Corp (HK:0763) have been summoned to U.S. federal court in Texas on Monday for a hearing over whether the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker violated probation in connection with an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud.
ZTE is on probation in the United States after pleading guilty in Dallas in 2017 to illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea.
The alleged visa fraud stems from a 2021 case in Atlanta, Georgia. ZTE was not charged in that indictment. 
A former ZTE research director in New Jersey and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology allegedly conspired to bring Chinese nationals to the United States to conduct research at ZTE between at least 2014 and 2018, according to the indictment.
The Chinese nationals came to the United States on J-1 visas, designed for work and study at institutions like Georgia Tech, but allegedly conducted research for ZTE in New Jersey. 
The professor, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the former ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. 
Shares of ZTE Corp in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen fell more than 12% last week after news of the hearing.
In a March 4 notice to the Hong Kong stock exchange, ZTE said Yu left the company years ago, and that no current employee had been charged in the visa case. ZTE said production and operation activities were being carried out normally.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta, where the visa case is pending, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington. A lawyer for ZTE did not respond to a request for comment. 
ZTE paid $892 million and pleaded guilty in Texas in 2017 to criminal charges for violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -South Africa's civil aviation regulator grounded Comair's planes indefinitely on Sunday over unresolved safety issues, in a move that also affects low-cost airline Kulula and British Airways, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.
A spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) said it had extended a 24-hour precautionary suspension of Comair's operator certificate indefinitely.
The suspension was meant to end on Sunday, but Comair has not adequately addressed all the necessary safety issues, the SACAA said.
""This morning we communicated to them (Comair) that their air operator certificate is now indefinitely suspended until they close all of the findings,"" SACAA spokesperson Phindiwe Gwebu told Reuters, effectively grounding the company's fleet of Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft.
Comair said it was unable to confirm when it would start flying again, after working through the night to provide documentation to SACAA following a review of certain policies, systems and procedures.
""This is a huge blow to our customers, employees and the flying public as it effectively takes 40% of the capacity out of the market,"" Glenn Orsmond, Comair chief executive said in a statement.
There would be considerable implications for the aviation sector and the country should the suspension be prolonged, he added.
CHARTERED FLIGHTS
Airports Company SA (ACSA), which runs the country's largest airports, said some of the stranded passengers were placed on chartered flights arranged by BA and Comair, specifically for commuters on the popular Johannesburg and Cape Town route.
""Priority is also given to those passengers who have onward international connecting flights,"" Terence Delomoney, ACSA's group executive operations manager said.
Issuing the precautionary notice on Saturday, the regulator said in the past month Comair had experienced safety problems ranging from ""engine failures, engine malfunction and landing gear malfunctions,"" among others.
In its investigations, SACAA said it had discovered three so-called ""level 1"" findings ""which pose an immediate risk"" and must be addressed immediately. 
Gwebu did not elaborate on what outstanding safety issues Comair, which flies local and regional routes from South Africa under the British Airways (BA) livery as part of a licence agreement, needed to address before flying again. Besides flying BA planes, Comair also operates the Kulula brand.

A notice on Kulula's website showed that Comair had been aiming to resume its schedule by 12 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Sunday, subject to SACAA's approval.
""We will do everything we can to accommodate customers affected by the suspension on other flights, prioritising vulnerable customers and those who most urgently needed to travel,"" Comair said, adding that customers would also be kept informed via text.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are rushing to recalibrate their portfolios for a potentially extended period of elevated commodity prices, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparks eye-popping moves in raw materials that threaten to exacerbate inflation and hurt growth. 
Wild moves have been the norm in commodities over the last few weeks, as the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russia helped lift oil prices to 14-year highs and natural gas prices near records. Prices for wheat and copper stand near all-time highs, while a doubling of the price of nickel earlier this week forced the London Metals Exchange to halt trading in the metal. [L2N2VE09Q][L2N2VE0JL]
With the U.S. economy already feeling the stress of a broad, post-COVID-19 boost in demand and a quick resolution to the West’s standoff with Russia in doubt, some investors are betting high commodity prices are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. 
Investors have sent $10.5 billion into commodities-focused ETFs and mutual funds since the start of the year, including a $2.8 billion gain in the week that ended March 2 that was the largest one-week positive inflow since July 2020, according to ICI data. 
""This is a very unique environment that we’re in because you have both demand shocks and supply shocks to the system at the same time,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. 
Marshall believes demand for commodities is likely to remain strong even if geopolitical tensions ebb, fueled by factors like electric car battery production, which requires metals such as copper and nickel. A $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill passed in November is increasing demand for steel, cement and other commodities, he said. 
He is increasing his stake in steel producer Cleveland Cliffs Inc and agricultural companies  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Co, while cutting positions in consumer companies most likely to feel the brunt of higher gas and materials costs. 
Massive rallies in commodities have increased pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks to tighten monetary policy and fight inflation. This has ramped up worries that doing so will hurt economic growth as rising prices already weigh on consumers. 
Investors widely expect the Fed to announce the first rate increase since 2018 at the end of its monetary policy meeting next week and have priced in 1.75 percentage points in tightening this year. Data this week showed consumer prices grew at their fastest pace last month in 40 years. [L2N2VC2QK][FEDWATCH] 
Matthew Schwab, portfolio manager of the Harbor Capital All-Weather Inflation Focus ETF, has increased his exposure to oil and metals futures. Prices for industrial metals are likely to stay high due to underproduction during the coronavirus pandemic, while oil companies appear content to trade lower production for higher prices, he said. 
""You are able to see the signs of a commodity price rally in the lack of investment over the last decade,"" Schwab said. 
Mark Khalamayzer, lead manager of the Columbia Commodity Strategy Fund, has increased his exposure to oil and agricultural commodities to the highest limits allowed by his fund prospectus, betting that the conflict in Ukraine will lead to prices spiraling higher. 
Brent crude settled at $112.67 a barrel on Friday and is up 44% since the start of the year.
Even as investors try to align their portfolios to expectations of higher raw materials prices, they are worried about how the rally in commodities could hurt growth. 

The risk of a recession led by a sharp cutback in consumer spending rises the longer that oil prices stay high, said Robert Schein, chief investment officer, Blanke Schein Wealth Management. 
""If oil prices stay well above $100 per barrel for a few months, the consumer and economy can withstand this, but if $100-plus oil prices last for more than six months, that's when we will see recession risk surge,"" he said.

His car was involved in an accident with a senior police official's car, both vehicles were impounded and the case was under investigation, local news agency IANS reported.

(Reuters) - Patient groups are mounting a public pressure campaign aimed at persuading the U.S. government to loosen proposed restrictions on new Alzheimer's treatments, spending millions of dollars on television and local advertisements that began running during the Sunday morning political shows. 
The unusual ad campaign comes after a high-profile disagreement between government health agencies over who should have access to Biogen’s Aduhelm, the first treatment for the mind-wasting disease to be approved in 20 years.
The government’s Medicare program, which provides health benefits for Americans aged 65 and older, in January proposed paying for Biogen’s drug and similar treatments in development only for patients enrolled in years-long government studies.
The drugs being considered remove amyloid plaques from the brain of people with Alzheimer's. The agency has until April 11 to issue a final coverage decision.
The highly restrictive move came after Aduhelm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last June, even though only one of two late-stage trials showed that it helped slow cognitive decline. As written, the Medicare plan would also apply to plaque-clearing drugs in advanced development by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd.
USAgainstAlzheimer's, one of the largest U.S.-based groups representing patients with the disease, said it is funding ads in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore areas targeting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the White House and Congress.
    ""We want to put a face on the individuals that are affected by this Medicare decision,"" said USAgainstAlzheimer's Chairman George Vradenburg. ""We tend to talk about big numbers. We don't talk about individual people."" 
He said the group is spending millions on the campaign, which will feature Alzheimer's patients, including social media outreach and print ads on bus stops and other transportation in the Washington area. Many have the tag line ""Alzheimer's patients can't wait.""
Thousands of patients and doctors have already pressured the Medicare agency with letters, echoing the companies’ assertions that patients should not be cut off from the new drugs once they have been approved. At the same time, many comments praised Medicare for putting curbs on Aduhelm's use.
Aduhelm's price - cut in December to $28,200 from $56,000 per year - sparked concerns about Medicare's budget since Alzheimer's is an age-related disease and around 85% of people eligible for the drug are covered by the government plan.
    The number of Americans with Alzheimer's is expected to rise to 13 million by 2050 from more than 6 million currently.

Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) has estimated that around 1 million should be eligible for Aduhelm, which is approved for people in the early stages of the memory-robbing illness.
    The Alliance for Aging Research said it has organized a protest for Tuesday across the street from HHS headquarters in Washington, during which patients, their caregivers and others will call for Medicare to reconsider its restrictive plan.

Russia's economy faces its deepest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, as the West imposes severe sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Some western allies have encouraged India to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, after New Delhi abstained from voting against Moscow, a long-standing arms supplier, at the United Nations.
""Russia's oil and petroleum product exports to India have approached $1 billion, and there are clear opportunities to increase this figure,"" said Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, according to a statement shared by Russia's embassy in India late on Friday.

""If oil prices stay well above $100 per barrel for a few months, the consumer and economy can withstand this, but if $100-plus oil prices last for more than six months, that's when we will see recession risk surge,"" he said.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s total client exposure to Russia has declined to less than $1 billion from $18 billion a month ago, before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine led to Western sanctions and the closure of the Russian stock market, according to figures supplied by the asset manager on Friday.
A spokesman for the New York asset manager said via e-mail that the impact on clients would ""depend on their initial asset allocation and the timing of their allocations to or away from this market during the period"".
Morningstar data through Feb. 25 had shown BlackRock had around $5 billion in exposure to Russia, among many large U.S. asset managers with investments there.
BlackRock last week said it had suspended the purchase of all Russian securities and given the figure that Russian securities accounted for less than 0.01% of its $10 trillion in assets. Most of BlackRock's remaining exposure is through index strategies. 

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Wednesday said moves by Western companies to break commercial and financial ties means ""Russia has been essentially cut off from global capital markets"".
""BlackRock will continue actively consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities, whenever and wherever regulatory and market conditions allow,"" the spokesman said via e-mail on Friday.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes stumbled on Friday as tech and growth shares led a broad decline and investors worried about the conflict in Ukraine while attention turned to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. 
At the end of a volatile week, indexes had opened higher after Russian President Vladimir Putin said there were ""certain positive shifts"" in talks with Ukraine, without providing any details, but stocks then faded during the session.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended down, with communication services falling 1.9% and technology dropping 1.8%. 
“After we saw a bounce in the middle of the week, there is still too much uncertainty out there,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. ""The market has had a tough couple of Mondays so I think the short-term players want to take some chips off the table.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 229.88 points, or 0.69%, to 32,944.19, the S&P 500 lost 55.21 points, or 1.30%, to 4,204.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 286.15 points, or 2.18%, to 12,843.81.
The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.9% for the week, and logged its second straight weekly decline. The Dow fell for a fifth straight week.
  On Friday, declines in shares of megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc dragged on the S&P 500. Apple fell 2.4% while Tesla dropped 5.1%.
Meta Platforms shares fell 3.9% as Russia opened a criminal case against the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent after the social network changed its hate speech rules to allow users to call for ""death to the Russian invaders"" in the context of the war with Ukraine.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict with Russia, but Russian forces bombarded cities across the country and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on the capital Kyiv.
Regarding developments in the Ukraine crisis, “you just don’t know what you are going to see so there’s no reason to go into the weekend with a risk-on attitude,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Growth stocks also came under pressure as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 2%. 
Stocks have struggled this year as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Fed is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. The S&P 500 is down 11.8% in 2022.
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates at its March 15-16 meeting. 
A survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell more than expected in early March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the aftermath of Russia's war against Ukraine.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 274 new lows.

LONDON (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta Platforms said Friday that a temporary change in its content policy, only for Ukraine, was needed to let users voice opposition to Russia's attack, as Russia opened a criminal case after the company said it would allow posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders.""
Russian prosecutors asked a court to designate the U.S. tech giant as an ""extremist organisation,"" and the communications regulator said it would restrict access to Meta's Instagram starting March 14. The company said the decision would affect 80 million users in Russia.
""A criminal case has been initiated ... in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta, which owns the social networks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said.
The committee reports directly to President Vladimir Putin. It was not immediately clear what the consequences of the criminal case might be.
Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg responded after the Russian government action with a tweeted statement saying that the company aimed to protect rights to speech as an expression of self-defense reacting to the invasion of Ukraine and that the policy only applied to Ukraine.
""If we applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable,"" Clegg wrote.
""We have no quarrel with the Russian people. There is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned,"" he added.
Two weeks into Russia's war in Ukraine, a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday the company had temporarily altered its rules for political speech, allowing posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders,"" although it would not allow calls for violence against Russian civilians.
Meta said the temporary change aimed to allow for forms of political expression that would normally violate its rules.
Its oversight board said on Friday that it had been briefed by the company on Ukraine-related policies and that context was important for content policies and enforcement.
Internal Meta emails previously seen by Reuters said the temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers had applied to the markets of: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. 
A Meta spokesperson declined to provide comment other than Clegg's statement.
The emails seen by Reuters also showed the U.S. company had temporarily allowed posts that call for the death of Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
""We hope it is not true because if it is true then it will mean that there will have to be the most decisive measures to end the activities of this company,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
INFORMATION WARS
Russia has for more than a year been striving to curb the influence of U.S. tech giants including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), repeatedly fining them for allowing what it deems to be illegal content.
But the invasion of Ukraine - met by a storm of international condemnation and unprecedented sanctions - has sharply raised the stakes in the information war.
Social media provide an opportunity for dissent against Putin's line - loyally followed by the tightly controlled state media - that Moscow was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to defend Russian-speakers in Ukraine against genocide and to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.
The Investigative Committee said the Facebook move could violate articles of the Russian criminal law against public calls for extremist activities.
""Such actions of the (Meta) company's management not only form an idea that terrorist activity is permissible, but are aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards the citizens of the Russian Federation,"" the state prosecutor's office said.
It said it had applied to a court to recognise Meta as an extremist organisation and prohibit its activities in Russia.
Meta's other services also are popular in Russia. Facebook last year had an estimated 7.5 million users and WhatsApp 67 million, according to researcher Insider Intelligence. 
Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform.

Instagram is a favoured tool of jailed Putin opponent Alexei Navalny, who used it in a message posted via his lawyers and supporters on Friday to call for Russians to join protests against the Ukraine war and ""mad maniac Putin"" this weekend.
WhatsApp will not be affected by the legal moves, Russia's RIA news agency cited a source as saying, as the messaging app is considered a means of communication not a way to post information.

The nomination was disclosed in Berkshire's annual proxy filing ahead of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's April 30 annual meeting, and will be voted on by shareholders.
Murphy, a longtime friend of Buffett, decided last month to step down from Berkshire's board following a bout with COVID-19.
That caused Berkshire to fall out of compliance with New York Stock Exchange rules requiring that a majority of board members be independent.
Weitz, 72, founded his namesake Omaha-based firm in 1983. It had about $4.1 billion of assets under management as of Dec. 31. 

""Wallace Weitz brings to the board his substantial financial experience as an investor in public companies and as a director of a public company,"" Berkshire said.
Berkshire's board would have 15 members following Weitz's appointment, including eight considered independent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares slid on Friday, pressured by uncertainty about the conflict in Ukraine and expectations the Federal Reserve will hike U.S. interest rates next week. 
The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell, weighed down by tech and growth stocks. Oil prices settled up for the day but down for the week in volatile trading.
Investors kept their focus on Ukraine, where Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv regrouped northwest of the capital. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country had ""already reached a strategic turning point"" in the conflict.
The U.S. announced a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds and made it harder for Russia to access funds from the International Monetary Fund, as Washington and its allies ramped up sanctions.
Financial markets have swung wildly during the war in Ukraine, now in its third week, as investors also braced for central banks to tighten monetary policy to tame inflation just as the global economy begins to slow. 
U.S. consumer sentiment fell in early March by more than expected on inflation concerns, according to a Friday report, while data released Thursday showed consumer prices in February notched their largest annual increase in 40 years.
Next week, the Fed is expected to begin raising interest rates, and the Bank of England is expected to continue its rate-hikes, especially after January's economic growth numbers from the U.K. came in stronger than expected.
""While investors have accepted the Fed will likely begin raising rates next week, there is still a lack of clarity of how far and how fast the Fed moves from there,"" Lindsey Bell, Ally's Chief Markets & Money Strategist wrote in a note Friday.
""With the market taking action (in the form of volatility) and possibly reducing demand, the Fed may not have to move as quickly. Still, the pace of inflation will be the key driver of policy changes for the better part of this year.""

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Friday urged the rejection of four shareholder proposals recommending that it replace Warren Buffett as chairman, report on its plans to handle climate risk and reduce greenhouse gases, and improve diversity.
The company, run by Buffett since 1965, also said the 91-year-old received $373,204 in compensation for 2021, down from $380,328 a year earlier, comprising his usual $100,000 salary plus personal and home security.
Though Buffett's salary is low for a chief executive officer of a major company, his 16.2% Berkshire stake comprises most of his $117.9 billion net worth, which Forbes magazine said makes him the world's fifth-richest person.
Berkshire disclosed Buffett's pay and recommendations on shareholder proposals in its annual proxy filing, ahead of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's April 30 annual meeting.
It also said Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who respectively oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations, were in 2021 each awarded $19 million for a third straight year. Buffett sets their pay.
Berkshire has said Abel would become CEO and Buffett's son Howard Buffett would become non-executive chairman if Warren Buffett could not continue in those roles.
One shareholder proposal, from the National Legal and Policy Center, said those roles are ""greatly diminished"" because Buffett holds both, weakening governance, and an independent director should become chairman.
According to the filing, Berkshire's directors agree that is a good idea, but only after Buffett is no longer CEO.
In urging rejections of the environmental proposals, Berkshire said many operating units already make disclosures concerning climate risks, and its insurance operations appropriately manage risks from greenhouse gases.
It also said its operating businesses have committed to diversity, equity and inclusion without needing direction from Buffett.
Berkshire's dozens of business units include Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Brooks running and See's candies, among others.

Buffett controls 32.1% of Berkshire's voting power. Shareholder proposals he opposes normally fail by big margins.
Berkshire's share price is up 9% this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 12%.

Customers will have to pay a surcharge fee of either 45 cents or 55 cents on each Uber trip and 35 cents or 45 cents on each Uber Eats order, depending on their location. The money charged will go directly to the workers, Uber said.
The surcharge will last for at least 60 days after which it will make adjustments based on feedback from workers and customers.

The move comes as many Uber drivers have been protesting on social media over high gas costs that have been eating into their earnings even as the company raised its profitability outlook, with some asking if it was still worth getting behind the wheel.
Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a major oil producer, had crippled global oil trade and could further lift gasoline prices.

""Food is a basic human right and should never be used as a weapon,"" Cargill, a U.S.-based privately held company, said in a statement.
Cargill this week removed details on its businesses in Russia and Ukraine from its website. The site previously said Cargill employs about 2,500 people in Russia, with investments of more than $1.1 billion in agro-processing.

The stock fell 2.4%, ending at its lowest since November in a broad selloff of technology shares. It dropped 5.2% for the week, the fifth straight week of losses, declining more than 10% over that period. The Nasdaq 100 Index slid 2.1% and posted a weekly loss of 3.9%.
Tech stocks have come under pressure this year on concern growth will slow as the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused commodity prices to jump and heightened worries about inflation, has also weighed on the group.
Apple remains a relative outperformer so far this year. Its loss of nearly 13% is less than the Nasdaq 100’s 18% drop. Investors have gravitated toward it as something of a haven, although that hasn’t been enough to offset the macroeconomic factors that are expected to continue weighing on the sector.
“Investors see macro indicators pointing to a slowdown, and Apple is getting swept up in that broad selling,” said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer of ACM Funds. “I don’t think tech is in a position where it will immediately bounce back, but even if Apple is unlikely to see a lot of multiple expansion from here, it shouldn’t see much compression either, given the stability of its earnings and the growth in its services business.”
Apple is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 6.2, compared with its five-year average of 4.6. The forward P/E is 24.5, above the long-term average of 20.3.
Kahn, whose fund owns the stock, described this valuation as “more neutral than compelling, which does make it something of a safety play, as there are parts of tech that saw bubble-like multiples and should continue to see compression.”

The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, or 230 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.
Consumer discretionary stocks led the broader market lower as investors digested data pointing to a wobble in consumer sentiment in the wake of surging inflation that ratcheted up a notch following the Russia-Ukraine war.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), and  Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY) led the losses in consumer discretionary stocks, with the latter falling by more than 11%.
The March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, which is negatively correlated with inflation, fell to 59.7 from 62.8, the lowest level since September 2011.
“This latest leg down [in the survey] surely reflects the recent spike in gasoline prices since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war,” Jefferies said in a note.
Signs of weakness in consumer, which is a key driver of economic growth, overshadowed hopes for a Ukraine-Russia agreement on a ceasefire after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly signaled positive developments in peace talks with Ukraine.
President Joe Biden continued to up the ante on Moscow, calling on lawmakers to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status, which could end normal trade with Russia, leading to higher tariffs.
Technology gains a day earlier proved short-lived as the sector resumed its selloff. Big tech as mostly in the red, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) the biggest decliners.
Meta was also pressured by concerns that user growth could slow even further after Russia restricted access to the social media giant’s Instagram platform and launched a criminal probe in the company.
The investigation was opened after the social media giant changed its policy on hate speech to allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” on its platforms.
The weakness in the broader market comes just a week ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting, which gets underway on March 15.
Ahead of the meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has backed a quarter point rate hike and said that the Fed would likely begin talks about how to reduce its balance sheet.
“Chairman Jay Powell will be walking a tightrope, balancing the needs to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown in credit markets,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.",,,,,

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank, which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.
Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow..
Deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.
""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.
""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" Deutsche said. 
A day earlier,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.
""The answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.""
Bill Browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in Russia, said that Deutsche Bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""
""I would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" Browder told Reuters earlier on Friday.
The criticism came as Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital and Britain said that Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Fabio De Masi, a former member of the Bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that Deutsche Bank had close ties to the Russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal Russian activity, had to end.
'MONITORING'
Deutsche Bank has said that it has pared down its Russian footprint in recent years. This week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". 
It also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in Russia and opened a new main office in Moscow in December, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market"".
Russia has landed Deutsche Bank in hot water in the past.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating it for years over trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the German bank being fined nearly $700 million. 
Deutsche Bank said on Friday that the DOJ probe ""is understood to be ongoing"".
The row over Russia came as Deutsche Bank disclosed in its annual report that it paid Sewing 8.8 million euros ($9.68 million) in 2021, a 20% increase from a year earlier. 

Overall, the lender paid 14% more, or 2.1 billion euros, in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.

""LSEG confirms it is suspending all products and services for all customers in Russia, subject to any regulatory requirements,"" the company said in a statement.
""We continue to support our employees in the region. We are also engaging with our customers outside Russia who depend on us for data and pricing information inside Russia. We are evaluating alternative options to continue providing these services.""
The company joins an exodus of Western firms severing ties with Russia after it was slapped with heavy sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) had already suspended access in Russia to products containing news and commentary since Wednesday this week, and had suspended all new sales of products and services.
However, at the time it did not suspend access to data products for existing customers in Russia. 
LSEG distributes news and commentary from Reuters as part of its products.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE after the exchange bought data and analytics company Refinitiv from it.
A new Russian law makes it possible to jail journalists who report any event that could discredit the Russian military.
Ukraine's central bank the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) wrote to data platform Refinitiv and rival Bloomberg last week to urge them to ban Russian and Belarussian financial institutions from accessing their platforms.

The NBU argued such a move would ""cripple their access to the international financial markets"".
Reuters declined comment. Bloomberg was not immediately available for comment.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 gave up intraday gains Friday, to remain on course for its another weekly loss amid rising concerns about the strength of the consumer in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war and expectations for the Federal Reserve to begin its tightening cycle next week.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, or 43 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.4%.
Consumer discretionary stocks led the broader market lower as investors digested data pointing to a wobble in consumer sentiment in the wake of surging inflation that ratcheted up a notch following the Russia-Ukraine war.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), and  Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY) led the losses in consumer discretionary stocks, with the latter falling by more than 9%.
The March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, which is negatively correlated with inflation, fell to 59.7 from 62.8, the lowest level since September 2011.
“This latest leg down [in the survey] surely reflects the recent spike in gasoline prices since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war,” Jefferies said in a note.
Signs of weakness in consumer, which is a key driver of economic growth, overshadowed growing hopes of a Ukraine-Russia agreement on a ceasefire after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly signaled positive developments in peace talks with Ukraine.
President Joe Biden continued to up the ante on Moscow, calling on lawmakers to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status, which could end normal trade with Russia, leading to higher tariffs.
Technology gains a day earlier proved short-lived as the sector resumed its selloff. Big tech as mostly in the red, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) the biggest decliners.
Meta was also pressured by concerns that user growth could slow even further after Russia restricted access to the social media giant’s Instagram platform and launched a criminal probe in the company.
The investigation was opened after the social media giant changed its policy on hate speech to allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” on its platforms.
The weakness in the broader market comes just a week ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting, which gets underway on March 15.
Ahead of the meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has backed a quarter point rate hike and said that the Fed would likely begin talks about how to reduce its balance sheet.
“Chairman Jay Powell will be walking a tightrope, balancing the needs to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown in credit markets,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG, Europe's top carmaker, doubled its operating profit in 2021 but warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on supply chains could hit business this year in unforeseen ways.
Carmakers are scrambling to find alternative sources of vital parts made in Ukraine, including wire harnesses, from as far afield as China and Mexico, as Russia's invasion halts assembly lines and breaks complex supply chains.
""The conflict ... has an impact on the entire global economy, on raw materials, on supply chains and therefore on our company,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) finance chief Arno Antlitz told journalists on Friday after publishing preliminary 2021 results.
""The impact of this cannot be conclusively assessed at this point in time,"" he said, adding the group was currently working on tapping other suppliers in Eastern Europe and North Africa to obtain wire harnesses.
Volkswagen said there was a risk that the latest developments in the war in Ukraine will have a negative impact on its business. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
The company still proposed to raise its annual dividend by more than half to 7.50 euros per ordinary share and 7.56 euros per preferred share for 2021, after operating profit doubled to 19.3 billion euros ($21.1 billion) last year.
The doubling of operating profit in 2021 was thanks to higher prices and a more favorable product mix, Volkswagen said, adding it expects an operating margin on sales of 7.0%-8.5% in 2022, compared with 7.7% in 2021.
Sales are forecast to rise 8%-13% in 2022, compared with a 12.3% increase to 250 billion euros in 2021.

""However, this guidance is subject to the further development of the war in Ukraine and in particular the impact on the group's supply chains and the global economy as a whole,"" the company said.

The agreement to extend the monitoring of the bank comes as the Justice Department ratchets up scrutiny of corporate misconduct and repeat offenders. 
In October, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco laid out policies that included heightened scrutiny of repeat corporate offenders. The agency has been questioning how broadly to continue deferring prosecutions in exchange for penalties and promises of compliance. 
The issue at Deutsche Bank revolves around claims by the former head of sustainability at DWS saying the investment firm overstated how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments. DWS has rejected the allegations of so-called greenwashing.
The DOJ, which had already installed a monitor at Deutsche for other issues, found that the bank violated a deferred prosecution agreement, Deutsche Bank said.
The violation was based on ""untimely reporting"" of the allegations, Deutsche said.
As a result, on Feb. 28, Deutsche agreed to extend the monitor until February 2023.
Deutsche Bank, DWS and the DOJ declined to comment.
Last year, the agency agreed with Deutsche Bank it would hold off prosecuting the bank over alleged corruption and fraud in exchange for a stiff penalty and promises to disclose any future misconduct and cooperate with any ongoing investigation.

Though agreement breaches have been historically rare, the Justice Department has issued such notices in recent months as it seeks to root out corporate misconduct. 
Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) has also recently disclosed getting a DOJ notice of a breach, underscoring the growing legal risks for corporate actors accused of repeat offenses.

(Reuters) -Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) Plc said on Friday it would exit Russia and cut its fiscal 2022 guidance as a result, the latest company to leave the country due to worries about the safety of its employees.
Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, the European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
In response, a government commission approved this week the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country.
To exit the business or stop selling or manufacturing would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia, and they may enforce criminal actions on local management, BAT (LON:BATS) Chief Executive Officer Kingsley Wheaton told Reuters in an interview. 
""There's no way, consciously, we can expose our people to criminal repercussions.""
The company employs about 2,500 people in Russia, and Wheaton said it would continue to pay their salaries until it transfers its business in the country to another entity.
He said potential parties that could be interested include its Russian distributor of 30 years, which he declined to name. 
In 2021, Ukraine and Russia accounted for 3% of revenue, and a slightly lower proportion of adjusted profit from operations.
The company represents just under a quarter of Russia's tobacco market.
The exit prompted the cigarette maker to cut its annual revenue growth outlook to 2%-4% from 3%-5% announced last month.
It now also expects mid-single figure growth for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 on a constant currency basis, down from its previous high-single figure forecast.
Shares of the company ended the day down more than 1% on the news.
The decision to exit Russia comes two days after the company said it had suspended all its planned capital investment in the country.

Stating that ""the context is highly complex, exceptionally fast-moving and volatile"" after reviewing its presence in Russia, BAT said it had started the process to rapidly transfer the Russian business ""in full compliance with international and local laws"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Eni and BP (NYSE:BP) have completed a deal to merge their oil and gas operations in Angola, the groups said on Friday, confirming what sources earlier exclusively told Reuters.
The deal will create a company called Azule Energy that is expected to be Angola’s largest producer with stakes in 16 licences and in the Angola LNG joint venture. 
Azule Energy will also take over Eni’s stake in Solenova, a solar company jointly held with Angola's Sonangol.
Earlier three sources said the two energy groups were close to raising around $2.5 billion in financing to help fund the joint venture and were also close to a separate agreement for Eni to buy stakes in Algerian gas plants. The two companies last year announced plans to combine their Angolan businesses into a self-funded company with oil and gas production of around 200,000 barrels of oil equivalentper day. The merger is part of the two companies' overhaul of their oil and gas businesses as they shift towards renewables and low-carbon energy in the coming decades. It will also help them to reduce debt. 
ALGERIAN GAS Under a separate deal, BP is close to selling to Eni its stakes in two major gas ‎developments in Algeria - In Salah Gas and In Amenas, the sources said. The value of such a deal is unclear.
One of the sources said the companies were in advanced talks. BP and Eni declined to comment on Algeria. The two sides have struggled to agree on a way to balance the value of their Angolan assets since Eni's operations and oil and gas reserves are bigger and hold a larger value than BP's, two of the sources said.

The statements issued by both companies on Friday said BP's gross assets in the deal were worth about $6.8 billion at the end of 2021, while those of Eni were worth $7.3 billion. The change of ownership at the two gas plants in the south of Algeria will help Eni develop Algeria's energy infrastructure and export gas to southern Europe via pipelines, the sources said. Italy is looking to ramp up gas imports from Algeria to help reduce its reliance on flows from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To do that Algeria needs to increase its upstream gas production. Eni, which holds long-term gas contracts with state-owned energy giant Sonatrach, has historic ties with Algeria. Last year it signed a series of accords aimed at increasing production in the country.
With one of Europe's biggest gas transport networks, Italy is seen as a future bridgehead into Europe for gas - and zero emissions hydrogen - produced in North Africa and beyond.

(Reuters) - The $100 billion Western rental car industry, flush with cash from a profitable pandemic, is gradually getting its electric show on the road, and Chinese-made vehicles are poised to play a starring role. 
The electric transition could see car fleets, long dominated by famed marques from the United States and Europe, increasingly switch towards Asian automakers, according to a European executive. 
""Historically, European and American manufacturers had an edge, but the shift towards electric is reshuffling the cards,"" said Olivier Baldassari, group chief countries and operations officer at rental giant Europcar.
He said electric cars from Chinese and Asian makers were comparable to Western models in terms of quality, citing Great Wall Motor's Ora line, but generally cost less.
Even small savings are significant in the vast rental industry, which buys millions of new cars a year - a tenth of all new cars in the United States alone - and provides a leading indicator of wider auto trends in society.
Companies in the sector have long resisted a rush to electrify because of weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs) among customers worried about being stranded out of power. 
Yet several analysts said now is the best time to start as companies have fortified their coffers with bumper profits during a pandemic that emptied public transit and airports, and led to more holidaying within driving distance.
In the United States, rental car companies received record monthly revenue of $1,320 per vehicle in 2021, according to Auto Rental News. That compares to around $1,000 pre-pandemic.
""In the past, companies have kind of stuck their head in the sand,"" said Nick Mountfield, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, which advises rental car companies, said about electrification. ""We're now starting to see people say that they'll have to do something about and put in place plans.""

WATCH YOUR SPEED
Hertz was an early mover last October when it announced the planned purchase of 100,000 vehicles from U.S. trailblazer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), upping the pressure on rivals to spell out transition plans.
French-based Europcar, meanwhile, pledged to make 20% of its fleet electric or low-emission hybrid by 2024, from 3% now, which means it will need to buy up to 70,000 cleaner vehicles in the coming two years if it restocks its fleet to the 350,000 vehicles it owned pre-pandemic. 
Rental companies sold off their fleets as demand plummeted at the start of the pandemic and have struggled to regain volumes amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has hampered vehicle production. 
Baldassari said Europcar was increasingly sourcing EVs from Great Wall Motors, SAIC Motor and Polestar, which is owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, though it was also buying from traditional partners, including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Stellantis. 
The company's China strategy might shift, however, if German carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) manages to close its offer to buy the company in the second quarter.
Industry players are running at different speeds, with each making their own calculations based on their markets. 
In the United States, where many customers prefer SUV and pickup models that have yet to be electrified and public charging infrastructure lags much of Asia and Europe, Enterprise Holdings is striking a more cautious tone.
Electrifying just a quarter of Enterprise's fleet at Orlando airport - its largest consumer rental location - would require the same amount of daily electricity as is needed to power more than 1,000 homes, said Enterprise's assistant vice president of innovation, Chris Haffenreffer.
Haffenreffer said the group currently had several thousand EVs in North America, including from Tesla, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Hyundai, Kia and Polestar. While the company said it has conversations with all global automakers, it has no immediate plans to boost that share. 
""At a high level, we want to let our consumers guide us in terms of what they're looking for,"" he added. ""Many car rental companies have historically taken that wait-and-see approach because we are still in the early phases of the transition."" 
Graphic on U.S. industry vehicle purchases: https://tmsnrt.rs/3gXAVnj
FOOTHOLD IN THE WEST
The varied pace of change, and the timeline for vast fleet overhauls means gasoline-powered vehicles are expected to remain the bulk of purchases for some years to come. Global automakers' transition plans as a whole would see electric vehicles make up at least 40% of their sales by 2040. 
Yet eventually the shift could prove far-reaching for the fortunes of Chinese in carmakers in Europe, a crowded, competitive auto market dominated by storied brands that has proved elusive for them to crack in the past. 
In years gone by, they have contended with a perception that China, associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Yet such arguments are challenged in a new reality that sees top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla now produce cars in the country, which is a technology powerhouse and the world's biggest auto market. 

Great Wall Motor, one of Europcar's suppliers, is expected to launch its Ora Cat compact electric car in Europe this year priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,260) with a range of around 250 miles (400 km), joining a growing number of Chinese EV makers trying their luck on the continent.
Chinese manufacturers using the rental channel to establish brand awareness and increase sales volumes would follow a playbook Kia and Hyundai used in the 1990s to gain a foothold in Western markets, said Mountfield at OC&C Strategy.

Investing.com – Deere stock (NYSE:DE) rose 2.6% on Friday after Wells Fargo initiated coverage with an ""overweight"" and a $455 target, an upside of more than 17% from the current level of $388.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -European Union and British antitrust authorities launched parallel investigations on Friday into a 2018 online display advertising deal between Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding to a long list of regulatory challenges facing the U.S. tech giants.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook, whose parent company is now called Meta, defended the ""Jedi Blue"" deal, which the EU said may thwart ad tech rivals and disadvantage publishers in online display advertising.
So-called header bidding allows publishers, such as news providers, to offer ad space to multiple ad exchanges and networks simultaneously, potentially generating more ad revenue.
The Jedi Blue agreement enables Meta via its Meta Audience Network, to participate in Google's Open Bidding programme, which is a rival to header bidding.
""A competing technology to Google's Open Bidding may have been targeted with the aim to weaken it and exclude it from the market for displaying ads on publisher websites and apps,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
While one angle of the EU investigation focuses on the deal, another looks at whether Google abuses its dominance which could mean that Facebook is off the hook if this is found to be the case.
""This is a publicly documented, pro-competitive agreement that enables Facebook Audience Network (FAN) to participate in our Open Bidding program, along with dozens of other companies,"" Google said in response to the investigations.
""Meta's non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements,"" Meta said in a statement.
Google, which has already been hit by more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the past decade, and Facebook are both being investigated by the bloc's executive over other issues and could face fines as much as 10% of their global turnover for breaching its rules.
Britain's antitrust authority is also investigating the deal and the EU competition watchdog said it intends to cooperate closely with its British counterpart.

Texas and 15 other U.S. states alleged in an antitrust complaint against Google that the deal with Facebook was struck as part of its effort to counter header bidding, which publishers wanted to use to make more money from advertising on their websites.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are warming to approving new domestic sources of electric vehicle battery metals, as Washington bids to avoid a reliance on strategic minerals imports similar to that on crude oil.
U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and other officials speaking at this week's CERAWeek energy conference in Houston said the need to domestically produce more metals is rising as EVs go mainstream, but that new mines must not harm the environment. 
Granholm told conference attendees she would work to streamline permitting for new sources of EV minerals, eliciting loud applause. 
""It takes forever to get a new permit. How crazy is that?"" said Granholm.
Granholm's department has already received applications for $2 billion in loans to fund U.S. strategic minerals projects from Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, ioneer, Piedmont Lithium Inc and others. 
The department is also proactively contacting junior miners to discuss potential loans.
""The goal here is to make sure that people know that it's not a lack of capital that's holding back the development of these assets in the United States,"" said Jigar Shah, head of the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office. ""
While the loan office is reviewing loan applications from some lithium projects that have faced opposition, funds will not be distributed to proposed mines that have not passed full regulatory review.
""We know that there will be some domestic mining,"" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Michael Regan said on the sidelines of the conference. ""But it can't take place in the ways that it has in the past, which skirted some of the environmental laws and disproportionately impact communities of color and tribal communities.""

To be sure, President Joe Biden's administration is not moving carte blanche to approve all mines. Last month, for instance, it effectively killed  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's Twin Metals copper project in Minnesota due to concerns the mine would harm an important watershed.
But mining executives said comments from Regan, Granholm and others show the White House is beginning to view mining with a more-nuanced lens and understand its role in a clean energy transition.

Shareholders approved various measures, such as charter amendments and a share issuance proposal, related to the transaction. They also supported golden parachute payments to executives, in case the transaction fails to close. 
The outcome was all but assured, as two of Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA)'s major investors, John C. Malone and Advance/Newhouse, agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. They together represent 43% of Discovery's voting shares.
In May, AT&T (NYSE:T) announced it would spin-off WarnerMedia, whose assets include HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros studio, and merge it with Discovery. The combination would create one of the world's largest media companies with a breadth of well-known film franchises and television series, including Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, ""Succession"" and the reality-series ""90 Day Fiance"" and ""Property Brothers."" 

The transaction has cleared regulatory reviews by the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. Earlier this week, AT&T and Discovery secured funding for the deal through a $30 billion bond offering. 
The merger is expected to close as soon as April, with Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav leading the new Warner Brothers Discovery.

AT&T is merging its media business with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) in a $43 billion deal. The new combined entity is projected to have approximately $52 billion in revenue by 2023 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of around $14 billion.
AT&T said it will focus on building out its 5G and fiber network. It said the $48 billion capex will be split equally over two years and will taper to the $20 billion range starting 2024.
The company wants to raise fiber internet availability to 30 million homes in the U.S. and expand its 5G network to cover over 200 million people.
By 2025, AT&T expects that 75% of its network will be served by fiber and 5G and that it will have reduced its copper services footprint by 50%.
The company expects to reach $6 billion in run-rate cost savings by end-2023.
AT&T reiterated its annual revenue will grow in low single-digit in the current financial year. Adjusted profit per share is seen at $2.44 at midpoint of its guidance range.

(Reuters) -AT&T Inc expects to invest about $48 billion through the end of 2023 to expand its fiber internet and 5G wireless services, the U.S. wireless carrier said on Friday, as it detailed the vision for the business after unwinding its media assets.
After facing skepticism from shareholders over its expensive quest to become a media and entertainment company, AT&T (NYSE:T) is working to merge its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc in a deal that is expected to close in the second quarter. The company plans to refocus on its core business of offering internet and phone services.
""Now that the close of the WarnerMedia deal is approaching, we are near the starting line of a new era for AT&T,"" said AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey, in a press release ahead of a presentation to analysts on Friday.
Shares of AT&T rose over 3% to $24.09 in pre-market trading.
AT&T said it expects annual capital investment to be in the $24 billion range both this year and in 2023. It will then taper to the $20 billion range beginning in 2024. 
The company is working to double its fiber internet availability to 30 million homes in the United States and expand its 5G network to cover over 200 million people.
AT&T on Friday also provided full-year financial guidance that excludes the WarnerMedia business and advertising unit Xandr, which AT&T agreed to sell to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in December.
The company said it expects low single-digit percentage growth for total revenue in 2022, unchanged from its previous outlook.
It also provided an outlook for 2023 for the first time, with continued low single-digit percentage revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share between $2.50 to $2.60. 

After closing the WarnerMedia and Discovery deal, the company expects to pay just over $8 billion in annual total dividends, AT&T said. 
Free cash flow for the standalone AT&T is expected to be in the $16 billion range this year and in the $20 billion range in 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz has 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in assets that could be threatened by Russian proposals to nationalise the property of foreign firms that leave because of its invasion of Ukraine, the German premium carmaker said.
The company said in its annual report released on Friday that the war in Ukraine raised a range of risks from disruptions to parts to energy supply or even cyber attacks.
""These risks could be exacerbated by the potential expropriation of assets of Russian subsidiaries,"" Mercedes-Benz said.
Russia's ruling party, United Russia, said this week a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising the assets of firms more than 25% owned by foreigners from ""unfriendly states.""
Mercedes-Benz has a car plant in the town of Esipovo 40 km (25 miles) northwest of Moscow with over 1,000 employees that produces E-class sedans and SUVs.
It was opened in April 2019 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance. It was the first plant in years to be opened by a foreign carmaker in Russia, where investment into the formerly burgeoning auto industry had dried up amid western sanctions and a stagnant economy.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Putin said the plant would produce 25,000 cars a year and that investment in the project had totaled just under $300 million.

Mercedes-Benz said its Russian units, which were valued at 2 billion euros as of the end of 2021, have liabilities to banks of approximately 1 billion euros, for which the carmaker has issued a global guarantee.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS aims to cut its financing of fossil fuel emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, Switzerland's biggest bank said on Friday, joining lenders setting targets for the first time this year.
More than 100 banks have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and are under pressure to provide details on the deep shorter-term cuts needed if they are to have any chance of meeting their goal.
UBS unveiled plans on Friday to cut its loan book financing of emissions caused by the oil and gas sector by 71% through 2030 from a baseline of 3.781 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020. That amounted to a steeper cut than those announced by competitors, but off a comparatively smaller lending book.
The bank said its target was for a reduction in absolute emissions, as opposed to the more flexible 'carbon intensity' metrics used by some rivals, which links emissions to the quantity of oil or gas produced.
Swiss rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Thursday it planned to cut its exposure to ""financed emissions"" in the oil, gas and coal sector by 49% through 2030 from a baseline of 37.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020.
UBS' plan does not include coal, which it said was a marginal area for the bank.
HSBC in February outlined aims to cut emissions associated with loans to oil and gas clients by 34% this decade, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in January vowed to reduce its energy-sector emissions by 29% over the same period.
Other lenders, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Natwest and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), have also set goals.

UBS' lending volume to fossil fuels dipped to $0.7 billion in 2021, it said on Friday. Its overall lending exposure to carbon-related assets was $45.6 billion, or 9.9% of its total customer lending.
UBS also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of its lending to power generation firms and to residential and commercial real estate lending. Together with fossil fuels, these accounted for a sizeable share of the emissions it financed, UBS said, making these priority sectors.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)'s board meets on Sunday to give its long-delayed response to a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) takeover approach from U.S. fund KKR amid mounting pressure to enter talks after an in-house turnaround plan failed to convince investors.
KKR made the non-binding offer last November to take the former phone monopoly private at a price of 0.505 euro per share. Telecom Italia (TIM) shares are now trading at 0.30 euro, after touching a record low of 0.22 euro on Monday.
The choice facing TIM appears simple enough - agree to talks with the U.S. private equity fund or reject its approach.
However, a compromise is also possible whereby TIM, whose leading shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) sees the approach as undervalued, seeks to enter talks on deepening existing cooperation with KKR while remaining independent.
KKR has been left on hold for more than three months as debt-laden TIM, in which state lender CDP is also a major investor, has been caught in its latest boardroom crisis.
New chief Pietro Labriola, a veteran TIM executive, last week revealed his own standalone plan aimed at unlocking value by separating TIM's wholesale operations from its service arm to pursue with M&A deals.
Backed by Vivendi, Labriola said KKR's intentions for TIM were broadly similar but he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors.
COMPROMISE POSSIBLE?
Labriola's strategy received unanimous support from the board of directors but some independent members representing institutional investors are wary of dismissing KKR out of hand.
Some minority investors are also pressing the company to engage with KKR. The fund is seeking the backing of the company and the government, as well as a four-week due diligence process before it formalises a bid.
KKR is already involved with TIM, having paid 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in its secondary network. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and LionTree, advisers for the TIM board of directors, are due to complete a review of KKR's proposal weighed against TIM's in-house overhaul by the weekend.

Labriola's plan would facilitate a long-mooted merger of TIM's fixed assets network with those of fibre optic rival Open Fiber, a move advocated by CDP which owns a 10% stake in TIM and controls Open Fiber.
Under such a scenario, TIM's investors could see an upside of 1 euro a share versus the current set up, two sources familiar with the matter said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish oil operator Meroil has no plans to sell its 50% stake in a joint venture with Russia's Lukoil in a Barcelona oil terminal due to the conflict in Ukraine, a top executive told Reuters on Friday.
Meroil is confident its 10-year-old project will not be affected by any potential new sanctions against Moscow and is not concerned about any reputational damage, Director General Miguel Paya said, arguing that the tie-up with Lukoil was very limited and the terminal did not receive Russian oil or ships.
Many Western companies have broken business ties with Russian firms or shunned their products or wound up Russian operations following the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shell (LON:RDSa), the world's largest petroleum trader, and Italy's Eni are among energy groups which have suspended the purchase of oil from Russia, while British oil major BP (NYSE:BP) exited its 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft.
Lukoil, Russia's second-largest oil producer, said earlier this month it was concerned by the ""tragic events in Ukraine"" and supported the negotiations to end the conflict.
The Meroil-Lukoil deal was sealed in 2010 and the Barcelona terminal - with a storage capacity of 360,000 cubic meters of refined oil and with a concession until 2047 - opened in 2012. 
""Everything remains the same ... they are calm. They continue working and so do we,"" Paya said referring to Litasco, Lukoil's Swiss trading arm that holds a 50% stake in the Barcelona plant.
He said his understanding is that any potential sanctions against Lukoil would not affect their JV, but conceded the situation was unpredictable. 
""There is not much we can do about it,"" he said, adding Meroil had no say over Lukoil's stake.

The joint venture company, named Meroil Tank, reported a 1.5 million euro ($1.64 million) net profit in 2020, according to the latest public records.

Investing.com – Zumiez (NASDAQ:ZUMZ) stock plunged 13% Friday after the company projected its current quarter sales to erode by more than a fifth from a year ago.
It also missed estimates for both sales and earnings in the fourth quarter ended January 29. The company is blaming last year’s stimulus that produced record annual sales for its lackluster forecast, saying sales will be “down meaningfully to the prior year.”
Net sales for the first quarter are seen between $215 million and $221 million, down by around 21% at the top end. At the pessimistic end, they could fall by as much as 23%, coming in after a record 2021.
Evidence of the sales weakening is already visible, according to the company. Total first quarter-to-date sales for the 35 days ended March 5 fell about 2%.
The company warned that fixed costs could come to hurt it as sales reduce. Expenses like store wages and travel expenses, all of which it was able to avoid during the pandemic, could return to weigh on earnings, it said.
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter are expected to be break-even to positive 10 cents per diluted share.
Zumiez said it will open around 34 new stores in the current financial year as it seeks to attract more young women and men to its apparel, footwear, and hard goods.
Sales in the fourth quarter were up a mere 4.6% to around $347 million. Quarterly profit on per share basis rose by 2 cents to $1.7.
The company closed the year with lower cash and current marketable securities, using the money for share repurchases and capital expenditures."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Atlantia expects its core profit to rise by 27% by 2024, it said on Friday, as traffic on motorways and in airports it operates recovers and the infrastructure group expands into adjacent sectors.
Unveiling a new multi-year strategy, the conglomerate controlled by Italy's powerful Benetton family set a 2024 profit goal of 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion), a figure matching the investments it expects to deploy over the same period. 
Atlantia, preparing to draw a line under a lengthy legal dispute with Italy's government following the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge it operated, projected a 20% rise in revenue to around 7.7 billion euros in 2024 from 6.4 billion in 2021.

""We want to continue to allocate our capital mainly in our core assets – motorways through [Spanish unit] Abertis, airports and railways,"" he added. 
Bertazzo told analysts Atlantia was ready to provide financial support to Abertis to help it clinch a sizeable transaction in the ""brownfield"" toll-road business - meaning toll roads that are already built and don't need development.
Abertis CEO Francisco Aljaro Navarro told the same presentation the Spanish group was reviewing opportunities in countries where it operated and would only select geographies with a ""robust"" regulatory framework.
Atlantia CEO Bertazzo said it was also important for the group to ""enlarge and diversify"" its portfolio of assets away from its core business.
He indicated Atlantia may be ready to part ways in the future with its 16% stake in German builder Hochtief, which Bertazzo said was not strategic.
The group by June will complete the sale of its domestic motorway subsidiary which was in charge of the bridge that collapsed in 2018.
It has already started using some of the 8 billion euros-plus in proceeds as it adapts its business model to more sustainable and technologically advanced mobility. 
In January it agreed to buy smart mobility company Yunex Traffic for 950 million euros.
""We see business opportunities in e-mobility, energy transition, smart parking, vehicles-to-grid, rail intermodality, all markets that are expected to grow fast by 2030,"" Bertazzo said.
Atlantia is also returning cash to shareholders. It will pay out 900 million euros in dividends this year, two thirds relating to 2021 results and the rest as an interim dividend on 2022 earnings. It also plans a share buyback of up to 2 billion euros.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine's two leading suppliers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted their operations as Moscow has sharpened its attack on the country, threatening to raise prices and aggravate the semiconductor shortage.
Some 45% to 54% of the world's semiconductor-grade neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, comes from two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the companies and market research firm Techcet. Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates. 
Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.
The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.
While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.
""If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don't have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,"" he said. 
Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters. 
The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.
""Civilians are suffering,"" Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access. 
Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the invasion began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.
Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly. 
She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for purifying neon.
The Economy Ministry of Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker TSMC, said that Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had ""safety stocks"" of neon, so it did not see any supply chain problems in the near term. The statement to Reuters echoed similar remarks from Taiwan's central bank earlier on Friday.
But smaller chipmakers may be harder hit, according to Lita Shon-Roy, president of Techcet.
""The largest chip fabricators, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (KS:005930) and TSMC, have greater buying power and access to inventories that may cover them for longer periods of time, two months or more,"" she said. ""However, many other chip fabs do not have this kind of buffer,"" she added, noting that rumors of companies trying to build up inventory have begun to circulate. ""This will compound the issue of supply availability.”
Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily.
Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan/cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan/cubic meter in late February. 
Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.

Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors.
But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary.

Investing.com -- Electric vehicle charging firm Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK) shares are down Friday after the company reported lower than expected earnings per share after the close Thursday evening.
The company, which provides Level 2 EV charging stations and networks for homes and businesses, reported a loss per share of 45 cents, below consensus expectations of a 39 cents loss per share. The number also widened from the 24 cents loss per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Blink shares have fallen over 9% Friday off the back of the earnings miss, putting its share price down around 10% for the year-to-date.
Q4 revenue, however, beat expectations, coming in at $7.95 million, above the $6.9 million anticipated. This was a record for the company, up 224% over the prior-year period and increasing 24% sequentially compared to Q3 2021. In addition, Q4 service revenues increased 471% year-over-year.
2021 revenue grew 236% to $20.9 million compared to 2020 revenue of $6.2 million.
When it comes to charging stations specifically, the company contracted or sold 3,733 in Q4, an increase of 253%.
The company put its robust revenue growth down to strong product sales and service revenues after solid momentum throughout the year.
""As we move through 2022, we are excited about the opportunities we’re seeing to bring our industry-leading charging technology to a broader audience, both in the U.S. and internationally,"" stated Michael Farkas, Blink’s Chairman and CEO.",

(Reuters) - The world's biggest eyewear company EssilorLuxottica reported strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, rising further above pre-pandemic levels and boosted by its performance in the United States and its GrandVision acquisition.
Shares in EssilorLuxottica, which owns the Oakley and Ray-Ban sunglass brands and makes sunglasses and spectacle frames for labels including Chanel and Prada (OTC:PRDSY), were up 2.3% after the quarterly results, which slightly beat analysts' forecasts.
The company said fourth-quarter revenue came to 5.58 billion euros ($6.14 billion), including GrandVision, up around 32% from a year earlier and up nearly 35% from the 2019 pre-pandemic level at constant exchange rates. 
Excluding the GrandVision acquisition, fourth-quarter revenue rose 11% from the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic. 
The group acquired over 76% of the Dutch eyewear retailer in July and completed the purchase of remaining shares in January. GrandVision added more stores to the group's retail business, which now generates half of EssilorLuxottica's sales.
Fourth-quarter revenue beat analysts' consensus expectations by 1%, according to RBC.
The company has seen a sharp rebound in sales since last summer, particularly in North America as economies reopened after restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Its shares have risen nearly 8% in the past year. 
EssilorLuxottica said it targeted an adjusted operating profit of between 19% and 20% of revenue by 2026, up from 17% in 2021. 
On Thursday, EssilorLuxottica said in a post on its LinkedIn page that it was temporarily restricting operations in Russia, where it has around 1,000 employees and a network of around 100 Lensmaster stores, citing uncertainties and significant disruptions.
A wave of Western companies have put their business activities in Russia on hold either due to stringent sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine or to show their opposition to the war in Ukraine.
""At this difficult time, the safety of our people remains our priority and we are providing all the support possible to our affected teams in the region,"" Chief Executive Francesco Milleri and his deputy, Paul du Saillant, said in the earnings statement. 
Russia and Ukraine account for less than 200 million euros or 1% of group revenue, executives said in a call with analysts Tuesday.

Overall, business has started out well in 2022, executives said, noting they hadn't seen an impact of inflation on sales or a spillover from the conflict in Ukraine into other regions.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Largely ignored by the growing ranks of Europe's socially minded investors, defence firms see a fresh chance to argue for a place in portfolios after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One asset manager announced last week that it would re-allow investment in defence, a sign that cracks are emerging in widespread opposition to owning defence firms from sustainable investors in Europe. 
Analysts expect more to follow. But for many with a sustainable tilt - defined by some as investing in companies that aim to have a positive impact on the world - it will prove a tough ask.
Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Thales and Airbus have joined a chorus of companies over the last two weeks calling for investors to treat the sector more favourably, arguing security and stability are key to sustainability.
That comes after a year of the industry lobbying European authorities not to exclude defence from an upcoming framework or ""taxonomy"" on socially good investments. 
It also follows years in which investors across Europe have avoided the sector in favour of firms with stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) profiles, hurting defence shares and raising financing costs.
Most of the funds focused on sustainability that Reuters has spoken to remain cold on defence. But some are eyeing the returns on offer from the region's push to raise security spending.
Sweden's SEB Investment Management announced last week it had overturned a blanket ban on any company deriving more than 5% of its revenue from defence for six of its funds, although the majority of its product range is unchanged, including sustainable funds.
SEB attributed the change to pressure from customers for exposure to defence as Russian troops amassed on the Ukraine border, underlining that fund houses must answer to clients as well as their own sustainability promises.
""We are seeing evidence that a number of large European asset managers are re-evaluating the sector,"" said Luke Sussams, head of ESG in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for investment bank Jefferies. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a real wake-up call for ESG investors in general.""
Yet others say the sudden redrawing of Europe's security architecture does not mean makers of fighters, missiles and tanks are suddenly sustainable.
""Sustainable investments must fulfil the criterion ""Do no significant harm"" – this is not the case with armaments,"" said Henrik Pontzen, head of ESG at Union Investment. It is sticking to excluding from its sustainable funds any company that earns more than 5% of revenue from arms.
Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish pension fund PFA, said investors were wrong if they believed they could ensure that any investment in defence went solely towards defending borders.
""What are we going to include tomorrow? Let's include chemical companies that are polluting certain parts of the world, but not the rest. Come on, it's ridiculous,"" he told Reuters.
While funds with a specific sustainable or ethical mandate may find it hard to change tack, others with a looser requirement to ""integrate ESG risks"" have more flexibility.
Sustainable managers typically avoid businesses that earn 5%-plus of revenue from defence, while the vast majority of risk-focused funds just ban those involved with unconventional weapons such as cluster munitions.
UBS analysts noted that rather than outright exclusions some ESG managers prefer engagement. 
According to Morningstar, sustainable funds have a 0.2% weighting to aerospace and defence against the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF's 1.1%. In Europe the underweighting is starker -- 0.2% against 1.6%.
SOCIALLY GOOD OR BAD?
Still, defence lobbyists believe they are now winning the argument, especially after a strong indication that Europe's drive to help funnel investment to socially and environmentally friendly activities would not exclude their industry. 
A report prepared for the European Commission on its 'Social Taxonomy' last month omitted an earlier reference of defence as socially harmful. Lobbyists had feared it would lead to widespread fund exclusions.
With Germany, Sweden and others announcing bigger defence spending since the war in Ukraine, analysts have rushed to upgrade forecasts and share prices have soared.
Calling ESG concerns ""spurious and morally weak"", Agency Partners said in a note that the EU taxonomy debate had clouded the investability and valuations of defence stocks. 
And French warplane manufacturer Dassault Aviation hit out at a ""schizophrenic"" situation that saw European defence spending rising only for U.S. rivals to benefit, because European suppliers were being harmed by the EU taxonomy drive.
""Taxonomy is not an effective weapon against current threats,"" CEO Eric Trappier, who also represents the French defence industry, told reporters. ""It is a weapon used against us, the defence industry, and the proof is that... its small suppliers are starting to have problems with their banks."" 
FIGHTBACK
The defence industry's fight is far from over, however. 
Including defence in the EU social's taxonomy would ""fly in the face of the 'Do No Significant Harm principle'"", said Hortense Bioy, sustainable research director at Morningstar.
European technical advisers are also backing a 5% revenue threshold to exclude defence companies from the bloc's planned 'EU Ecolabel', which is designed to help consumers identify more environmentally friendly and socially good products.
A spokesperson said the Commission would ""carefully reflect on all the implications of those exclusions for defence-related activities"", but stressed no final decision had been made. 
For a fragmented industry that can struggle to compete against rivals in the United States where ESG concerns are less commonplace, winning hearts and minds of investors is crucial.

""Even if some banks and investors are coming back to defence, it doesn't mean they all are,"" said Jan Pie, secretary general of European defence industry lobby ASD, arguing that longer term, defence needed more reliable financial backers.
""It shouldn't be public opinion that decides whether to finance the defence industry.""

(Reuters) - Japanese brands Uniqlo and  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) made U-turns and said they were stopping business in Russia, joining the corporate crowd shunning Moscow on Thursday, and Britain escalated sanctions against oligarchs including Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the first U.S. bank to quit Russia, and global grain trader  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) said it had suspended new export business from Russia, although it is still crushing oil seeds for the domestic market..
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country would emerge stronger and more independent from Western sanctions, which he said were inevitable. The corporate condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading, but Putin, who calls the war a special military operation, said he had no choice.
The fallout is also broadening among Putin's personal allies, as Abramovich and six others including Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian energy giant Rosneft, became the highest-profile oligarchs sanctioned by Britain since the invasion.
The action effectively puts Chelsea under UK government control, halting any disposal, and stopping new ticket or merchandise sales.
Britain's move came as the first major mining company, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland.
Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Nintendo suspended deliveries of their gaming consoles; Sony's music businesses and Warner Music Group also stopped business in Russia.
HOTELIERS STEP BACK
Major fast-food, drinks and consumer goods companies, led by McDonalds and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), have stepped back from Russia following pressure from customers in the West.
Hotelier Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) closed its Moscow office and joined Hilton and Hyatt in suspending developments.
The exodus by Japanese companies picked up steam, with many describing the decisions in practical terms.
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life,"" but on Thursday the company said it could not continue business in Russia because of ""a number of difficulties."" 
Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market, said its subsidiary would stop investment, marketing and a launch of a heated tobacco product.
Japan's Shiseido suspended exports of its cosmetics to Russia from Europe as well as advertising and promotions, and Mitsubishi Electric (OTC:MIELY) said it would stop exports to Russia, where operations were in a ""difficult situation"".
Japanese construction machinery supplier Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) said it would stop exports and cease most operations in Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar exits by American industrial companies  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), 3M Co, Deere (NYSE:DE) and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON).
""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a spokesperson for Hitachi said, echoing a statement from Caterpillar. 
While some companies such as Ford and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, others including Japanese automaker Toyota have taken a more neutral stance, blaming a halt in production in Russia on logistical hurdles.
Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) flagged a roughly $900 million Russian credit exposure, including lending to wealthy clients, following disclosures from Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Suzuki's Hungarian factory suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine, about 10,000 vehicles a year, in one of the first signs of the conflict hitting the broader economy in the region.
Sweeping Western sanctions have isolated Russia, while shippers have suspended routes and European Union leaders plan to phase out buying Russian energy in a bid to be less dependent on the country.
The war, which entered its third week on Thursday, has killed thousands of people and rendered more than two million refugees.
It has decimated the Russian rouble, roiled stock markets and prices of oil and other commodities have skyrocketed, adding to global inflation that was surging even before the conflict began.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube and Google Play store are suspending all payment-based services in Russia, including subscriptions, as sanctions start to pose banking challenges.
They had earlier stopped selling online ads in Russia.
PAY IN ROUBLES
Russia plans to order local airlines to pay for leased aircraft in roubles and bar them from returning planes to foreign companies if the latter cancel the lease, according to a draft law published on Thursday.
Lessor BOC Aviation said it had 18 planes worth $935 million leased to Russian airlines that could be affected by the sanctions and insurance policy cancellations.
Moscow, which calls the war a ""special military operation,"" has warned it might nationalise idled foreign assets in retaliation against Western sanctions.

Rio Tinto, which owns an 80% stake in a joint venture with Russian aluminium producer Rusal, said it was ""in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business."" 
Italian energy group Eni suspended the purchase of oil from Russia and said it was watching developments closely with regards to gas procurement.

ROME (Reuters) - Generali (MI:GASI)'s second-biggest investor, construction tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, plans to put forward his own candidate to lead Italy's biggest insurer, challenging the reappointment of chief executive Philippe Donnet.
Caltagirone and fellow billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, Generali's third-largest investor, are battling its single biggest shareholder, Italian investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), over control of the insurance group.
In the complex world of Italian business, the Generali power struggle is also likely to have implications for the Milanese merchant bank, which once sat at the heart of corporate Italy. 
Del Vecchio, the founder of global eyewear giant Luxottica, is also the main shareholder in Mediobanca, in which Caltagirone too has built a stake.
The two sides in the Generali battle will face off at the end of April when its shareholders are due to meet to elect a new board of directors.
Caltagirone said in a statement on Thursday that he would present a slate of nominees for Generali's board which would include candidates for both chief executive and chairman.
Generali shares were 1.49% higher on Friday, rising alongside other insurers, the while FTSE Mib index was up 0.5%.
Generali's outgoing board has proposed current CEO Donnet for a third term, a decision which was opposed by Caltagirone and a representative for Del Vecchio.
Both Caltagirone and Del Vecchio's representative have since stepped down from the board. 
The two had struck a shareholder pact in September over a combined 16% stake, but Caltagirone quit the accord in January to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny. 
Following a request by Generali, Italian market and insurance authorities are looking into whether the two should have sought a prior authorisation, something which could result into their voting rights being capped at 10% in April.
Caltagirone is expected to reveal in the coming days the names of his candidates. He is also due to present an alternative strategy to the one Donnet put forward in December, a person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that consultants Bain had been hired for the project.
Caltagirone has so far held his cards close to his chest, with analysts saying he had to find a CEO candidate of high standing, but that person risked ending up without a job.

Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna could be a candidate for the role of chairman in Caltagirone's list, a person close to the matter said.
Generali has put forward current Borsa Italiana Chairman Andrea Sironi for the role of chairman under the list the board could finalise on Monday when it meets to approve full-year results.

Prices of lithium and nickel, key materials used in batteries that power electric vehicles, have skyrocketed due to the Western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
That, in turn, has added to supply-chain disruptions, which have plagued the industry since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Rivian expects these challenges to extend through 2022. 
""The recent spike in core raw materials raises serious issues with (battery electric vehicle) economics,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said, while highlighting the 130% rise in nickel prices and a 16% to 88% rise in prices of cobalt, lithium and aluminum this year.
Rivian shares have nearly halved in value since their blockbuster initial public offering in November. They opened at $38.32 on Friday and hit a fresh low of $38.

At least six brokerages, including Piper Sandler, trimmed their price targets on the stock. Piper, which has an ""overweight"" rating, however, said supply-chain constraints are temporary and might not be a big enough reason to sell the stock.
Rivian Chief Executive Officer R.J. Scaringe said the company was developing a portfolio of battery solutions, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, to hedge against soaring nickel prices.

(Reuters) - AIA Group (OTC:AAGIY) Ltd on Friday launched a $10 billion share buyback plan and declared a higher final dividend on strong growth in 2021, but warned of near-term pain from a recent outbreak of coronavirus infections in Hong Kong.
The Asia-focussed insurer's value of new business or VONB, which measures expected profit from new premiums and is a key gauge for future growth, rose to $3.37 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, from $2.77 billion a year earlier.
China and Hong Kong accounted for about half of new business growth globally. Mainland China business was the top contributor to VONB, logging a 14% growth, while its Hong Kong business jumped 37%, indicating strong recovery from the pandemic-lows.
Better operating conditions for the Hong Kong-based insurer, which relies on its army of agents, prompted it to announce the buyback plan spread over the next three years. 
""The share buyback represents capital accumulated over time that is surplus to our needs, allowing for capital market stress conditions and retention of capital for strategic and financial flexibility,"" Group Chief Executive Officer Lee Yuan Siong said.
However, the company warned that the recent outbreak of the Omicron variant, especially in Hong Kong, is affecting its new business sales, particularly in the first quarter.

Over the past few weeks, Hong Kong has seen some of the most draconian curbs in place to combat a record surge in coronavirus cases and deaths. China has also seen a rise of locally transmitted coronavirus infections recently.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, having absorbed the twin disappointment of unsuccessful Ukrainian peace talks and U.S. inflation hitting its highest in over 40 years on Thursday.
By 9:50 AM ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 338 points, or 1.0% at 33,512 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up more modestly, by 0.6% and 0.5% respectively.  All three indices are on course for their fourth weekly loss in five, under pressure from the rising interest rate environment and the war in Ukraine. 
Fresh talk of the possibility of summit meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents has been offset by news that Russia has broadened its air campaign against Ukrainian cities, and also split up the huge armored convoy that has been threatening Ukraine's capital Kyiv for the last week. Analysts say that could be the prelude to an assault on the city, similar to what has been witnessed in Kharkiv and Mariupol. Russian President Vladimir Putin also said on state TV Friday that he will deploy 'volunteers' from Syria to bolster his forces in Ukraine, which have only captured one major city in two weeks of fighting. 
The market's attention is drifting back to next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The February inflation report, which showed a broad rise in 'sticky' prices such as rent and services as well as more volatile elements such as food and energy, has given no room for speculation that the Fed will soft-pedal on tightening monetary policy. Even the European Central Bank, which has run an unabashedly dovish policy for most of the last decade, sent a clear signal at its policy meeting on Thursday that it considers inflation to be the greater threat - despite the fact that the war is likely to hit the Eurozone economy much harder than the U.S. one. 
The impact of the highest inflation in a generation is already being seen. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment index for March fell to its lowest since 2011, the reading of 59.7 being comfortably below the 61.4 expected. Expectations of inflation for the next 12 months rose to 5.4% from 4.9% but longer-term expectations stayed unchanged at 3.0%, suggesting that many consumers are still inclined to see the current conditions as transitory.
Individual stocks standing out included DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), which slumped another 20% after issuing a much-reduced growth forecast, emphatically signalling that the boom in demand from pandemic-related behavioral changes is over. DocuSign stock is now down 75% from its peak and has, like many other growth stocks, unwound all its gains since March 2020. 
 Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock also fell 7.3% to a new all-time low after the EV maker nearly halved its production forecast for 2022 owing to supply chain difficulties. The company also posted a thumping $2.46 billion loss in the fourth quarter, caused in part by accounting effects from its IPO.
Elsewhere, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock fell 0.1% and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 2.7% after EU and U.K. regulators launched a formal probe into suspected price-fixing in the digital advertising market by the owners of Google and Facebook. Meta's underperformance was also partly driven by fears that its policy on the Ukraine war could come back to haunt it. News reports suggest that the company is suspending its usual policy of a ban on calls for violence in order to allow a voice to those defending Ukraine. ",,,,,
387,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government wants to set up a new backstop allowing the provision of state-guaranteed cash should one of the country's big banks fail, it said on Friday, as it seeks to bolster major lenders' crisis resilience and limit the risk of economic turmoil from any banking failure.
Switzerland, like other countries, has adopted ""too big to fail"" (TBTF) rules since the Global Financial Crisis to ensure major banks hold enough capital and liquidity to absorb shocks, with new adjustments set to take effect in July.
Solving the TBTF problem has been a priority for U.S. and European regulators after several banks, including Switzerland's biggest bank UBS, were bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis.
But the Swiss government cautioned on Friday that scenarios remained conceivable in which a major bank would face difficulties in resolving in an orderly manner should it fail.
""Even with higher liquidity requirements, situations are conceivable in which a systemically important bank's liquid assets are not enough to perform successful resolution,"" the government said in a statement. ""In order to increase market participants' confidence in the ability of a recapitalised and solvent systemically important bank to survive, it is planned to provide a third line of temporary additional liquidity via a public liquidity backstop.""
Liquidity backstops help provide insurance that banks will have access to cash in a crisis, thereby mitigating the risk of bank runs, or customers and counterparties pulling out of business with a failing bank over concerns for their money.
The government's proposed backstop would allow the Swiss National Bank to provide funds to any systemically important bank in the event of failure, in the form of a state-guaranteed loan.
Alongside UBS, Switzerland's second-largest lender  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is classified as systemically important, as are unlisted lenders Raiffeisen Group, Zuercher Kantonalbank and PostFinance.

Internationally, a public liquidity backstop is part of the standard crisis toolkit,"" the Swiss government said, cautioning it ""should not be confused with a state bailout.""
It tasked the finance ministry with preparing draft legislation by mid-2023.

LONDON (Reuters) -Confiscating the assets of companies that have fled Russia since the invasion of Ukraine would shatter investor confidence for decades and take Russia back to the calamitous days of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, metals magnate Vladimir Potanin has said.
Potanin, president and biggest shareholder of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel, said Russia should respond with pragmatism to its exclusion from swathes of the global economy.
""We should not try to 'slam the door' but endeavour to preserve Russia's economic position in those markets which we spent so long cultivating,"" Potanin, 61, said on the Telegram messaging app. 
Potanin, one of the most prominent Russian billionaires who is not sanctioned by the West, said confiscating assets from companies that had left would put Russia out in the cold for decades, as far as investors were concerned:
""It would take us back 100 years to 1917. And the consequences - a global lack of confidence in Russia from investors - we would feel for many decades.""
Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday that the government proposed putting companies that had left Russia into external administration. 
The exact mechanisms of that are unclear, though there is a fierce debate within the Russian elite about how severe Moscow's reaction to Western sanctions should be, officials and businessmen said.
Putin said Russia would remain open for business and did not intend to close itself off from those who still wanted to do business.
But many do not - at least for now. 
BP (NYSE:BP) said last month it was abandoning its stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft while companies ranging from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co to Toyota and IKEA have shuttered their businesses in Russia.
'WE MUST BE WISER' 
Potanin’s upbringing as the son of a high-ranking Soviet trade official and an education at Moscow’s elite diplomatic academy have always set him slightly apart from other oligarchs who rose from rags to riches in the chaos of the 1990s.
The privatisation deals under President Boris Yeltsin gave Potanin and other oligarchs control over some of the best assets of a former superpower, though their clout was eroded under Putin as a new group of former spies put some of Russia's biggest oil production units under state control.
Besides being the world's largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, MMC Norilsk Nickel is a major producer of platinum and copper. It also produces cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, iridium, ruthenium, selenium, tellurium and sulphur.
Potanin said some countries used sanctions as a way to edge out competition, urging Moscow to consider its moves carefully.
He also urged Moscow to remove restrictions on servicing Russia's foreign currency debt, which he said totalled $480 billion. He said a technical default on interest payments could trigger demands for the full principal to be paid.
""This fully applies to major public companies,"" Potanin said. Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions.
""We see that the West's own economies have suffered by imposing sanctions against Russia. So we must be wiser and avoid a scenario under which our sanctions hit us,"" Potanin said. 

Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after NATO admitted members up to Russia's borders and Western countries supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.
Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm.

Construction of the plant, to be located in the town of Kuppenheim, will take place in two stages. 
In a first step, a plant for mechanical dismantling will be built by 2023, the company said, adding that hydrometallurgical processing of the battery materials would start after that.
The plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 2,500 tonnes, Mercedes-Benz said, adding the recovered materials would be used to produce more than 50,000 battery modules for new Mercedes-EQ models.

""With our new recycling plant at the Kuppenheim location, we are increasing the recycling rate to more than 96% while expanding our own expertise in the area of battery value creation,"" Mercedes-Benz board member Joerg Burzer said.
""Through targeted collaborative ventures with high-tech partners in China and the U.S., we are globalising our battery recycling strategy and taking a decisive step toward closing the recycling loop in e-mobility.""

Investing.com – Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock traded 2.2% higher in premarket Friday after the beauty retailer beat fourth-quarter estimates.
The company reaped the gains arising out of more people returning to work and spending more on fragrances and skin care. As of January 29, the company operated 1,308 stores, 44 more than a year ago.
Q4 net sales jumped over 24% to $2.7 billion as Covid-19 restrictions eased and consumer confidence returned. Comparable sales were up more than 21% as more people shopped and average ticket size also grew.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher by a small margin of 0.4 percentage points to near 24% due to higher pay and incentives, partially offset by leverage in marketing expenses due to higher sales.
“The beauty category is healthy and growing, and we are confident the recovery that began in 2021 will continue, as consumers maintain their self-care routines, become more resilient to Covid surges, and engage in more leisure and social activities,” CEO Dave Kimbell said in a statement.
He listed wage and supply chain cost pressures as challenges in the current year while it attempts to exceed the “exceptional performance” in 2021 when net sales jumped over 40% to $8.6 billion.
The company’s targets for 2022 include at least $9.05 billion in annual sales with an ambitious aim of making it $9.15 billion. Comparable sales are seen up 3-4%.
Four days ago, the company announced a $2 billion share buyback. This replaces the little that was left out of its previous repurchase program of $1.6 billion, the company said.  ",,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday issued final rules eliminating the need for automated vehicle manufacturers to equip fully autonomous vehicles with manual driving controls to meet crash standards.
Automakers and tech companies have faced significant hurdles to deploying automated driving system (ADS) vehicles without human controls because of safety standards written decades ago that assume people are in control.
Last month, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and its self-driving technology unit Cruise petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for permission to build and deploy a self-driving vehicle without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals.
The rules revise regulations that assume vehicles ""will always have a driver's seat, a steering wheel and accompanying steering column, or just one front outboard passenger seating position.""
""For vehicles designed to be solely operated by an ADS, manually operated driving controls are logically unnecessary,"" the agency said.
The new rules, which were first proposed in March 2020, emphasize automated vehicles must provide the same levels of occupant protection as human-driven vehicles.
""As the driver changes from a person to a machine in ADS-equipped vehicles, the need to keep the humans safe remains the same and must be integrated from the beginning,"" said NHTSA Deputy Administrator Steven Cliff.

NHTSA's rule says children should not occupy what is traditionally known as the ""driver's"" position, given that the driver's seating position has not been designed to protect children in a crash, but if a child is in that seat, the car will not immediately be required to cease motion.
NHTSA said existing regulations do not currently bar deploying automated vehicles as long as they have manual driving controls, and as it continues to consider changing other safety standards, manufacturers may still need to petition NHTSA for an exemption to sell their ADS-equipped vehicles.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s low-cost 5G model should enhance the iPhone maker's appeal in Asia where it is in a stiff battle with multiple rivals from Samsung (KS:005930) to Vivo, analysts believe.
After focusing on high-end phones during the pandemic-induced supply chain crisis, Apple this week unveiled 5G connectivity to its iPhone SE - for $429 - which is likely to attract more lower-end buyers in emerging markets.
""The new 3rd gen iPhone SE could be effective in gaining incremental share among price sensitive consumers, especially in Asia,"" Cowen and Company brokerage said, citing China and India in particular.
Counterpoint Research said the earlier 4G iPhone SE accounted for 12% of total iPhone sales from its launch in Q2 2020 until the end of 2021, with Japan the biggest market after the United States.
'DEMAND TO OPEN UP'
""This time we expect demand to open up more across other markets like Europe, SE (South East) Asia and Korea – regions where many consumers stayed away because of the lack of 5G support (for the older SE),"" Counterpoint Research analyst Sujeong Lim said.
The world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $2.6 trillion, Apple achieved its highest ever market share in China at the end of last year, surpassing Huawei to become the best seller, according to a previous Counterpoint. 
Cowen and Company analyst Krish Sankar said the new small-screen 5G phone's $30 price hike from the 4G version should cover most extra costs from the enhanced technology, though margins would be lower compared to the $699 iPhone 13 mini.

He estimated the iPhone SE would generate gross margin between 42%-54%, or roughly half the gross profit for each device compared with the iPhone 13 mini.
""We believe a renewed affordable iPhone SE lineup should buoy consumer interest in iPhones versus investor fears of sharp declines,"" Citi analyst Jim Suva said.

The Canadian operations of Russian steelmaker Evraz, of which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, will not be affected by the move, Trudeau said at a news conference. 
""The sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs like Abramovich are directed at them so that they cannot profit or benefit from economic activities in Canada or the hard work of Canadians working in companies that they have investments in,"" Trudeau said. 
""We are obviously going to watch carefully but we are confident that this will not impact the hard working Canadians who are doing good work in companies across the country."" 
On Monday, Canada slapped sanctions on 10 individuals close to the Russian leadership over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Trudeau said he would not rule out an airlift to help Ukrainians who have fled the country since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. He said his government was looking at all options and planned to do more to help.

Canada and its allies will remain united in their conviction that Russian President ""Vladimir Putin has made a terrible mistake and will end up losing, despite how many bombs he can drop on hospitals, or perhaps even because of it. There is no win in this for him,"" Trudeau said.
Moscow denies it has been attacking civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.

Investing.com – Pearson (NYSE:PSO) ADRs surged 21% in premarket trading Friday on a Bloomberg report that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) is evaluating a cash offer for the education and publishing company.
The stock had risen earlier in the morning following a report on the Betaville blog about a possible approach for the company.
Apollo has time till April 8 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or to withdraw, according to U.K. takeover rules.
Europe’s largest activist investor Cevian Capital currently owns 10.2% of Pearson, making it the company’s largest shareholder.
The company, after seeing its traditional business of college publishing decline, has pivoted to the ‘digital first’ game, selling directly to consumers via its Pearson+ app and to businesses looking to train staff.
The company closed December with 2.75 million registered users on its app including 133,000 paid subscriptions. It recently acquired Clutch Prep, an online video-based learning service to fuel Pearson+ with original video tutorials.
Demand for assessment and qualification services grew 19% in the year. Growth in the IT sector led to a 19% growth in professional certification. US student assessment and English language learning rose 17% each, the latter benefiting from the recovery in both international courseware and Pearson Test of English.
The British company reported 2021 adjusted operating profit of 385 million pounds ($504 million) on sales of 3.42 billion pounds. It expects 2022 revenue to be higher.
The company is confident of getting 416 million pounds in adjusted operating profit in 2022, in line with current market expectations. The higher education business will continue being a drag on operations although the revenue decline should slow this year, according to the company. 
It expects pricing pressure to continue due to the shift from print to ebooks and Pearson+, and from bundles to digital-only."

(Reuters) -Boeing Co is yet to see any respite from a freeze in deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner - but that has not stopped it testing suppliers' capacity to meet output scenarios as high as seven a month by end-2023, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The planemaker has stopped making public predictions on when it will win approval from U.S. regulators to resume deliveries, halted for nearly a year by factory defects in a still-running saga that is costing $5.5 billion overall.
But, the people said, it has discussed what some analysts consider ambitious scenarios with parts makers as it surveys an industry crippled by successive crises and now facing labor and materials shortages deepened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s production strategy hinges on several key unknowns including when deliveries restart, how quickly it can reduce an overhang of more than 100 undelivered 787s and the extent to which the Ukraine crisis dampens already weak demand.
While some industry sources have pegged a delivery restart as early as next month, the date is increasingly under scrutiny with April just days away.
Boeing's recovery plan could see it increase the current rock-bottom monthly rate of two 787s to three around May, if deliveries have started by then, and again to four around November, two of the people said.
From there, suppliers have been asked to be ready to tackle rates as high as seven a month around October 2023, if requested, the sources added. 
That is more than most analysts reckon the market will absorb and the sources stressed no decision has been made on what, for now, remains purely a planning scenario.
The more Boeing produces the harder it may be to shift the backlog of undelivered planes.
Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu this week estimated monthly output would stay at two in 2022, rising to 3.5 in 2023 but remaining below 5 ""to facilitate the burndown of inventory"". 
""April delivery restart may be aggressive,"" Kahyaoglu added. 
Boeing has repeatedly referred questions on the timing to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Boeing declined comment on the supplier targets and pointed to comments in January when it said the 787 program remained at a low rate, with an expected gradual return to five a month.
Planemakers frequently test scenarios to keep the supply chain in battle mode ready for the next phase of competition. 
""We will run our rate as low as we can while we burn our inventory as fast as we can,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in January, adding Boeing would monitor rates as demand grows.
RAMP-UP
The industry has meanwhile received mixed signals on demand for wide-body jets which had peaked well before the pandemic.
Boeing has said it sees a full recovery in airline traffic that underpins plane sales by the end of 2024. 
But it has given what appears to be cautious guidance to one supplier, saying that production for major 787 parts could reach pre-pandemic levels by 2026-2027, one industry source said.
Forecasts for the second half of the decade are still at a very preliminary stage, analysts say.
""Overall, our projections for the three-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume passenger traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 timeframe,"" a Boeing spokesperson said.
Italy's Leonardo, which builds two fuselage sections for the 787 in southern Italy, said on Friday it plans to deliver just over 30 pairs of sections to Boeing this year, up from 28 last year.
Before the pandemic, Boeing was building around 12 of the carbon-composite jets per month, a rate dragged down partially by China-U.S. trade tensions.

Last month, the U.S. FAA revoked Boeing's ability to self-certify newly built 787 aircraft ahead of delivery, raising another potential hurdle to Boeing's plans.
Asked in January whether 787 deliveries would resume in April, Calhoun said, ""That's up to the FAA, and we're going to let them do what they have to do.""

Investing.com – DocuSign Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock plunged 17% in premarket Friday after the company’s 2023 revenue growth projection came in at less than half of the previous year’s pace.
A share buyback plan of up to $200 million failed to make any impact in shoring up the share.
The company was one of the biggest winners of the pandemic as companies, forced to adopt remote work, turned to its digital solutions to onboard and engage with employees. E-signatures of documents became commonplace. As economies reopen, more people are returning to work, lessening the demand for its solutions.
DocuSign sees 2023 revenue to be not more than $2.48 billion, just over 18% year-on-year. In comparison, 2022 revenue grew 45% to $2.1 billion.
Annual billings are seen around $2.71 at the center of its guidance range, just about a 13% growth compared to the 37% jump in 2022.
Adjusted operating is also seen shrinking by 1 to 3 percentage points.
Last month, the company tied up with Zoom to enable virtual, face-to-face signing up of employees.

The Softbank-backed firm said it expects full-year revenue between $3.35 billion and $3.5 billion, a 30%-36% rise from its 2021 revenue.
The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed companies to offer employees to work from places other than their offices, benefiting workspace providers such as WeWork, which offers workstations, private offices and customized floors.
Softbank-backed WeWork's business has also recovered due to easing of COVID-19 curbs, after work-from-home arrangements last year weighed heavily on the company amid reduced occupancy and higher operating costs.
The switch to a hybrid work model had also lifted WeWork's London-listed rival IWG, which reported a smaller loss on Tuesday.
WeWork, which went public in October last year after a near two-year struggle, was aided further by chief executive Sandeep Mathrani's push to cut costs by exiting unprofitable leases and selling non-core assets.
On Friday, WeWork said it expects revenue between $900 million and $1 billion in the third and fourth quarter of 2022, which is the range it expects to become profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis.
Long-term lease obligations, a closely-watched metric given the company generally leases real estate, fell about 11% to $17.93 billion as of Dec. 31.

Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC), the owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in China, said it may have to delist from the New York stock exchange by 2024 after U.S. authorities said it had failed to provide access to audit documents.
Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell as much as 12% on Friday, having closed 11% lower in New York. 
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - a long-simmering auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake.
In December, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without disclosing names. It named five of these firms including Yum China for the first time this week. 
Shares of other Chinese companies identified by the SEC, including  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) Inc,  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) Limited and HUTCHMED (China) Limited also tumbled on the news. 
In an apparent attempt ease investor panic, China's securities regulator said on Friday it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the dispute.
""We always adhere to the spirit of openness and cooperation, and are willing to resolve the issue ... through regulatory cooperation,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement early on Friday, calling the latest SEC statement ""normal procedure.""
The CSRC and China's Ministry of Finance have recently been in continuous communication and dialogue with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and ""have made positive progress,"" it said. 
Separately, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Friday the discussions were proceeding smoothly. 
""The next step for both parties is to continue to advance in depth on more details,"" said one source. The other source said a consensus was expected ""as soon as possible."" 
SEEKING SOLUTIONS 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 9% on Friday, before recouping some losses to close down 4.3%. 
BeiGene, whose shares fell 4.9% in Hong Kong and 6% in New York, said in a filing it was seeking solutions.
ACM Research said it was looking for solutions and Zai Lab said its inclusion ""will not materially impact operations."" HUTCHMED did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Group, said the SEC move was not totally unexpected, but investors' reaction was understandable given heightened geopolitical tensions.
""The atmosphere now is bad. We have Sino-U.S. frictions, the Ukraine crisis, prospects of rate hikes and more,"" Yip said. ""So it's natural for investors to look on the dark side.""
Bruce Pang, an analyst at China Renaissance, said the main reason the five companies were identified by the SEC was that they were the first few companies that already filed their 2021 annual reports. 

""However, this list has returned delisting risk to the forefront, as regulators look to proceed step by step with stricter requirements on disclosure and compliance.""
The SEC has given these companies until March 29 to submit evidence to dispute their identification.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, ending a volatile week on a positive note on the back of raised hopes of a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 390 points, or 1.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 55 points, or 1.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 220 points, or 1.6%.
These gains followed a Reuters report quoting Russian President Vladimir Putin as stating that there were certain ""positive shifts"" in talks with Ukraine, lifting hopes for a ceasefire in a war that is now in its third week.
The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Thursday after talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries failed to make progress, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 1.3% on the week, potentially registering its fifth negative week in a row for the first time since May 2019. 
The war in Ukraine has driven up the costs of oil and other commodities, prompting fears that the Federal Reserve will have to lift interest rates more rapidly than previously expected.
Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February over last year, the largest annual increase in 40 years, data showed on Thursday, and this is before the sharp commodity price rises caused by Russia's war against Ukraine are factored in.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lift interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets next week, the likely start of a series of interest rate hikes to curb inflation. 
Goldman Sachs cut its full-year GDP growth forecast this year to 1.75% from 2.0%, with the influential investment bank warning the probability of a U.S. recession in the next year may be as much as 35%.
The data slate is quiet Friday, with only consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan due. However, this will give investors an insight into how households are faring as rising price pressures erode spending power. 
In corporate news, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported a hefty fourth quarter net loss of $2.46 billion after the close Thursday, and the EV-maker halved its production target for this year amid supply chain issues.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) forecast strong fourth quarter profit as the software firm expects its heavy cloud investments to pay off, while DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) issued weak revenue guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year. 
Additionally, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), will be in the spotlight after regulators in the EU and U.K. opened antitrust probes into the pair over the pair’s 2018 advertising deal.
Oil prices traded higher Friday as the talks around lifting sanctions on Iran were paused, further delaying the possibility of crude exports from the Persian Gulf country entering the global market.
That said the market still looked set for the largest weekly drop since November 2021, amid uncertainty over global production levels. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $107.50 a barrel, heading for a weekly drop of around 8% after touching a high of $130.50, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $111.09, set for a weekly fall of about 7% after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13.

According to Bloomberg, the firm has failed to meet Cyberspace Administration of China’s demands of overhauling its systems for handling sensitive user data. Its main apps, removed from local app stores last year, will remain suspended for the time being.
The company had, in December, announced its plan to delist in the U.S. and pursue a listing in Hong Kong on landing under the cybersecurity probe in its home country. It had then said its NYSE-listed stock will be converted into tradable shares on another stock exchange.
News that the company had landed in the crosshairs of the Chinese regulators became public soon after its June 30 debut on NYSE, ensuring that the share has rarely traded above its issue price of $14. It closed at $3.38 Thursday.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the company had been advised to delay its initial public offering, pending a review of its data-handling practices. The company ignored the advice, only to find itself in all sorts of legal troubles later.
As more and more Chinese companies have got listed on American exchanges over the last few years, authorities there have become increasingly uncomfortable with the vast trove of data they possess and that they may be asked to share with American regulators to comply with listing norms.
According to Bloomberg, DiDi has since explored several alternatives, including hiving off data to a third-party Chinese firm and selling a stake to state-backed companies."

Ghosn, the architect of the Renault-Nissan auto alliance, has been fighting multiple probes since fleeing to Lebanon from Japan in late 2019, and has said he hopes to clear his name in financial misconduct cases against him.
Ghosn was chairman of both Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Mitsubishi and chief executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of under-reporting his salary and using company funds for personal use. He has denied wrongdoing.
Japanese prosecutors sought legal assistance from Switzerland to get documents from bank accounts owned by an associate of Ghosn. Zurich prosecutors agreed last year to hand them over, which prompted an appeal from the unidentified associate that the Federal Criminal Court said on Friday it had rejected.

""The Japanese authorities have concrete indications that funds of allegedly criminal origin may have been deposited in two accounts in the complainant's name"" at two unidentified banks, the verdict said.
The verdict did not give the name of the business associate who filed the appeal. Zurich prosecutors identified him only as an Arab businessman whose accounts in question were at two Zurich-based banks they did not name.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian aerospace and defence group Leonardo believes Russia's invasion of Ukraine will accelerate plans to create European common defence capabilities and expects to see higher military spending.
""I am sure this tragic event will create higher coordination and spending in defence (in Europe),"" Leonardo Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo told an analysts call, adding that Leonardo was already part of several EU programmes including the recently signed EuroMale air drone and Tempest fighter jet project.
In addition, EU countries also needed to cooperate more on land defence, Profumo said.
Last month, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a 100 billion euro ($109.82 billion) new fund - worth twice last year's annual defence budget - to modernize its military, including buying armed drones and new fighter jets.
Italy, expected to spend 26 billion euros on defence this year, is also looking to increase its military spending, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week.
Denmark, Poland and Sweden have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.
The state-controlled group expects its cash flow to more than double this year compared with 2021, reaching 500 million euros.
Cash generation is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, driven by an increase in sales coming from its governmental and defence businesses, CFO Alessandra Genco said.
Last year 88% of its 14.1 billion euros in revenue came from these activities, while the production of parts for commercial aircraft shrunk, forcing the group to restructure its Aerostructures division.
Despite restructuring costs worth 70 million euros and cash absorption from the Aerostructures division, the group recorded a jump in net profit to 587 million euros.
Shares in Leonardo rose more than 12% at 1100 GMT in Milan to touch their highest in more than two years.
The state-controlled group said it had limited activities in civil helicopters in Russia and suspended the business following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Leonardo said it saw growth in the aero, defence and security market averaging about 6% over the next five years and its target market represented about a fifth of the total.

The company added that it had no significant exposure to Russia or Ukraine.

""A sound securities civil compensation system is an important guarantee for the full implementation of the registration-based IPO system,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement on its website.
China has been pushing to move from its traditional IPO system, based on regulatory approvals, to a registration-based system of the type used in the United States, a shift that makes investors more responsible for their own investments.

To pave the way for that shift, China introduced rules in January to make it easier for victims of securities fraud to claim compensation, in order to stamp out corporate cheating and protect investors' interests.
The CSRC said it would work to improve the draft rules based on public feedback.

(Reuters) - The Russian invasion of Ukraine has left drugmakers scrambling to find ways for patients enrolled in clinical trials there to receive their medicines as millions seek shelter from bombardment and flee to neighboring countries. 
Ukraine, as well as Russia, have become important countries for studying new drugs because patients there have a dire need for medicines to treat cancer, neurological and gastrointestinal disorders. Russia and surrounding countries account for 10% of people in clinical trials, analysts estimate.
Russia's two-week-old invasion and bombardment of Ukraine has rapidly created a humanitarian crisis, curtailing access to food, water and medical supplies and damaging hospitals in major cities. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine.
""The health system is becoming engulfed in this conflict, engulfed in this crisis,"" the World Health Organization's emergencies director Mike Ryan said this week. ""We've seen now that some hospitals are being abandoned by the authorities because they simply cannot function.""
Two of the pharmaceutical companies with the most clinical trials in Ukraine - U.S.-based Merck & Co and Swiss drugmaker Roche - said they were assessing how to continue delivering medicines to patients. Combined they have about 100 clinical trials underway there.
At least seven companies, including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), have said they are experiencing disruptions to trials or patient enrollment in the region. The full scope of delays in Ukraine is unknown. But there were 502 ongoing trials in Ukraine, according to research firm GlobalData.
Roche alone has 33 trials underway in Ukraine accounting for 1.5% of the active trial population across its global studies. 
A Roche spokesperson said the company is trying to identify sites in nearby countries like Poland, Slovakia and Romania that could take on its patients in clinical studies.
""The situation for those patients is currently very challenging and we are actively working on solutions to ensure continued access to treatment for these patients, including if they have left Ukraine and moved to other countries,"" the spokesperson said in an email.
Patient visits to clinics in the Ukraine capital Kyiv run by Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH), which conducts trials for drugmakers, have been canceled since the week beginning Feb. 21, LabCorp told Reuters. 
Paul Evans, chief executive of Velocity Clinical Research, which does not currently operate in Europe, said the industry faced similar challenges in the region when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
""But that wasn't an all-out war situation,"" said Evans, adding that conducting research in Ukraine now is nearly impossible. ""You can probably finish existing trials in Russia. But there is probably a disincentive to starting a new trial there.""
PATIENT RECRUITMENT ON PAUSE
Pharmaceutical companies often run large clinical trials across many countries. Ukraine and Russia have been sought after given a willing patient population and lower cost of doing business compared to the United States and Western Europe. 
Jefferies analyst Chris Howerton said trials in Ukraine provide access not only to the experimental drugs, but medicines they are tested against. Trials still enrolling patients will likely shift to other areas if the war drags on, he said.
Merck, which has nearly 60 ongoing trials in Ukraine - the most among all companies operating there - said it had paused enrolling new patients in Ukraine and Russia. The company said on Monday at a conference that it was trying to get products to people enrolled in trials as well as to commercial customers.
Mounting sanctions against Russia do not include medicines. There are 842 trials underway in Russia, making it the sixth largest site for clinical studies worldwide, according to GlobalData.
But experts also cited fresh challenges to conducting clinical business in Russia, such as lack of air travel for investigators outside the country.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said it had paused screening and enrollment of new patients in Ukraine, as well as in Russia and its ally Belarus.
Pfizer, which said it was conducting 27 clinical trials in Ukraine, has paused recruitment of new patients.
U.S. drug developer Karuna Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KRTX) suspended enrollment for a trial of its lead schizophrenia drug in Ukraine. Chief Executive Steven Paul told Reuters it could recruit more patients in the United States, if needed.

California-based  Tricida  (NASDAQ:TCDA) Inc said it expected to report data from a trial of its experimental kidney disease drug in the fourth quarter instead of the third, as 15% of patients in the study were from Ukraine.
Said Velocity's Evans: ""In Ukraine, you've got a complete breakdown of society there. You can't possibly be doing clinical research in a war zone like that now.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp will scale back domestic production by up to 20% during the months of April, May and June, it said on Friday, to ease the strain on suppliers struggling with shortages of chips and other parts.
The move by Japan's largest automaker is the latest to spotlight the supply-chain difficulties hobbling the global auto industry as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. The outlook has been further complicated by the crisis in Ukraine.
Toyota plans to reduce domestic production by about 20% in April, about 10% in May and about 5% in June from an earlier production plan, a spokesperson said. Production would still remain high as the previous plan factored in the need to make up for lost output, the spokesperson said.
The automaker's suppliers have been forced to deal with a number of changes to production plans due to chip shortages, and the reduced output should take some of the burden off them, the spokesperson said, declining to comment on the number of cars involved or the financial impact.
Toyota President Akio Toyoda told union members this week that without a sound production plan, suppliers risked becoming ""exhausted"" and that April through June would be ""an intentional cooling off"" period.
U.S. electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc on Thursday said supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half this year, to 25,000 vehicles.
Honda Motor Co Ltd has said it would cut production by about 10% in two domestic plants through the end of this month.
Separately, Toyota suspended domestic production for one day at the beginning of this month after a cyberattack on a supplier, a halt that prevented the production of about 13,000 vehicles that day.

Toyota is planning to produce a record 11 million cars in fiscal 2022 as long as it can ensure a stable supply of chips.
Its shares slid down 4.4% on Friday, underperforming a 2.1% decline in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 average.

Investing.com – Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stocks tumbled 12% in premarket Friday after the EV-maker said its production in 2022 is likely to be 25,000 units as supply chain issues hamper production.
Without the constraints, its factory could make 50,000 vehicles, Rivian said.
Gross margins will be negative, the company said, citing inflationary pressures while it tries to minimize price increases.
Rivian reported a fourth quarter net loss of $2.46 billion, much wider than analysts’ estimates. Revenue of $54 million was well behind expectations.
The company expects a ""significant"" production ramp-up in the second quarter of the EDV-700 van for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Reuters quoted CEO R. J. Scaringe as saying.
According to the news agency, Rivian is exploring ways to further expand its commercial relationship with Amazon, which owns a 20% stake in the startup and has ordered 100,000 vans. Rivian will begin producing a second Amazon van this year, the EDV-500, which is shorter and narrower than the EDV-700.
Rivian has 83,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup and R1S utility vehicle as of March 8, up from 71,000 in mid-December.
The company’s stock made a blockbuster debut on November 11 and in no time commanded a market cap of almost $162 billion without a revenue on books, easily surpassing legacy automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F).
Since then, the stock is now down to less than a fourth of its value but still carries a market cap of over $37 billion when revenue in the full year was $55 million.  
Rivian ended the quarter with $18.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, excluding additional lines of credit.",

LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it was not withdrawing completely from Russia, drawing anger from investors and contrasting with Wall Street banks which are severing ties with the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
Banks and asset managers have joined many other Western companies in pulling back from Russia following a raft of sanctions on the country.
""We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values,"" Chief Executive Christian Sewing said in a note to Deutsche Bank staff on Thursday.
He added that it would not ""be the right thing to do in terms of managing those client relationships and helping them to manage their situation"".
Bill Browder, an investor campaigning to expose corruption, said that by staying in Russia, Germany's biggest bank ""is completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West"".
Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital, satellite pictures showed on Friday, and Britain said Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
Tim Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said it was ""just not good enough from DB"".
""Perhaps DB needs to take a fresh look at its own ESG (environmental, social, governance) framework,"" he said.
Fund managers are reassessing their approach to governance as a result of the invasion.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) this week became the first U.S. banks to suspend business in Russia.
Goldman Sachs, which has a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million, said on Thursday it was winding down its business there. Any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation.
JPMorgan also said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"" and was not pursuing any new business there. 
JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. The bank did not list Russia in the top 20 countries where it has the most exposure, in its most recent filings.
The world's biggest insurance brokers Marsh and Aon (NYSE:AON) also said on Thursday they were halting operations in Russia.
Deutsche Bank said earlier this week its credit risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was 2.9 billion euros ($3.18 billion) and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.

While the potential losses among major European lenders are not big enough to threaten their stability, analysts and investors fear it could derail their turnaround plans and halt payouts to shareholders.

The two companies were notable stand outs among major brands, saying they would continue doing business in Russia amid the imposition of massive trade and banking sanctions. 
Tadashi Yanai, the founder of Fast Retailing had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life"".
But on Thursday Fast Retailing said: ""While continuing our Uniqlo business in Russia, it has become clear to us that we can no longer proceed due to a number of difficulties.
""We condemn all forms of aggression that violate human rights and threaten the peaceful existence of individuals.""
Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market through brands including Winston and Camel, said its subsidiary there would suspend investment, marketing activities and a planned launch of a heated tobacco product.
""The challenges of operating in Russia at this time are unprecedented,"" the company said in a statement.
Japan Tobacco, which has four factories and about 4,000 workers in Russia, is continuing manufacturing there for now, but those activities could also be suspended depending on changes in the operating environment, the company said.
A wave of global consumer brands, such as  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE),  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI), and home furnishings firm IKEA, have said in recent days they would halt sales and investment in Russia. 
Fast Retailing was also among major clothing companies that faced a backlash last year over their operations in China amid criticisms of alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.
Fast Retailing insisted its sourcing in China was sustainable, and founder Yanai told the Nikkei newspaper the company wouldn't choose between the U.S. and Chinese markets.
The company has more than 800 stores in China, about the same as in its home market of Japan. Staying in Russia put the company at risk of boycotts in its bigger consumer bases, said LightStream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri.

""We could expect such an approach when it comes to China as the Chinese market is extremely important to the company,"" Kumarasiri, who publishes to the SmartKarma platform, told Reuters before the Russia pullout announcement. ""However, Russia is not so important as to risk a backlash from other main markets.""
Fast Retailing will also halt online sales in Russia, the company said. The company previously announced it would donate $10 million and 200,000 clothing items to aid refugees from the crisis.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) set new targets on Thursday to nearly halve its exposure to the financing of emissions from oil, gas and coal between 2020 and 2030.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank reduced its exposure to emissions it financed in the oil, gas and coal sector by 41% between 2020 and 2021, preliminary estimates in its sustainability report showed on Thursday, when it had some $2.6 billion in loans outstanding to such clients.
The report marks the first time the bank detailed its exposure to financing emissions from the fossil fuel sector, which it estimated at 21.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent for 2021.
Financed emissions are greenhouse gas emissions associated with a financial institutions' loans and investment.
Credit Suisse began adjusting its policies on coal following pressure from environmental groups in late 2019, and in 2020 halted lending to companies which make more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal mining or coal power.
Those restrictions were stepped up further in late 2021, when it decided to exclude any new clients generating more than 5% of revenues from coal activities or seeking to develop new coal projects.
But investors and climate activists have repeatedly asked the bank to do more, with investors managing $2.4 trillion calling on Credit Suisse this week to take tougher climate action, including cutting its exposure to fossil fuel assets. 
The group, which includes Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi and a host of Swiss pension funds, said it plans to submit a resolution to Credit Suisse's annual general meeting on April 29.
In its sustainability reported--published as the bank detailed a 2021 pay cut for executives--Credit Suisse said it had reduced its potential exposure to coal mining companies by 39% to $640 million at end-2021, while reducing its potential lending exposure to oil and gas companies by 25% from 2020 to $9.8 billion.

The bank also said 2021 figures remained preliminary estimates, calculated using year-end lending exposure paired with client data on emissions and financials from the year before.
It expects to set further sector-specific goals by the end of 2022, it said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Elon Musk wants to make cheaper batteries - fast.
But the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive is unlikely to hit ambitious targets for Tesla to mass-produce its own new batteries this year, industry insiders and analysts say. Though Musk is known for doing the impossible, starting with turning the electric vehicle maker into the world's most valuable auto company, the challenges of launching a new factory and developing a new way of battery manufacturing, are likely to be too much. 
The stakes are high. Prices of battery ingredients like nickel hit records this week on supply fears stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Musk in January forecast battery supply constraints next year, making in-house production a key to growth. 
""He is changing the way how battery manufacturing is done,"" said Shirley Meng, a University of Chicago professor who previously worked with Maxwell, a battery technology company acquired by Tesla. ""It's really, really difficult to manufacture at a speed and at scale.""
""I think they will probably fall short of the ramp-up of 4680 over the next year,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, referring to the next-generation EV battery. Munster sees Tesla beating its targets longer-term, but starting off slowly, given its history of new-model production.
Musk says making the batteries at scale will be very difficult, but they are critical to his goal of building less expensive, longer-range electric cars that will keep Tesla ahead of a growing pack of competitors.
Like other automakers, Tesla sources battery cells from suppliers like Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, CATL and LG Energy Solution. In late 2020, Musk announced that Tesla aims to halve the costs of the most expensive part of an EV by producing its own batteries. 
Tesla's 4680 lithium-ion batteries - with 46-millimeter diameter and 80-millimeter length - hold about five times the energy of its current smaller 2170 cells. Tesla can use a smaller number of new cells for the same energy and driving range, reducing costs. 
Tesla has said it will start delivering Model Y vehicles with its bigger battery cells by the end of March. In 2020, Musk said Tesla would have capacity to produce 100 gigawatt hours of 4680 batteries this year, enough to power about 1.3 million cars, and more than enough to supply production at factories in Texas and Germany. 
Tesla is expected to deliver about 1.4 million vehicles this year. Industry researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects the company to produce batteries for about 30,000 Model Y vehicles, growing to 484,000 in 2024, according to a previously unpublished forecast provided to Reuters.
DOUBLE CHALLENGE
Tesla faces a lengthy process in ramping up a battery factory, complicated by plans to use a new manufacturing technology called dry electrode coating.
""There's a very long process of fine-tuning the equipment before you can get to volume production,"" said Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at Benchmark, adding that Tesla would have to refine the manufacturing process this year to ensure volume production in 2023. 
""Battery production is hard, even hard for experienced suppliers,"" Rawles said. 
Tesla said it produced its one millionth 4680 cell in January. It did not say how long it took to hit that milestone, but Benchmark estimated that 1 million cells would power only 1,200 Model Ys, which suggests that Tesla has a long way to go. 
Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its battery business. Senior Vice President Drew Baglino said in January Tesla is ""making meaningful progress of the ramp curve"" in its test battery factory in Fremont, California, while installing battery equipment at its upcoming plant in Texas. 
Baglino said Tesla's ""focus is to drive yield quality and cost to ensure we are ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year."" 
As a sign of Tesla's ambition, it expects to beat established battery makers Panasonic and LG to market with 4680s.
The crowning difficulty for Tesla is that it is planning a new manufacturing process, called dry electrode, a technology it obtained via its 2019 acquisition of California startup Maxwell Technologies. The factory equipment, Musk said, ""doesn't exist. It's being made."" 
Dry electrode manufacturing skips a traditional, complicated step of battery manufacturing that involves a chemical slurry. If it works, it will be cheaper and more efficient, but Musk freely admits it will be a challenge. 
""The very difficult part is then scaling up that production and achieving extremely higher reliability and safety with the cells,"" he told a European battery conference in November 2020. 

Even so, his timeline is seen as optimistic. It took more than a decade for battery makers to optimize the conventional manufacturing process for lithium-ion batteries. 
Musk - who described a ""production hell"" of mass producing the Model 3 sedan several years ago - might experience a ""Death Valley"" start to scaling up the dry electrode process, said professor Meng, adding, though, that Tesla will overcome the difficulties.

STOCKHOLM/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is in talks to replace Huawei 4G radio equipment from parts of  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea's telecom network in India, in one of the largest swap deals for the Finnish company, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The deal will see Nokia deploying 12,000 5G-ready radio sites and 4,000 small cells in Vodafone Idea's network in India's capital Delhi, the sources said.
Telecom operators in India have been reducing their dependence on Huawei after certain security concerns and Vodafone Idea's move is a blow to Huawei's prospects in the country, telecom experts said, adding more operators may choose to replace the Chinese company as supplier.
Huawei said the company doesn't comment on specific projects. Nokia declined to comment, while Vodafone Idea did not respond to requests for comment.
Several countries, including the United States, Britain and Sweden have blocked operators from using equipment made by Huawei over security concerns. Huawei denies it is a security risk.
""Unfortunately, there is no choice but to move out of Huawei because of the security concerns and government pressure,"" said Vivekanand Subbaraman, a telecom analyst at India's Ambit Capital. 
""Those concerns are not something you can wish away.""
Vodafone Idea in January agreed to convert dues owed to the government for use of airwaves into equity, giving the Indian state a 35.8% stake in the company. 
Vodafone Group (LON:VOD) holds 28.5% and Aditya Birla Group 17.8%.
Though India has not banned Huawei, the country has not named Chinese companies, including Huawei, among the list of approved suppliers for carrying out 5G trials. India is expected to auction 5G spectrum later this year.

In a swap deal, an operator changes an existing vendor and Nokia had earlier replaced Huawei gear in operators including BT, Orange Belgium, Proximus in Britain, Belgium and Luxembourg respectively.
Huawei supplies telecom equipment to both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel and the former is one of its largest customers in India. Bharti Airtel also counts Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) among its suppliers. ""(The) India market is very complex with many challenges and we are closely monitoring the developments in this market,"" Huawei said. Huawei has a 29% share of the global telecom equipment market, followed by Nokia and Ericsson at 15% each, according to research firm Dell'Oro. Nokia's gear will allow Vodafone Idea to manage 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G networks from the same platform and deployment could start from next month, according to the sources.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher, rebounding after the previous session’s hefty losses with investors digesting strong U.K. growth, the hawkish ECB stance, and the continuing war in Ukraine.
By 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France traded flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 outperformed, rising 0.7%.
Data released earlier Friday showed that Britain's economy rebounded much more than expected in January, with gross domestic product growing by 0.8% on the month after a 0.2% decline in December. 
The Bank of England meets next week, and these upbeat numbers can only bolster the chances of the central bank lifting interest rates for the third time in the space of three months.
European equities closed sharply lower Thursday after talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine failed to bring about a ceasefire to the conflict that has roiled markets over the last couple of weeks, with commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels.
Further moves to punish Russia are expected on Friday, with the United States, the European Union, and other allied nations set to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trading status. This would then allow for the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, further hurting the country’s economy.
The Institute of International Finance on Thursday cut its 2022 Russian GDP growth expectation, saying Moscow’s economy will contract by some 15% this year due to the severity of sanctions, having previously had a 3% growth estimate.
The European Central Bank surprised investors on Thursday by taking a relatively hawkish tone, announcing it would be speeding up its plans to tighten monetary policy, phasing out all of its asset purchases in the summer if inflation fails to come down fast enough.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 0.4% after Switzerland’s second-largest bank set new targets to nearly halve its exposure to the financing of emissions from oil, gas, and coal by the end of 2030.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock rose 0.5% after the German lender announced it paid 14% more in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.
Oil prices stabilized on Friday but still looked set for the largest weekly drop since November 2021, amid uncertainty over global production levels in a week marked by talk of potential supply additions, mainly from the United Arab Emirates, as well as additional sanctions on Russia. 
By 3.55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% higher at $108.68 a barrel, heading for a weekly drop of around 8% after touching a high of $130.50, while the Brent contract rose 3.1% to $112.74, set for a weekly fall of about 7% after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13.

U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba's third-largest shareholder with a stake of more than 6%, said in a statement it planned to oppose the management-backed break-up, calling it a premature step as a privatisation was never adequately explored.
""Farallon believes the privatisation solution is both the most value maximizing alternative and the only solution for Toshiba to fix its governance, capital allocation issues, and the deep mistrust with its shareholders,"" it said.

Toshiba's top shareholder and two influential proxy advisory firms on Thursday said they opposed the company's plan to split up, pointing out that it needed to rebuild trust with shareholders before pressing ahead with the plan.
Toshiba will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 24 to put to a vote its plan to split in two, drawn up originally after a five-month strategic review.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Friday, rebounding after the previous session's sharp losses. At the same time, investors digest surging U.S. inflation, British growth data, and the continuing war in Ukraine.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.9%.
European equities closed sharply lower Thursday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both dropping nearly 3%, after talks between the foreign ministers of both Russia and Ukraine, helped in Turkey, failed to bring about a ceasefire to the conflict between the two countries. 
Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks as Western nations levied a number of sanctions on Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, moves which have seen commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels.
Further action is expected on Friday after Reuters reported that the United States, the European Union, and other allied nations are set to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trading status. This would then allow for the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, further hurting the country’s economy.
Data from the U.K. on Friday showed that the country’s economy grew by 0.8% in January, a stronger rebound than expected after contracting by 0.2% in December. 
Financial markets expect the Bank of England to raise rates from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% next week amid rising price pressures, and this rebound will largely cement those expectations.
These inflationary pressures were in full display in the U.S. on Thursday, as consumer inflation jumped an annualized 7.9% in February, the largest increase in 40 years.
The Federal Reserve also meets next week and is widely expected to raise its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points, especially in the wake of the hawkish tone from the European Central Bank, which said on Thursday it would stop bond-buying in the third quarter if inflation doesn't fall.

Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil supplier, over its invasion of Ukraine, sent prices into overdrive. The northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market soared by 85% since Feb. 25 to $1,649 a tonne on Wednesday, though it fell back to $1,007 by Friday.
Malaysia Airlines said on Friday it would put in place a fuel surcharge for some markets from March 23 and manage capacity to mitigate unprofitable routes due to rising fuel costs.
Its budget rival AirAsia on March 5 introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help partially offset the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline has hedged its entire first-quarter consumption and about half of its expected second-quarter consumption, it said on Wednesday. It has also hedged lower amounts through the end of 2023.
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows. In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said on Tuesday, adding it had also hedged 50% of its fuel for the following quarter.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. 
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

(Reuters) - California utility PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp is partnering with U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to bring 'bidirectional' charging electric vehicles (EV) to its customers, the utility's chief executive said on Thursday.
Under bidirectional charging, also known as 'vehicle-to-grid' charging, the electric charge can travel both ways, allowing the EV to charge a consumer's home or tools. 
""We're announcing today our partnership with  Ford Motor Co  to bring bidirectional charging vehicles, specifically the Ford F-150 Lightning, to the PG&E customers,"" Patti Poppe said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. ""Imagine if your home generator was your car.""
Poppe said a bidirectional vehicle can provide power to a home for three to five days.
The pilot programme will test how the Lightning electric pickup truck can interact with the grid to support electric reliability by providing backup power for customers' homes in the utility's service area, PG&E said.
Ford previously partnered with solar power company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) Inc to use the Lightning, which Ford will begin building this spring, to power homes.

Ford CEO Jim Farley at the same event called the deal a next step, allowing the automaker's vehicles to plug into grids themselves. He added that Ford will probably make most of its EVs bidirectional.
Farley added he doesn't think EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will take this approach with its vehicles because it has an energy business to protect.

(Reuters) - Meta Platforms will allow Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion, according to internal emails seen by Reuters on Thursday, in a temporary change to its hate speech policy.
The social media company is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to internal emails to its content moderators.
""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.
The calls for the leaders' deaths will be allowed unless they contain other targets or have two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method, one email said, in a recent change to the company's rules on violence and incitement.
Citing the Reuters story, Russia's embassy in the United States demanded that Washington stop the ""extremist activities"" of Meta.
""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in a message that was also shared by their India office.
The temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers apply to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, according to one email.
In the email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion.
""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" it said in the email.
""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email stated.
Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. Moscow has cracked down on tech companies, including Twitter, which said it is restricted in the country, during its invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation.""
Many major social media platforms have announced new content restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union, and have demonstrated carve-outs in some of their policies during the war.

Emails also showed that Meta would allow praise of the right-wing Azov battalion, which is normally prohibited, in a change first reported by The Intercept.
The Meta spokesperson previously said the company was ""for the time being, making a narrow exception for praise of the Azov Regiment strictly in the context of defending Ukraine, or in their role as part of the Ukraine National Guard.""

Florida lawmakers recently passed a Republican-backed bill prohibiting classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for many young students. 
The legislation has stirred national controversy amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender. 
""As a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am deeply concerned about laws being enacted across the country, particularly those focused on our vulnerable youth,"" Cook said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Bob Chapek is another chief executive to voice his disappointment about the LGBTQ legislation.
Another case that has stirred corporate concern about LGBTQ rights is that of a Texas judge who recently issued an order blocking the state from investigating the parents of a 16-year-old transgender girl for providing her with gender-affirming medical treatments.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott says the treatments are ""child abuse"" and the state has appealed against the judge's order.

Major U.S. tech firms, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc and Apple are among more than 60 companies that have opposed equating gender-affirming treatment with child abuse by putting their names to an ad that will run in Texas on Friday, according to Axios.

Investing.com – Chinese tech shares fell on Friday, alongside their U.S. counterparts, as fresh regulatory concerns added to an already volatile market. These concerns stem from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s identification of five Chinese firms that could be subject to delisting if they failed to comply with certain auditing requirements.
The quintet is Beigene Ltd. (HK:6160),  Yum China Holdings  Inc. (HK:9987), Zai Lab Ltd. (HK:9688),  ACM Research Shanghai  Inc. (SS:688082)and Hutchmed China Ltd. (HK:0013) BeiGene’s Hong Kong shares were down 8.28% to HK$106.40 ($13.60) by 11:34 PM GMT (4:34 AM GMT). Yum China shares fell 12.15% to HK$335.40, while  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) shares fell 13.24% to HK$253 and Hutchmed shares slid 14.97% to HK$24.70. ACM Research’s Chinese shares were down 9.16% to CNY$89.39 ($14.14).
In response to the SEC move, China Securities Regulatory Commission posted a note on its official WeChat page that said that together with the Ministry of Finance, it has continued to communicate with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and has made “positive progress.”
Although some analysts predict that the risks of delisting are unlikely to materialize in the near term, even the probability unnerved a market already dealing with the Chinese government’s year-long crackdown and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The SEC update is “a reminder for the regulatory risks surrounding Chinese equities once again and the lack of positive catalysts overnight may potentially aggravate the downside move,” IG Asia Pte Ltd. market strategist Jun Rong Yeap told Bloomberg.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index that tracks Chinese shares listed in the U.S. tumbled 10% overnight, its biggest slide since October 2008. The index has slumped more than 60% since a February 2021 peak.
Meanwhile, China’s regulatory tightening for private enterprises has also seemingly intensified in recent weeks, even after food delivery platforms were asked to cut fees charged to restaurants. Authorities have also issued warnings about the risks in investing in products linked to the metaverse."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, with Chinese stocks in the U.S. plummeting to around 14-year lows. Investors also digested data showing the highest U.S. inflation in 40 years, which drove U.S. bond yields higher and raised expectations that interest rate hikes will be steeper.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.28% by 9:55 PM ET (2:55 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that household spending grew 6.9% month-on-month, but contracted 1.2% year-on-year, in January 2022. The Business Sentiment Index (BSI) Large Manufacturing Conditions index for the first quarter was -7.6.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 1.04%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.83%, with Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe speaking earlier in the day. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s Business NZ purchasing managers' index was 53.6 in February.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 3.23%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.59% and the ShenzhenComponent was down 1.51%. Chinese stocks trading in the U.S. tumbled, with the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index plunging 10% on Thursday, its biggest drop since October 2008. This selloff came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identified five Chinese companies that could be subject to delisting if they fail to comply with certain auditing requirements.
Data released on Thursday showed that the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) grew 7.9% year-on-year and 0.8% month-on-month in February. The core CPI grew 0.5% month-on-month and 6.4% year-on-year.
The data, while within expectations, added to concerns about the economic recovery from the recent rally in commodity markets. This could lead to more hawkish action from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is already expected to hike interest rates when it hands down its policy decision on Mar. 16.
“The biggest risk is inflation,” City Index senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta told Reuters. “Even though central banks will try and rush to get through as much tightening as possible in the first half of the year, I think looking further out, they’re going to struggle if growth really starts to take a hit.”
The European Central Bank kept its interest rate steady at 0% as it handed down its own policy decision on Thursday. However, it accelerated its wind-down of monetary stimulus in a surprise move, signaling that the central bank’s focus is on high inflation rather than weaker economic growth.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield steadied after climbing above 2%, and the 30-year rate hit its highest level since May 2021. Inflationary pressure is adding to the strain on global markets, with little hope of progress in talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict triggered by Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was the latest addition to the list of firms pulling out of Russia over the invasion."

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index plunged as much as 6.4% in early trading, the most since July. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and Trip.com were among the worst performers. Meanwhile the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 3.3%. 
Friday’s selloff comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identified five Chinese firms that could be subject to delisting if they failed to comply with certain auditing requirements. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index sank 10% overnight, its biggest slide since October 2008, even as the Chinese securities regulator said it will cooperate with the U.S.
While analysts say the risks of delisting is unlikely to materialize in the near term, the news unnerved investors already on edge following Beijing’s yearlong crackdown and the fallout from the war in Ukraine. Since its February 2021 peak, the China tech gauge has slumped more than 60%.

Equity benchmarks in Hong Kong and onshore were hit with a fresh bout of volatility this week, with prices fluctuating sharply within sessions on investor jitters.

FDA said in a statement that it had determined the order necessary, citing the risk of harm posed by the recalled products. 
""Taking this action today enables the FDA to mandate that Philips Respironics improve its communication about the recall and the serious risk posed by the foam used in the recalled products with patients,"" the regulator added. 
The company said in a statement it would be working with its durable medical equipment (DME) customers to allow the company to directly contact those patients and other end-users that may not yet have received notice of the recall.

Philips Respironics had recalled some breathing devices and ventilators in June last year because of a foam part that might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer.
The health regulator has also recommended the company to provide monthly updates to device users that include information on expected time for replacement and current rate of replacement of recalled devices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global share markets slid on Thursday as U.S. inflation hit almost 8%, making it almost certain the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, and the European Central Bank sped up the end of its massive stimulus program.
Data showed U.S. consumer inflation running at a 7.9% annualized clip in February, the largest annual increase in 40 years. 
Wall Street fell on the data because, while markets expect the central bank to raise the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting, the CPI data suggested the FOMC could move ""more aggressively"" to curb inflation, as promised by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week.
The ECB earlier in the session said it will stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Talks between Ukraine and Russia on Thursday failed to bring any respite in the conflict, which has trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians in Ukrainian cities sheltering amid Russian air raids and shelling.
The euro retreated from overnight gains following the ECB announcement, and the dollar strengthened on the U.S. inflation report. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2% for the first time in two weeks.
Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, said that some inflation can be beneficial to stock prices, but central banks have their work cut out for them managing inflation that is at multi-decade highs. 
""We've reached that tipping point between good inflation and bad inflation. It is driving volatility higher, and the higher volatility typically drives away investors,"" Brown said.
""Sentiment is very uncertain. Now that we are where we are, can (central bankers) tread that fine line between managing inflation and not pushing us into recession?""

Veneta Dimitrova, senior U.S. economist at Ned Davis Research, said that with the sharp rises in energy and other commodity markets due to the war in Ukraine, it will most likely take longer to reach peak inflation. 
""This means higher inflation for longer and a treacherous policy path for the Fed ahead,"" Dimitrova, adding she expects the Fed to proceed with a 25-basis point interest rate increase next week. 
""With all the geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility out there, the Fed doesn’t want to add to the uncertainty.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street resumed its slide on Thursday, ending in the red as inflation hit a four-decade high, cementing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike key interest rates at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting to prevent the economy from overheating.
Looming uncertainties surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine also helped convince market participants to recommence their flight to safety.
While all three major indexes ended in the red, they pared their losses late in the day and closed well above session lows, as the U.S. equities market followed its best day in months on Wednesday by renewing a multi-session sell-off.
""It's more of the same,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, noting that the equity market's daily volatility is ""being driven more by geopolitical than economic news."" 
Consumer prices surged in February to a 7.9% annual growth rate, according to the Labor Department, the hottest reading in forty years.
""The (CPI) print was not far off estimates,"" Nolte added. ""There will be more to come in the next month or two as some of the rising commodity prices get incorporated."" 
While the market fully expects the central bank to raise the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting, the CPI data suggested the FOMC could move ""more aggressively"" to curb inflation in the upcoming year, as promised by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week.
""It's still expected the Fed will raise rates four to seven times in the next year or two to curb economic growth,"" Nolte said, adding that ""what complicates this, is the Fed has never raised rates with the yield curve this flat and volatility so high.""
""They're trying to increase rates at a time when the market is in turmoil.""
The graphic below shows annual core CPI growth, along with other indicators, and how far they have soared above the Fed's average annual inflation target:
Energy prices were the main culprit, with gasoline prices surging 6.6% in a single month, although the report did not reflect the entirety of spiking crude prices in the wake of Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Those actions kept geopolitical jitters at a full boil, with peace talks showing little progress even as a humanitarian crisis unfolds and world oil supply pressures continued to weigh on global markets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The top shareholder in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and two influential proxy advisory firms joined a growing list of investors on Thursday who oppose the Japanese firm's plan to split up and dismantle the 146-year-old conglomerate. 
It marks the latest in a long battle between the once-mighty tech company and a number of its foreign shareholders as it tries to revive itself following years of accounting scandals and governance issues. 
Toshiba will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 24 to put its plan to split in two, drawn up originally after a five-month strategic review, to a vote. 
Effissimo Capital Management, which owns a stake of about 10% in Toshiba, said in a statement it has decided to vote against the plan, which has been criticised by some other hedge fund shareholders that favour a sale to a private equity firm.
The Singapore-based fund called on Toshiba to establish a trustworthy leadership team first, saying the current management and board are not capable of crafting ""a strategic plan with such irreversible and profound consequences.""
The plan, ""may ultimately damage Toshiba's medium- to long-term corporate value,"" it said.
Separately, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advised against the break-up plan in a report dated Thursday.
""Years of corporate governance turmoil ... a split shareholder base, and an uninspiring management track record raise significant scepticism as to whether the current plan is superior to a privatisation proposal,"" ISS said.
ISS also recommended shareholders vote against a proposal from the second-largest shareholder, Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners, that Toshiba explore other options and solicit buyout offers from private equity firms.
The proposal to direct the board towards more explicitly considering a sale of the company ""appears overly prescriptive and premature given the three months remaining until the company's annual shareholders meeting,"" it said.
Glass Lewis, another influential proxy advisory firm, issued a report later on Thursday recommending against the management-backed break-up and advising acceptance of 3D's proposal to restart the strategic review.
Toshiba's core review of available alternatives was ""overtly narrow"" and not transparent enough to convince investors that the break-up plan was the most compelling path forward, Glass Lewis said. The review also sidestepped urgent investor feedback and widely reported interest from private equity firms, it said. 

Toshiba said in response to the Effissimo statement and the ISS recommendation that it would continue to make every effort to explain its proposal to shareholders to gain their support. It had no immediate comment on Glass Lewis. 
Toshiba earlier this month appointed an interim chief executive after shareholders voiced concerns that management had not appeared able to proceed with the company's restructuring plan in a timely manner.

(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) forecast fourth-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates as the legacy software firm expects its heavy cloud investments to pay off, as more businesses ramp up their spending to support hybrid work and transition to cloud.
The company's strong forecast, which was disclosed on a call with analysts, pulled up its shares from a nearly 6% slide in extended trading triggered by tepid third-quarter profit due to higher spending for its cloud services.
Oracle said it is on track to spend $4 billion in capital expenditure this year as it looks to build more data centers and improve its cloud services that trail behemoths like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said Oracle's plan to increase investment in its cloud business was the ""right move."" ""I do think that's (profit forecast) enough to convince investors Oracle still has room to grow,"" he said.
Oracle said its third-quarter operating expenses were up as the company invested aggressively to meet customer demand for cloud services. Cloud services and license support costs alone rose 23% during the quarter, while total operating expenses were up 8% at $6.69 billion.
Excluding items, it earned $1.13 per share for the quarter ended Feb. 28, missing analysts' estimates of $1.18.
Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said earnings were hit by ""share price declines of equity investments, impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter.""

Revenue was at $10.51 billion, in line with estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted profit to be between $1.40 and $1.44 per share, ahead of estimates of $1.38. It forecast revenue to grow between 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis.

(Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc warned on Thursday that supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half in 2022 to 25,000 vehicles, sending shares of the EV maker down more than 12% in extended trading.
Rivian said as of March 8, it had built 1,410 vehicles this year, and 2,425 since the start of production. It said that during the two weeks prior to March 8 it averaged a weekly production rate that was about twice the exit rate of the fourth quarter of 2021, but it expects supply-chain constraints to continue through 2022.
""As we continue to ramp up our manufacturing facility, manage supply chain challenges, face continued inflationary pressures and minimize price increases to customers in the near term, we expect to recognize negative gross margins throughout 2022,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.
""The 2022 production guidance was disappointing and well short of what they said in their road show, and the fourth-quarter loss was wider than expected,"" said Garrett Nelson, analyst at CFRA Research.
Rivian, other startups and legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) face tough competition from market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc as they aim to start delivering more electric vehicles in the near future.
Rivian reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.46 billion, or $4.83 per share, compared with a year-ago loss of $353 million, or $3.50 per share. It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.
Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a Thursday conference call with analysts that Rivian expects a ""significant"" production ramp-up in the second quarter of the EDV-700 van for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Rivian said it was ""exploring ways to further expand"" its commercial relationship with Amazon, which owns a 20% stake in the startup and has ordered 100,000 vans. Rivian said it will begin producing a second Amazon van this year, the EDV-500, which is shorter and narrower than the EDV-700.
Rivian said it had 83,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup and R1S utility vehicle as of March 8, up from 71,000 in mid-December.

As of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.
The company ended the quarter with $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration will extend requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and in transit hubs through April 18 as public health authorities review when mask requirements should be dropped, the White House confirmed.
The move extends the current requirements that were set to expire March 18 by a month.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in statements Thursday that CDC will work with other government agencies ""to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor.""
The TSA extension comes at the CDC's recommendation. Airline and some government officials think this could be the last nationwide extension of the mask requirements.
Airlines and travel groups last month called on the administration by March 18 to ""repeal the Federal mask mandate for public transportation or provide a clear roadmap to remove the mask mandate within 90 days.""
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on U.S. airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,800 unruly passenger incidents reported -- and 70% involved masking rules.
The CDC last month eased its guidance for wearing masks. U.S. government agencies have dropped mask requirements in federal buildings in the Washington area and other places with low or medium levels of COVID-19.
The CDC said last week that 93% of the U.S. population is in a location where COVID levels are low enough that people do not need to wear masks.
United Airlines said Thursday it would allow 2,200 unvaccinated workers to return to their normal positions as the pandemic recedes. 
The administration is also considering lifting requirements that international visitors get a negative COVID-19 test within a day of travel, officials said, as many countries have dropped testing requirements. The administration requires foreign air travelers to be vaccinated. 
On Thursday, 31 Republican senators asked the administration to end the mask and pre-departure testing requirements. ""It is time for the federal government to recognize this reality, follow the science, and reduce or eliminate these restrictions immediately,"" Senator Roger Wicker said.
The current CDC transit order, which has been in place since soon after Biden took office in January 2021, has been previously extended three times and requires masks to be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares and at transportation hubs such as airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations, and seaports.
His predecessor, President Donald Trump, rejected requests from U.S. public health agencies to impose the requirements in transit - even though airlines and some other transportation modes had required masks.

Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration over the transportation mask mandate. 
""Seat-belt laws likewise took away the 'liberty' to choose driving (or flying) without a seat belt, but losing that choice was not irreparable harm,"" the Justice Department said in response, adding the court should reject Paxton's lawsuit.

(Reuters) - Aircraft lessor BOC Aviation Ltd believes a deadline giving lessors just over two weeks left to end contracts with Russian carriers due to sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine is ""unrealistic"", a senior executive said on Thursday.
""The EU and UK sanctions set, effectively, a deadline of 28 March for termination of aircraft leases, which is frankly an unrealistic timetable for a fleet of approximately 500 aircraft leased into Russia by operating lessors,"" Chief Operating Officer David Walton told analysts, according to an earnings call transcript.
However, he added BOC Aviation would comply with the sanctions and was discussing logistics for the recovery of its planes with customers. 
Russia published a draft law on Thursday that could prevent its airlines returning leased aircraft, raising the stakes in a showdown with Western finance over $10 billion of jets.
BOC Aviation said its 18 planes leased to Russian airlines had a book value of $935 million and could also be affected by insurance policy cancellations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The international aviation insurance markets are progressively cancelling certain elements of insurance policies in relation to aircraft located in Russia or leased to Russian airlines,"" the lessor said in its financial results. ""This is a complex and rapidly developing situation that we are monitoring closely."" 
BOC Aviation, which has 4.8% of its assets by book value leased to Russian airlines, is among the first leasing firms to publicly confirm upheaval in the aviation insurance market. 

The resulting flood of claims and potential writedowns could trigger a lengthy contest between lessors and insurers over liability, according to experts.
BOC Aviation Chief Executive Robert Martin said Russian rental payments had been fully up to date as of the end of February. Russia's domestic aviation market was one of the strongest performers globally during the pandemic.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Six South American nations are proposing the exclusion of fertilizer from sanctions on Russia, a major world producer whose invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supplies, Brazil's Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Thursday.
She said Brazil has secured the support of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay for a proposal excluding fertilizer products that will be submitted to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.
Brazil, an agricultural powerhouse, is the world's top importer of fertilizers and argues that crop nutrients, like food, should not be targeted by sanctions.
Brazil relies on imports for 85% of the fertilizer it needs for its grain crops. More than one-fifth of its imports, totaling 9 million tonnes in 2021, comes from Russia.
Dias, who is expected to talk to FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu, has called on countries to find a global solution for the issue, noting a shortage of fertilizers will cause food inflation and potentially undermine food security. 
She hopes to get enough support from FAO to persuade other U.N. members to back the proposal.
""Global food inflation is something that should worry all countries,"" Dias said in a recent interview.
Even before the war in Ukraine, the global supply of fertilizers, especially potash, was already being curtailed after the United States sanctioned Belarus, another major producer.
As part of Brazil's efforts to secure supplies, Dias and Brazilian company representatives will travel next week to Canada, where  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR), the world's largest global producer of potash, is based.

While Russia is Brazil's main supplier of the NPK fertilizer mixture of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, Canada is Brazil's main source of potash used to raise crop yields.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited Moscow days before the invasion of Ukraine to discuss Russian fertilizer supplies and sales of Brazilian beef.

(Reuters) - In the scramble by some bankers and financial industry executives to leave Moscow, Dubai is turning out to be a favorite location to land. 
Some bankers at Moscow offices of financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Rothschild & Co and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have either left or are considering moving, as operating in Russia becomes increasingly difficult, several sources familiar with the matter said.
Goldman Sachs on Thursday became the first major Wall Street bank to say it was exiting the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, followed swiftly by JPMorgan Chase while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Wednesday it was limiting operations.[nL3N2VD29I]
Employees in Russia worry that they could get caught in the middle of rising tensions between Moscow and the West, sources said. 
It was unclear exactly how many bankers have left Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and how long they might stay abroad. 
Around half of Goldman Sachs employees in Moscow have moved or are in the process of moving to Dubai, sources familiar with the matter said. The bank had around 80 staff in Moscow.
Bloomberg previously reported some Goldman bankers were moving to Dubai. 
A handful of JPMorgan bankers from Moscow are in Dubai, but the bank did not have a formal relocation program, a source familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. 
One Dubai-based banker at a separate international bank said the firm had relocated about four people from Moscow to Dubai, and a few more were coming in the next few days.
Separately, two sources familiar with the situation said Rothschild is considering moving bankers from Russia, and one of the options being considered was Dubai. Rothschild declined comment. 
While Dubai has emerged as a favored destination for many of these people, the sources said, one of the sources said other destinations for departing bankers included Turkey.
""There's no particular playbook,"" said one of the sources, a Moscow-based financial industry professional now in Dubai, when asked how long people were planning on staying. 
Gulf Arab states have so far taken a neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have deep ties with Russia through stakes in companies and the oil cartel OPEC+.
Part of the draw of Dubai is logistics. While a number of countries closed their airspace to Russian planes after the Ukraine invasion, flights have been operating between Moscow and Dubai, a major financial center about five hours away with a time-zone difference of just one hour. 

In a sign of demand, the cheapest one-way airfare from Moscow to Dubai on Emirates jumped as much as 30 fold to $2,369 for departures between Wednesday and Friday, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Flights data showed.

Investing.com -- Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) reported Thursday fourth quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts as improving margins helped bolster results.
Ulta Beauty shares rose 1.5% in after-hours trade following the report.
Ulta Beauty announced earnings per share of $5.36 on revenue of $2.73 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.56 on revenue of $2.69 billion.

(Reuters) - TikTok is nearing a deal for  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to store its U.S. users' information without its Chinese parent ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns over data integrity on the popular short video app, people familiar with the matter said.
The agreement would come a year and a half after a U.S. national security panel ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's communist government.
That order was not enforced after Joe Biden succeeded Donald Trump as U.S. president last year. The panel, however, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has continued to harbor concerns over data security at TikTok that ByteDance is now hoping to address, the sources said. 
It is not clear whether CFIUS will find that TikTok's partnership with Oracle will resolve the national security issues it has identified, the sources said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oracle had discussed acquiring a minority stake in TikTok in 2020, when ByteDance was under U.S. pressure to sell the app. The cloud computing giant will store all of TikTok's U.S. user data on Oracle data servers under the new proposed partnership, the sources said. Some of TikTok's data is currently stored on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud.
A dedicated U.S. data management team of hundreds of people acting as a gatekeeper for U.S. user information and ringfencing it from ByteDance will be set up under the agreement, the sources said. The team will be comprised of engineers and cyber security personnel. The companies are discussing a structure under which that team would operate autonomously and not be under TikTok's control or supervision, the sources added.
TikTok is also exploring partnerships with other technology companies over firewalls and cyber security measures, the sources added. 
A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment on the partnership with Oracle. ""We continue to invest in data security as part of our overall work to keep our users and their information safe,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email.
Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TikTok is one of the world's most popular social media apps, with more than 1 billion active users globally. The information of U.S. users is currently stored in TikTok data centers in Virginia, with a backup in Singapore.
The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.
Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd was forced to sell its popular gay dating app Grindr in 2020 after CFIUS approached it with national security concerns.

ByteDance is one of China's fastest growing startups. It owns the country's leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok's Chinese counterpart Douyin.
The U.S. Commerce Department is considering new rules to address potential security risks from TikTok and other foreign-owned apps, and potentially even ban some of them. The rules, if adopted, could force TikTok to submit to third-party auditing, source code examination and monitoring of user data logs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for a hit to U.S. earnings as oil and other commodity costs skyrocket and major U.S. companies including McDonald's begin to halt sales in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Estimates of the earnings growth for S&P 500 companies have barely budged since the invasion began two weeks ago, but strategists expect that to change as more companies give guidance on earnings for this year. 
The surge in commodity prices remains the biggest risk to profit growth, they said, since overall S&P 500 companies' revenue exposure to Russia is relatively small. 
Prices ""spiked on the Russia-Ukraine turmoil, but they'd been going up pretty fast anyway,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
That means forecasts are likely to ""come down across the board for everything but energy."" Also, he said, ""you're seeing a lot of companies back away from Russia.""
In addition to McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), companies including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia on Tuesday. McDonald's on Wednesday said the temporary closure of its 847 stores in Russia will cost the fast-food chain about $50 million a month. A list of companies that have cut Russia operations and trade can be found here:
One-time costs related to the closures ""could be significant on cash flow"" for some companies, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York.
PRICING IN PROFIT CONCERNS
The recent sharp selloff in stock prices suggests investors already are pricing in an earnings impact, strategists said. The S&P 500 is down about 12% from its Jan. 3 record closing high and the Nasdaq Composite Index earlier this week finished down more than 20% from its November record closing high, confirming it is in a bear market.
The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 is now at about 19, down from more than 22 at the start of the year.
Oil prices this week hit a 14-year high at over $139 a barrel, with the United States and other countries imposing a raft of sanctions aimed at stopping energy exports from Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter.
While higher oil prices benefit energy companies, they are a negative for consumers and businesses alike and are likely to affect a wide range of companies.
The S&P 500 energy sector is up 38% so far in 2022, but it accounts for only about 4% of the S&P 500. Technology accounts for the most, at 27%.
Some strategists have estimated that benefits to energy firms from higher oil prices typically outweigh the drag on earnings of airlines and other companies potentially hurt by higher crude costs, but surging prices for gasoline and other commodities are hitting consumers hard. 
A broad rise in consumer prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday led to the largest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, and inflation is set to accelerate further in the months ahead amid Russia's war against Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.” 
Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month to try to combat inflation, which would leave the economic and profit growth outlook more uncertain. 
The Russia-Ukraine crisis also comes just as many businesses and consumers had begun to operate more normally after two years of living with the coronavirus pandemic. But U.S. profit growth for 2022 already was slated to be much lower than in 2021 when companies experienced a massive bounceback from the pandemic lows. 

U.S. companies next month are expected to begin reporting results on the first quarter. Analysts expect first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to increase 6.2% from a year ago, while they expect second-quarter earnings to grow 5.7%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. S&P 500 profit growth for all of 2022 is estimated at just 8% compared with 52% growth in 2021. 
For the second quarter, ""it's going to come really close to no growth,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of independent research firm the Earnings Scout. ""And third- and fourth-quarter numbers are going to have to come down, too.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 cut losses to end the day above session lows Thursday, amid signs of dip-buying activity after hopes of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were dashed as both sides failed to find a breakthrough in talks on a ceasefire. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, but had been more than 1% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, or 112 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1%.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there was “no progress” on discussions concerning a ceasefire, and said that demands from his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov would amount to a surrender for Ukraine, something the country isn't prepared to do. 
""Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a cease-fire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they're going to get,"" Kuleba said following a sit down with Russia’s Lavrov.
Many had hoped that Ukraine’s softer stance on seeking to join the NATO military alliance – in the days leading up to the meeting – would pave the path toward a diplomatic resolution.
The lack of a breakthrough renewed fears that prices for key commodities including oil, gas, wheat and corn -- key exports from Russia and Ukraine -- will remain elevated, and keep inflation higher for longer.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the IMF expects to cut its global growth estimate next month owing to the economic set back sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The consumer price index rose 0.8% in February, pushing inflation for the year through February to 7.9%, the hottest annual increase since January 1982.
“The risk is that the inflation we are enduring now could become more entrenched, as it did in the 1970s. That is why the Fed is so wedded to raising rates starting in March,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Technology fell nearly 3% as investors fled big tech, though Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bucked the trend after announcing a $10 billion share buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split.
Falling semiconductor stocks also weighed on the tech sector on concerns that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict will exacerbate supply problems for chip companies.
Financials pared their gains from a day earlier as banks were pressured by ongoing flattening in the yield curve in the wake of growing worries that red-hot inflation and slowing economic growth increase the risk of a recession.
U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 4% as it announced Thomas P. Gibbons would be retiring as chief executive on Aug. 31.
“The headwinds for banks is clearly the Russia exposure, but it's also the flattening in the yield curve,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. “Higher rates are fine for banks as long as short term rates are lower, but if that's not the case, that's going to hurt banks.”
Energy stocks was one of the few sectors in the green even as oil prices erased their intraday gains.
The earnings front served up mostly positive results, with Crowdstrike garnering the bulk of investor attention.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) rolled out an upbeat outlook for the full-year after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 12% higher.
Asana (NYSE:ASAN) also reported better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance that surprised to the upside, but the outlook for increased growth will likely prove costly as the company ramps up investment. Its shares fell more than 22%.
“The product/sales expansion is coming at the expense of aggressive investment, which we expect investors to look at cautiously given the challenging macro/geopolitical environment,” Oppenheimer said as it cut price target on the stock to $85 from $100 amid valuation concerns.",,,,,

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) became the first U.S. banks to wind down business in Russia after it invaded Ukraine, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it had gross exposure to Russia of 1.6 billion Swiss francs ($1.73 billion) at the end of last year. 
Goldman Sachs, which has a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million, said on Thursday it was winding down its business there, in a move that will likely increase pressure on rival lenders to follow. Any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation.
Just hours later, JPMorgan said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"" and was not pursuing any new business there.
The largest U.S. bank said its operations in Russia are currently limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations and manage their Russian-related risk, as well acting as a custodian for client assets.
JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. The bank did not list Russia in the top 20 countries where it has the most exposure in its most recent filings.
Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at cutting off Moscow's access to the global financial system in response to its Ukraine invasion.
Banks, insurers and asset managers, which rarely make political statements, have scrambled to distance themselves from Russia and assess their exposures, as the conflict enters its third week.
Credit Suisse was the latest European bank to reveal the size of potential losses, which it said included lending to wealthy clients as well as trade finance and investment banking exposure.
Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) have also disclosed billions of euros worth of Russia risk. In an extreme scenario, banks could lose it all if Moscow seizes assets and sanctions render Russia-related securities worthless. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said its credit-risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was 2.9 billion euros and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
While the potential losses among major European lenders are not big enough to threaten their stability, analysts and investors fear it could derail their turnaround plans and halt payouts to shareholders.
The conflict has also potentially upended planned interest rate increases by the European Central Bank, with its policymakers expected to go into a meeting on Thursday divided as to how to proceed and wary of making mistakes.
BNP Paribas, meanwhile, has cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyber attack, in another sign of how the conflict is hitting Western financial institutions.

The French bank, thought to be the first major lender to have shut staff in Moscow out of its IT networks, has also placed employees in other locations on high alert for cyber threats emanating from Russia.

Investing.com – Stocks waffled on Thursday led by a drop in technology shares after a surge in consumer prices for February showed inflation is running the hottest in 40 years.
Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February over last year, according to the Labor Department. The Federal Reserve meets next week and is widely expected – mostly because the central bank has telegraphed it so – to begin a series of interest rate hikes to calm inflation.
The big wild card of course is Russia's war against Ukraine, which broke out at the end of February and hasn’t been factored into the economic data so far. The war has driven up the costs of oil and other commodities.
Food prices jumped 1.0%, with the cost of food consumed at home soaring 1.4%, Reuters reported. Prices for fruit and vegetables increased by the most since March 2010, the report said, while prices for dairy and related products rose in nearly 11 years.
Gasoline prices in the U.S. are averaging a record $4.318 a gallon, up from $3.469 a month ago, AAA said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the first Wall Street bank to quit operations in Russia, following a bunch of other American companies including McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and  Coca-Cola Co  (NYSE:KO). 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Peloton rentals
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) is testing new pricing plans in which customers pay a monthly fee that covers both its stationary exercise bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses. If a customer cancels, Peloton will take back the bike.
Stores in Texas and Florida will begin bundling $60-$100 monthly subscriptions on Friday. The move comes as the new CEO tries to execute a turnaround after Peloton came under pressure from an activist shareholder to sell the company.
2. Netflix plans
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) won’t start an ad-supported subscription tier despite plans by rival Disney+ to do so, the streaming giant’s CFO said at a conference. 
Netflix is raising prices in the U.K. and Ireland for the second time in less than 18 months. The company is set to raise the price of its most popular subscription plan, which allows customers to watch on two screens at once, to £10.99 per month in the U.K. Netflix's premium plan will rise to £15.99 per month while the entry-level plan will move to £6.99.
3. Rising prices
Consumer prices rose 7.9% year over year last month, and Americans are paying more for fuel, food and rent. Inflation is poised to accelerate this month after the effect of Russia’s war on Ukraine on oil and gasoline prices work their way into the data.

Chile's SMA environmental watchdog had filed charges against the world's largest copper mine in mid-2020, saying it had been exceeding the maximum level allowed for water extraction since 2005, going over the 2019 limit threefold.
""After processing the penalty procedure, the SMA endorsed the charge made against the mining company, showing that the owner caused irreparable environmental damage in Las Vegas de Tilopozo,"" the regulator said in a statement.
BHP denied non-compliance with its environmental permit and said it is evaluating further action.
""Escondida reiterates that at no time did it exceed what was approved by the RCA in the Las Vegas de Tilopozo area, as has been reported to the authority every six months since 2001,"" the company said in a statement.

BHP added that it ceased the extraction of water from high Andean aquifers in 2019 and currently operates only with desalinated water.

EBay saw strong demand from the online shopping boom last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, but is now scrambling to sustain the momentum as people return to regular living.
Moreover, analysts have said that eBay, which is still in the early stages of product innovation, faces tough competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
EBay said the digital wallet would let customers use proceeds from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item or pay their selling expenses.

The company also launched eBay Vault, a digital marketplace and storage facility for trading cards and collectibles, which is expected to launch in the United States in the next quarter. 
Shares of the company fell 1.1% to $52.5 in extended trading.

The company expects adjusted profit to rise about 10% in 2023, it said at its investor day. For fiscal 2024, eBay forecast revenue to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, and adjusted profit to rise about 15%.
Last month, eBay had forecast bleak first-quarter results as it tackles waning online demand, stiff competition and global supply chain disruptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several public advocacy groups on Thursday called on U.S. regulators to block a bid by budget carriers Frontier Group Holdings and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Public Citizen, Fight for the Future, the American Economic Liberties Project and other six groups said in a letter to the Transportation and Justice Departments that a merger between the ultra-low-cost carriers ""would destroy competition in the only competitive market segment of the highly consolidated airline industry.""
The groups added: ""Travelers (NYSE:TRV) will pay higher prices for fewer and lower quality options, workers will lose their jobs, and smaller firms will be muscled out of a once-competitive market segment.""
The carriers did not immediately comment.
Separately, eight progressive lawmakers including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Ray Lujan and Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote U.S. regulators raising concerns about the airline deal valued at $6.6 billion saying the ""resulting Spirit-Frontier carrier could hurt consumers in numerous ways, consolidating market power for the airlines and reducing choices for travelers.""
The Justice Department did not immediately comment. The Transportation Department said it would respond to the lawmakers, adding the ""administration is committed to protecting competition and consumer protection across a wide range of industries.""
The proposed merger comes as the U.S. airline industry is grappling with volatility in travel due to COVID-19. At the same time, costs are soaring on a combination of sharply higher fuel prices and rising wages.
The merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022, is projected to result in synergies of $500 million annually, mainly through operational savings.

The companies pledged to avoid job losses and add 10,000 direct jobs by 2026 and say it would deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings and offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.
The DOJ has filed an antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Thursday announced they were unwinding their Russian businesses, becoming the first major U.S. banks to exit following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and putting pressure on rivals to follow.
Operating in Russia has become harder for Western financial institutions due to international sanctions against that country.
While European banks are the most highly exposed to Russia, U.S. banks still have significant exposure, totaling $14.7 billion, according to Bank of International Settlements data.
""Goldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,"" the bank said in an emailed statement.
JPM said in a statement: ""In compliance with directives by governments around the world, we have been actively unwinding Russian business and have not been pursuing any new business in Russia."" 
Current activities are limited, and it is helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations, manage Russian-related risk, act as a custodian to clients and take care of employees, JPM said. 
Goldman will wind down the operations rather than exit them immediately and any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
In the aftermath of Russia's invasion last month of Ukraine, around half of Goldman Sachs employees in Moscow have moved or are moving to Dubai, three sources familiar with the matter said. The bank had around 80 staff members in Moscow. 
Some of the relocated staff will be involved in the winding down, working with colleagues still in Moscow, the sources said.
Goldman's Russia head is understood to be remaining in Moscow, one source said. 
In its annual filing, the bank had disclosed a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million.
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 2.8% to $325.97 in midday trading. Up to the close of trading on Wednesday, GS had fallen 12.8% this year.
The biggest exposed U.S. bank is  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which said on Wednesday it was operating its Russian consumer business on a more limited basis while sticking with its previous plans to divest the franchise.
Citigroup has total Russian exposure of nearly $10 billion and its chief financial officer has warned that in a ""severe stress scenario"" its loss might be half that.
Citigroup might be able to spread the pain of any Russia losses over several quarters by recording expenses to build reserves on some assets before the losses are final, said analyst David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors.
""It might put pressure on earnings for the next couple of quarters,"" Hendler said.
Other U.S. banks operating in Russia include JPMorgan, which declined to comment on what its plans were. 
Goldman Sachs was seventh overall in generating investment banking income in Russia's last year, with Russia's VTB Capital top, JPMorgan second with $32.8 million,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fourth with $27.3 million and Citigroup fifth with $22.8 million. Goldman Sachs generated $19.5 million last year, according to Refinitiv data.

In Europe, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is considering leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters previously. 
Banks will find it hard to extricate themselves from the market, however, experts have said, with the process taking months or even years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock splits are becoming fashionable for megacap U.S. companies.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) unveiled a 20-for-1 stock split late on Wednesday, only weeks after megacap peer Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) did the same.
Other companies that have split their shares since 2020 include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
""It’s a little bit of follow the leader,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""You had Apple, you had Tesla, and just recently you had Alphabet.”
Though a company may decide to split its stock for various reasons, a cheaper price may make the shares more appealing to some investors, analysts said.
While a stock split ""does not affect company fundamentals"", it ""can increase liquidity by making shares more accessible to a wider range of investors,"" BofA Global Research analysts said in a note.
BofA found that splits ""historically are bullish"" for companies that enact them, with their shares marking an average returns of 25% one year later versus 9% for the market overall.
""Once the split is executed, investors who have wanted to gain or increase exposure may start to rush for the chance to buy,"" BofA said in the note.
Stock splits also significantly lower the per-contract price of trading options, which have been increasingly used by individual investors in recent years and so can potentially attract more retail players to the stock, according to some analysts.
For Amazon, the split may also be a way to recharge stock performance. The company's shares on Tuesday marked their lowest closing level since June 2020 and are still down 20% since mid-November amid a broad swoon for growth stocks. Amazon shares were up nearly 6% on Thursday after the company also announced a $10 billion buyback plan.
Amazon remains one of the biggest influences on the market-cap weighted S&P 500, with a market value of about $1.5 trillion.
As they did when Google-parent Alphabet announced its split, investors speculated on whether Amazon's stock split could pave the way for its addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. At around $2,900 a share, Amazon's current price is too unwieldy for the blue-chip Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that high-priced stocks have an outsized influence. 
The split would reduce its stock price to about $145 a share, putting it in the middle of the 30-member Dow, whose highest priced component is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) at around $485 a share.

""Do Google or Amazon’s managements care about becoming Dow stocks like Apple?"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, asked in a research note. ""From a purely financial perspective, probably not; very little capital is indexed to the Average.""
However, Colas added: ""From the perspective of corporate recognition, the answer is likely 'perhaps'.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines said Thursday it will allow unvaccinated employees to return to their jobs starting March 28 and asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a legal challenge to the COVID-19 mandate as moot.
The Chicago-based U.S. carrier said in a memo about 2,200 employees had received vaccine-related reasonable accommodations after it had become the first major U.S. airline to mandate employee vaccines. 
""We plan to welcome back those employees who have been out on an approved (accommodation) to their normal positions starting"" March 28, the memo said.
United told a federal appeals court Thursday the new policy was ""due to substantial changes in the scope and severity of the pandemic as well as the guidance of public-health authorities.""
United said the change applies to all employees who were placed on temporary unpaid leave as well as those temporarily placed in other jobs.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) in December said that, of the company's 67,000 employees, about 200 did not comply with United's mandate and were fired. A United official said the airline has no plans to rehire those employees.
The memo noted the sharp decline in COVID-19 cases in the United States and that the CDC recently relaxed its mask guidelines.
The memo added, ""Of course, if another variant emerges or the OVID trends suddenly reverse course, we will reevaluate he appropriate safety protocols at that time.
A U.S. appeals court last month ordered a new review of a lower court decision not to block United from enforcing its employee vaccine mandate. United said Thursday the issue was now moot.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to return the issue to a U.S. District judge who rejected a request for an injunction blocking the mandate while employees argue their case against it.

In a scathing dissent, Judge Jerry E. Smith said ""for every conceivable reason that the (employees) could lose this appeal, they should.""
Kirby in December defended the employee mandate: ""We did this for safety. We believe it saved lives.""

Investing.com --  After Disney+ announced its ad-supported subscription tier, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) revealed it has no plans to provide the same for its consumers, TechCrunch reported on Thursday.
Netflix shares are up 1% Thursday. 
Speaking at The  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann is said to have explained that Netflix is not against advertising, but the company currently has no plans for the model. Neumann was quoted as saying it is ""not something that's in our plans.""
Questions were put to the Netflix CFO about advertising potentially decreasing the entrance price for Netflix's service and allowing it to compete as it grows into global markets where pricing may be sensitive to countries.
However, Neumann defended the current model, focusing on ""optimizing for long-term revenue"" and giving the best possible experience to customers.
The dilemma Netflix faces with a potential ad-supported model is that while it may help reduce a subscription cost, it will also potentially negatively impact the end-user experience.
However, the CFO did state that an ad-supported model is a possibility as long as the goal of offering users the best experience is not tarnished.
TechCrunch quoted Neumann as saying, ""right now, we think we have a great model and a subscription business that scales globally really well."" 
""We were about a $20 billion revenue business two years ago… we're $30 billion revenue now. The growth is healthy across every region of the world.""
Consumers debate Netflix's strategy, with some arguing that near-term growth is the best option, especially after the firm failed to meet Wall Street's subscriber growth forecasts for Q4. Furthermore, Netflix has had to contend with ever-rising competition in recent years.
In other Netflix news Thursday, the company is raising prices in the U.K. and Ireland for the second time in less than 18 months, according to a report by Reuters. The company is set to raise the price of its most popular subscription plan, which allows customers to watch on two screens at once, to £10.99 per month in the U.K. Netflix's premium plan will rise to £15.99 per month while the entry-level plan will move to £6.99."

(Reuters) - Victims of America's opioid epidemic confronted members of the Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma on Thursday with wrenching stories of suffering they said was caused by the painkillers that built the company fortune.
""You got rich off our dead bodies and told us it was our own fault for dying,"" Ryan Hampton told Richard Sackler, a former board member, during a Zoom hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
The emotional court hearing stemmed from a $6 billion settlement between the Sacklers and state attorneys general that could resolve claims over the family's role in the crisis without taking them to trial.
Purdue Pharma allegedly downplayed the addiction risks of its OxyContin painkiller, helping to fuel a healthcare crisis that has claimed more than 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing. They said last week in a statement that they ""sincerely regret"" that OxyContin ""unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.""
The 26 speakers were chosen by the official committee that represents creditors in Purdue's bankruptcy, including the thousands of people who filed personal injury claims against Purdue Pharma.
Their stories included the loss of a twin, a Korean War veteran begging his grandson for pills and anguished parents struggling to cope with loss and anger directed at the Sacklers.
David Sackler and Theresa Sackler attended by Zoom and David's father Richard Sackler did not appear on the video but told the court he was listening by phone. The Sacklers were not permitted to respond to the victims' statements and Hampton said they did not appear to react.
Kristy Nelson of Indiana played a recording of the emergency call she placed when she discovered her overdosed son and can be heard screaming, ""Oh my god he's dead!"" as the operator tries to extract information about her location.
While many U.S. overdose deaths were caused by illicit drugs such at heroin and fentanyl, often victims became addicted to opioids through pain medicines such as OxyContin prescribed for high school sports injuries or recovery from surgery.
Photographer Nan Goldin said an OxyContin addiction that began in 2014 almost ended her 50-year career, reducing her to a ""hermetic state"" in which she barely left her room for three years. She said the Sacklers should not be allowed to buy respectability through naming agreements with museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre, calling it ""toxic philanthropy."" 
""Their legacy is forever tainted,"" Goldin said.
Richard Sackler told the bankruptcy court in August that the family did not bear responsibility for the crisis. At the same hearing, his son David testified that the family has a ""moral responsibility"" to help curb the opioid epidemic.
Both served as Purdue board members along with several other members of the family and have been named in lawsuits alleging they directed deceptive marketing of addictive painkillers.

Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019, and the court extended to the Sacklers legal protections from being sued - one of the main benefits of seeking bankruptcy - despite the family members never filing for bankruptcy themselves.
That controversial protection is being challenged in court by the U.S. Department of Justice.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday tapped federal prosecutor Kevin A. Chambers to lead the department's efforts to help investigate fraudsters who used the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to bilk government assistance programs.
Chambers' appointment as the Justice Department's chief pandemic fraud prosecutor was previewed by President Joe Biden during last week's State of the Union address.
Chambers currently serves as the associate deputy attorney general, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
He worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 2010 through 2014, and then worked at the law firm of Latham & Watkins. From June 2018 through January 2021, he served as the co-chair of the firm's Washington, D.C., litigation and trial department.
The Justice Department said Chambers intends to focus his efforts on larger-scale criminal enterprises and foreign actors, and that he will be setting up strike teams to prepare for the next wave of cases.
Tackling criminal and civil fraud stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has been a Justice Department priority.
In May 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. That group, led by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, will meet on Thursday and formally announce Chambers' new role.
Many of the fraud cases the department investigates are pegged to U.S. government assistance programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program, unemployment insurance and Medicare.
To date, the Justice Department said its enforcement efforts have alleged fraud tied to $8 billion in pandemic relief. 

It has brought over 1,000 criminal cases involving losses of $1.1 billion, and charged more than 1,800 individuals and businesses in civil litigation alleging fraud in more than $6 billion worth of loans.
“We will continue to hold accountable those who seek to exploit the pandemic for personal gain, to protect vulnerable populations, and to safeguard the integrity of taxpayer-funded programs,"" Garland said in a statement.

The company on Wednesday announced a 20-for-1 stock split, its first since 1999, and a $10 billion share buyback. It comes on the heels of a similar split announced by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc earlier this year.
""Amazon's management is looking to instill fresh confidence,"" AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould said, adding that the buyback was the company's first direct distributions of cash back to its shareholders since its stock market debut.
Amazon shares were up 5.4% to $2,936.99 in early trading on Thursday. The company's stock closed at $2,785.58 on Wednesday, near a two-year low after riding a pandemic-induced rally in tech and growth shares that brought it within striking distance of a $2 trillion valuation mark.
Amazon's stock ticker was trending on investor-focused social media site stocktwits.com and was among the most discussed on Reddit's wallstreetbets, according to sentiment aggregator Swaggystocks.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rallied sharply after their stock splits in 2020.
Amazon's stock split ""just makes inexperienced investors and traders feel better,"" said Perri Dong, a China-based portfolio manager at Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Winslow LLC, who said he owns Amazon shares. 
""It's just psychological. Some people believe the shares will have more liquidity, but I argue it doesn't matter."" 
Amazon shares have struggled along with other growth stocks in 2022, falling 16.5% year-to-date as of Wednesday's close. 
""To state the obvious, buybacks also suggest Amazon sees value in the stock here,"" BofA Global Research analysts said in a note, adding that the repurchases would amount to about 0.7% of shares outstanding.
The company went public in 1997 at an IPO price of $18, or $1.50 when adjusted for stock splits that occurred in 1998 and 1999. The latest stock split will take effect on June 6.

Amazon's share surge on Thursday was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market, where shares of megacap companies such as Apple and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were trading lower.

""The process of integration and creation of a European defence and the increase in defence spending in EU and neighbouring countries could be accelerated, creating opportunities for companies operating in the sector,"" the group said in a statement on 2021 results.
It added its exposure to operators directly affected by sanctions against Russia was around 30 million euros ($32.97 million), with an order backlog with Moscow of about 25 million euros. 
The exposure to Ukraine was negligible.
The state-controlled group said it was monitoring the geopolitical situation closely and was aligned with Italy's government policies.
Last year Leonardo reported a free cash flow of 209 million euros and a 142% rise in net profit to 587 million euros, beating full-year guidance.
Revenue was up 5% to reach 14.1 billion euros, driven by sales in the governmental and defence businesses, which accounted for 88% of total.
""We are confirming our target of generating a cumulative 3 billion euro of cash flow over 2021-2025, with a significant step up in 2022,"" CEO Alessandro Profumo said, adding the group would return to paying a dividend based on its 2021 earnings.
This year, free operating cash flow is seen rising to 500 million euros and revenue is expected to be between 14.5 billion and 15 billion euros.
All the businesses have recovered pre-pandemic levels, excluding the Aerostructures division, which is under restructuring, the group said, adding it was seeing signs of recovery in the civil aeronautics business.

Germany, which has long played down the role of its military in foreign policy, as well as Denmark and Poland have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.

According to a statement from Erdogan's office, he also told Biden that Turkey expected its request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernise its existing fleet to be finalised as soon as possible.
Ankara had initially ordered more than 100 F-35 jets, made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), but the United States removed Turkey from the programme in 2019 after it acquired Russian S-400 missile defence systems.
Turkey has called the move unjust and demanded reimbursement for its $1.4 billion payment.
Reuters reported last year that Ankara had made a request to Washington to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16s and nearly 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes.
Turkey's purchase of the S-400s has also triggered U.S. sanctions. In December 2020, Washington blacklisted Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate, its chief, Ismail Demir, and three other employees.
A readout of Thursday's call from the White House did not mention a discussion about sanctions or Turkey's request regarding the F-16s. 
But it said Erdogan and Biden had talked about opportunities to strengthen ties, in addition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in recent years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankara's closer ties with Moscow, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and erosion of rights and freedoms in Turkey.
Washington has repeatedly warned Turkey against buying further Russian weaponry. Ankara has said it intends to go through with the purchase of a second batch of S-400s from Russia, a move that could worsen the diplomatic rift with the United States.

The request for the jets will likely have a difficult time getting approval from the U.S. Congress, where sentiment towards Turkey has soured deeply over recent years.
Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers urged the Biden administration in October not to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and said they were confident Congress would block any such exports.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 moved off lows Thursday, but remained under pressure as hopes of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict suffered a setback, while inflation surged to fresh 40-year highs.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, or 269 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there was “no progress” on discussions concerning a ceasefire, and said that demands from his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov would amount to a surrender for Ukraine, something the country isn't prepared to do. 
""Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a cease-fire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they're going to get,"" Kuleba said following a sit down with Russia’s Lavrov.
Many had hoped that Ukraine’s softer stance on seeking to join the NATO military alliance – in the days leading up to the meeting – would pave the path toward a diplomatic resolution.
The lack of a breakthrough renewed fears that prices for key commodities including oil, gas, wheat and corn -- key exports from Russia and Ukraine -- will remain elevated, and keep inflation higher for longer.
The consumer price index rose 0.8% in February, pushing inflation for the year through February to 7.9%, the hottest annual increase since January 1982.
“The risk is that the inflation we are enduring now could become more entrenched, as it did in the 1970s. That is why the Fed is so wedded to raising rates starting in March,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Technology fell nearly 3% as investors fled big tech, though Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bucked the trend after announcing a $10 billion share buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split.
Falling semiconductor stocks also weighed on the tech sector on concerns that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict will exacerbate supply problems for chip companies.
Financials pared their gains from a day earlier as banks were pressured by ongoing flattening in the yield curve in the wake of growing worries that red-hot inflation and slowing economic growth increase the risk of a recession.
U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 5% as it announced Thomas P. (Todd) Gibbons would be retiring as chief executive on Aug. 31.
“The headwinds for banks is clearly the Russia exposure, but it's also the flattening in the yield curve,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. “Higher rates are fine for banks as long as short term rates are lower, but if that's not the case, that's going to hurt banks.”
Energy stocks was one of the few sectors in the green even as oil prices erased their intraday gains.
The earnings front served up mostly positive results, with Crowdstrike garnering the bulk of investor attention.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) rolled out an upbeat outlook for the full-year after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 12% higher.
Asana (NYSE:ASAN) also reported better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance that surprised to the upside, but the outlook for increased growth will likely prove costly as the company ramps up investment. Its shares fell more than 23%.
“The product/sales expansion is coming at the expense of aggressive investment, which we expect investors to look at cautiously given the challenging macro/geopolitical environment,” Oppenheimer said as it cut price target on the stock to $85 from $100 amid valuation concerns."

Putin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country which could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain. 
""These sanctions would have been imposed in any case,"" Putin told a meeting of the Russian government. ""There are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now.
""In the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty,"" he told a televised government meeting two weeks after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine.
His comments were designed to portray Western sanctions as self-defeating and reassure Russians that the country can withstand what Moscow is calling an ""economic war"" against its banks, businesses and business oligarchs.
Putin said Moscow - a major energy producer that supplies a third of Europe's gas - would continue to meet its contractual obligations even though it has been slammed with comprehensive sanctions including a ban on U.S. purchases of its oil.
""They announced that they are closing the import of Russian oil to the American market. Prices there are high, inflation is unprecedentedly high, has reached historic highs. They are trying to blame the results of their own mistakes on us,"" he said. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it.""
Hitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier it had banned exports of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of 2022.
In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers, turbines and other goods.
'WE WILL SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS'
Speaking calmly, Putin acknowledged that sanctions imposed since the Feb. 24 invasion were being felt.
""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.
""Gradually, people will orient themselves, they will understand that there are simply no events that we cannot close off and solve.""
Putin noted that Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers, and said there would be inevitable ""negative consequences"" for world food markets if the West made problems for Russia.
His agriculture minister reported at the meeting that the country's food security was ensured.
Speaking at the same meeting, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia had taken measures to limit the outflow of capital and that the country would service its external debts in roubles, not in dollars.
""Over the last two weeks Western countries have in essence waged an economic and financial war against Russia,"" he said.

Siluanov said the West had defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its gold and foreign currency reserves. It was trying to halt foreign trade, he said.
""In these conditions the priority is for us to stabilise the situation in the financial system,"" Siluanov said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) has started the sale process of its towers business and expects indicative offers in the next couple of weeks, three sources with knowledge of the deal said.
The German company is working with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as advisor in the sale of its 40,600 masts, in a deal that could value the business at close to 18 billion euros ($19.9 billion), two of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A Deutsche Telekom spokesperson said the group was in the process of reviewing several options for the tower business - as announced last year on its capital markets day. 
Telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years as telecom companies seek to reduce debt and costs.
Deutsche Telekom needs cash to cut a massive debt pile of more than 130 billion euros and free up funds for investment in infrastructure and to secure the control of its U.S. business T-Mobile, which accounts for three-fifths of group sales.
Spanish mobile telephone infrastructure operator Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) are both readying offers, two of the sources said, as they race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.
Cellnex, Goldman Sachs and American Tower declined to comment. 
American Tower and Cellnex are the two largest independent tower operators in Europe. Cellnex has 130,000 tower sites in its portfolio.
American Tower has nearly 220,000 towers globally and a quarter of them in Europe, and about 170,000 towers are still owned by mobile network operators.
The deal may also attract interest from private equity groups or competitors such as Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s Vantage or Orange's Totem.
Vantage has about 82,000 towers, while Totem has just 26,000.
Vodafone CEO Nick Read said in February that the next step for Vantage Towers should be a merger and Orange's Stephane Richard has flagged the possibility of joining Totem with one of the other operators in Europe.
While the conflict in Ukraine is prompting companies hoping to list shares to put plans on ice, mergers and acquisitions in the telecom industry are still happening.

This week, France's Orange (PA:ORAN) and Spain's MasMovil announced talks on a Spanish merger.

470,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s embrace of Rivian Automotive Inc., last year’s electric-vehicle startup darling, is waning already as the company has lost about $117 billion in market value in just four months. 
Analysts are paring back their expectations for this once-hyped stock ahead of Rivian’s fourth-quarter results, which are due after the market close on Thursday. At least four analysts have lowered their price targets this month by an average of 40%, according to Bloomberg data.  
The cuts come amid concerns that the war in Ukraine will further exacerbate the intense supply-chain problems that plagued the auto industry last year.  
“With investors increasingly concerned about Rivian’s production ramp combined with its inability to combat cost inflation with price increases, we have trimmed our price target to $47 from $115,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to clients on March 8. Johnson maintained his hold equivalent rating on the stock. 
The electric-truck manufacturer’s initial public offering in November coincided with heightened investor appetite for all things EV, driving its market valuation to $153 billion at its peak a few weeks after the IPO. Barely four months later that value stands at about $36 billion, as the market sours on growth stocks amid concerns about growing inflation and an impending tightening of monetary policy -- not to mention the rising risks to the automotive supply chain. 
These sector-wide headwinds are bound to weigh heavily on newer EV companies, given the soaring costs of battery raw materials such as lithium and nickel. But Rivian’s challenges go much further, as seen in the company’s recent flipflop on a decision about the price of its trucks. 
Rivian said on March 1 that it would raise the prices on its debut vehicles for retail buyers, citing “unprecedented” supply-chain shortages. Then, two days later it back tracked after being hit by customer cancellations. That did not sit well with investors, who sent the stock down 32% over five trading sessions.
“Rivian needs to reassure its investors and customers that it has a handle on its supply chain and can accurately forecast what its costs will be and how it will price its trucks,” said Greg Martin, managing director and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities. 
Still, the average analyst price target on Rivian is fairly high at around $116, with 11 analysts rating it a buy, four recommending holding and only one with a sell rating. The reason is despite its issues, Rivian is still considered the best-positioned startup to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. in the rapidly growing EV market.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, whose last published note on the company was on Dec. 17 after the third-quarter results, is waiting for the company’s 2022 production target in order to update his model. Rivian’s “fair value is now dependent on its Street credibility,” he said.

The Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) this week said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland. 
Rio Tinto has a joint venture with Rusal International PJSC, holding 80% of Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd (QAL), Australia's second-largest refinery processing alumina, the chemical compound that contains aluminium. Rusal owns the remaining 20%. Being the majority stakeholder in the joint venture may make it more difficult for Rio to relinquish its ties with Rusal.
Rio Tinto also has a supply and offtake contract with Rusal Aughinish, Europe's largest alumina refinery in Ireland, which it is also looking to halt.
GLENCORE
The Swiss trader and miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) has a 10.5% stake in EN+ Group , which it said last week it is reviewing as well as its 0.57% stake in oil giant Rosneft . Rosneft's boss Igor Sechin is under British, European Union and U.S. sanctions.
Glencore did not comment further on Thursday and did not explain what the review of the stakes entails.
KINROSS GOLD
The Canadian gold miner  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC) said last week it was suspending its Russian operations, including its Udinsk development project and its Kupol mine in northeastern Russia.
BHP GROUP
The world's largest mining company BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said it does not sell into Russia, nor does it have any investments or commercial arrangements in Russia or with Russian organisations. 

ANGLO AMERICAN 
The London-listed miner  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) said it has no operations or offices in Russia, but it is ""assessing any commercial relationships with Russian businesses to ensure we make the right decisions.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Steve Rowe will step down as chief executive of Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) in May after six years in the job, with the British retailer opting for continuity by choosing two of his senior lieutenants as his successor.
Rowe, who joined M&S at the age of 15 before rising through the ranks, will step down after the food and clothing retailer reports annual results on May 25.
His tenure in one of the most high-profile jobs in British business has been turbulent as he, along with chairman Archie Norman, has sought to transform M&S by improving the quality and value of its clothing and food products, overhauling its store estate and investing heavily in technology and e-commerce, including a venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group Plc that took M&S food online for the first time.
Having steered the retailer through the pandemic he exits as hopes are rising that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise after more than a decade of false dawns.
M&S shares, which closed on Thursday at 159 pence, were trading at nearly four pounds when Rowe became CEO in April 2016. 
The group said current joint chief operating officers, Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe, will take over Rowe's responsibilities in an unconventional structure.
Machin will become CEO and will take on responsibility for day-to-day leadership of the business and the executive committee.
He will keep oversight of his current responsibilities, which include the leadership of M&S's food business, as well as operations, property, store development and technology, and will take on responsibility for human resources and corporate communications.
Bickerstaffe will become co-CEO with a focus on driving M&S's strategy of selling across multiple platforms, while retaining her existing responsibilities for clothing & home, MS2, international and financial services.
Both Machin and Bickerstaffe will join M&S's PLC board on May 25.
Machin, Bickerstaffe and Chief Financial Officer Eoin Tonge had been the favourites to succeed Rowe.
Tonge has been promoted to chief strategy & finance officer, playing an enhanced role in leading the future development of the business.
""The board's view is that under the current team, the business has made remarkable progress and that continuity of strategy and leadership is advantageous,"" M&S said.

However, some observers were left baffled by the new structure, saying it contradicted M&S's stated desire for a leaner, simpler business.
Rowe will cease being an M&S employee after its annual shareholders' meeting on July 5 but remain an adviser for up to a year.

The leather goods maker beat market expectations on Thursday with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 24.2 million euros ($26.6 million) versus a 3 million euro analyst forecast in a company-provided consensus.
Tod's, however, still posted a net loss last year of 5.9 million euros.
""Year-to-date sales trends in our stores are very good, confirming the growing appreciation of customers for both our brands and products,"" founder and main shareholder Diego Della Valle said.
The group said it decided not to pay any dividend.

Investing.com -- TikTok and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are close to finalizing an agreement to allow Oracle to keep TikTok's U.S. users' data in its servers without giving ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, access, according to a report from Reuters Thursday.
The news comes barely a year and a half after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered ByteDance to remove its app, TikTok, from the market due to concerns about U.S. data being exposed and accessible by the Chinese government.
CFIUS's concerns over TikTok's data protection have persisted, but no action has been taken since Biden's takeover as President from Trump, with hopes of ByteDance addressing these issues further.
Oracle played a crucial role in potentially acquiring a minor stake in TikTok during the scrutiny faced by ByteDance in 2020. Now, the near deal will see storage of all TikToks' U.S. user data on Oracle's data servers, sources from Reuters state. This will be in addition to some of TikTok's information already being stored on Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud.
TikTok is also looking at forming agreements with other technology companies to work on various security measures.
While the news may be seen as a positive for Oracle, its share price has seen little reaction, up 0.24% Thursday following Wednesday's 3.78% gain. "

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded 1.1% lower Thursday on reports the Federal Aviation Administration is readying three safety directives for Boeing to implement so that some of its 777 planes, grounded for more than a year, can return to flying.  
The directives cover Boeing 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.
According to Reuters, the engines are on only a small number of older 777s operated by Japan Airlines Ltd ADR (OTC:JAPSY), United (NASDAQ:UAL),  ANA Holdings Inc  ADR (OTC:ALNPY),  Korean Air Lines Co  (KS:003490),  Asiana Airline  (KS:020560) and  Jin Air  Co Ltd (KS:272450).
The manufacturer must now develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements, the Reuters report said. The bulletin will need the FAA’s approval before the planes can return to service.
The new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, call for enhanced inspections and modifications.
One directive requires the installing of debris shields on the thrust reverser inner wall, inspecting fan cowl doors for moisture ingression and repetitive checks of the hydraulic pump shutoff valves. Another requires modifying the engine inlet to withstand fan blade failure events. A third requires specific corrective actions depending on inspection results.
In a February 2021 incident, a United Airlines 777 showered debris over nearby cities, shortly after takeoff from Denver. No one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The directives will take effect in mid-April."

The bank said it would strive for a post-tax return on tangible equity (ROTE) - a key profit metric - of more than 10% by 2025.
The more ambitious goal comes as many investors still doubt whether Deutsche will achieve this year's target of 8%, which the bank is firmly standing by, though it acknowledged increased uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. 
The new roadmap is the first since the bank embarked on a major overhaul in 2019, which involved exiting some businesses and cutting thousands of jobs after years of losses.
Under Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, Deutsche has made progress, delivering its most profitable year in a decade last year.
But analysts' consensus is for the bank to achieve a ROTE of just 6% this year.
""For the full year 2022, we continue to expect to deliver a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8%,"" said Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke.
Deutsche is also aiming for a cost-to-income ratio of below 62.5% for 2025. That compares with 2021's ratio of 84.6% and the bank's target of 70% this year.

GREENVILLE, S.C. (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Thursday reiterated its 2022 earnings forecast, but said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to business uncertainty.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate last month warned that its profits would suffer in the first half of this year due to persistent supply-chain and inflationary pressures.
A run-up in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has worsened the situation.
At the company's first in-person investor meeting in more than two years, Chief Executive Larry Culp said the company's outlook has not incorporated the potential fallout of the situation in Ukraine as there are ""too many uncertainties.""
""Like every company directly or indirectly exposed to what's happening, there's more uncertainty today with respect to what lies ahead than we saw just a month ago,"" Culp said.
""There are really things we don't know.""
Culp said GE would be ""hyper-focused"" on controlling the things it can control.
On Tuesday, the company said it has suspended its operations in the country and is working with authorities to ensure compliance with sanctions.
Culp said Russia accounts for less than 2% of the company's overall sales. Its power business, however, has a bigger exposure to the country.
Russia's invasion has also put the supplies of titanium from the country in doubt. The metal is used in the aerospace industry to make landing gear, blades and turbine discs.
GE said its aviation unit uses Russian supplies for just two parts for which it has more than a year of inventory on the shelf. Overall, it sources just 1% of its titanium supplies from Russia. 
Mounting concerns about supply-chain and inflation have hurt GE's shares, which are down 11% since mid-January. Its shares were down 1.2% at $90.12 in mid-day trade.
The company has said it is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is also trying to source alternative parts to help to deal with shortages.
GE, which last November said it would split into three public companies, reaffirmed the timeline for the spin-offs.
It plans to spin off its healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company next year. It would combine its power and renewable energy units, and spin off that operation in 2024. Following the split, it will become an aviation company.
GE expects to post high-single-digit revenue growth this year on the back of a more than 20% increase in aviation revenue.

Adjusted profit for the year is projected to be in the range of $2.80 per share to $3.50 per share. It also expects to grow its profit margin by 150 basis points and to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.
The company expects to generate about $10 billion in adjusted operating profit and more than $7 billion in free cash flow in 2023.

(Reuters) - European gas prices have risen as sanctions on Russia have been tightened over its invasion of Ukraine and amid fears of supply disruptions.
Earlier this week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia was fulfilling its gas supply obligations but that it would be entirely within its rights to retaliate against the European Union after Germany last month froze the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
The arrival of Russian troops at two gas compressor stations in eastern Ukraine poses a risk to European supplies, Ukraine's gas pipeline operator warned on Thursday, but there were no signs of an immediate impact on flows.
HOW RELIANT IS EUROPE ON RUSSIAN GAS?
Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas, with most transported by pipeline. Rystad Energy estimates 52 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year comes to Europe via Ukraine or nearby routes, while total Russian supplies to Europe are about 150 bcm to 190 bcm.
Some pipelines transit Ukraine, while others take alternative routes, such as Yamal-Europe, which crosses Belarus and Poland to Germany, and Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany.
Most European countries have cut reliance on Russian gas in recent years. In 2021, the Ukraine transit corridor was mainly used for gas going to Slovakia and then to Austria and Italy.
U.S. President Joe Biden this week imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022.
Other countries are trying to wean themselves off Russian gas. The EU has said it wants to cut Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies ""well before 2030"".
WHERE ELSE CAN EUROPE GET SUPPLY FROM? 
Some countries have alternative supply options and Europe's gas network is linked up so supplies can be shared, although the global gas market was tight even before the Ukraine crisis.
Germany, Europe's biggest consumer of Russian gas which has halted certification of the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, could import gas from Britain, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands via pipelines.
Norway's Equinor said it is considering ways to produce more gas from its Norwegian fields during the upcoming summer in Europe, a season in which output is normally affected by maintenance.
Southern Europe can receive Azeri gas via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline to Italy and the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) through Turkey.
The United States, which exports shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has also sought to help Europe by asking LNG producers at home and abroad to ramp up supplies.
LNG imports to northwest Europe, including from the United States, have hit record highs this year.
But Qatar, one of the world's top LNG producers, has said no single country can replace Russian supplies to Europe, with most volumes tied to long-term supply contracts.
Europe's LNG terminals also have limited capacity for extra imports, although some European countries say they are looking at ways to expand imports and storage.
Britain, which is much less reliant on Russian gas than its European neighbours, has said it will look at all options to boost energy supplies.
ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS TO COPE WITH A GAS SUPPLY CRUNCH?
Several nations could seek to fill any gap in energy supplies by turning to electricity imports via interconnectors from neighbouring states or by boosting power generation from nuclear, renewables, hydropower or coal.
The European Commission said this week that gas and LNG from countries like the United States and Qatar could this year replace 60 billion cubic metres (bcm), of the gas Europe gets annually from Russia. By 2030, increased biomethane and hydrogen use could also help.
New wind and solar projects could replace 20 bcm of gas demand this year, while tripling capacity by 2030, adding 480GW of wind and 420 GW of solar energy, could save 170 bcm a year.
Turning down thermostats by 1°C could save an extra 10 bcm this year, while by 2030, replacing gas boilers with 30 million heat pumps could save 35 bcm, the Commission added.
Nuclear availability is falling in Belgium, Britain, France and Germany as plants are facing outages as they age or are decommissioned or phased out.
Europe has been trying to shift away from coal to meet climate targets but some coal plants have been switched back on since mid-2021 because of surging gas prices. 
Germany has said it could extend the life of coal or nuclear plants to cut reliance on Russian gas.
The head of a gas lobby said Germany could increase its domestic production at fields concentrated in the north of the country.
In past crises, countries have also sought to reduce industrial production at certain times, pay back-up generators to switch on supply, order households to curtail energy use or enforce temporary power cuts.
A spike in electricity prices has forced small German steelmaker Lech-Stahlwerke to halt production at its plant in Bavaria, the German state's only steel works.
Norwegian fertiliser-maker Yara is also curtailing its ammonia and urea output in Italy and France. 
HAS SUPPLY TO EUROPE BEEN DISRUPTED BEFORE?
The last 15 years have seen several disputes between Russia and Ukraine over gas, mostly to do with prices paid. 

In 2006, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) cut supplies to Ukraine for one day. In the winter of 2008/2009, Russian supply disruptions rippled across Europe. Russia cut off supplies to Kyiv in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea.
Ukraine stopped buying Russian gas in November 2015 and has instead imported gas from EU countries, by reversing the flow in some of its pipelines.

(Reuters) - Ethiopian Airlines has emerged as the unidentified buyer of five Boeing (NYSE:BA) current-generation 777 freighters reported this week, two people familiar with the matter said. 
The order, posted as an unnamed airline in Boeing's monthly orders update on Tuesday, is separate from a recently announced provisional agreement by Ethiopian for later deliveries of five of a successor model, the 777X freighter, also known as the 777-8 cargo version.
Ethiopian ordered the current-generation 777 freighters to meet near-term cargo demand, the sources said. 
Boeing declined to comment. The airline did not respond to a request for comment.
It was not immediately clear whether the airline would press ahead with both sets of orders, but several airlines have been aggressively adding capacity to address a boom in cargo demand.
The airline operates Africa's largest cargo terminal from its Addis Ababa hub.
The International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday that growth in demand had softened in January due in part to the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
But supply chain disruptions that surfaced at the start of the pandemic recovery and stoked air cargo demand are still present.
CARGO DEMAND
Boeing has dominated the air freight market for years through its 767, 777 and 747 cargo jets and has been galvanizing support for the new twin-engined 777X freighter. 
The plane - officially known as 777-8F - was launched in January with an order for 34 from Qatar Airways. It is due to enter service in 2027, behind a long-delayed passenger version.
Boeing on Friday said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Airlines with ""the intent to purchase"" five 777X freighters. Sources said the wording did not rule out further comparisons by the airline between cargo versions of the 777X and Airbus' rival A350. 
Ethiopian Airlines operates nine 777 freighters. Its fleet also includes three 737-800 converted freighters, Boeing said. 

About half of global cargo by value travels by air, and in turn half of that usually goes in the belly of passenger planes. 
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to park unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters. But some economists warn that could start to unravel as the pandemic eases.

LONDON (Reuters) - Companies in the United States and elsewhere will voluntarily use new global climate-related disclosures even if making them a mandatory requirement takes longer, the chair of a new standard setter said on Thursday.
The International Sustainability Standards Board was set up in November at the COP26 climate summit to try to give more coherence to disclosures from companies and stop potential ""greenwashing"" or inflated climate-friendly credentials.
ISSB chair Emmanuel Faber said the Frankfurt-based board's first set of standards would be put to public consultation this month.
ISSB sister body, the International Accounting Standards Board, took over 20 years to persuade 140 countries one-by-one to make its norms mandatory.
""We don't have 25 years to get there, we have a few years,"" Faber told the London Business School, adding there was an alternative markets-directed pathway.
""If you look at the U.S., probably there will be a lot of adoption directly by market participants. They may well decide to adopt even without their home country being a formal adopter,"" the former chair of French yoghurt maker Danone said.
The draft disclosures will focus on greenhouse gas emissions from a company itself, emissions related to a company's energy use, and emissions from a company's supply chain and products, such as cars.
The aim is to replace a patchwork of standards with a global baseline called for by investors for countries and regions to build on, if they want to.
For example, the European Union has introduced more ambitious ""double materiality"", which measures a company's impact on the environment and not just how climate change will affect a company's bottom line.
Faber said that ""politically driven noise"" over double materiality needs to be ""shut down"" as it was not opposed to the global baseline approach ISSB is taking - just building on its common starting point. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is due on March 21 to propose how companies can disclose the impact of climate change on their business.

""We expect that in the U.S. the SEC baseline it going to be compatible with where we will start with the global baseline, and then it will be up to local companies to voluntarily adopt the global standards,"" Faber said.
The ISSB's public consultation will last at least three months, with final adoption by year end.

Investing.com – Xpeng stock (NYSE:XPEV) plummeted 10% Thursday on concerns over its international expansion in markets where it runs into competitors such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
The company is taking pre-orders of its P5 electric sedan in four European countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Bookings can be made through the website or the company’s mobile app.
In August, it began shipments of its P7 sedan to Norway, its first international market and one of the early ones to have taken to EVs.
Last month, it opened its first store outside of China in Stockholm. It has plans to open another in the Netherlands, according to CNBC.
The company has made some modifications to the model it’s selling in Europe. The European P5 is being sold with an older version of the driving software system, Xpilot 2.5, that makes the vehicle close to autonomous.
CNBC said Xpeng’s European P5 will also not have Lidar technology, an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. Lidar is the technology behind more advanced autonomous driving features, though Xpilot 2.5 works without Lidar.
Xpeng sold 6,225 vehicles in February compared to Nio (NYSE:NIO)'s 6,131 units.  ",

The company reported earnings per share of $3.48, beating analyst expectations of $2.59 per share.
However, revenue came in below forecasts at $727.66 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected revenue of $728.25 million.
Genesco is trading almost 9% above Wednesday's close following the report.
The company revealed same-store sales for Genesco increased 10% over last year, while e-commerce sales increased 36% from the fourth quarter two years ago.
Genesco's full-year net sales increased 36% from last year to $2.4 billion, with adjusted earnings per share for the period at $7.62.
""We concluded an outstanding year with a very strong fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. Our holiday performance was fueled by unprecedented levels of full-price selling and strong in-store sales while our digital channel held on to most of last year's record gains,"" said Mimi E.

Investing.com – Marqeta Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ) stock gained 5% Thursday after the card-issuing platform said current quarter net revenue will grow 48-50% after annual total processing volume for the year crossed $100 billion for the first time.
The company’s outlook indicates little let-up in the payments business which boomed in the pandemic as people took to online shopping and ordering like never before.
Total processing volume climbed 85% to $111 billion in 2021 while rising 76% in the December quarter to $33 billion.
The company, which counts Uber (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) as clients, grew its fourth quarter revenue 76% to $155 million. The company attributed this to higher TPV from existing large customers and continued growth in TPV from both its digital banking and buy-now-pay-later customers.

At least 21 large U.S. and Canadian energy companies have bought back their own stock in the last quarter, with the move continuing this year in the buildup to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co. signaled late in January it could use excess free cash flow to buyback shares and more recently, Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). launched a $3 billion buyback program.
To Wall Street strategists schooled in the logic of “buy low, sell high” this makes little sense particularly at a time when oil revenues are surging and the stocks hit yearly, multi-year or -- in some cases -- all-time highs. Even some companies are scratching their heads.
“People buy back their stock, historically, at the top in our industry,”  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co. CEO Scott Sheffield said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) conference in Houston. “Not one U.S. company bought their stock in 2020, which is when we should have been buying our stock.”
Laura Lau, senior vice-president and chief investment officer at Toronto-based investment manager Brompton Group believes that raising dividends would be a more efficient way to get capital to shareholders. 
“Personally, I like money in my hands,” Lau said in an interview.

The S&P 500 energy index touched the highest level since May 2015 this week, up 105% since the start of 2021, as Russia’s war in Ukraine pushed Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude to around $120 a barrel. The windfall has helped 24 of the 53 members of the S&P 500 Energy Index and S&P/TSX Composite Energy Index double recent quarterly year-over-year revenues, Bloomberg data shows. 
Oil fell 10% on Wednesday, but more than half the members of the S&P 500 Energy Index and S&P/TSX Composite Energy Index are still trading near 52-week highs.
Occidental, which also hit a 52-week high on Monday, raised eyebrows when it announced on Feb. 24 a $3 billion buyback program in light of the mound of debt it took on for its $55 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). in 2019. The Texas-focused oil producer’s net debt was $27.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Occidental representatives pointed to chief financial officer Rob Peterson comments last month saying the company intends to pay down another $5 billion in debt before initiating share repurchases. He added the goal is to “reward shareholders with the triple benefit of a sustainable common benefit, an active share repurchase program, and a continuously strengthening financial position.”
Not Attractive
“Though we support returning cash to stakeholders via dividends, the $3 billion share-buyback program does nothing for the company’s financial health,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vincent Piazza wrote on Occidental’s buyback.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently recommended investors buy dividend-paying companies as a hedge against inflation. And Desjardins Securities analyst Justin Bouchard wrote in a recent note that “there is a price at which buybacks cease to be attractive.”
For companies including Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd., messages such as Bouchard’s have yet to resonate. 
The company spent $1.26 billion on buying back its own stock in the fourth quarter, even as it breached a previous all-time high. For this year, the Canada’s largest oil and gas company plans to spend 50% of its free cash flow buying back up to 10% of its shares, which are up nearly 40% since January.
“The longer sky-high commodity prices persist, the sooner CNQ will have to reevaluate its current capital allocation framework,” Bouchard wrote.
CNQ representatives didn’t reply to a request for comment.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday on disappointment at the failure of ceasefire talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.
Negotiations between Sergey Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russia invaded two weeks ago, broke down quickly with no visible progress. 
The downbeat mood was reinforced later by U.S. consumer inflation data for February, which showed prices rising at their fastest in over 40 years, cementing expectations of a first interest rate hike in two weeks' time from the Federal Reserve. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 325 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 was down by a similar amount and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 1.4%. The three indices had gained between 2% and 3.6% on Wednesday in anticipation of the talks.
The annual rate of inflation accelerated to 7.9% in February, in line with expectations but the highest since January 1982. Core inflation also rose to a 40-year high of 6.4% as the extraordinary amount of liquidity created by the Fed during the pandemic seeped into an ever-broader cross-section of prices. 
""The Russia-Ukraine war adds further fuel to the blazing rate of inflation via higher energy, food, and core commodity prices that are turbo charged by a worsening in supply chain problems,"" said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics in a note to clients. ""This will lead to a higher near-term peak in inflation and a slower descent through 2022 than previously envisaged.""
Bostjancic expects inflation to average 6.5% this year, leading the Fed to raise rates by 175 basis points. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock bucked the negative  trend in early dealings, rising 4.8% thanks to the announcement late on Wednesday of a new $10 billion buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split that's aimed at making the stock more easily accessible to smaller investors. It had been down some 15% for the year as of Wednesday's close.
Amazon's e-commerce peers in China fell under a harsher spotlight, as JD.com reported its slowest sales growth in six quarters, along with an operating loss due to higher input costs. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs fell 14%, dragging rival  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) down by a similar amount. Chinese online realtor Ke Holdings (NYSE:BEKE) fell an even bigger 16% after reporting a stubbornly wide net loss and a worsening operating margin in the fourth quarter. 
Elsewhere, business software group Asana (NYSE:ASAN) fell 24% after it forecast revenue growth would slow to 40% this year from 67% last year, when the pandemic and the spread of remote work had created more favorable conditions for it. The opposite was true for Crowdstrike  (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock, which rose 13% after the company posted strong quarterly numbers and predicted another good year ahead.
Defense stocks  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) all also eked out gains after the House of Representatives approved a revised spending bill for the current year late on Wednesday which incorporated a last-minute hike hike in defense spending.",,,,,

(Reuters) - Russia published a draft law on Thursday that could prevent its airlines returning leased aircraft, raising the stakes in a showdown with Western finance over $10 billion of jets.
Sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine give leasing firms until March 28 to free themselves from deals with Russian airlines, sparking a game of cat-and-mouse as lenders try to seize back jets - with very little success.
Under the proposed law drafted by the transport ministry, Russian airlines will pay leases in roubles throughout 2022.
If a foreign lessor terminates the agreement, a special government commission is to decide whether the aircraft can be returned or rule that the aircraft must stay in Russia.
""It is a bad offer tied to an even worse offer,"" said Eddy Pieniazek, head of analytics and advisory at UK-based aviation consultancy Ishka.
The rouble has plunged around 30% since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting sanctions from the West. 
Leasing contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the mainly Ireland-based leasing industry usually borrows money and pays for aircraft.
If contracts are terminated, an international treaty called the Cape Town Convention calls for airlines to return planes with minimum interference, something Western sources say is not happening though Russia insists the sanctions are improper.
""Cape Town should come into play meaning an orderly process of aircraft recovery. What they are suggesting is breaking terms of contracts for all the aircraft,"" Pieniazek said.
Sanctions have already cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia and forced its carriers to cancel many international flights for fear their aircraft will be seized by foreign lessors or banks.
They have also frozen much of Russia's foreign reserves and forced authorities to look for ways to limit foreign currency outflows.
MASS DEFAULT
For the global leasing industry, which owns more than half of the world's airliner fleet, the standoff risks what experts have described as its largest mass default, though the immediate impact is dwarfed by global groundings in the COVID-19 crisis.
The resulting flood of claims could trigger a decade-long legal battle between lessors and insurers amid uncertainty whether war-risk policies will pay out, experts say.
Lessors worry the crisis could lead to insurance contracts being cancelled amid the lack of a clear blueprint over what happens next, and are seen likely to delay taking writedowns until it is clear whether they can be compensated.
On Thursday, BOC Aviation, which has 4.8% of its assets by book value leased to Russian airlines, became one of the first lessors to voice insurance concerns. 
""The international aviation insurance markets are progressively cancelling certain elements of insurance policies in relation to aircraft located in Russia or leased to Russian airlines,"" it said with its results.
""This is a complex and rapidly developing situation that we are monitoring closely."" 
In total there are almost 780 jets leased by Russian airlines, including 515 from foreign lessors.
Some 425 of these are most immediately at risk, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium.

The world's largest lessor, Dublin-based AerCap, has the largest exposure by number of units with 152 planes rented to Russian airlines, according to industry data.
It declined comment on the draft law on Thursday but said on Feb. 28 around 5% of its fleet by net book value was on lease to airlines in Russia and that it would cease activity there.

RC Ventures has retained Harkins Kovler, the solicitor frequently used by prominent activist investor Carl Icahn in his corporate battles, said the sources, who are not permitted to discuss the private matter publicly.
A representative for Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Harkins Kovler declined to comment.
A proxy solicitor polls shareholders on how they plan to vote on hotly contested corporate matters such as mergers or proxy fights. 
Hiring one signals that Cohen is taking the next steps to prepare for a potential fight with Bed Bath & Beyond.
Cohen, who co-founded online pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and is chairman of the board at GameStop (NYSE:GME), disclosed his stake in Bed Bath & Beyond in a letter in which he urged the company to narrow its focus on operational and inventory improvements.
He also urged the company to consider strategic alternatives, including a possible sale or spin-off of its buybuy Baby business.
In the letter, Cohen estimated buybuy Baby could be worth billions of dollars on its own now that sales are nearing $1.5 billion with double-digit margins.
A source familiar with Cohen's thinking said the investor is open to a negotiated compromise with the company if it includes significant boardroom change and a committee to review strategic alternatives led by new independent directors.
Bed Bath & Beyond's board currently has 11 members.
At the same time, Cohen is also preparing for a potential fight by selecting potential director candidates, the source said.

(Reuters) - The $100 billion Western rental car industry, flush with cash from a profitable pandemic, is gradually getting its electric show on the road, and Chinese-made vehicles are poised to play a starring role. 
The electric transition could see car fleets, long dominated by famed marques from the United States and Europe, increasingly switch towards Asian automakers, according to a European executive. 
""Historically, European and American manufacturers had an edge, but the shift towards electric is reshuffling the cards,"" said Olivier Baldassari, group chief countries and operations officer at rental giant Europcar.
He said electric cars from Chinese and Asian makers were comparable to Western models in terms of quality, citing Great Wall Motor's Ora line, but generally cost less.
Even small savings are significant in the vast rental industry, which buys millions of new cars a year - a tenth of all new cars in the United States alone - and provides a leading indicator of wider auto trends in society.
Companies in the sector have long resisted a rush to electrify because of weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs) among customers worried about being stranded out of power. 
Yet several analysts said now is the best time to start as companies have fortified their coffers with bumper profits during a pandemic that emptied public transit and airports, and led to more holidaying within driving distance.
In the United States, rental car companies received record monthly revenue of $1,320 per vehicle in 2021, according to the American Car Rental Association. That compares to around $1,000 pre-pandemic.
""In the past, companies have kind of stuck their head in the sand,"" said Nick Mountfield, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, which advises rental car companies, said about electrification. ""We're now starting to see people say that they'll have to do something about and put in place plans.""

Hertz was an early mover last October when it announced the planned purchase of 100,000 vehicles from U.S. trailblazer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), upping the pressure on rivals to spell out transition plans.
French-based Europcar, meanwhile, pledged to make 20% of its fleet electric or low-emission hybrid by 2024, from 3% now, which means it will need to buy up to 70,000 cleaner vehicles in the coming two years if it restocks its fleet to the 350,000 vehicles it owned pre-pandemic. 
Rental companies sold off their fleets as demand plummeted at the start of the pandemic and have struggled to regain volumes amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has hampered vehicle production. 
Baldassari said Europcar was increasingly sourcing EVs from Great Wall Motors, SAIC Motor and Polestar, which is owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, though it was also buying from traditional partners, including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Stellantis. 
The company's China strategy might shift, however, if German carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) manages to close its offer to buy the company in the second quarter.
Industry players are running at different speeds, with each making their own calculations based on their markets. 
In the United States, where many customers prefer SUV and pickup models that have yet to be electrified and public charging infrastructure lags much of Asia and Europe, Enterprise Holdings is striking a more cautious tone.
Electrifying just a quarter of Enterprise's fleet at Orlando airport - its largest consumer rental location - would require the same amount of daily electricity as is needed to power more than 1,000 homes, said Enterprise's assistant vice president of innovation, Chris Haffenreffer.
Haffenreffer said the group currently had several thousand EVs in North America, including from Tesla, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Hyundai, Kia and Polestar. While the company said it has conversations with all global automakers, it has no immediate plans to boost that share. 
""At a high level, we want to let our consumers guide us in terms of what they're looking for,"" he added. ""Many car rental companies have historically taken that wait-and-see approach because we are still in the early phases of the transition.""

FOOTHOLD IN THE WEST
The varied pace of change, and the timeline for vast fleet overhauls means gasoline-powered vehicles are expected to remain the bulk of purchases for some years to come. Global automakers' transition plans as a whole would see electric vehicles make up at least 40% of their sales by 2040. 
Yet eventually the shift could prove far-reaching for the fortunes of Chinese in carmakers in Europe, a crowded, competitive auto market dominated by storied brands that has proved elusive for them to crack in the past. 
In years gone by, they have contended with a perception that China, associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Yet such arguments are challenged in a new reality that sees top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla now produce cars in the country, which is a technology powerhouse and the world's biggest auto market. 

Great Wall Motor, one of Europcar's suppliers, is expected to launch its Ora Cat compact electric car in Europe this year priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,260) with a range of around 250 miles (400 km), joining a growing number of Chinese EV makers trying their luck on the continent.
Chinese manufacturers using the rental channel to establish brand awareness and increase sales volumes would follow a playbook Kia and Hyundai used in the 1990s to gain a foothold in Western markets, said Mountfield at OC&C Strategy.

Investing.com – Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock traded 0.6% lower in premarket Thursday amid reports the maker of fitness equipment is testing new pricing plans.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the company on Friday will start testing a new package in which customers pay a monthly fee that covers both the namesake stationary bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses. If a customer cancels, Peloton will take back the bike with no charge.
Stores in Texas and Florida will begin bundling $60-$100 monthly subscriptions Friday onward, the report said. This will be a limited period offer and is intended to help the company discover a profitable price proposition, the report said.
The purpose is to position Peloton as a service that can be dropped any time compared to a costly hardware that comes with a subscription.
The new strategy is the brainchild of former Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy who took over as CEO last month after pressure from investors forced co-founder John Foley to leave that room.
McCarthy’s appointment followed a tumultuous year for the company where it went from being a pandemic winner to a big loser as a waning virus and reopening of economies returned people to parks and gyms outside.
The company decided to cut costs and talked about layoffs even before attempts at going mass-market with reduced product prices could yield results.
It lost more than 80% of its market value which led to speculation it could become a takeover target. Media reports named Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among potential suitors."

Peloton, which saw its shares tumble more than 80% in the past year due to waning demand for the company's stay-at-home exercise equipment, is looking to revitalize sagging sales and win back investor confidence.
The company said it has created a limited pilot program to explore pricing and options for new members, but did not reveal details about the plan.
According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the move, select Peloton stores in Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Denver will offer a bike and subscription to workout courses at a price between $60 and $100 a month for a limited period from Friday.
Shares of Peloton were down about 2% before the bell.
The pricing experiment aims to find a price proposition helping the company return to profitability without hampering growth, the report said. 
Upon cancellation, the company will take back the bike with no charge, the WSJ reported.
Last month, the company reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and slashed its forecast for full-year revenue, saying the lowered outlook was to adjust to changes in demand brought on by the reopening of economies.

Barry McCarthy, who took over as the company's chief executive last month, told the WSJ that he plans to reshape his executive team, consider manufacturing simpler bikes, and upend the company's capital spending strategy. https://on.wsj.com/3tODrSM

BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW more than doubled pre-pandemic earnings in 2021 to 16 billion euros ($17.67 billion), the company said on Thursday, as higher prices and strong sales of top-end cars boosted revenue despite supply chain constraints.
The premium carmaker, which sold a record 2.52 million vehicles last year despite semiconductor shortages, reported a 10.3% earnings margin for the year, its highest since 2017.
Still, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in its automotive segment took a 4.2% hit in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage, which BMW has so far weathered better than competitors, caused a drop in deliveries of 14.2%.
Quarterly net profit for the group came in at 2.25 billion euros, a third higher than last year but well below 2019 levels of 5.02 billion euros.
BMW's share price tumbled 7% from yesterday's close to 70.95 euros at 1303 GMT, hitting the bottom of Germany’s bluechip index alongside Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Mercedes-Benz Group and in line with a European-wide slump in auto shares amid fears over disruptions to supplies.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), Stellantis as well as Swedish Volvo were all among the worst performers of their respective indexes on Thursday.
Premium carmakers have largely been better positioned to weather supply chain troubles than value brands because they can push higher costs onto consumers through elevated prices.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, registered a 24.7% fall in deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2021 but still boosted its EBIT by 12% in its cars and vans division.
BMW's revenues climbed 12.4% from last year to 111 billion euros, with net profit reaching a record high of 12.46 billion.
""We are in a good position and optimistic about the future,"" Chief Financial Executive Nicolas Peter said.

The company will propose a dividend of 5.8 euros per share, up from last year's 1.9 euros, it said.

Investing.com – JD.com ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) traded 7.4% lower in premarket Thursday as it posted a loss in October-December following the slowest pace of revenue growth in six quarters.
Consumer spending slowed while general expenses rose 89%, primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation. Last month, bigger rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) posted its slowest revenue growth for the same period since going public in 2014.
JD.com reported a net loss of 5.2 billion yuan (around $820 million) after revenue grew 23% to 276 billion yuan. It had posted a profit of over 24 billion yuan in the same period last year.
Cost of revenue jumped about 24% while market expenses surged over 28%.
Revenue at JD Retail, the unit that accounts for the bulk of the company's revenue from its website, retail partnerships and retail stores, rose nearly 21%. The logistics business saw revenue jump about 28%.
While most Chinese tech giants were facing the heat from the country’s crackdown last year, JD.com was left untouched and in fact benefited, adding new and returning brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) to its platform, according to Bloomberg.
Annual active customer accounts jumped 21% to about 570 million in 2021.
JD.com’s stock is down over 30% in the last year. It has been under pressure also because of a decision by Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), one of its early backers, to distribute its JD.com shares among its shareholders as a one-time dividend.

510,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index fell into a bear market for the first time since the pandemic as investors exit risk assets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The technology-heavy index shed as much as 3.3% by 9:31 a.m. in New York, pushing it into bear-market territory, which is measured as a decline of 20% or more for a stock index from a recent high. Russian forces attacked targets across Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin ordered an operation to demilitarize the country, prompting a threat of further “severe sanctions” on Moscow and sending markets tumbling around the world. The S&P 500 index dropped 2.4%, pushing the benchmark index deeper into a correction.
Among the Nasdaq 100’s most notable movers, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). fell 4.6%,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). dropped 2.9%, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). shed 3.2%, and Google Parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped 2.6%. Meta Platforms Inc. sank 2.3%; the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent has underperformed for months, and the day’s slide will bring it around a 50% drawdown from a September peak.
The invasion is the latest risk to hit markets, following growing expectations for a rise in interest rates and persistent inflation, factors that have largely hit high-growth names.
“We’re not at a point where you can just jump in because everything is so cheap; it is extremely hard to call a bottom, and the geopolitical risk makes it even harder,” said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.
The Nasdaq 100 has dropped 21% since notching its Nov. 19 closing record amid skyrocketing inflation, disappointing earnings and the prospect of conflict. Companies on the index have lost about $3.1 trillion in market capitalization so far this year as investors grapple with a double whammy for the sector in rising interest rates, which chip away at the value of future earnings, and slowing growth.
Yields have soared on the prospect that the Federal Reserve will start withdrawing the massive monetary stimulus that has supported the U.S. financial system since the pandemic hit. Policymakers are fighting the largest consumer price spikes in a generation, but investors are dumping tech and growth stocks, whose valuations ballooned during the pandemic, as borrowing costs rise. 
“Growth stocks had gotten incredibly loved and overvalued,” Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance, said. “There was a feeling of intense speculation like with the tech bubble.”

Problems have been brewing since the start of the year with more than a third of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100, which represents the exchange’s largest non-financial companies, down at least 50% from their 52-week highs by just the second week of January. Meanwhile, the percentage of stocks on the Nasdaq Composite that set new 52-week highs stood at just 1% on Wednesday. 
The broader Nasdaq Composite Index also fell into bear territory, but some strategists said the selloff could have gone too far.
“The weakness in U.S. markets seems the most overdone with this move being sentiment- rather than economically-driven,” said Altaf Kassam, EMEA head of investment strategy and research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. “The moves are inspiring us to add a little risk in a measured way. However, we are tempering this addition to risk with some tail risk hedges, notably in long duration U.S. Treasuries and VIX futures.”
Wild Swings
Big Tech has experienced the wildest volatility swings in recent weeks since the pandemic shuttered the U.S. economy in 2020. At one point this month, Facebook parent Meta Platforms posted the worst one-day drop in market value in stock-market history while Amazon.com posted the biggest single-day gain in market capitalization in U.S. history.
Shares of smaller, fast-growing tech companies have been especially hurt by concerns that they would be more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy since they are more reliant on capital markets for financing rather than incredible riches that have helped some founders skyrocket to the moon. 
U.S. tech companies may face further pain as investors swap growth stocks for energy, financials and other cyclical shares that historically have benefited from improving economic growth and higher rates. The shifts likely represent a rebalancing away from the atypical conditions that have persisted for more than a decade and helped create a cadre of trillion-dollar companies dominating stock indexes.

(Reuters) - The U.S. oil industry and President Joe Biden's administration are clashing over who is to blame for tight energy supplies that have driven up U.S. pump prices to record highs.
Big Oil blames the problem on Biden's tighter regulations and push for renewable energy, which it says threaten to constrain output. The White House says the U.S. drilling industry is quick to ask for concessions but slow to open the spigot when consumers need it.
""What permits do they need? I don't think they need an embroidered invitation to drill,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing on Wednesday. 
U.S. oil prices have surged in recent months due to a rebound in demand from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and supply disruptions from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Even after falling sharply on Wednesday, U.S. crude settled at $108.70 a barrel, compared to about $75 at the end of 2021. [O/R]
On Tuesday, Biden banned U.S. imports from Russia, the world’s third biggest producer. Traders around the globe had already been shunning shipments from the country since it invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
Retail gasoline prices in the United States spiked to a record $4.17 a gallon this week, posing a major problem for the administration as it battles inflation ahead of the November mid-term elections.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil companies, took the opportunity in a press release on Tuesday to ""urge policymakers to advance American energy leadership and expand domestic production to counter Russia’s influence in global energy markets.”
“It’s time now for the administration to partner with domestic energy producers to leverage America’s ability to produce more oil and gas and focus on pro-growth policies to benefit our economy and the world’s security,” said the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business lobby group.
Oil executives this week mentioned another factor that has limited production but has nothing to do with government: pressure from shareholders to hold back spending on exploration and drilling and boost investor returns through share buybacks and dividends. 
The Biden administration has said it wants to decarbonize the nation’s economy by 2050, in part by transitioning off fossil fuels. It has sought to suspend issuing new federal oil and gas leases while it studies their climate impacts, an effort that has triggered a legal battle.
It has also said over the last few days that its policies are not hindering the oil industry’s production, noting this week that U.S. oil producers have more than 9,100 unused permits to drill on federal acres. 
Drilling permits are still being issued for federal lands, according to Interior Department records, and the pace of approvals since Biden took office is faster than it was during the administration of Republican Donald Trump. 
The administration noted that 90% of drilling takes place on private land that would be unaffected by delays in new federal leasing. It also said it wants more oil, not less.
""In this moment of crisis we need more supply,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told attendees at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston on Wednesday. ""Right now we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand.""
Indeed, oil production in the country is on the upswing. The Energy Information Administration has projected U.S. oil production will hit a record over 12.2 million barrels per day in 2023 as drillers ramp up output.
WHERE IS THE CONSTRAINT?
The top five holders of unused leases on federal lands include EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Matador Resources (NYSE:MTDR), according to energy research firm Rystad.
Four of the companies – EOG, Occidental, ConocoPhillips and Devon - declined to comment on whether they will raise production by tapping those unused leases. Matador did not respond to requests for comment.
EOG, the largest holder of unused permits with more than 1,000, said it's ""standard practice is to maintain a healthy inventory of the permits necessary to provide flexibility for current and future development plans."" 
Labor and supply constraints can also make it difficult for companies to boost production beyond what they had previously planned, Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at the CERAWeek conference. 
Occidental has more than 500 unused federal permits.
She added that oil and gas companies have been limiting costs and spending to return more cash to shareholders. ""Capital discipline today for oil companies is basically no (production) growth,"" Hollub said. 
Her view was echoed by another executive at the conference.
""As an industry, we can't lose sight of the returns,"" said ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, and he also blamed the administration's ""poor energy policy, poor regulatory policy"" for creating the current squeeze. The company has nearly 400 unused federal permits.

For Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, this adds up to an oil industry dragging its feet, rather than an administration clamping down on drilling.
""The constraint is not access to public lands, it's that oil companies are prioritizing shareholders over consumers,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) faces writedowns on $400 million in Russian downstream assets, it said on Thursday, having announced $3 billion worth of other projects previously.
The oil major announced on Feb. 28 that it would quit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and related entities including the flagship Sakhalin 2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
""It is expected that these decisions ...will impact the carrying value of the related assets and lead to recognition of impairments in 2022,"" Shell said in its annual report on Thursday.
The downstream assets come on top of $3 billion mentioned in its Feb. 28 announcement, a company spokesperson said.
Shell's production from Russian oil and gas projects reached stood at 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) compared with around 2.2 million boe/d total volumes for sale, according to its annual report and a spokesperson.

Shell's writedowns come amid a mass exodus of western oil majors. BP (NYSE:BP) is facing a $25 billion writedown for its planned divestment of Russian assets.

515,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:36AM ET</span>",,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
Almost two years after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) started breaking ground on its factory outside Berlin, the electric-car maker finally  secured approval for the €5 billion ($5.5 billion) project underpinning its European expansion.
Authorities in the state of Brandenburg announced the green light last week after months of delays linked to environmental concerns, including water usage. If all goes as planned, the facility will be producing Model Ys for customers before the month is over. Elon Musk took to Twitter to thank local authorities, writing in German that the future is ""very exciting” and vowing to shake a leg at the plant’s opening ceremony, just as he did when Tesla inaugurated its Shanghai facility two years ago.
A celebratory dance is probably called for after successfully maneuvering through Germany’s infamous red tape. The company had to relocate hibernating bats and lizards, replant more trees than it cut down and reduce water consumption as much as possible to appease locals. The approval documents comprise more than 23,700 pages and roughly 400 conditions Tesla still has to meet to secure a production permit, including setting up emissions-monitoring equipment and introducing measures to protect local groundwater. Tesla said it expected to complete the process in around two weeks.
Musk has reason to hurry. A few hours after Tesla got final approval, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) announced it’s moving ahead with a plan to add a €2 billion EV factory close to its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. The new plant is targeting 10 hours of production time per car — much quicker than it currently takes to piece together a vehicle at VW’s other facilities, and in line with what Tesla’s site is supposed to achieve.
VW CEO Herbert Diess replied to Musk’s tweet, saying the German giant is committed to setting new standards when it comes to quality and productivity at the factory it has code named Trinity. Peers including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Jeep maker Stellantis also are retooling factories to make EVs.
Ramping up a new plant is always difficult. Sales of made-in-Germany Teslas may be delayed by two to three months because of pre-production issues, particularly in the paintshop, Germany’s Automobilwoche reported on Sunday. A coronavirus outbreak among workers last month also hindered progress, the weekly magazine said. Musk himself has warned of significant production risk in Gruenheide because Tesla will be trying out lots of new technology there for the first time. 
Getting enough manpower is another challenge. Tesla lists dozens of job openings for the plant on its website, and Musk this week retweeted his company’s call for applications. Around 2,500 of as many as 12,000 positions have been filled, according to local officials.
An even bigger concern than scaling production is the disruption to supply chains spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The country is a major source of wire harnesses, and Russia supplies raw materials including nickel. Prices of the key metal used in EV batteries exceeded $100,000 a ton this week as an unprecedented short squeeze forced the London Metal Exchange to shut down for days. 
Supply chains to and from China also are coming under pressure because land routes through the war region are making transport increasingly difficult, Germany’s auto lobby warned last week. 
European carmakers from VW to BMW and tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) have reduced or halted output at several of their European factories. Toyota said on Wednesday it’s reviewing production plans due to mounting disruptions.
VW’s Diess fears the war could hit economies harder than Covid-19 did. The CEO is in favor of maximum sanctions against Russia, but also wants leaders to go to the negotiating table, he told the Financial Times on Thursday.
“What we don’t want is a never-ending war in Ukraine,” Diess said.

The U.S. health insurer's rebranding move is not its first, having previously changed its identity from WellPoint Inc (NYSE:ANTM) around eight years ago. 
The rebranding is a first step in the company's effort to optimize its brand portfolio, the insurer said in a statement. Anthem's Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans will not be renamed, it added.
The company, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states, has been attempting to compete in a changing health insurance landscape following deals by rivals such  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) to merge with the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs).
Anthem launched its in-house pharmacy benefits management business, IngenioRx, in 2019 after ending a long-standing deal with Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co, which is now a part of Cigna.

In the quarter ended Dec. 31, IngenioRx brought in about 19% of Anthem's total operating revenue. 
The company acquired myNEXUS Inc, a home-based nursing management company, in April.

LONDON (Reuters) - The aviation industry needs to take ""urgent action"" to align with the world's climate goal, including curtailing growth in air travel and rapidly scaling up use of sustainable aviation fuels, a report on Thursday said.
Climate Action 100+, the world’s largest grouping of investors pushing for corporates to move faster on cutting emissions, said the actions were needed to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms.
CA100+ said it was updating its views on the sector in light of a major report from the International Energy Agency last year which suggested deep cuts in fossil fuel use would be needed to reach the mid-century target.
The CA100+ report is expected to inform discussions with company management by its 615 members, which collectively manage more than $65 trillion in assets, ahead of the next season for annual general meetings.
On sustainable aviation fuel, the report highlights the need for a ""substantial"" increase between now and 2030, citing the IEA's analysis that 16% will need to come from advanced biofuels and 2% from synthetic fuels. In 2020, use was below 0.1%.
In addition, CA100+ said business travel and long-haul leisure flights needed to be capped at 2019 levels and demand shifted to high-speed rail, where possible, in order to keep emissions at half their projected 2050 level.
Aviation firms also needed to cut their own emissions rather than use carbon offsets to compensate for them, it said.

""The industry holds its future in its own hands,"" said Ben Pincombe, Head of Stewardship for Climate Change at the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the organisation leading the Climate Action 100+ Aviation Sector Strategy.
""If the sector fails to respond effectively, it is likely to face significant and rapid regulatory tightening, and ever greater scrutiny and challenge from capital markets.”

Investing.com – Asana, Inc. (NYSE:ASAN) stock was trading 24% lower in premarket Thursday with almost a fourth of its value erased after the company projected a slower growth in the ongoing year.
The company had a solid two-year growth when its software supporting corporate teams’ collaboration and organization proved to be a big hit in the pandemic.
Asana expects revenue of no more than $531 million in the current fiscal year, up 40% after it rose 67% in 2022.
The muted outlook comes in even as the company outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter. It closed January with over 119,000 paying customers.
The number of customers spending $5,000 or more on an annualized basis in the quarter grew 52% to 15,437. Revenue from these customers grew 82% year-over-year in the quarter.
Asana was founded in 2008 by Facebook co-founder Dustin Aaron Moskovitz and former Google and Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein. It was listed on NYSE in September 2020. It counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM), and Sky as customers relying on it to manage digital transformation, product launches, and marketing campaigns.
Revenue in the fourth quarter climbed 64% to $112 million. Adjusted loss per share widened by 3 cents to 25 cents. A jump in operating expenses and a much higher interest income last time offset the rise in revenue.
In the current quarter, the company is expecting revenue to be $115 million at the center of its guidance range, up 50%. Adjusted loss per share is seen between 36 cents and 35 cents.
It launched Asana Flow in February -- a suite of offerings to help teams build start-to-finish workflows and enable individuals to prioritize work with an intelligent Home interface."

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's securities regulators are gathering information from futures brokerages about their clients' short positions in nickel to prevent spillover risks from rocketing prices this week, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The London Metal Exchange intervened on Tuesday to calm the nickel market after prices hit records of more than $100,000 a tonne as Western sanctions threatened supply from major producer Russia.
In China, the Shanghai Futures Exchange suspended nickel trading on Thursday after the metal surged for three days in a row. The exchange would resume trading of some of its nickel futures contracts from March 11.
As a result of the sharp price swings, local bureaus of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) have asked future brokers to submit information about how many of their clients have short nickel positions, said one of the sources.
The regulators have also asked the futures brokers in their jurisdictions to submit information about their hedging status, and whether they have nickel for delivery, the source said.
It was not immediately clear what action might be taken, if any, after those details are submitted. 
""Regulators are worried,"" because if their clients cannot meet margin calls, brokerages would need to make up for the shortfall, the second source said.
CSRC, which supervises the futures exchange, did not respond to a request for comment. 
All the sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to talk to media.
A separate source at a major futures brokerage said the firm was directly approached by the Shanghai Futures Exchange and was asked about risk-management measures, as well as about some of its big clients trading nickel and coal.
CSRC's health check on futures brokerages comes as China's banking regulators also reportedly requested lenders report overseas exposure as part of efforts to contain possible fallout from volatility in global commodity prices.
In China, ""the violent price movements of futures' contracts are likely to expose brokerage companies to losses,"" said Wang Yunfei, an analyst with ShenYin & WanGuo Futures Co, a Shanghai based futures broker.
""Losses could quickly exceed the deposits held in a broker's account if, say, prices of nickel keep surging. If a client fails to top up the deposits, while the broker fails to close the positions in time, the latter might have to bag losses.""
In the most actively traded nickel contracts, Guotai Junan Futures, Citic Futures, and Ruida Futures held the biggest short positions on Shanghai Futures Exchange, according to data on Wednesday. 
China's securities regulators have access to market data including daily trading volumes, short and long positions held by each brokerage company for a particular contract.
But they are likely trying to know more about specific betting strategies placed by major investors, as they try to take early actions and avoid concentrated bets burning brokerage companies, industry insiders said.

In developed markets, ""futures brokerages would conduct careful credibility check on clients,"" said the second source.
""In China, opening a futures account is relatively simple,"" making brokerages more vulnerable, the source added.

The Newport Beach, California-based asset manager has at least $1 billion of bets in the derivatives market and $1.5 billion of Russia’s sovereign debt, the newspaper reported on Thursday. At least five Pimco funds sold credit-default swaps to investors, the FT reported, citing its analysis of the asset manager’s holdings at the end of 2021. 
The positions mean it stands to lose both on its own bond holdings and on the insurance if contracts pay out. The derivatives are designed to compensate holders in the event of default.
The majority of Pimco’s swaps sit in its marquee $140 billion Income fund, run by Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn, alongside Alfred Murata and Joshua Anderson, the FT reported. The fund disclosed that it had written $942 million of protection on Russia by the end of 2021. The other funds holding positions include Pimco’s Total Return bond fund, its Emerging Markets bond fund, Diversified Income and Low Duration income funds, according to the newspaper.
Credit-default swaps on Russia’s sovereign debt are trading at levels that suggest the market is expecting a high probability that the country will default on its debt. It has payments due on foreign bonds next week.
It costs $5.8 million upfront and $100,000 annually to insure $10 million of Russia’s debt for one year, suggesting a record 71% chance of default in that time, according to ICE Data Services. That compares with about $3.8 million in advance last week and about 300 basis points -- or $300,000 annually -- before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

(Reuters) -Rio Tinto on Thursday became the first major mining company to announce it was cutting all ties with Russian businesses, joining a raft of leading Western companies in a pullout following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The global miner has previously said it has no operational assets or employees to pull out of Russia, or Ukraine, but the move comes as Western firms come under increasing pressure to exit Russia since the invasion began on Feb. 24. 
Leading U.S. companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stopped trading with Russia this week, offering a united rebuke of the war on Ukraine. Moscow describes its actions there as a ""special operation"".
""Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business,"" a Rio spokesman said in a message sent to Reuters. It wasn't immediately clear with which companies Rio has done business in Russia.
The announcement from the Anglo-Australian firm comes after a top executive said on Wednesday the company was looking for alternative fuel sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, but did not believe it can stop buying from Russia altogether.
The company did not immediately respond to questions on whether it would continue to buy Russian fuel and other products through non-Russian third parties.
The miner owns an 80% stake in Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd (QAL) in a joint venture with Russia's Rusal International PJSC, the world's second-largest aluminum producer. The company did not comment on how its decision to cut ties with Russian businesses would affect Queensland Alumina dealings with Rusal.
Rusal purchased its 20% stake in Australia's second-largest refinery processing alumina, the chemical compound that contains aluminium, in 2005 from Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ:KALU).
In 2018 Rusal was covered by U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and companies. Queensland Alumina was not affected by those sanctions and isn't affected so far by curbs put in place since the Ukraine invasion began.
Rio has said previously that it was actively reviewing any existing commercial ties to Russia across its global business.
Shares in Rio dropped as much as 8.3% on the Australian bourse, as they traded ex-dividend, before closing down 7.7% at A$109.91. The Sydney benchmark closed up 1.1%.

Rio rival BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) did not immediately comment on whether it had any business links with Russian firms and would consider terminating them.
Earlier, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday after high-profile talks between Russia and Ukraine ended without progress, while investors digest volatile oil prices and await key inflation data.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 290 points, or 0.9%; S&P 500 Futures traded 36 points, or 0.9%, lower; and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 160 points, or 1.2%.
The main Wall Street indices all closed sharply higher Wednesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 650 points or 2%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 2.6%, its best day since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%, the biggest one-day rise since November 2020.
These gains were based on a sharp fall in oil prices, amid indications that a couple of major producers were prepared to increase output, as well as tentative hopes for peace in the Ukraine conflict.
Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey earlier Thursday, the highest profile meeting between diplomats from the two sides since Russia’s invasion, but hopes for progress toward achieving a ceasefire appear to have been dashed.
Additionally, crude prices have rebounded sharply Thursday, after they suffered their biggest one-day drop in almost two years, further weighing on sentiment.
By 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.2% higher at $113.31 a barrel, bouncing from a fall of more than 12% on Wednesday, its worst day since late November. The Brent contract rose 4.8% to $116.50, after dropping 13%, the largest one-day drop since April 2020.
Investors will also keep a close eye on U.S. inflation figures, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which could further guide expectations for the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. The annual CPI figure for February is expected to rise to 7.9%, up from 7.5% in January. 
Weekly initial jobless claims are also slated to come out at the same time.
In corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be in the spotlight after the online retail giant’s board approved a 20-for-1 stock split and authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of its common stock.

Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 13% of the Group’s revenue in 2021.
Carlsberg said the ongoing conflict between the two countries “will negatively impact the Group’s financial results for 2022” and warned there could be write-downs on assets while it undertakes a full review of its business in Russia.

Investing.com – Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock traded 7% higher in premarket Thursday after the company’s board approved a 20-for-1 stock split and authorized the retailer to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock.
The split and the proportionate share increase are subject to shareholder approval at the company’s May 25 annual shareholder meeting.
Fundamentally, a stock split does absolutely nothing to the intrinsic value of a share. At the same time, it makes it more accessible to small investors by simply reducing the value of the stock proportionately. Many retail investors base their decision on the absolute value of the share and not always its fundamental strength at that point in time.
The appeal of a split has reduced in recent times though because of the advent of platforms like Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), which permit trading of shares in fractional quantities. The Amazon stock closed at $2,785.58 Wednesday, a price that puts it out of reach for many retail investors.
The company’s proposed $10 billion buyback replaces the previous $5 billion repurchase exercise that still had $2.88 billion left in it. The buyback doesn’t have any last date and the company isn’t obliged to buy back any share. At Amazon’s market cap of $1.42 trillion, a $10 billion buyback amounts to less than 1% of its shares.",,,,,

Investing.com -- The economic damage from a prolonged war in Ukraine could be worse than that from the pandemic, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess warned in an interview published Thursday.
“The threat of this war for Germany and Europe is huge,” Diess told the Financial Times, pointing to the risk of ""huge price increases, scarcity of energy and inflation.""
Such fears have already been reflected in a sharp drop in the euro's value since Russia invaded, as market participants bet that the hit to the economy would derail the European Central Bank's plans to normalize monetary policy as the pandemic ebbs. 
Diess's warnings come a couple of days after VW, Europe's largest carmaker, was forced to suspend production of some models in Germany, such as the Porsche Taycan, due to a shortage of components. The group usually receives supplies of electrical wiring and harnesses from Ukraine.
VW has already stopped production at its own factory in Kaluga, southwest of Moscow, and in Nizhny Novgorod. It's one of many global automotive groups to cease production in the wake of U.S. and EU financial sanctions that make the reliable import of parts to their facilities all but impossible. However, VW's Russian operations are minor compared to those in the rest of Europe, where it is the biggest private-sector employer in Germany.
Diess said that he was in favor of ""maximum sanctions"" on Russia, but also urged a quick resumption to negotiation.
""For a society like Germany, depending on Russian energy, raw materials . . . if you imagine a scenario where we cut off business relations with Russia, which we probably would have to do if this conflict (doesn't stop), you could not buy energy any more and this would lead to a situation that might impact Europe and Germany considerably,” Diess said.
His arguments echo those of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose government earlier this week refused to go along with the U.S. and U.K. in banning Russian energy imports due to the lack of short-term alternatives.
Diess's wish for negotiations got some satisfaction on Thursday as the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russia invaded over two weeks ago. Newswires reported that the ministers would discuss, among other things, the possibility of a meeting between their respective presidents, which would mark an even bigger step toward a diplomatic resolution of the war."

The Manchester, northern England, based group, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products aimed at 16 to 40-year olds, had warned on annual profit in December, blaming a spike in product return rates, disruption to international deliveries and higher inbound freight costs.
Its shares have fallen 76% over the last year as it has also sought to improve its image following negative publicity over supply chain failings.
Boohoo said on Thursday it expected to report adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the year to Feb. 28 of about 125 million pounds ($165 million), down from 173.6 million pounds in 2020-21.
Boohoo said net sales growth in its fourth quarter was 7%, having been 10% in the third quarter.
""As expected, net sales growth in the quarter was impacted by higher returns rates year on year due to product mix. This is expected to continue in the first half of FY23,"" it said.
It said while it continued to trade well in its home market, its international performance continued to be impacted by longer customer delivery times as a result of pandemic-related supply chain pressures.
""We are confident that pandemic-related headwinds are short-term in their nature, and our focus is to ensure the business is well positioned for growth as these headwinds ease,"" said CEO John Lyttle.

Suzuki's Hungarian factory has suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine as of March due to the war, the company said on Wednesday, in one of the first signs of the conflict hitting the broader economy in the region.
Central Europe is facing the economic fallout that has followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, including from harsh Western sanctions on Moscow and turmoil in global markets as investors switched into safer assets.
Suzuki said it exports about 10,000 cars to Russia and Ukraine per year and added that it was trying to shift the affected orders to other markets to maintain its planned production volumes.
Suzuki's Hungarian business sold 119,098 cars in 2020 based on the latest available figures on its website, including 101,672 vehicles in foreign markets, meaning Russia and Ukraine account for roughly a tenth of its annual exports.
""Our company has no direct Tier 1 suppliers in the areas affected,"" spokeswoman Zsuzsanna Bonnar-Csonka said, referring to Russia and Ukraine. ""However, we are continuously monitoring the entire supply chain,"" she said. She also said the global chip shortage still represented the biggest hurdle.
Bonnar-Csonka said that rising energy costs and the weakening of the forint, which is down by some 3% versus the euro this year, had an additional impact on its operations.
""We are doing our utmost to optimise our manufacturing costs. However, after a certain point, we need to reflect part of these additional costs in new car prices,"" Bonnar-Csonka said.
Other major carmakers in Hungary include Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group's Audi division.
The sell-off across currency, bond and stock markets in Central Europe forced the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to raise the top of its interest rate corridor by 100 basis points to 6.4% on Tuesday after the Hungarian forint sank to a record low near 400 versus the euro on Monday. read more
The NBH said the war in Ukraine boosted inflationary pressures, while risks to economic growth were on the downside.
The car sector has been a mainstay of Hungary's growth and exports, but even before the war output had been hampered by the global semiconductor shortage.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, handing back some of the previous session’s hefty gains ahead of new high-level Russia-Ukraine talks and the latest policy-setting European Central Bank meeting.
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 1.8%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1%.
European equities posted strong gains on Wednesday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both closing over 7% higher after crude prices suffered their biggest one-day drop in almost two years amid indications that major producers could increase supply to make up for the disruptions caused by the Western sanctions on Russia.
Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels, raising stagflation fears.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% higher at $112.24 a barrel, bouncing from a fall of more than 12% on Wednesday, its worst day since late November. The Brent contract rose 4.7% to $116.34, after dropping 13%, the largest one-day drop since April 2020.
Investors are now focusing on the meeting later Thursday in Turkey between Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the first meeting between the two since Russia’s invasion.
These talks are taking place amid mounting fury in the West, and the potential for further sanctions, over Ukraine's accusation of Russia bombing a children’s hospital in the city of Mariupol.
Investors will also be watching the latest policy-setting meeting from the European Central Bank later Thursday, with the policymakers having to walk the tightrope caused by surging energy prices likely exacerbating already record-high inflation as well as slowing growth.
The central bank had been expected to announce the end to its emergency bond purchases, opening the way for an interest rate hike late this year. However, the high uncertainty caused by the Ukraine conflict is likely to stay in the hands of policymakers this month.
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock slumped 6% after the company became the first major mining company to cut ties with Russian businesses.
 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock fell 2.5% after the German fashion house warned that it was difficult to assess the impact of the Ukraine war on growth in the sector, noting that Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 3% of group sales in 2021. That said, it still expected a healthy increase in sales and profits this year.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 1.7% after the Swiss lender flagged just under $1 billion of net credit exposure to Russia.

After the U.S. S&P 500 index saw its biggest one-day gain since June 2020 and oil slumped 13%, it promises to be another eventful day.
World stocks have seized on a meeting later on Thursday between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia and are up almost half a percent. 
True, there does not seem much conviction behind the gains, with European futures only slightly higher and Wall Street so far tipped to open lower. Oil prices are trying to recover too after Wednesday's fall that was driven by the UAE holding out the possibility of more supply from the OPEC+ group.
European markets are especially on edge before a meeting of the European Central Bank, which will have to walk a thin line between committing to tackle inflation and protecting economic growth. 
Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine the ECB was on track to announce an end to money-printing stimulus and open the way for interest rate hikes. But now while the Russia-linked economic hit is worsening by the day, inflation in the bloc is more than double the 2% target, exacerbated by a weaker euro.
Aside from the ECB meeting in Frankfurt, traders will keep an eye on Versailles where a EU leaders' meeting kicks off later in the day. They will announce plans to wean the bloc off Russian energy but markets are keen to hear of any plans for additional fiscal stimulus, possibly financed by another round of joint borrowing.
Then, in the United States, February inflation is predicted at 7.8% year-on-year, surpassing January's four-decade high 7.5%. But since then U.S. gasoline prices have rocketed higher, meaning an above-forecast print may well revive bets of a 50 basis-point interest rate rise at the Federal Reserve's March 15-16 meeting.
Finally, foreign companies continue to flee Russia; miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Nintendo the latest to announce their exit. All this carries a cost of course-- McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for instance, says the temporary closure of its Russian restaurants will cost it $50 million a month. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-Japan's wholesale prices rise at record pace
- RICS housing survey
-ECB meeting
-U.S. CPI/initial jobless

-U.S. 30-yr bond auction
-Peru likely to raise interest rates by 50 bps

PARIS/SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) -Global leasing companies staring at an imminent sanctions deadline to repossess more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines have received mostly radio silence as experts warn of legal wrangling that could last a decade.
Western bans imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine give most leasing firms until March 28 to sever ties with Russian airlines - sparking a game of cat-and-mouse from Asia to Africa as lenders frantically try to seize aircraft.
Leasing companies are terminating leases and asking for planes to be returned along with the paperwork that must be secured for planes to be placed with new airlines.
But so far, Western observers say that is not happening.
""There is nothing official, but Russian airlines are not giving aircraft back. The only ones are a handful that were already outside Russia and could be repossessed,"" said independent aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
Those include two jets seized in Istanbul and Mexico City, according to trade journal ch-aviation. 
Others have wriggled through the repo net.
An Aeroflot Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 narrowly escaped being seized at the initiative of a non-Russian bank in Southeast Asia and the Gulf in the past week, two people familiar with the matter said. 
An Airbus A321neo leased to the same flag carrier was the target of a failed repossession in Egypt, aviation publication The Air Current reported.
Aeroflot did not respond to a request for comment.
MASS DEFAULT RISK
In total there are almost 780 jets leased by Russian airlines, including 515 from abroad. Even some leased within Russia are subject to claims from foreign banks.
Some 425 of these are most at risk in what looks set to become aviation's biggest mass default, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium who have seen ""virtually no progress"" in seizing jets.
For a maturing industry with portfolios worth up to $300 billion, that remains far from the global impact of the pandemic that grounded over 15,000 jets.
But the loss of a market representing 5-6% of global traffic has shocked a sector that owns more than half the world's airliner fleet. 
The resulting flood of claims and potential writedowns could trigger a lengthy contest over liability.
""This will end up in the courts forever. In general it is a very bleak picture,"" said Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of advisers Lundquist Group.
""Between the airlines, lessors and insurers, you are most probably looking at a decade of lawsuits,"" Grabowski added.
Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) warned last week that a prolonged escalation of sanctions could pile pressure on the leasing industry, which has risen from shaky roots https://www.reuters.com/article/aviation-finance-ireland-idCNL5N0KR1EN20140119 in the 1970s to become a dominant force.
'UNCHARTED TERRITORY'
As Russia launched what it described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine last month, some financiers reported initial signs of panic.
""Someone offered to sell me seven freighters – and two other international lessors asked if I wanted to buy their entire Russian portfolio,"" said a person at a China-based lessor, adding the offer had been refused. 
Facing multiple obstacles in seizing jets - from lack of co-operation and possible security risks on the ground, to airspace bans and questions over permission to fly to storage sites - lessors are banking on a record payout under war-risk insurance.
But the aviation insurance market will struggle to make payouts potentially dwarfing the $1.8 billion from 9/11.
A declaration of war is not necessarily required to claim under a war-risk policy, insurers say, with nationalisation, seizure and restraint under government orders also covered.
But lawyers say proving Moscow has effectively confiscated hundreds of jets could be a daunting task.
""This is totally uncharted territory. There is a possibility that insurers could cancel policies, leaving lessors with an aircraft but no insurance,"" Lundquist said.
War also threatens to erode the Cape Town Convention, an industry circuit-breaker designed to make contracts more enforceable across borders.
Its 83 nations including Russia set up an international register to smooth repossessions but it relies on co-operation widely seen as unlikely after Russian President Vladimir Putin told airline workers that Western sanctions were ""akin to a declaration of war"". 
Most lessors already use the Bermuda register rather than Russia's over legal uncertainties.
A person at a Chinese lessor with planes at Aeroflot said transferring the agreement to a different entity would require layers of approvals that have little chance of materialising.
    ""We're completely stuck,"" said the person who has spoken to an Aeroflot representative almost every day since the invasion. 
Even if conflict eases, Russia's near-isolation may permanently damage valuations by interrupting the continuity of maintenance records or encouraging airlines to swap parts.
Indirect effects might go wider still, forcing Airbus and Boeing to remarket dozens of jets and halting others' plans to convert older Russian jets into freighters amid a cargo boom.
Also in the spotlight are asset-backed securities used by lessors to ease financing and now containing high Russian risk.
All this, while soaring oil prices threaten to punch a new hole in airline balance sheets and damage the creditworthiness of all carriers. 
UK-based aviation consultancy IBA said the crisis had already delayed the industry's pandemic recovery by two months.
Critics say the crisis calls for a rethink about the way the industry handles risk. For years its selling point to investors was its ability to move assets to escape regional volatility. But a worldwide pandemic, and now a sequestered Russian fleet, have left the industry struggling to restore equilibrium.

""There was a perception that Russia was a good risk and capable of absorbing significant capacity that others could not take because of the COVID-19 crisis,"" Grabowski said.
""For people who had surplus planes on their hands Russia was a venue of last resort. Most of the market also thought Aeroflot was an impeccable credit but forgot the political risk.""

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's securities regulator has barred the country's investment banks it regulates from acting as promoters of blank-check firms in Hong Kong, three people with knowledge of the matter said, cutting off a potentially lucrative business.
The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has decided to take the step, which was communicated to the mainland investment banks earlier this year, due to concerns over the risks associated with those vehicles, the sources said. 
While promoting the deals will be off-limits, the investment banks will be allowed to work as advisors on special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions under Hong Kong's new rules for such listings, said the sources.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity as the directive was not public.
The move comes as China is set to unveil final and tougher rules for offshore capital raising by domestic companies, as part of which the regulators are also seeking to subject investment banks to extra scrutiny. 
Mainland commercial banks-affiliated institutions, regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) have been given the greenlight to be promoters, the sources said, giving them a competitive edge.
Chinese brokerages have been lobbying the CSRC to change the rules to allow them to act as promoters as well, one of the sources said.
CSRC and CBIRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
SPACs are shell, or blank-check companies, that raise money in an initial public offering (IPO) with the proceeds held in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
In Hong Kong, promoters are the same as sponsors in other markets in that they establish the SPAC and own promoter shares issued by the blank check company.
Promoters pay much less for their shares, which are a different class of stock than those issued in the IPO, compared with the price paid by public investors, allowing them to lock in higher profits later.
Investment banks are allowed to be sponsors in the United States with some like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) having created their owns SPACs in the last two years.
In Singapore, the current rules don't bar investment banks from becoming SPAC sponsors, but bankers say the regime calls for such vehicles to be backed by experienced and quality sponsors, and is not likely to appeal to investment banks and brokerages.

In Hong Kong, the asset management arms of two commercial banks, Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) International (ABCI) and China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) have acted as SPAC promoters, according to exchange filings.
The city allowed creation of SPACs starting Jan. 1 and eight such vehicles have lodged preliminary filings, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange website.

LONDON (Reuters) - For funds undeterred in their investment choices by the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi or China's treatment of the Uyghurs, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is proving a wake-up call.
Buying into companies on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is one of the hottest trends in the fund management industry, attracting investments totalling more than $35 trillion by the start of 2020. 
But for money managers from Boston to London the focus has largely been on companies, with governance risk largely ignored in decisions over whether to invest in a country itself.
China has denied allegations of abuses against the Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. Saudi Arabia's government has said Khashoggi's killing was committed by a rogue group. 
Now, as western banks and companies revisit hundreds of billions of dollars worth of exposure to Russia, more than half a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters said the Ukraine crisis was causing them to rethink how they assign country risk.
""We have to accept that we, as an industry, committed a very big blunder by not taking that invasion (of Crimea) in 2014 for what it was and acting accordingly,"" said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish $87 billion pension investor PFA.
""Is this something that we would like to repeat?"" Beslik said of investors who have been left holding often distressed Russian assets since its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" to disarm the country.
While a fund may make its own assessment of the quality and structure of a country's government, this is only one of many factors for investment decisions.
For some 71% of the $35 trillion invested with an ESG focus, the analysis focuses on the risk of an investment, rather than a country's human rights record or other governance factors.
It can be easier to ignore human rights if an ESG fund manager feels the chances of losing money on an asset, such as a sovereign bond, is sufficiently low given its price, because for example the relevant country's ruling government is secure.
Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said for investment decisions on China at least western investors are more focused on shareholder value than on human rights.
However, engagement on sovereign risk is the next frontier for investors, said Martina Macpherson, president of Network for Sustainable Financial Markets, a non-profit organisation which is run by finance and academic experts.
This is particularly the case ""where systemic ESG risks such as climate, biodiversity, human rights violations and poor state governance are concerned,"" Macpherson added. 
Government clampdowns can sometimes be followed by more investment flowing into the country concerned as disruptions to daily economic activity cease, as was seen after China brought pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong two years ago to a halt.
Foreign direct investment into China rose 14.9% in 2021.
Beijing rarely discusses the issue of democracy, but has previously referred to China's governance arrangements as ""whole-process people's democracy"".
RISK REWARD
Bets on such market moves have not always been safe ones.
International investors, for example, were criticised last year for holding bonds issued by Belarus when its President Alexander Lukashenko intensified a crackdown on protesters.
And investors in a range of Chinese companies, from technology to property developers, suffered losses as Beijing unleashed a regulatory crackdown last year.
While some funds dumped investments in such countries, citing reputational and moral concerns as well as the risk of losses, these have tended to be smaller ones or those with a mandate to invest towards a sustainable outcome. 
Most have stayed, not least because the task of exiting becomes tougher the bigger the market.
The BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares ESG Aware MSCI EM ETF fund, for example, has around 3% invested in Russia, but 28% in China, Refinitiv data shows.
""It's too big to ignore and it's too profitable,"" Lardy said of investor holdings in China.
This view is echoed by Ross Gerber, president of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who said China's huge global economic reach makes it hard for any investor to avoid. 
""There's no way around China,"" said Gerber, who owns shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for instance, with a big factory in Shanghai.
""People criticise me for having investments in China and not Russia, but it's very nuanced, the people criticising are typing on a Chinese-made iPhone and wearing Chinese-made clothing.""
Nevertheless, some are now moving money out of China.
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it had excluded China's Li Ning due to an ""unacceptable risk"" that the sportswear maker was contributing to serious human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China.
Li Ning did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday after the Norges Bank announcement.
SOVEREIGN RISK 
One major factor missing from ESG calculations is the market pricing of sovereign debt, said Diliana Deltcheva, head of Emerging Market Debt at asset manager Candriam's SRI Bond EM Fund, which has long excluded Russian, Belarussian, Chinese and debt from the Gulf states.
In the case of Russia, foreigners hold nearly $80 billion of debt, including sovereign bonds denominated in roubles, euros and dollars, as well as hard currency corporate securities, while investors outside Russia also owned 86% of Russia's stock market free float at the end of 2021. 
In addition, Western companies, from BP (NYSE:BP) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), built out ties to Russia. Many have paused or ended those connections since the invasion, steps some say show ESG values have now seeped from money management into corporate decision-making.
""There are no rules that will protect you,"" Sonia Kowal, president of U.S.-based ESG investor Zevin Asset Management, said of investing in some countries. Kowal said she avoids investments in Russia and in state-controlled Chinese firms.
Jeffrey Gitterman, an ESG-focused wealth manager in New Jersey, said he sold his firm's 5% emerging-market stake last week after Russia's invasion, worried among other things that China holdings could also face restrictions.

""Everything we know about the role of EM (emerging markets) in portfolios is now subject to re-evaluation,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled a travel recovery for airlines and led to a 23% fall in flight bookings within Europe and a 13% fall in trans-Atlantic bookings in the first week, travel data firm ForwardKeys said on Thursday.
The data, which compared bookings from Feb. 24 to March 2 to the week before Russia launched what it described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, is an early indicator of consumer confidence for travel heading into the peak summer season.
Rising inflation and oil prices are also dampening the economic outlook and carriers including Lufthansa, Qantas Airways and Japan's ANA Holdings have warned ticket prices may need to rise to cover increased costs.
The worst-hit destinations in Europe were those in the east closest to the conflict, with Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia seeing a 30% to 50% drop in bookings, according to ForwardKeys.
Domestic bookings in Russia, which had been one of the world's top performing markets during the pandemic, fell 49%.
ForwardKeys Vice President Insights Olivier Ponti said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had stalled a recovery in bookings that began in January after cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus peaked in many countries.

But he added the impact on trans-Atlantic travel and western European destinations was so far not as bad as he had feared.
""North Americans can tell the difference between war in Ukraine and war in Europe, and so far, it seems that travellers regard the rest of Europe as relatively safe,"" Ponti said in a statement.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digest wild swings in oil prices ahead of new high-level Russia/Ukraine talks and the latest policy-setting European Central Bank meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
European equities posted strong gains on Wednesday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both gaining over 7%, after crude prices suffered their biggest one-day drop in almost two years amid indications major producers could increase supply to attempt to make up for the disruptions caused by the Western sanctions on Russia.
Comments from UAE's ambassador to Washington saying his country will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher output to fill the supply gap as well as reports that Iraq was prepared to increase production resulted in hefty falls in the price of crude. They have since rebounded to a certain extent.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $110.37 a barrel, having fallen more than 12% on Wednesday, its worst day since late November. The Brent contract rose 2.7% to $114.09, after dropping 13%, the largest one-day drop since April 2020.
Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with commodity prices, and oil in particular, soaring to record levels, raising stagflation fears.
Sentiment was also lifted with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov set to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey later Thursday, the first get together between the two since Russia’s invasion.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -France's largest bank BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) has cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyber attack, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The French lender, believed to be the first major bank to have jettisoned staff in Moscow from its IT networks, has also placed employees in other locations on high alert for cyber threats emanating from Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine, an internal memo seen by Reuters showed.
The move, aimed at protecting the bank from cyber criminals who could use the local network as an access point, also further distances its shrinking Russian operations from the rest of the group. 
Banks are grappling with an unprecedented wave of Western sanctions designed to smother President Vladmir Putin's aggression by sparking domestic economic chaos, while any counter sanctions from Moscow could abruptly end lenders' relationships with one of the globe's biggest energy producers.
BNPP raised the alarm in late February after regulators, including the European Central Bank, warned of the threat of retaliatory hacking as Russia seeks to promote economic instability in countries siding with Ukraine.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the Russian state has anything to do with hacks against other countries.
BNPP employs fewer than 500 people in Russia, a fraction of its 190,000-plus global headcount, and has been gradually reducing its presence there, exiting retail banking in 2012 and consumer finance in 2020.
Moscow-based staff lost access to the bank's network last week and it is unclear when this will be restored, the source told Reuters.
A BNPP spokesperson said it was one of the ""least active"" international banks in Russia but it complied strictly with all international sanctions decided by the European Union and other governments.
""In the current geopolitical context cyber attacks are likely to multiply,"" the bank said in a series of messages sent to top staff and seen by Reuters.
""Our cybersecurity ... teams are on heightened alert ... and are extensively monitoring our networks,"" it said, adding that it had told business partners to do the same, as it assigned the hacking threat the ""highest priority"".
VULNERABILITY
The warning underscores a vulnerability of large Western banks and investment firms beyond the direct financial impact of war on business activities and asset values.
Cyber attacks can result in customers being unable to access accounts and other services and can hamper a bank's ability to trade.
BNPP outlined a 3 billion euro ($3.29 billion) exposure to Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday, while Italy's Unicredit (MI:CRDI) said a full write-off of its Russian business would cost around 7.4 billion euros.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and Ireland's AIB Group (OTC:AIBRF) have also flagged the risk of cyber attacks since Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, which Moscow refers to as a ""special military operation"" to disarm and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"".
Meanwhile, the Bank of England is beefing up its Cyber Security Division, with an Emerging Threat Specialist and several Senior Cyber Defence Analyst vacancies among a raft of new roles posted on its website in recent days.
The CEO of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX said on Wednesday there had been an increase in hacker attacks around the start of Russia's military operation last month.

Kyiv's cyber watchdog agency has said that Ukrainian websites have been under non-stop attack from Russian hackers since the invasion, while Meta Platforms said it had removed a network of fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine.

The move comes against the backdrop of unionization efforts gaining momentum at large U.S. corporations, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In Buffalo, Walden Anderson, Sheridan and Bailey, and Depew stores won the vote 8-7, 15-12 and 15-12, respectively, Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday.
The vote saw U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders call out Starbucks to ""end union busting & embrace this movement.""
""Starbucks workers have now voted to join unions 6 out of 7 times. Union elections will soon be held in over 120 more shops. The movement to unionize Starbucks is spreading like wildfire,"" he said in a tweet.
Starbucks, which has roughly 9,000 U.S. locations, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
In the last six months, Starbucks employees from more than 100 stores in at least 26 states have petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold union elections in their locations – including flagship Reserve Roastery locations in New York and Seattle.

Two other stores in Buffalo voted to unionize in December and January, and have begun negotiating contracts. Workers at a third location in the city voted down the union.
Last month, Starbucks workers in Mesa, Arizona, won their bid to join a labor union, marking the first company-owned U.S. location outside of New York state to do so.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Capital-hungry smaller Chinese startups are vying for speedy offshore listings by merging with blank-check firms at a time when Beijing's tighter scrutiny has slowed capital raising via overseas IPOs, company executives and bankers said.
As a string of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) hunt for targets to merge with, the startups see an opportunity to raise funds and get listed by cutting the time and regulatory rigour needed for traditional market debuts, they said.
The escalating Ukraine crisis, which has heightened market volatility and dampened investors' risk appetite, however, could cast a shadow over fundraising plans in the near-term.
SPACs are shell firms that raise money from institutional and retail investors via market listings, and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
While Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals have slowed in the past year due to mismatches in valuation expectations and some regulators toughening rules, competition is intensifying in Asia due to a large number of unicorn startups in the region.
""We badly need capital to help us grow,"" said Tian Rui, general manager of Nongdinghui Technology, which builds online marketplaces connecting farmers and consumers, and is eyeing a Nasdaq-listing this year by merging with a blank-check company.
""A SPAC is a very good tool to help accelerate our expansion,"" while traditional IPOs take too long, said Tian.
ETAO International Group, a digital healthcare group providing telemedicine, hospital care, pharmacy and health insurance, said in January it's going public on Nasdaq through a merger with a listed SPAC, valuing it at about $2.5 billion.
Other Chinese companies eyeing a U.S. listing through SPAC merger include solar technology startup Santime Technology and pet entertainment company Ailulu Technology, executives at the two companies told Reuters.
""The potential for it (SPAC) to be faster, and the fact that you have a little more control over the process… might make a difference in this environment,"" said Lin Xiaoxi, Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Linklaters.
Between 2019 and 2021, 10 Chinese firms raised $2 billion via mergers with U.S.-listed SPACs, according to SPAC specialist investment bank Chardan.
But last year deals ground to a halt, with only one company closing a SPAC merger as the U.S. regulator tightened scrutiny of Chinese companies' New York listings following Beijing's unprecedented crackdown on technology companies.
Regulatory tightening from both China and the U.S. have deterred some blank-check firms from merging with a Chinese company, but investors are not expected to ignore the opportunities, said Joel A. Gallo, Shanghai-based CFO at ETAO.
""This (SPAC) method of going public was chosen ... due to the ability to accelerate the listing process while reducing the costs associated with going public.""
GROWING INTEREST 
Most of the Chinese startups prefer to list in the United States via a SPAC merger due to higher valuation expectations, and more opportunities for such deals in that market. China has not yet created for a framework for onshore SPAC listings.
The growing Chinese interest comes as Hong Kong and Singapore have launched a market for SPAC listings recently, intensifying competition for deals even as Wall Street's craze for such deals is cooling.
Santime founder and CEO Harry Ze said a Nasdaq listing via a SPAC deal would propel its global strategy, while Ailulu executive Ding Jian said such a listing in the U.S. was more practical for his company.
Compared with an IPO, listing via a SPAC is also a more feasible option for a technology company with little business track record, said Zhang Yexuan, founder of a Chinese solar energy vehicle start-up which aims to list on Nasdaq next year.
While the Chinese securities regulator is yet to publish the final rules for raising capital by domestic companies overseas and it's not clear whether SPAC listings would also be subjected to tighter scrutiny, some advisors expect the door to stay open.

Drew Bernstein, U.S-based co-chairman of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, a China-focused international accounting firm, said he believed small companies were not a target of the new overseas capital raising rules. 
""So going after the smaller deals (in China) to be able to get things done seems to make sense,"" Bernstein said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Resource-poor Japan depends overwhelmingly on fossil-fuel imports to meet its energy needs, complicating calls for the nation to boycott Russia's oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Here's what's at stake:
WHAT'S IN JAPAN'S ENERGY MIX, AND WHY IS LNG SO IMPORTANT?
Japan gets most of its primary energy needs from crude oil, more than 90% of which comes from the Middle East, based on government data. LNG comprises about 24% of the total energy mix.
But LNG takes up a bigger piece of the pie when it comes to electricity production, at 36%. That dependence has increased since 2011, when most of Japan's nuclear facilities were idled after the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered meltdowns at a plant in Fukushima, northern Japan. 
HOW DOES JAPAN USE LNG AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?
Until it was overtaken by China last year, Japan was the world's largest importer of LNG, accounting for about 22% of the total market, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The LNG supply is primarily used in electricity production, but it is also used for heating and cooking in most residential households.
Australia was the biggest single supplier of LNG at 36% of Japan's imports as of last year, followed by Malaysia with 14%. Russia accounts for 9%, the same as the United States.
COULD JAPAN REPLACE ITS RUSSIA-SOURCED LNG?
Given Russia accounts for less than 10% of Japan's LNG supply, it could probably replace that supply from other sources. But that would only compound a surge in global prices, as demand for non-Russian gas grows while supply shrinks.
Asia LNG spot prices rocketed to a record of more than $59 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) recently, compared with less than $3 per mmBtu before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Japan has more leeway with its crude oil supplies. The country's top refiners have said they would be able to find replacements in the global spot market in the event of disruptions of Russian crude as it accounts for less than 4% of their total imports.
Japan also held 480 million barrels, or 240 days' worth of oil reserves in national and private stockpiles as of December 2021. But there are only two-three weeks of LNG inventories because Japan does not have underground storage facilities, as is common in Europe, and long-term storage is not possible due to evaporation.
WHAT DO HIGHER LNG PRICES MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE BOJ?
The effect is already being felt in Japanese households in the form of surging power bills. The surging costs also add to inflationary pressures that have been compounded in Japan via supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
So far, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has ruled out tightening monetary policy to deal with those pressures.
For Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the increase in consumer energy prices could impact the government's popularity ahead of critical Upper House elections this summer, according to Temple University political science professor James D.J. Brown.
WHAT JAPANESE FIRMS ARE INVESTED IN RUSSIAN LNG?
Trading houses Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp have stakes in the Sakhalin-2 project in eastern Russia. Mitsui also holds a stake in the $21 billion Arctic LNG 2 project, expected to be launched in 2023.
The Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO), a consortium including Itochu Corp and Marubeni Corp, are part of the Sakhalin-1 project. In turn, the Japanese government itself has put billions of dollars into those projects in the form of loans.
CAN'T JAPAN JUST SWITCH ITS NUCLEAR REACTORS BACK ON?
Increasingly, Japan is doing just that. Power from nuclear plants slid to almost zero by 2014 in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, but now stands at about 3% of total energy production. The government wants to expand that to 20%-22% by 2030, though many market watchers believe that pace is infeasible.
Only six reactors are operating now, compared with 54 before the Fukushima disaster. Many others are still going through a re-licensing process under stricter safety standards.

Speeding up the nuclear restart could be Japan's ""best option"" to make up for fuel shortages, senior lawmaker Itsunori Onodera told Reuters on Tuesday.
In perhaps another sign of this shift, the government said this week it would forgo an official memorial of the March 11 nuclear disaster for the first time since it occurred in 2011.

548,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 10:05PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Wednesday its board approved a 20-for-1 split of the e-commerce giant's common stock and authorized a $10 billion buyback plan, sending the company's shares up 7% in extended trading.
This is the first stock split by Amazon since 1999 and will give investors 19 additional shares for every share they hold. Trading based on the new share price will begin on June 6.
Amazon's share split is similar to the one announced by Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc last month. Several mega cap companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have split their stocks since 2020.
Amazon's stock, which closed at $2,785.58 on Wednesday, has nearly doubled over the last two years, when demand for both its e-commerce and cloud computing business surged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.

The stock buyback replaces the previous $5 billion stock repurchase authorized by Amazon's board in 2016, under which the company had repurchased $2.12 billion of its shares.
After shares declined about 16% amid a tech rout this year, the company's market capitalization stood at roughly $1.4 trillion as of last close.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning and were in tune with a rebound in global shares. Risk sentiment improved, with dip-buyers increasing bets that weeks of market volatility could have priced in the economic impact of the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3.71% by 9:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 2.15%, with markets re-opening after Yoon Suk-yeol was elected as the country’s next president. Yoon is expected to take a hawkish stance in relations with China and North Korea.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.51% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 2.12%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 1.76% and the Shenzhen Component rose 2.09%.
In the U.S., contracts opened little changed after the S&P 500 recorded the sharpest gains since June 2020. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares soared more than 10% in late trading after the company announced a share split and $10 billion buyback plan. The online retailer is now a key step closer to being included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Meanwhile, a rally in many commodity markets stalled, although oil clawed back some of its steep losses overnight that saw it drop below the $110 mark. Investors also digested the United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s call for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) alliance to speed up oil production. This would be a dramatic change from the cartel’s strategy so far and could pit the UAE against its fellow members.
The market volatility that has been in place since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. led to warnings of potential stagflation. Uncertainty remains, but investor sentiment picked up Wednesday after Ihor Zhovkva, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s deputy chief of staff, indicated Ukraine is open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality, but with security guarantees.
“If you see a resolution of the war in Ukraine, and we are getting some reports that Russia and Ukraine might be moving closer to the negotiation stage, that could help shift sentiment,” UBS Global Wealth Management senior U.S. equity strategist Nadia Lovell told Bloomberg.
However, “we expect the market to remain choppy near term,” she said, as both the conflict and Western sanctions against Russia continue. Lovell added that she is looking for the S&P 500 to recover to 4,800 by the end of 2022 assuming no significant escalation in geopolitical stress, “given the fact that the U.S. economy’s entering this from a position of strength.”
The Russian rouble fell as trading in the currency resumed, with the impact of the sanctions remaining strong. Investors also await the European Central Bank’s latest policy decision and the U.S. consumer price index, both due later in the day.
An imminent overhaul of cryptocurrencies oversight in the U.S. is expected to provide regulatory clarity for investors. This sparked a sharp rally in digital tokens, with Bitcoin near the $42,000 mark."

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's struggling banks entered 2022 on a wave of optimism not seen in more than a decade, with interest rates set to rise at last, the COVID-19 pandemic receding, and profits rising. The Ukraine crisis has swiftly knocked that flat.
Russia's invasion has triggered an exodus of Western companies from the country, sent commodity prices soaring, hammered the euro and even threatened a global recession, just as Europe's lenders looked poised to re-enter growth mode.
Investors had been cautiously returning to the sector, lured by cheap valuations and the prospect of excess capital set aside during the pandemic being returned as dividends and buybacks.
But capital distribution plans by Italy's UniCredit appeared to be hanging by a thread this week after it said a write-off of its Russian business would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), the starkest indication yet of how the crisis is tarnishing the sector's key appeal. 
The STOXX index of European banks has fallen 15% since the invasion on Feb. 24, against only a 5% fall in the benchmark STOXX index, making banking one of the worst performing sectors in the region.
European banks' shares trade at a discount of more than a third to their U.S. peers, RBC Europe calculations show, and could yet fall further, with valuations still above troughs seen in previous crises. 
That reflects a major change in mood in just the last few weeks. Banks' full-year earnings reports in February reflected an upbeat tone, with lenders including HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and UBS posting bumper profits, promising more shareholder payouts and citing a much improved outlook.
Assessing the potential damage to individual banks is complicated, Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management, said, because of the variety of ways they are exposed.
Some have holdings of Russian bonds and shares, others stakes in Russian banks, and others still sensitivity to secondary effects on Europe's economy.
""European growth will take a hit, so will European banks exposed to Russia - that's one of my biggest concerns,"" Theoret said. 
Graphic: Russia's attack on Ukraine a headwind for Europe: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrlqogpm/banks0803.PNG 
French, Italian and Austrian banks have the most direct exposure to Russia, according to analysis by Citi.
Those with the most to lose, via their stakes in local lenders, including UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), could still cope with a complete write-off of those holdings, analysts said.
Societe Generale on March 3 said it could cope with being stripped of its 15 billion euro stake in local lender Rosbank.
Austrian lender Raiffeisen is looking into leaving Russia, where it is the country's tenth largest bank by assets, Reuters reported earlier this month. 
Potentially more damaging for European banks in the longer run are the risks of delayed central bank rate hikes, dwindling prospects of returning excess capital to shareholders, and the threat of stagflation, whereby prices rise as growth stalls.
Prior to the conflict, markets had priced in the European Central Bank's deposit rate rising from -50 basis points (bps) to zero by year-end. They now expect only a 20bp increase, Berenberg analyst Michael Christodoulou said.
That hurts banks because higher benchmark rates help them generate greater profits on the spread between rates charged on lending and those paid out to depositors.

A likely freeze on corporate fundraising could also hit banks, such as Barclays and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which have significant capital markets businesses.
""Debt and equity issuance by clients will be put on hold until there is greater certainty, and this could negatively impact overall revenues in underwriting,"" said Maria Rivas, senior vice president for global financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar.

Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods group, and Mondeleze International, followed actions by rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) in halting investment in Russia.
But the four companies will continue providing essentials, with Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) aiming to help to maintain ""continuity"" of the Russian food supply. 
Similarly, while cigarette maker Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) suspended operations in Russia, rival Philip Morris only said it would scale down manufacturing, and Camel maker British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc said its business in Russia continued to operate, even though it had suspended capital investment.
Sony, whose movie studio has already stopped releases in Russia, took additional action on Wednesday, saying its PlayStation gaming unit would stop shipments and operations in Russia. ""Sony Interactive Entertainment joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,"" it said.
Many businesses face difficulty working in Russia due to sanctions and a lack of shipping, in addition to pressure from consumers and investors, and describe ending work in Russia in more practical terms, without blaming the Russian government for attacking Ukraine.
Heavy equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, saying it was ""deeply saddened by the significant escalation of events in Ukraine,"" announced it had ended shipments to Russia two weeks ago, and subsequently to Belarus, and said it would follow U.S. and international sanctions.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) said it was suspending business as supply chain disruptions and sanctions made business difficult and 3M followed suit after reassessing its business in Russia.
Still, pressure in the West is building.
A Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) executive early in the day said the miner was working to maintain supplies of Russian fuel to its Mongolian copper mine, but the company later announced it was terminating all commercial relationships with Russian businesses.
Hotel companies  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp said they would suspend development in Russia.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) halted sales in Russia on Tuesday in symbolically potent gestures. A senior member of the Russian ruling party has warned that foreign firms that close down could end up having their operations nationalised.
McDonald's said the temporary closure of its 847 stores in the country would cost it $50 million a month.
Sportswear firm Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) also quantified the cost of scaling back its operations, saying it would take a hit to sales of up to 250 million euros ($277 million). 
Yum Brands Inc, parent of fried chicken giant KFC, said it was pausing investments in Russia, a market that helped it achieve record development last year.
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said it was suspending Russian brewing of its namesake brand of beer while keeping its Russian Baltika brand operating.
""We feel a moral obligation to our Russian colleagues who are an integral part of Carlsberg, and who are not responsible for the actions of the Government,"" Carlsberg said, adding it was withdrawing financial guidance for the year. 
E-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc joined the crowd, saying it would suspend Russian operations and collect no fees from Ukrainian merchants, citing millions of Ukrainian refugees needing support.
'LAWS OF WAR'
In response to the exodus, Andrei Turchak, secretary of the ruling United Russia party's general council, warned Moscow might nationalise idled foreign assets.
""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak wrote in a statement published on the party's website on Monday.
The statement named Finnish privately owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures.
""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said.
SANCTIONS
Moscow, which calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" has been hit by sweeping Western sanctions that have choked trade, led to the collapse of the rouble and further isolated the country.
Banks and billionaires have also been targeted, with the European Commission preparing new sanctions targeting additional Russian oligarchs and politicians, and three Belarusian banks, Reuters reported.
While the war in Ukraine and the sanctions have bolstered prices for commodities that Russia exports such as oil, natural gas and titanium, those sanctions have largely barred Moscow from taking advantage of the high prices.
On Tuesday the United States banned Russian oil imports.
U.S. oilfield services company Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which derives about 5% of its revenue from Russia, said the ongoing conflict would likely hurt results this quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday restored California's ability to set its own zero-emission vehicle sales mandate and tailpipe emissions limits, reversing a 2019 decision by then-President Donald Trump.
The agency said it was finalizing a decision to reinstate a waiver under the Clear Air Act to California that was first awarded in 2013.
""With today’s action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.
The EPA is also rejecting a Trump-era decision to prohibit other states from adopting the California tailpipe emission standards.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said the move remedies the Trump administration's ""groundless ​attack on a critical program that is based on California's decades ​of experience setting emissions standards as authorized by law.""
The California Air Resources Board said on Tuesday it plans to significantly increase electric vehicle requirements by 2030 as the state moves to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered, light-duty vehicles by 2035.
President Joe Biden has set a goal of 50% of new-vehicle sales being electric or plug-in electric, but has not endorsed a date to phase out gasoline-vehicle sales.
In a draft document in December, the California regulator said it aimed to reach 61% of new sales as zero-emission models by 2030. A revised proposal, which is still under staff review, would aim for 68% new zero-emission vehicles in 2030, 76% in 2031, and 100% in 2035, a board spokesman told Reuters.
Sixteen states, including New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as the District of Columbia, have adopted California's tailpipe emissions rules and 13 are following its zero-emission vehicle rules.
Environmental groups praised the action.
Biden noted on Wednesday that General Motors (NYSE:GM) in November 2020 withdrew its support for Trump's effort to bar California emissions rules.
GM said Wednesday it shares California’s greenhouse gas emission ""reduction goals and vision for an all-electric future"" and would study the waiver.

In December, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration separately rescinded Trump's action seeking to bar California from setting vehicle rules conflicting with U.S. authority to set Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements.
The EPA in December finalized new vehicle emissions rules restoring targets undone by Trump and requiring a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026.

Under the settlement, the Sacklers would pay between $5.5 billion and $6 billion to a trust that will be used to pay the claims of states, victims of addiction, hospitals and others who have argued that the Purdue painkiller OxyContin played a central role in the U.S. opioid epidemic. 
The revised settlement must still be written into a new reorganization plan before getting final approval in bankruptcy court.
Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing. They said last week in a statement that they ""sincerely regret"" that OxyContin ""unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.""
There have been nearly 500,000 U.S. opioid overdose deaths over two decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, called the settlement an ""extraordinary"" improvement on previous offers from the Sacklers, and he blasted the U.S Department of Justice as ""reprehensible"" for its continued opposition.
The Justice Department's Office of the U.S. Trustee, which oversees bankruptcy administration, said that the bankruptcy court does not have authority to approve the settlement because an appeals court must first decide whether the Sacklers can receive sweeping legal immunity in exchange for the payment. 
""Why are we even here?"" Justice Department attorney Nan Eitel asked at the hearing, arguing that the deal was premature.
Drain repeatedly raised his voice at Eitel, saying that the Justice Department appeared uninterested in improving the deal and was only interested in ""throwing out ways to kill it.""
""I find this reprehensible,"" Drain said. 
An attorney for Purdue's official creditors' committee said the Justice Department appeared willing to risk a multibillion-dollar settlement so that it could strengthen its argument that bankruptcy courts should not use their authority to protect non-bankrupt entities like the Sacklers.
A Justice Department spokesperson said after the hearing that the agency stands behind its attorney and her argument, and will continue its appeal.
The Sacklers' payment is contingent on ending their exposure to opioid lawsuits. But a U.S. District judge ruled in December that the protections they seek fall outside the bankruptcy court's authority. Purdue is appealing that decision in the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.
The new agreement replaces an earlier $4.3 billion settlement, which was upended after nine attorneys general and others argued that the Sacklers should not receive such sweeping legal protections.
After agreeing to the prior deal, 20 states objected to the new settlement because it includes a $277 million payment exclusively to states that negotiated the $6 billion deal. Some have said it would unfairly reduce the percentage of funds dedicated to addressing the opioid crisis in their own states.
The states still have time to negotiate, Drain said, and may be forced to accept terms they do not like rather than inviting the ""dog eat dog"" litigation that would result if the settlement fails. 
Purdue said last week that the settlement would provide additional funding for opioid abatement programs, overdose rescue medicines and for victims, while putting the company on track to resolve its bankruptcy case on ""an expedited schedule.""
On Thursday, victims of the opioid epidemic will address members of the Sackler family in a hearing overseen by Drain. The hearing will be conducted by Zoom due to COVID-19 restrictions and the Sacklers will not be able to respond.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and members of the Sackler family of igniting the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing of OxyContin, a highly addictive pain drug.
Purdue pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its OxyContin marketing in 2007 and 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it is finalizing three safety directives for some grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines that will allow them to return to service.
The new final airworthiness directives cover Boeing 777s like a United Airlines 777 that failed shortly after takeoff from Denver in February 2021, showering debris over nearby cities. No one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The FAA said the new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, require enhanced inspections and modifications that will allow Boeing 777-200 and -300 airplanes equipped with those Pratt & Whitney engines to resume flights after being grounded for more than a year.
One directive requires installing debris shields on the thrust reverser inner wall, inspecting fan cowl doors for moisture ingression and repetitive checks of the hydraulic pump shutoff valves. Another requires modifying the engine inlet to withstand fan blade failure events. A third requires specific corrective actions depending on inspection results.
The directives will be effective in mid-April.
In February 2021, the agency ordered immediate inspections of 777 planes with PW 4000 engines before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine.
United, which is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 of those planes, said the step ""is a good and safe outcome for our industry and United customers.""
The airline said ""many of the affected engines have already undergone these proposed modifications. We expect these aircraft to resume flying customers again soon.""
Boeing must now develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements. FAA must approve that bulletin before the planes can return to service.
Boeing did not immediately comment.
In April, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13  Boeing Co  777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned, having suspended operations in February.

The Japanese carrier had an incident of its own with the PW4000 engines in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return to Naha airport in Okinawa.
The engines are on only a small number of older 777s operated by JAL, United, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Asiana Airlines Inc and Jin Air Co Ltd.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied in Europe and North America on Wednesday after three straight days of selling, and oil prices retreated from the peaks scaled over the last week after the United Arab Emirates pledged to boost its oil supply.
Moscow accused the United States on Wednesday of declaring an economic war on Russia, and said it was considering a response to the U.S. ban on Russian oil and energy imports.
Russia's economy faces the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian companies, banks, individuals and its central banking system, following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
But there were signs that the conflict could cool on Wednesday, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Turkey for more diplomatic talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up 2.91% on the day at 3:30 p.m. EST (2030 GMT).
U.S. stocks surged on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumping over 3%, rebounding from several days of declines as oil prices pulled back sharply and investors gauged developments in the Ukraine crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 778.14 points, or 2.38%, to 33,410.78, the S&P 500 gained 123.57 points, or 2.96%, to 4,294.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 493.33 points, or 3.86%, to 13,288.89.
Europe's STOXX 600 gained 4.68%.
In a rocky trading session, the international oil benchmark Brent crude settled 13.16% lower at $111.14. U.S. crude closed down 12.13% at $108.70 per barrel, its biggest one-day percentage decline since November 2021. [O/R]
Oil at one point fell more than 17% after OPEC member UAE said it would support boosting supply into a market in disarray because of supply disruptions and sanctions on Russia.
Joseph Capurso, head of international economics for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), noted that though Wednesday's market moves appear large, ""equities are still well below, and oil prices are still well above, prewar levels."" 
""The proximate cause for the big moves are signs Ukraine may accept Russian demands for neutrality in exchange for security guarantees,"" Capurso said. If the war does de-escalate, he said, investors will refocus their attention on inflation data and central banking moves.  
WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
The Russian invasion and ensuing sanctions have played havoc with global supply chains, sent prices soaring across commodities markets and could slow economic growth worldwide. 
European companies are suffering more strain on supply chains caused by the war, with German carmakers Porsche, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW all curtailing output because of a lack of supplies.
The London Metal Exchange halted nickel trading on Tuesday after prices rocketed to over $100,000 a tonne on concern that Russian supplies will be interrupted. The LME said it does not expect to resume trading before Friday.
A World Bank official said high oil prices prompted by Russia's invasion could cut a full percentage point off the growth of big developing economies such as China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.19%. 
""War is inflationary and this war in particular is very inflationary... not just in terms of energy, oil and gas, but it's inflationary across the commodities complex,"" said Dan Scott, chief investment officer at Vontobel.
""Grain prices don't react to central bank policy, and nor do necessarily nickel prices.... Hiking interest rates is not going to have a direct impact.""
After a four-session rally, spot gold fell on Wednesday by 2.4% to $2,003.66 an ounce, as markets became less risk-averse.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, but given the threat of stagflation - when prices soar and growth slows - economists expect rate hikes will be put off until later this year.
The euro rose on reports that European Union countries were discussing joint bond issuance to finance energy and defenee spending. The euro up 1.61% to $1.1074, while the dollar index fell 1.18%.
German government bond yields rose as investors awaited the ECB meeting.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was 1.9235%, as U.S. job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell by 185,000 to 11.263 million in January.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) on Wednesday reported net profit of 11.1 million reais ($2.1 million) in the fourth quarter, up from a 7.7 million reais net loss a year earlier.
Quarterly net revenue came in at 7.3 billion reais, a 25% drop year-on-year. The average estimate of analysts polled by Refinitiv Eikon was 4.95 billion reais. 
The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 22% below the same quarter from 2020 at 609.4 million reais, while its adjusted EBITDA margin were at 8.4%, ""driven by increased operational efficiency and better prices,"" it said. 
The planemaker had already reported its delivery figures for the fourth quarter in February, when it said its firm order backlog ended 2021 at the highest level since the second quarter of 2018, making analysts call for ""solid"" quarterly results.
Embraer also provided guidance for 2022, excluding its electric aircraft subsidiary Eve, saying it expects deliveries for its commercial unit between 60 and 70 jets and executive jet deliveries in the range of 100-110 aircraft.

Its free cash flow forecast were $50 million ""or better"", while its revenues were forecasted in a range of $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion for the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's watchdog voted to unveil a rule on Wednesday that aims to enhance how public companies disclose when they experience a breach, and how soon.
Under the proposed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) measures, a company would have to spell out when it experiences a risk and what strategies it has employed to address and manage such risks in current report filings, including Form 8-K.
The rule changes, which are subject to public consultation, would also require an analysis of how the cyber risks are likely to affect the company's financials. This would allow investors to assess these risks more effectively, and to locate them more readily, the SEC said.
The 3-1 vote by the commission to issue changes comes at a time of growing regulatory concern about how cyber security issues could affect markets and investors. Regulators have warned, for example, of cyber attacks from Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions.
President Joe Biden's administration has also ratcheted up its focus on the issue after a recent series of high-profile cyber attacks on U.S.-based companies.
""The interconnectedness of our networks, the use of predictive data analytics and the insatiable desire for data are only accelerating, putting our financial accounts, investments, private information at risk,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday.
""They're like honeypots sitting inside of companies and investors want to know more about how issuers are managing those growing risks.""
Wednesday's measure would also require updates in periodic reports to give investors more complete information on previously disclosed, material cybersecurity incidents, the agency said.
The proposals would build on existing SEC cyber risk guidance, which is set to remain in effect, even under the SEC's new rules, an agency official told reporters.
""How a company might think about the impact (of a breach) to management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions ... should still be taken into consideration,"" the official added.
The SEC has long warned companies that materiality of a cyber breach should not be limited to the quantitative impact on revenue or assets, but should consider qualitative factors that a reasonable investor would consider in making decisions.
Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, who dissented on the proposal, said the move goes beyond the agency's mission.
""This proposal flirts with casting us as the nation's Cybersecurity Command Center -- a role Congress didn't give us,"" she said.

Tom Quaadman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said he welcomes attention to the matter of cybersecurity risk management, but urged that the SEC liaise with other federal cyber experts to help ""ensure policies are supportive, not duplicative.""
""The SEC, as a disclosure agency, should be mindful to not get in the way of national security priorities and focus on robust coordination.""

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) -Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) were the latest banks to set out their Russian exposures, warning of billions of euros in potential costs from the financial fallout from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Banks, insurers and asset managers have been scrambling to distance themselves from Russia and assess their exposures after Moscow was hit with heavy sanctions by the West in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine that began last month. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
BNP Paribas has also cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyberattack, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The French lender is believed to be the first major bank to have excluded staff in Moscow from its IT networks.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Wednesday it is operating its Russian consumer business on a more limited basis following the country's invasion of Ukraine, while sticking with its previous plans to divest the franchise.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), meanwhile, said on Wednesday its exposure to financial markets in Russia and Ukraine was very limited. Deutsche Bank has reduced its Russian exposure and local footprint significantly since 2014, with further reductions in the past two weeks, the bank added.
The European Union agreed new sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus on Wednesday that blacklist 14 more oligarchs and freeze relations with Belarus' central bank and three top lenders there.
Financial information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) added to the growing list of companies to suspend commercial operations in Russia, a day after Britain's  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) stopped some services in the country.
Italy's second-biggest bank, UniCredit, said late on Tuesday that a full write-off of its Russian business would cost it around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion).
BNP Paribas said it had a total exposure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Russia and Ukraine, which it said was relatively limited.
Shares in Europe's major financial firms have fallen sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as investors took fright at some institutions' exposure to Russia and braced for a potential broader economic slowdown.
UniCredit said a worst-case scenario would knock 2 percentage points off its capital ratio, but nonetheless stuck with its dividends and share buyback plans.
Shares in UniCredit rebounded 11.68% and BNP Paribas 9.95%, with the wider STOXX index of European banks up 7.49% on the day, staging a partial rebound after recent falls. 
The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since June 5, 2020. 
Analysts suggested the rebound could be a temporary relief rally.
""The mood in the markets has swung around and stocks are enjoying a major rally. The fact that Western governments seem to be carrying out an economic war against Russia, rather than military conflict, has helped the overall sentiment,"" wrote David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.
PULLING BACK
Europe's struggling banks entered 2022 on a wave of optimism not seen in more than a decade, but investors and analysts have warned the Ukraine crisis may have knocked that flat.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economists slashed their forecast for European growth on Wednesday and now expect the region to expand just 1% this year as the Ukraine crisis turbocharges commodities prices and disrupts supply chains.
Among European banks, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) have the largest Russian exposure. 
S&P Global joined rival credit rating agencies Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch in suspending commercial operations in Russia.
The move comes as the London Stock Exchange Group suspended access in Russia to products containing news and commentary, as well as all new sales of products and services. LSEG said data products will continue to be accessible by currently serviced customers.
LSEG distributes news and commentary from Reuters as part of its products.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE.
A new Russian law makes it possible to jail journalists who report any event that could discredit the Russian military.
Two of the world's largest insurers, British-based Prudential and Legal & General, said on Wednesday they each had very small exposures to Russia and no plans to increase them.
Financial firms have also been bracing for other potential risks from the war, with regulators working closely with companies to prepare defences against the threat of cyberattacks.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX said it had seen an increase in hacker attacks around the start of the invasion but said this had since subsided.

(Reuters) - Meatless burger maker Impossible Foods sued competitor Motif Foodworks on Wednesday, accusing the startup of copying its technology for imitating the taste of real meat.
The lawsuit filed in Delaware federal court said Motif, a spinoff of biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks, infringes an Impossible Foods patent by using the protein molecule heme in its plant-based beef.
A Motif spokesperson called the lawsuit ""nothing more than a baseless attempt by Impossible Foods to stifle competition"" and said it would fight the claims.
Boston-based Motif announced last year that it had raised $226 million in its second round of investment financing. 
Wednesday's lawsuit said heme is a ""central component of meat's appeal,"" and Impossible incorporates the protein in its plant-based burger to replicate meat's taste, smell, and ""overall sensory experience.""
The lawsuit said Motif's use of an ingredient it calls ""Hemami"" in its imitation burgers infringes an Impossible Foods patent covering a ""beef replica"" product that also uses heme.

Impossible Foods asked for an undisclosed amount of money damages and a court order blocking Motif's sales of the allegedly infringing burger.
An Impossible Foods spokesperson said the company welcomes competition but does ""not tolerate attempts to undermine our brand or products"" through infringement.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s low-cost 5G model should enhance the iPhone maker's appeal in Asia where it is in a stiff battle with multiple rivals from Samsung (KS:005930) to Vivo, analysts believe.
After focusing on high-end phones during the pandemic-induced supply chain crisis, Apple this week unveiled 5G connectivity to its iPhone SE - for $429 - which is likely to attract more lower-end buyers in emerging markets.
""The new 3rd gen iPhone SE could be effective in gaining incremental share among price sensitive consumers, especially in Asia,"" Cowen and Company brokerage said, citing China and India in particular.
Counterpoint Research said the earlier 4G iPhone SE accounted for 12% of total iPhone sales from its launch in Q2 2020 until the end of 2021, with Japan the biggest market after the United States.
'DEMAND TO OPEN UP'
""This time we expect demand to open up more across other markets like Europe, SE (South East) Asia and Korea – regions where many consumers stayed away because of the lack of 5G support (for the older SE),"" Counterpoint Research analyst Sujeong Lim said.
The world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $2.6 trillion, Apple achieved its highest ever market share in China at the end of last year, surpassing Huawei to become the best seller, according to a previous Counterpoint. 
Cowen and Company analyst Krish Sankar said the new small-screen 5G phone's $30 price hike from the 4G version should cover most extra costs from the enhanced technology, though margins would be lower compared to the $699 iPhone 13 mini.

He estimated the iPhone SE would generate gross margin between 42%-54%, or roughly half the gross profit for each device compared with the iPhone 13 mini.
""We believe a renewed affordable iPhone SE lineup should buoy consumer interest in iPhones versus investor fears of sharp declines,"" Citi analyst Jim Suva said.

Puma, whose relationship with the Italians stretches back almost two decades, will provide their kit for the World Cup in Qatar in November, assuming the team qualifies for the competition.

The following are some companies which have offered support:
ENERGY
TotalEnergies said on March 1 it would provide fuel to the Ukrainian authorities and aid to refugees in Europe, but stopped short of joining rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in planning to exit positions in oil-rich Russia.
COMMUNICATIONS
Ukraine said in late February it had received Starlink satellite internet terminals donated by SpaceX, though CEO Elon Musk and an internet security researcher warned these could become Russian targets.
More than a dozen telecom providers are providing free international calls to Ukraine or scrapping roaming charges there. Firms taking measures include A1 Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY) Group, Altice Portugal, AT&T (NYSE:T), Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Orange, Proximus, Swisscom, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Telenor, Telia Company, TIM, KPN, Vivacom and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). 
NECESSITIES
Poland's largest food retailer Biedronka said it would hire family members of its 1,800 Ukrainian employees, who would each receive a $233 grant. It has also introduced food banks collection points and pledged funds to bring food and hygiene products to refugees.
IKEA and the Ingka Foundation pledged $11 million for aid groups to bring products and services to Ukraine, while home retailer Jysk said it would give out free stock from stores it reopened in western Ukraine, and H&M said it would donate clothes and other necessities.
ACCOMMODATION
Airbnb said it was working with its hosts to offer free, short-term housing to up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, and that it was temporarily waiving its booking fees there.
Nordic Choice offered free lodging in its Vilnius hotel, while Poland's Arche Hotels said three days after Russia launched the invasion that it had already put up 1,000 refugees as it prepared to lodge 5,000, and called for clothes, Polish language books and toy donations for children fleeing Ukraine. 
HEALTHCARE
Sweden's Medicover and private Polish provider LuxMed said they were providing free medical assistance to Ukrainians coming to Poland, while Gdansk-based Nivique clinic offered free gynaecological services to female refugees. 
Merck, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) have offered COVID-19 pills, funds for medical devices, insulin and coronavirus treatments, while L'Oreal said it had distributed 250,000 hygiene products and would provide more in coming weeks. 
TRAVEL
Train operators across Central and Western Europe have meanwhile offered free travel to Ukrainians, while Flixbus added buses to run free routes to refugees of all nationalities from the main Polish border crossing of Medyka, as well as free tickets from Bucharest.
Low-cost airline Wizz Air said it offer 100,000 free seats to Ukrainian citizens on short haul flights from border countries.
Car rental companies Panek CarSharing and 4Mobility said they would allocate parts of their fleet for transport to the border and invited volunteers to help.

(Reuters) -Walt  Disney  Co Chief Executive Bob Chapek voiced disappointment on Wednesday with a Florida bill limiting LGBTQ discussion in schools, saying he called Governor Ron DeSantis to express concern about the legislation becoming law.
Disney has been under pressure to take a public stand against the legislation that critics say will harm the lesbian, gay, transgender and queer community. The company employs more than 65,000 people at the sprawling Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World resort in Orlando.
Chapek said Disney was ""opposed to the bill from the onset,"" but chose to work behind the scenes, relying on its longstanding relationships with lawmakers, to influence the outcome.
""I understand our original approach, no matter how well intended, didn't quite get the job done,"" Chapek said during Disney's annual shareholder meeting.
A spokesperson for DeSantis, however, said a call from Chapek on Wednesday was ""the first time we have heard from Disney"" regarding the legislation.
""The governor did take the call from Mr. Chapek. The governor’s position has not changed,"" the spokesperson said via a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The Florida legislation, referred to by its opponents as the ""don't say gay"" bill, has stirred national controversy amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender. DeSantis, who is seeking re-election this year, has indicated his support for what is formally called the Parental Rights in Education bill. 
""The same Florida parents who take their families to Disney also support parental rights in education, because they do not want their children exposed to inappropriate content about sex and gender theory at school,"" the DeSantis spokesperson said.
One Disney shareholder from California read a statement from his daughter, who had been accepted into the Disney College Program in Florida, and was ""heartbroken"" that Disney failed to take a public position on Florida's legislation. 
""You can't stand on the sidelines when it comes to human rights,"" she wrote.
The Disney CEO said he had an ""extraordinary conversation"" with DeSantis, who assured Chapek that the law would not be ""weaponized in any way"" or used to harm or target gay, lesbian, non-binary or transgender kids or their families. Chapek said the governor agreed to meet with him and LGBTQ+ Disney employees to discuss concerns.
Chapek said Disney has joined some 170 companies in signing a statement from the Human Rights Commission's opposing anti-LGBTQ state legislation. The company also pledged $5 million toward organizations, including the HRC, that are working to protect LGBTQ rights.

In other matters, Disney shareholders elected all 11 board members, ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Disney's independent public accountant and supported the compensation for the company's top executives. Investors rejected all shareholder proposals except one, which calls for the company to report on both median and adjusted pay gaps across race and gender. 
“We appreciate our shareholders’ view on this important issue, and the Board accepts the results of today’s vote,"" the company said in a statement, adding it is committed to pay equity.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian carriers are seeing a bounce in spring travel after a slump due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with the country's largest airport bracing for its busiest travel day since the onset of the pandemic this Friday.
But just as COVID-19 shows signs of ebbing, surging oil prices due to the Russian-Ukraine crisis and high regulatory costs are casting shadows ahead of the busy summer vacation season.
Canadian air traffic is recovering more slowly than in the United States due to tougher virus restrictions.
But after rules eased in February, flights to some sun destinations rebounded in March to levels similar to those seen before Omicron hit winter travel, data from airline data company Cirium suggest.
Toronto Pearson International Airport on Wednesday said it is expecting March 11 to be the busiest travel day since the start of the pandemic, with about 85,000 passengers set to arrive or depart ahead of spring break next week in the country's most populous-province, Ontario.
The country's two largest carriers, Air Canada and privately-held WestJet Airlines are recalling and hiring flight attendants, said Hugh Pouliot, a spokesman for the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) which represents them.
Westjet is ""hiring like mad right now.""
""We have seen an uptick in demand for both short-term (spring break) and long-term travel,"" said WestJet spokeswoman Denise Kenny.
Still, WestJet operates about 350 flights a day compared with more than 700 pre-pandemic, she noted.
""Even with this uptick we won't recover to 2019 levels,"" said Suzanne Acton-Gervais, interim president of the National Airlines Council of Canada (NACC), which represents the country's largest carriers.
Both U.S. and Canadian airlines have called for an end to testing requirements by the two countries for international travellers as they face higher oil prices and other costs.
""What we're hopeful is as the rules become less complex and more predictable people will feel comfortable traveling again,"" said Acton-Gervais who wants Canada to end testing by April 1.
The price of oil, which has climbed steadily since late last year, is linked to capacity growth, said U.S. airline trade group Airlines for America in a presentation, as some of the country's carriers cut less profitable routes. 
Air Canada and U.S. legacy carriers have said they do not have current plans to hedge.
WestJet's Kenny said other costs have risen during the pandemic with 24% of every C$100 spent on airfare in Canada going to regulatory fees.

Kenny said WestJet has not increased fares, or ""made any deliberate change to our systems in response to the rising cost of fuel.""
Air Canada said airline pricing is based on different factors including competition and demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposed bill to fund the U.S. government's operations through September would cut $2 billion from a COVID-19 program to boost aviation manufacturing and repair businesses.
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill on Wednesday that redirects $15.6 billion in COVID-19 relief programs to other COVID programs.
In total, the U.S. Transportation Department has offered $673 million nationwide in three rounds of awards in the $3 billion program.
The aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program created in 2021 covers up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for up to six months. Some major aerospace firms like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) opted not to participate.
Grantees may not conduct furloughs without employee consent or lay off workers covered by subsidies during that period.
Among the 593 awards offered were $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), $20.9 million for Connecticut-based Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) Corp, $17.5 million to BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Controls, $12.9 million to Airbus' U.S arm, $15 million to Learjet, a unit of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc, and $12.5 million to Dassault Falcon Jet Corp.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, was offered about $40 million for various U.S. units.

The department said the awards will support 31,000 U.S. jobs in 43 states.
To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) took a 728 million euro ($805 million) writedown on its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) in 2021, the French media group said on Wednesday, as it reported a doubling in core operating earnings over the same period.
The Paris-based company, whose top investor is billionaire Vincent Bollore, is the largest shareholder of the former Italian monopoly with a 24% stake, which reflects a total initial investment in the company of 3.9 billion euros since 2015.
Private equity firm KKR made a non-binding approach to Telecom Italia (TIM) in November which was pitched at 0.505 euro per share, valuing Italy's largest telecoms company at 10.8 billion euros.
By comparison, Vivendi's average purchase price of Telecom Italia shares was 1.07 euros each, while the company's current book value for TIM shares is 0.63 euro against 0.83 euro per share as of June 2021, according to a Reuters calculation based on available documents. 
A Vivendi spokesperson said the exact figure for the book value for TIM was 0.657 euro per share. TIM shares closed on Wednesday at 0.26 euro each. 
In a call with reporters, Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine praised the recent appointment of TIM's new boss, Pietro Labriola, and confirmed that KKR's initial approach undervalued the phone company.
""It's a turning point for Telecom Italia,"" he said. ""We consider its value very much higher than its current share price and that of the virtual value mentioned by KKR in its statement of intent."" 
Vivendi supports Labriola's turnaround plan for TIM, de Puyfontaine added. 
A TIM board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal will be held on Sunday once TIM's advisers complete an analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, two sources close to the matter said.
Vivendi said it also took an impairment charge of 200 million euros on its wholly-owned mobile video game-maker Gameloft, reflecting a decline of the division's performance. 
The company more than doubled its earnings before interest, tax and amortisation last year to 690 million euros thanks to strong growth at its pay-TV group Canal Plus, advertising unit Havas and publishing division Editis. 

Vivendi did not provide targets for the current year.

(Reuters) - Australian and South African miners are exploring ways to supply coal and metals consumers in Europe scrambling for alternative sources to Russian supply, but logistics and cost constraints make it difficult to rapidly boost output, companies said. 
Prices of palladium, coal and other commodities have skyrocketed since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, while sanctions on Moscow drive Western consumers to replace Russian supply.
Customers are approaching suppliers they have no existing relationships with, desperate to secure the commodities, major producers said. Miners typically utilize long-term contracts, making surplus supply scarce. 
Palladium, used by automakers in engine exhausts to reduce emissions, hit a record high on Monday before easing back. Russia accounts for 25-30% of the world's palladium supply. 
South Africa's Sibanye-Stillwater, the world's largest primary producer of platinum, said some clients have asked about its ability to produce more platinum group metals (PGMs) but that it has very little flexibility to increase production in ""any material way"" in the short to medium term.
""Accelerating projects is possible but ... this is not a quick fix and will generally still take months or even years before the benefits are apparent,"" Sibanye said in responses to Reuters' questions. 
Automakers, who use palladium in engine exhausts to reduce emissions, will start substituting platinum for palladium if palladium prices stay high, Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman said last week.
The auto industry is expected to account for 42% of overall demand for platinum this year, up from 37% in 2021, the World Platinum Investment Council forecast on Wednesday. 
Platinum prices have also risen due to uncertainty over Russian supplies, but more mutedly as platinum is forecast to remain in oversupply this year.
South Africa's Impala Platinum (OTC:IMPUY), the world's third-largest producer of PGMs, also said it has limited capacity to plug the gap left by Russia's palladium supplies. Russia's Norilsk Nickel alone produces around 38% of global palladium and 11% of global platinum, Sibanye said. 
While miners are benefiting from the rise in metal prices, Sibanye's Froneman cautioned that supply chain disruptions could have a destructive impact on demand further down the line. 
More costly metals are also a headache for carmakers hoping to make electric vehicles more affordable. 
SHUNNING RUSSIAN COAL
Companies in Europe, which relies on Russia for 70% of its coal supplies, are also turning to Australian miners for supply of the fuel.
""Due to the conflict, we are fielding requests from Europe for security of met coal supply,"" said Gerhard Ziems, group chief financial officer of Coronado, one of the world's largest producers of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking. 
Coronado will boost output to about 18-19 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022 from 17.4Mt last year, he said. Ziems estimated the Russia exports about 45 million metric tonnes of met coal per year. 
""In circumstances where the international community is shunning Russian coal, supply shortfalls need to be sourced from elsewhere which includes established markets such as Australia and the U.S. in which Coronado operate,"" he said.
Australia's top independent producers, Whitehaven Coal and New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) Group, said they have been approached to supply countries, including Poland, which have traditionally relied on Russian coal, and the latter said it was looking at ways to supply the European market.
""We have a mix of contracted and spot sales which allows us to take advantage of tactical opportunities in the market,"" a Whitehaven spokeswoman told Reuters.
The Australian government said last week that it would help its coal-importing Western allies to find alternatives to Russia for supplies by connecting them with local producers.
Glyn Lawcock, head of mining research at Barrenjoey, said while the idea appeared simple, the execution was not, as Australian miners were already flat out.
""It's not like people have volumes sitting there to give out. Ukraine/Russia produces high grade pellets for markets... there is no one sitting on surplus material,"" Lawcock said. 

In a sign of how tight the market is, coal prices for loading at Newcastle - the world's biggest coal port on Australia's east coast - rocketed to a record $440 a tonne last Wednesday, a five-fold jump from a year ago.
Australian Resources Minister Keith Pitt said this was an opportunity for Australian miners, and called for expansion of coal mines in the country, as these could help desperate European nations wean themselves off Russian coal.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Two Russian members of the supervisory board of Dutch luxury yacht maker Heesen Yachts stepped down on Wednesday, the company said, citing ""developments of the current international situation in Ukraine.""
Heesen, one of four major luxury yacht makers in the Netherlands, is owned by Morcell Ltd. of Cyprus, the investment vehicle of billionaire Lukoil president Vagit Alekperov, though its managers are Dutch.
Neither Alekperov nor the resigning board members are on international sanctions lists, though trading in Lukoil shares has been suspended.
""The current situation (leads) us to step back for the good of a company that is close to our hearts,"" Pavel Sukhoruchkin and Pavel Novoselov said in a statement.
Their resignations were first reported by Dutch investigative news site ""Follow The Money"".
Wealthy Russians are the second-largest purchasers of yachts longer than 40 meters, after Americans, according to a 2021 report by industry publication SuperYacht Times. 
Yacht-building is a significant industry in the Netherlands, with chamber of commerce records showing that Heesen, Feadship, Damen Shipyards, and Oceanco had combined sales of around 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion) in 2020.
The resignations at Heesen come after United States President Joe Biden said at the start of the month that the U.S. was ""joining with our European allies to find and seize (oligarchs') yachts.""
While France has seized one luxury yacht it says is linked to sanctioned Rosneft boss Igor Sechin, others such as one owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg, have become stuck or delayed in ports or shipyards due to international financial sanctions.

Reuters reported on March 3 that at least 5 yachts owned by Russian billionaires have moved to the Maldives, which has no extradition treaty with the United States.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 surged Wednesday, on hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality, which could prove key in ending the conflict.
The S&P 500 rose 2.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2%, or 653 points, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%.
“U.S. equity markets are rallying this morning, as favorable geopolitical chatter and bargain buying work to reduce oversold chart conditions on benchmarks like the S&P 500,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
Ukraine reportedly said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand of neutrality in exchange for security guarantees.
The prospect, albeit still very nascent, of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis cooled the run-up in commodity prices including energy, and eased fears about a prolonged impact on global growth.
Technology stocks and financial stocks led the market rebound, with the latter boosted by a surge in banks as Treasury yields jumped.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) were up more than 6%.
Big tech also played a role in the broader market melt up, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 3%, a day after the tech giant unveiled a several new products including a new updated iPhone and revamped M1 chip.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 5% after Wedbush upgraded its rating on the streaming company to a neutral rating from underperform.
The decline in oil prices also provided a boost to fuel-sensitive sectors of the market including airlines and cruise lines.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line(NYSE:NCLH), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up sharply.
The rebound in the broader market comes just a day ahead of an inflation report expected to show that consumer prices rose nearly 8% in the 12 months through February.
The economy, however, is expected to remain in good shape despite forecasts of slowing growth ahead as the consumer, which makes up about 66% of the economy, has shown little sign of reining in spending.
""The lack of early signs of deterioration in consumer spending like substitutions and trading down [reflects] the ability of the consumer to continue to spend money,""  Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday. ""They're still willing to pay up for all of the things that they were paying for throughout the pandemic."""

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge fund Third Point LLC is pushing Cano Health to put itself up for sale because the senior-care facility operator's stock price has tumbled since it went public with a blank check company.
The New York-based firm, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, said in a regulatory filing that it now owns 6.4% of the Miami-based company, making it the third-largest investor.
Third Point, which invests $18 billion, spent $106 million to buy 11.5 million shares, the filing said.
Loeb, who has run activist campaigns at Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) and  Campbell Soup  Company (NYSE:CPB) and recently pushed  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to make changes, said his firm is currently not looking for board seats. The filing said the firm has ""confidence"" in the company's strategy and management team.
But that could change, the filing said, if the company fails to address the ""value gap"" between its share price and intrinsic value of the company.
Cano's sluggish stock price is related to the fact that investors have ""a largely unfavorable view of companies taken public through special purpose acquisition vehicles"", Loeb wrote. He urged the company to hire bankers and lawyers to review strategic alternatives and said ""this strategic review should focus on a sale.""
Cano Health closed its merger with investor Barry Sternlicht's special purpose acquisition company in June and its stock price lost more than half of its value. On Wednesday the stock price surged 40% on news Third Point was involved, valuing the company at $3 billion.

Cano said in a statement that it is ""successfully executing its strategy"" and that the business has strong momentum, ""as demonstrated by our 115% year-over-year membership growth in 2021 and continued growth into 2022."" The company, which operates primary care medical centers in eight U.S. states and Puerto Rico, also said it welcomes shareholder perspectives.
Third Point participated in a private placement alongside Sternlicht and Fidelity Management & Research Company and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to a statement made when the deal was announced.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Rio Tinto Ltd is working to maintain steady supplies of fuel and other goods for its Mongolian copper operations from suppliers that buy from Russia and elsewhere, a top executive at the mining giant said on Wednesday. 
The Anglo-Australian company is developing Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest known copper and gold deposits. Rio controls about two-third of the project, with Ulanbaatar controlling the rest. 
While Rio has begin looking for alternative fuel sources for Oyu Tolgoi, the company does not believe it can stop buying from Russia altogether, Bold Baatar, head of Rio's copper business, said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Rio has supply agreements for a host of products with Mongolian suppliers, many of whom procure materials from Russia.
""The reality is, Mongolia has two very big powerful neighbors, so it's quite important for us to maintain healthy, peaceful, balanced relationships,"" Baatar said of his home country. 
Mongolia is bordered on the north by Russia and on the south and east by China, leaving Rio few options to secure supplies for the project, which is set to be the world's third-largest copper mine.
Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, multiple companies and countries have announced they will stop business in Russia and buying Russian products. 
Baatar said it would be ""very difficult"" for Rio's Mongolian operations to stop all imports from Russia, adding that some supplies come through Russia via Kazakhstan.
""That kind of supply is fine unless the world wants to completely shut the Russian borders, which is not possible,"" he said.
Rio in January ended a long-running feud with Mongolia's government over control of Oyu Tolgoi. The deal marked a positive development for the company, which is facing major pushback for projects in Serbia, the United States and Guinea. 
Baatar appeared on a copper panel at the conference alongside Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc and Trafigura's Julien Rolland. 
Baatar told the panel that it was ""pretty imperative"" for the United States to develop more copper mines to supply copper needed for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. Rio is trying to develop the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, but has faced Native American opposition.
Mining companies ""should respect the wishes of communities, and many communities don't want to see mining,"" Baatar said. 

When asked what that meant for the Arizona project, Baatar said he believes an agreement can be reached with local Native Americans.
""I completely respect their views of the project and I'm really hopeful we can find a mutual, common solution,"" he said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto industry companies need to take into account their communities and workers through greater environmental protections and higher pay in the transition to electric vehicles, a panel of investors, labor officials and human rights activists said on Wednesday.
The global auto industry is shifting to EVs in response to pressure from countries and regions like China and Europe that want to reduce carbon emissions. 
Companies also face growing pressure from investors on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters. Automakers not only are charging ahead on the EV rollout, but also working to ensure a supply of battery minerals.
""Every business will be significantly affected by the transition to a net-zero economy,"" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said at a conference held by the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of public, corporate and union employee benefit funds. 
""Companies have a responsibility to their investors ... and to their communities and their workers to prepare for this transition,"" he added. ""We can't let them bury their heads in the sand and pretend they don't need to make any changes.""
Part of that push includes good-paying jobs and access to union representation in plants, the speakers said at the event in Washington. 
Cindy Estrada, vice president of the United Auto Workers union, which represents most U.S. hourly workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis, said the key is protecting worker jobs and wages in the EV transition.
""We could end up doing this transition and lower workplace standards,"" she said, citing the numerous EV battery plants coming online in the United States. She said the battery plant workers are expected to be paid about $17 an hour, compared with the $30-plus workers in current engine plants earn.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk earlier this month invited the UAW to hold a vote to represent workers at the EV leader's California plant. UAW officials have not commented on the invitation, but Musk has been hostile to the union in the past.
In November, 10 advocacy groups, including Sierra Club and Greenpeace, urged EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc to engage with labor unions. Workers at Rivian's Illinois plant are not unionized.

Investors need to use their leverage with companies to ask tough questions and push for greater transparency, said Richard Kent, Amnesty International's researcher on human rights and energy transition. 
Wednesday's panel was hosted by SOC Investment Group, an adviser for union pension funds with more than $250 billion in assets. SOC pressed Rivian last fall on its battery supply chain.

584,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 03:06PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee have asked the U.S. Department Of Justice (DOJ) to investigate Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for ""potentially criminal conduct"" by the company and some of its senior executives.
In a letter to the Attorney General of the United States, the bipartisan group of lawmakers said Amazon had engaged in a ""pattern and practice of misleading conduct that suggests"" it was acting with an improper purpose to influence or obstruct the panel's investigation into competition in digital markets.
""We have no choice but to refer this matter to the Department of Justice to investigate whether Amazon and its executives obstructed Congress in violation of applicable federal law,"" stated the letter dated March 9.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement: ""There's no factual basis for this, as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we've provided over several years of good faith cooperation with this investigation.""
A DOJ spokesperson said the department has received the letter and will review it.
The referral to the DOJ follows a previous warning from members of the U.S. committee in October 2021 accused Amazon's top executives, including founder Jeff Bezos, of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices. 
That letter had come days after a Reuters investigation showed that Amazon had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands - practices Amazon has denied engaging in.
The members had at the time stated the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets ""directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.""
Amazon at the time said the company and its executives ""did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.""
In Wednesday's letter to the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. lawmakers cited stories from various media outlets including Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and Politico about the American e-commerce giant's business practices.
They added that Amazon had declined several opportunities to demonstrate with evidence that it had made accurate and complete representations to the panel during its investigation.
The Reuters investigation in October, which was based on a review of thousands of internal Amazon documents, showed that, at least in India, Amazon had a formal, clandestine policy of manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods – and that at least two senior company executives had reviewed it.

The latest letter from U.S. lawmakers cited the Reuters story, and released a letter from Amazon dated Nov. 1 in which it told five committee members that the company was ""looking into the allegations in the Reuters article,"" adding that ""doing so will take time.""
Amazon also told the U.S. panel that ""creating private brands that are similar or even identical to existing brands is a common retail practice.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 surged Wednesday, led by dip-buying in financials and tech on hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality that could prove key in ending the conflict.
The S&P 500 rose 2.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1%, or 677 points, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.5%.
“U.S. equity markets are rallying this morning, as favorable geopolitical chatter and bargain buying work to reduce oversold chart conditions on benchmarks like the S&P 500,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
Ukraine reportedly said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand of neutrality in exchange for security guarantees.
The prospect, albeit still very nascent, of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis cooled the run-up in commodity prices including energy, and eased fears about a prolonged impact on global growth.
Technology stocks and financial stocks led the market rebound, with the latter boosted by a surge in banks as Treasury yields jumped.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) were up more than 6%.
Big tech also played a role in the broader market melt up, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 2%, a day after the tech giant unveiled a several new products including a new updated iPhone and revamped M1 chip.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped more than 7% after Wedbush upgraded its rating on the streaming company to a neutral rating from underperform.
The decline in oil prices also provided a boost to fuel-sensitive sectors of the market including airlines and cruise lines.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line(NYSE:NCLH), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up sharply.
The rebound in the broader market comes just a day ahead of an inflation report expected to show that consumer prices rose nearly 8% in the 12 months through February.
The economy, however, is expected to remain in good shape despite forecasts of slowing growth ahead as the consumer, which makes up about 66% of the economy, has shown little sign of reining in spending.
""The lack of early signs of deterioration in consumer spending like substitutions and trading down [reflects] the ability of the consumer to continue to spend money,""  Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday. ""They're still willing to pay up for all of the things that they were paying for throughout the pandemic."""

587,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- When Pamplona Capital Management invested in Paraxel, a company that conducted clinical trials for developers of Covid-19 treatments, Russian money greased the purchase. 
When the London-based private equity firm announced its decision to buy Danish tech distributor EET Group and U.S. garden-products company BFG Supply, Russian money was behind those deals, too.
Pamplona, which raised $11 billion for five private equity funds since its 2005 inception, has marketed itself as a manager for all kinds of investors, saying as recently as last year that it caters to “a variety of clients including public pension funds, international wealth managers, multinational corporations, family offices, and funds of hedge funds.” 
But one client has stood out: LetterOne Holdings, the investment conglomerate co-founded by Mikhail Fridman, one of many Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the European Union last week following the invasion of Ukraine. Pamplona oversees almost $3 billion of LetterOne’s money, according to a LetterOne spokesman.
The sanctions are a reminder of how Russian wealth stretches far beyond Western trophy assets such as sports teams, superyachts and mansions. It helps to power the movement of food, technology and agricultural supplies. Efforts to untangle those interests from private equity investments will ripple across national economies for years to come.
Even though LetterOne is Pamplona’s biggest source of capital, the private equity firm announced Wednesday that it “has begun the process” of redeeming LetterOne’s partnership interests.

“While Pamplona has received clear guidance that LetterOne is not a sanctioned entity, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine makes such relationships increasingly challenging for our portfolio companies, their management teams, customers, employees, and counterparties throughout Europe and the rest of the world,” Pamplona said in a statement.
LetterOne said it’s disappointed by the decision.
“We sincerely wish to cooperate constructively with Pamplona and we will continue to focus on protecting the jobs our investments support while distributing the $150 million of aid we have pledged for relief for the victims of the war in Ukraine,” LetterOne said in an emailed statement.
As the sanctions began to bite and the influence of Russian money on the global economy came under greater scrutiny, Pamplona faced increasing pressure over its relationship with its most prominent backer. Lenders to the firm’s portfolio companies were reassessing those business relationships because of its ties to Russian capital, according to people familiar with the matter.
The influence of Russian money has far-reaching implications for investment firms and their backers, said MaameYaa Kwafo-Akoto, a partner at London law firm Allen & Overy.
“It is a concern for fund managers as capital that was guaranteed for portfolio investments is now out of reach,” she said. “Overnight, sanctioned lenders and investors are no longer an option.”

Fridman, 57, a native of Lviv, Ukraine, amassed a fortune by founding one of Russia’s largest private banks and collecting profits from energy ventures. In 2013, he set up Luxembourg-based LetterOne along with Petr Aven, 66, and other Russian associates to invest part of the $14 billion they took in from the sale of their stake in TNK-BP, a former state-owned company with interests in Siberian oilfields, to Rosneft Oil Co. 
The two men, who stepped down from LetterOne last week and together own less than half of the firm, said the sanctions were based on false allegations and that they plan to contest them.
“These are malicious and deliberate lies -- pure and simple, the product of historical fantasies and conspiracy theories dreamt up by individuals with their own agendas,” they said in a statement.
LetterOne also said that none of its underlying investments are affected by sanctions.

Private equity firms typically secure commitments from multiple investors and then ask for the money when they’re ready to deploy it. Clients that default on those commitments can hamper an investment firm’s ability to do deals or provide financing to help their portfolio companies grow. Several large credit funds and investment banks had shunned investing and underwriting Pamplona’s deals because of its ties to Russian money, the people said.
Much of the debt carried by Pamplona’s portfolio companies is wrapped up in leveraged loans and private credit, both of which are hard to trade, especially during a crisis. 
‘Unique Strength’
Pamplona’s Russian investors attracted scrutiny from Washington in recent years. In 2019, Pamplona sold cybersecurity company Cofense after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pressured it to do so, citing national security risks associated with the amount of Pamplona’s foreign backing.
Pamplona was founded in 2005 by Alexander Knaster, the former chief executive officer of sanctioned Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Fridman is the co-founder and chairman of the bank’s parent, Alfa Group, one of Russia’s largest financial industrial conglomerates. His net worth has tumbled $4 billion this year to $9.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Over the years, he channeled more money to Pamplona through various investment entities. The firm’s executives, recognizing the risk of having one Russian-linked source wield so much influence, sought to raise more money to diversify its investor base, people said. Several employees have moved between Pamplona and LetterOne.
In 2012, Alfa Group said it had invested about $1.5 billion in Pamplona’s funds. Those investments eventually were rolled into LetterOne. 
The investment firm has touted its Russian heritage as “a unique strength.” 
“L1’s shareholders are used to, and comfortable with, very major changes and dislocations in their external environment,” LetterOne said in its 2015 annual report. “It is part of life for Russian investors. It is not so for Western investors.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) - When  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's investors gather on Thursday, they will focus on a potential hit to company profits from persistent supply-chain and inflationary woes.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate last month warned that its profits would suffer in the first half of this year from supply and labor issues.
Roughly two years into the coronavirus pandemic that has snarled supply chains across the globe and driven up costs for everything from labor to raw materials, companies of all sizes are scrambling not just to produce enough to feed current demand -- but to also restock inventory shelves.
A run-up in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only worsened the situation.
While GE continues to back its earnings estimates for this year, mounting concerns about supply chains and inflation have led to a 13% fall in its shares since mid-January.
In January, GE said it would return to revenue growth this year. It also expects to grow its profit margin by 150 basis points and to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.
The company has said it is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is also trying to source alternative parts to help deal with shortages.
GE is expected to reiterate its full-year earnings outlook on Thursday. Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair, says Wall Street is now more focused on GE's ability to pursue profitable growth as debt reduction and cash flow have become less of a concern.
Similarly, the fallout of Western sanctions on Russia is also expected to be a topic of discussion.
Russia accounts for about 1% of GE's revenue. On Tuesday, the company said it has suspended its operations in the country and is working with authorities to ensure compliance with sanctions.
The shift in focus away from GE's balance sheet could be a relief for its investors after declining sales, crushing debt levels and operating challenges had put the company into a survival mode.
Since taking GE's reins in 2018, Chief Executive Larry Culp has primarily focused on reducing debt by selling assets and improving cash flows by streamlining operations and cutting overhead costs.
Those measures have led to an improvement in the company's balance sheet, allowing it to reduce debt by $87 billion. In a sign of growing confidence, the company's board has authorized a $3 billion share buyback program.
With its turnaround gathering steam, GE last November announced it would split into three public companies. 
It plans to spin off its healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company next year. It would combine its power and renewable energy units, and spin off that operation in 2024. Following the split, it will become an aviation company, headed by Culp.

Some analysts, however, say the timeline for the spin-offs could be brought forward. On Thursday, they expect GE to provide an update on the breakup timing.
""We believe the market under-appreciates that the timing of the three-way breakup could happen faster,"" said analysts at RBC Capital Markets in a note.

Investing.com –  Stitch Fix  stock (NASDAQ:SFIX) plummeted 11% Wednesday after the company lowered its prior full year revenue outlook, reflecting how tough it is for the platform to attract new clients to its online styling service.
Stitch also withdrew its full-year outlook for adjusted basic operating income.
The company that uses algorithms to help customers style their wardrobe faces increasing competition, including from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
For the ongoing financial year that ends July 30, the company now expects revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year.
“This full year outlook assumes that the number of active clients is flat through the end of the fiscal year. We are actively evaluating our marketing spend as we manage improvements to onboarding and conversion,” CEO Elizabeth Spaulding said in a statement.
Net revenue in the current quarter is seen between $484 million and $500 million. Margins could be negative, according to the company.
Stitch’s revenue per active client rose around 18% to $549 across about 4 million clients. The active client base grew 4% year-on-year.
Net revenue in the second quarter rose 3% to around $517 million. Margins expanded due to tight control on selling, general and administrative expenses, and lower spending on advertising.
Net loss widened to almost $31 million from $21 million in the same period a year ago."

""DAX is up as a mixture of bargain hunting and short covering,"" added Madden.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon is expected to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $8.5 billion buy of U.S. movie studio MGM, people familiar with the matter said, a move that is set to ramp up competition with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+. 
Announced in May last year, the deal would also strengthen Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s video streaming service, drawing people to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which offers fast shipping and encourages consumers to shop more regularly.
The MGM acquisition would give the world's largest online retailer rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history that's earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally, according to MGM.
MGM also licences content for video games, which could benefit Amazon's development efforts in that area.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by March 15, declined to comment.

Amazon said: ""Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and we’re working with regulators to respond to requests.""
The Federal Trade Commission is nearing a mid-March deadline to decide on the deal, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Investing.com -- Piedmont Lithium Ltd ADR (NASDAQ:PLL) has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for a proposed second lithium hydroxide plant.
The company plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity to 60,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide.  
They believe they will be able to achieve that target using spodumene concentrate secured under existing supply agreements with Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium, and other sources. Spodumene concentrate is used to produce lithium chemicals that go into electric vehicle batteries.
The company said the PEA assumes the lithium hydroxide plant is located at one of the several sites under consideration and also that there is a 30-year life of operations with the production of 30,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.
Projected capital costs for the plant are $572 million. Based on those capital cost assumptions, the PEA projected an estimated net present value of approximately $2.25 billion and an internal rate of return of 33%.
“2021 was a transformative year for electrification in the United States,” said Piedmont President and CEO Keith Phillips. 
“Current and forecasted battery manufacturing capacity now exceeds 500 gigawatt-hours (“GWh”) with public announcements of over $25 billion in capital investments to occur by 2025. The potential lithium volume these battery plants will require reinforces the importance of developing a domestic lithium supply chain,"" Phillips added.
The potential site development still remains subject to various factors, including a final site selection and financing. 
Piedmont shares rose 6% Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) Plc said on Wednesday its business in Russia continued to operate, but that it had suspended all planned capital investment in the country following the Ukraine invasion.
BAT (LON:BATS), which has 2,500 workers in Russia and major local manufacturing operations, also said it was ""scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation, including rationalising our marketing activities.""

The Ukraine crisis has put pressure on multinational companies to take action, with a growing list of consumer products manufacturers distancing themselves from Russia this week.

""I expect that it will be around a dozen aircraft in Switzerland,"" a spokesperson for the Federal Office of Civil Aviation said. This included EuroAirport near Basel, which straddles the Swiss-French border. 
There were two aircraft in Geneva, including an Aeroflot passenger jet, and none in Zurich, he said, adding that not all airports had responded to his survey.
Swiss broadcaster SRF said its investigation had found private aircraft believed to belong to Russian oligarchs were on the ground at EuroAirport.
It said one of the aircraft was believed to belong to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, and had flown to Basel from London at the end of February. Another was thought to belong to billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, it said.
Neither could be reached for immediate comment on the report. The airport declined comment.
Switzerland adopted European Union sanctions against Russia and closed its airspace to Russian aircraft and airlines on Feb. 28.
Abramovich and Vekselberg are not personally sanctioned in Switzerland but would still be affected by the airspace closure.

Russia's super-rich oligarchs have been the focus of Western pressure following the invasion of Ukraine, due to their links to the Kremlin.
Moscow says its actions are a ""special operation"" aimed at disarming Ukraine and removing leaders it casts as dangerous.

(Reuters) - Packaged food maker  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co posted below-expectation quarterly sales on Wednesday but forecast better profit margins for the second half of 2022 thanks to easing supply chain constraints and a fuller workforce.
Shares of Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell rose as much as 4% to $43.98 after it also maintained full-year profit targets largely above expectations.
The COVID-19 pandemic ripped through supply chains across the food industry, raising costs, delaying deliveries and reducing worker numbers in the United States.
However, Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse predicted margins would recover through the rest of the year on improved staffing including 3,500 new workers in the last seven months.
""We now see absenteeism and vacancy rates trending back to normal levels. This is translating to more production and the beginning of a return to normal distribution and inventory levels,"" he said.

Higher prices, and a sustaining of the home cooking boom, have helped rivals including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) deliver above-expectation topline results in recent months.
Campbell - known for Swanson broth, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies - said benefits from recent price changes will be reflected in the current quarter with improved profits coming despite higher inflation than previously expected.
The company maintained its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of between $2.75 and $2.85 per share, saying roughly 95% of costs for fiscal 2022 were ""fairly well covered."" That compares to analysts' estimate of $2.79, according to Refinitiv IBES.

In the quarter to Jan. 30, however, Campbell's gross margin fell to 30.3% from 34.4% the previous year due to higher supply expenses and the labor crunch, while organic sales were down 2%.
Net sales dropped a bigger-than-expected 3%, while per-share profit of 69 cents came in line with estimates.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -Prudential PLC notched up a 16% rise in 2021 operating profit after it strengthened its focus on Asia, though it warned of implications for global markets and the economy from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Uncertainties triggered by the crisis in Ukraine have prompted insurers to review their risk exposure. Prudential's investment exposure through its Eastspring asset management unit is minimal, chief financial officer Mark FitzPatrick told a media call.
However group chief executive Mike Wells warned, ""The current conflict in Ukraine could have wider implications for global economic and market conditions as well as geopolitical relations.""
Prudential now has no operations in Europe following the spin-off of British and European business M&G in 2019.
Its adjusted operating profit came in at $3.23 billion, up from $2.75 billion in 2020, beating the $3.19 billion consensus of analysts' forecasts provided by the company.
Prudential's shares surged 5%, outperforming the FTSE 100.
Prudential entered 2022 with an improved balance sheet, with a $2.4 billion equity raise in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, used to repay debts.
Mainland China became Prudential's largest market for sales for the first time last year, Wells told reporters.
The company is “exploring” a regional partnership in China’s Greater Bay Area in the wealth management space, Prudential Asia CEO Nic Nicandrou told Reuters separately.
New business in Hong Kong, Prudential's Asia headquarters, however, continued to face pressure from the extended mainland China border closure in 2021 and from COVID-19. 
Wells retires at the end of this month and Prudential's incoming chief executive will be based in Asia but may start outside Hong Kong, as the financial hub grapples with a surging COVID-19 pandemic.

The results are the life insurer's first after two strategic demergers that left Prudential focusing on Asian and African markets.
Following the M&G spin-off, it offloaded its U.S. business Jackson last September.

At the end of January, the company’s order backlog was higher by 60% at nearly $18 billion on strong demand for its recreational vehicles as people return to enjoying their lives after two years of the pandemic. Additionally, backlog fell while consolidated RV wholesale shipments rose more than 14%.
The company said it is looking to reduce its order backlog “without overproducing and overloading our independent dealer channel” even as it sees strong retail demand for its products. Thor showcased two new electric RVs at the 2022 Florida RV SuperShow and said the feedback “has been phenomenal”. Thor said it is focused on growth and higher profitability.
Gross margin in the second quarter rose 2.2 percentage points to 17.4% due to lower discounts and higher product prices that helped offset inflation in raw materials, the company said.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter jumped over 42% to $3.9 billion, partly due to the acquisitions the company made last year.
The addition of the Tiffin Group, acquired in December 2020, accounted for over $132 million of the increase in net sales while the inclusion of Airxcel, acquired in September 2021, contributed about $129 million.

In order to settle the dispute, Volkswagen struck an agreement for 4G patents with independent licensing marketplace Avanci, which licences patents for cellular technologies from multiple owners at a fixed fee per vehicle, also used by Mercedes-Benz and BMW and Volkswagen's brands Porsche and Audi.

The New York-based investment firm, which owns approximately 0.3% of the Davidson, North Carolina-headquartered maker of defense and intelligence programs, agreed to withdraw its four nominees to the board, Curtiss-Wright said in a statement.
Saddle Point's slate included national defense and financial industry experts.
Curtiss-Wright's chief executive officer, Lynn Bamford, said in the statement that the company is ""open minded"" about shareholders' ideas and will continue to look for directors who ""bring to bear the critical skills and values in light of our business, financial profile and our portfolio's increasing focus on defense.""
Saddle Point, which is run by former Pershing Square Capital Management partner Roy Katzovicz, has been engaging with Curtiss-Wright since 2020 and has urged the company to become a more pure play defense company.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp agreed on Wednesday that its union demand for annual salary and bonus hikes will be fully met in the new fiscal year, President Akio Toyoda said.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor and Honda Motor followed suit with the same response to its union's demands after Toyota's announcement, in a sign of broadening momentum towards wage hikes needed to stoke a virtuous cycle of wage growth and private demand.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable Japanese firms to raise pay by 3% or more to help achieve his ""new capitalism"" agenda aimed at boosting wealth distribution.
""I'd like to thank all those unionists who did the utmost for the future of the auto industry despite uncertainty on the outlook amid the coronavirus and a chip shortage,"" a Toyota labour union official quoted the president as telling a meeting between labour and management.
""We will pay salary and bonuses in line with their demands,"" he added, confirming the union's demand was fully met during the third round of the talks for 2022.
Neither Toyota nor Nissan unveiled the extent of pay hikes immediately. Honda offered a base pay rise for the first time in two years, Kyodo news agency reported.
The decisions at the three major Japanese automakers were made during the annual labour talks at blue-chip companies a week before they are concluded on March 16.
Toyota, the largest auto maker, has long served as a pace-setter for annual wage talks, which is followed by not just the auto sector but other industries, including smaller enterprises.

Last year, major Japanese companies offered the lowest pay hikes in eight years, pushing the pace of increase below 2% as the COVID-19 outbreak dealt a blow to profits at many firms.
Although analysts expect wages to rebound in the coming fiscal year, the pace of growth will be modest as resurgence of infections and Russia's aggression in Ukraine cloud the outlook.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator asked a judge for permission to distribute $40 million to investors it obtained in a 2018 civil settlement with Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc that resolved a fraud charge and required Musk to obtain advance approval for some tweets.
Musk's lawyers had accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month of having ""broken its promises"" by dragging its feet on the payout, while trying to muzzle their client's speech and harass him with an ""endless"" investigation into his conduct.
The SEC did not mention the dispute in a Tuesday night court filing describing what it called a ""fair and reasonable"" means to distribute the payout, which has grown to $41.2 million with interest, that deserves ""significant deference.""
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, declined to comment on Wednesday.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman, to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company private.
A related consent decree also required Musk to obtain pre-clearance from Tesla lawyers for tweets and other public statements that could be material to Tesla.
Musk believes the SEC has since ""weaponized"" the decree to stifle his speech as punishment for his criticism of the government.
On Tuesday, he formally requested to end the decree, adding that he felt pressured to accept it.
""I never lied to shareholders,"" Musk said in a court filing. ""I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders.""
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan enforces the decree and would need to approve the distribution plan.

Payouts would go to investors who lost money in Tesla stock in the 1-1/2 days after Musk's tweet.
The SEC filed the proposed plan 10 hours after Musk asked to scrap the consent decree.

Net sales in the quarter ended January 30 fell 3% to $2.2 billion on lower volumes, offset by higher prices. President and CEO Mark Clouse attributed this to a “difficult comparison” and other factors, including labor and supply constraints, made tougher by the Omicron surge.
Sales in the same quarter a year ago rose, owing to a jump in at-home food consumption during the pandemic.
Organic net sales, which exclude the impact from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, fell 2%, the company said.
“However, heading into the second half of the fiscal year, we are seeing labor availability and service levels improve, better mitigation of inflation with pricing, and strong levels of demand all underpinning our confidence in our delivery of full-year guidance,” he said in a statement.
The company is expecting the second half to be better as price hikes come into effect fully while supply and labor conditions improve.
Campbell expects its current year sales to be flat or to fall 2% in the worst-case scenario. Organic net sales could rise by 1% or fall as much, according to the company’s estimates. Adjusted profit per share for full-year 2022 is seen flat or falling by a maximum 4%.

The analyst upgraded shares of Netflix to Neutral from Underperform, maintaining a $342 price target.
Pachter pointed to the company's recent sell-off as a reason for the upgrade, telling investors in a note that it “reflects that Netflix investors have begun to appreciate that the company’s long-term prognosis is as a low growth, extremely profitable enterprise.”
He did, however, add that he doesn't expect a “significant share price appreciation in the near-term.” 
“Netflix’s first mover advantage and large subscriber base provides the company with a nearly insurmountable competitive advantage over its streaming peers. Netflix appears to have hit a ceiling on subscribers in UCAN, and is pulling new levers to lower churn,"" the analyst stated, reiterating previous comments from January.
Adding that ""subscription price increases should fuel additional content production and growth in other regions.”
While Wedbush believes content dumps will keep customer churn high, Pachter feels Netflix is aware of the situation after the company split the Stranger Things series into two half-seasons. 
He concluded that Netflix will ""deliver sustainable profit growth as long as it is able to continue raising subscription prices, but competition may create a price ceiling.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa's largest mobile operator by subscribers, MTN Group, resumed annual dividends on Wednesday, declaring a higher payout than previous guidance as a divestment plan made progress and the firm reported higher profit. 
Last year March MTN suspended dividends to focus on reducing debt and because of uncertainty around cash upstreaming from Nigeria, the timing of proceeds from its asset realisation programme and the impact of COVID.
It said at the time it would announce a revised medium-term dividend policy in March 2022 and anticipated paying a total ordinary dividend of at least 260 cents per share for fiscal 2021. 
""The board has looked at the cash balances, solvency and liquidity as well as the investment profile that we have in the year ahead and has declared a dividend of 300 cents per share, so 40 cents higher than our minimum,"" said Group Chief Executive Ralph Mupita.
It also announced a new dividend policy, to guide the market annually on a dividend amount, subject to its capital allocation priorities and market conditions, Mupita added.
With its new policy, MTN anticipates paying a minimum ordinary final dividend of 330 cents for financial year 2022.
By 0900 GMT, shares were up 5.40% at 196.71 rand.
MTN, with 273 million customers in 19 countries across Africa and the Middle East, also gave new higher medium-term guidance, with group service revenue now projected at mid-teens percentage growth in constant currency terms, upgraded from low-to-mid teens.
MTN Nigeria, its biggest revenue generator, is forecast to produce service revenue growth of at least 20% from previous mid-teens target. 
Its financial results for the year ended Dec. 31 showed group service revenue grew by 18.3% to 171.8 billion rand ($11 billion), ahead of its medium-term targets, thanks to continued demand for data, digital and financial services.
It increased headline earnings per share (HEPS), the main profit measure in its home market of South Africa, by 31.8% to 987 cents.

Holding company net debt fell to 30.1 billion rand from 43.3 billion rand due to cash received from its operating companies as well as proceeds from its divestment plan.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy has ruled that state broadcaster RAI should retain a stake of at least 30% in its towers unit Rai Way, a draft government decree seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday.
Reuters reported on Monday that Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi had signed off on a decree allowing RAI to cut its 65% holding in Rai Way below 51%, in a move expected to trigger sector consolidation.
The decree could pave the way for merger talks between Rai Way and rival EI Towers, a long-mooted tie-up that would create a group worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the television and radio mast sector.
RAI can cut its stake in Rai Way ""up to the limit of 30%"" while ""keeping control over such a strategic infrastructure"", the decree said, adding the towers firm should remain listed.
Shares in Rai Way were up 2.2% at 1233 GMT, after closing up 5.86% on Tuesday.
Intesa San Paolo analysts said in a report that the 30% threshold ""should not prevent a consolidation with EI Towers and its potential in terms of synergies"".
Banca Akros estimated EI Towers has approximately 600 million euros more net debt than Rai Way, adding this meant that in a merger of equals between the two tower groups, RAI would remain ""well in excess"" of the new 30% limit. 
The decree lists ways RAI can offload the holding, including ""one or more extraordinary merger deals"", a direct negotiation or a public offer, without setting a deadline for any of the options.
Rome is reversing a provision made in 2014, when Italy ruled that at least 51% of Rai Way should remain in public ownership due to the strategic importance of its infrastructure.
EI Towers launched a takeover bid for Rai Way in 2015, but this was thwarted by the centre-left coalition government of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
At that time, former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's family controlled EI Towers through broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) and Renzi did not want to see the media magnate take control of Rai Way's assets.

EI Towers is now 60% controlled by fund F2i and 40% owned by MediaForEurope, Mediaset's new name.

Production of the BMW Mini would remain suspended in Oxford for two weeks, the company said. 

Other plants in Germany and the rest of Europe were operating as normal, but the carmaker expected further interruptions due to both the Ukraine crisis and ongoing chip shortages, it said.
European carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Porsche and Audi are struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses as suppliers in western Ukraine have been shuttered by Russia's invasion, forcing them to curtail production.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Makers of everyday staples from Pampers diapers to Dove soap are walking a fine line by continuing to sell their products in Russia, as pressure grows on multinational companies to take a stand against Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said on Tuesday it was closing its restaurants in Russia, including its iconic Pushkin Square location in Moscow. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) also stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia. 
But the world's biggest makers of packaged food items and household basics have lagged some financial services firms, oil and gas companies and retailers that withdrew entirely from Russia. The consumer products companies argue that everyday people in Russia rely on their products. 
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc said this week they are continuing to sell essential products in Russia, but are ending any new capital investments and are no longer advertising in the country. Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of the country.
On Wednesday, Nestle, the world's largest food group, followed suit, suspending investment in the country after its earlier decision to stop advertising there.
Dairy company Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) is taking a similar approach.
""I give them credit for doing more today than they did yesterday,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' moves to withdraw from Russia. ""The more comprehensive the pullout, the more you’re advancing the prospects of world peace.""
Sonnenfeld added that it was a ""mistake"" to try to minimize the damage to Russian people by continuing to supply basics. 
""There's no middle ground,"" he said. 
Cadbury chocolate maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB), which produces Huggies diapers, have yet to announce plans to curtail production in Russia. 
“It’s not about pure profits,” said Katie Denis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group representing companies including P&G and Mondelez. “It’s about, are you going to continue producing things people need? It’s different than what companies who came out earlier are dealing with.”
WORTH THE RISK?
Companies also do not want to be seen as harming regular Russian citizens by putting them out of work.
At least six major fast-food companies – including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Burger King – run more than 2,500 restaurants in Russia, mostly through franchisees, and employ tens of thousands more people, according to a Reuters tally that does not include McDonald's. 
Yum on Tuesday said it was suspending operations of its 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in the country and finalising an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations, in partnership with its master franchisee.
But other companies have so far remained silent.
Investors such as the New York State pension fund want companies to consider whether continuing to do business in Russia is worth the risks.
Asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) is pressing companies in phone calls and letters to be ""open and transparent about what they do in Russia"" and share ""what decision-making process they've gone through to come up with a conclusion"" on working in the country, said Hannah Shoesmith, director of engagement at the firm. Federated Hermes is targeting consumer products companies in its outreach, Shoesmith said.
""We wouldn't ask companies to just leave Russia without asking them to assess the impact on human rights,"" Shoesmith said. ""There's a tradeoff companies have to make. It's not so black and white."" 
Companies also ""should start to think carefully"" about their position on taxes paid to the Russian government, Shoesmith said.
""There are attempts to come up with good solutions around paying tax,"" she said. ""If they pay tax in Russia, what are the solutions they can come up with to make up the balance on that?""
Shoesmith said that in prior military coups and refugee crises, companies made payments equivalent to their tax bills to nongovernmental organizations aimed at helping people. 
'CORPORATE SUICIDE' 
""There's a big move in our industry to focus on companies with strong corporate governance and ethical standards - and that means societal issues as well,"" said Jack Martin, investment manager at Oberon Investments, which holds shares in Unilever,  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, Burberry Group (OTC:BURBY) Plc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY). ""It's corporate suicide, really, at the moment, to not pull back from the region."" 
Joe Sinha, chief marketing officer for Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, said his firm has no direct exposure to Russian companies, but that it is reaching out to the U.S. portfolio companies it owns with more than 2% or so of revenue exposure to Russia to ask for details about their thinking on whether to stay or leave the country.

""We’re not being prescriptive, we’re trying to understand their roles and choices,” Sinha said. While Parnassus is supportive of steps like sanctions that cut off Russian banks and technology firms close to the military, he said, the analysis could be different for food companies that serve consumers. 
“For certain goods and services it would harm individual citizens who don’t have anything to do with the regime,” he said. “There are gray areas.”

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese airline operator ANA Holdings Inc will only raise airfares as a last resort to cover European route changes, its incoming chief executive said on Wednesday, adding that it would focus on belt-tightening first.
Koji Shibata, who takes the helm of the parent company of All Nippon Airways (ANA) from April 1, also told Reuters in an interview that the crisis in Ukraine was so far having a limited impact on earnings, as the airline had already scaled back international flights due to COVID-19.
His comments are the latest to illustrate corporate Japan's drive to avoid price increases, despite the spiking cost of fuel and commodities. Years of deflation have made Japanese consumers ultra-sensitive to price hikes and forced companies to avoid increasing prices - prolonging the economic malaise.
""We will do everything we can"" to avoid price hikes as a result of the change of European routes, Shibata said. 
""But we may be in a situation where we will have to slightly increase air fares to make up for the amount we cannot cover by cost-cutting."" 
ANA, like other airlines around the world, changed its routes over Europe following Russia's invasion. The political turmoil raised uncertainties and jacked up oil prices.
Shibata, though, said the energy price's surge has limited impact thanks to hedging for domestic and surcharges for international flights. 

Airlines are also reeling from the collapse of international travel triggered by the COVID pandemic. 
It would take about two years for the demand for international flights to return to the pre-pandemic level depending on how Japan's COVID-related entry restrictions, which is gradually relaxed, and the Ukraine crisis will unfold.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday on a change in the messaging from Russia and Ukraine that suggested they may be inching toward a negotiated settlement after two weeks of war. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry dropped what had appeared to be a key element of its war objectives as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow doesn't want to occupy Ukraine or overthrow its government. Later, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that the country was willing to discuss adopting neutral status in return for security guarantees, something that would make the issue of Ukraine joining NATO a moot point. 
By 9:33 AM ET (1433 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 580 points, or 1.8% at 33,213 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.5%.
The improvement in risk appetite was also immediately evident in oil prices, which fell over 5% to their lowest since last Friday. U.S. Crude futures were quoted at $117.50 a barrel, while Brent was at $121.50, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. will ban imports of Russian energy, forcing U.S. buyers to find alternatives on the open market.
Despite all this, the fighting in Ukraine continued unabated, punctuated again by mutual accusations of violating the ceasefires that had been agreed to allow civilians to escape from besieged cities. Unverified social media footage indicated widespread use of cluster bombs and 'butterfly mines' by Russian forces against the fleeing population. Nor was there any sign of movement on the key issue of territory, with Russia continuing to demand that Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine that it established eight years ago after its first invasion. Zhovkva said Ukraine ""won't cede one inch of territory.""
Elsewhere, Russia's government approved a draft bill that would allow it to nationalize the assets closed by Western companies that have ceased or suspended operations in the country due to the war. In the last 36 hours, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have joined that list, as have Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). 
Early moves essentially reversed the pattern of trading seen in recent sessions, with growth and financial stocks rising and oil and gas stocks falling. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.1% after it held a preview for a new generation of high-end desktops and a revamped iPhone SE, its cheapest smartphone offering. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 2.3%, shrugging off concerns about the explosive rise in prices for nickel, a key battery metal.
Oil majors by contrast gave up some of their windfall gains.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.8%, while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 1.8% and Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 0.7%. 
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 10% after the White House issued an executive order on digital currencies that appeared to allow a regular pathway into the financial mainstream for them.
Elsewhere, Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock rose 4.8% after the struggling department store chain refinanced high-yielding debt at a lower rate, a vote of confidence by creditors in its viability, while  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock rose 40% after the female-led dating site published quarterly numbers that eased fears about its future.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - Within hours of Moscow launching its invasion of Ukraine, BP’s chief executive summoned his senior team to discuss the limited options for its Russian operations, including separating the British energy giant’s stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft or exiting completely, according to three senior BP (NYSE:BP) executives.
Bernard Looney made it clear at the Feb. 24 meeting that he saw the investment as untenable, the executives said. The decision, which marked a reversal of BP's three decades-long relationship with Russia, was made easier by reservations Looney had about the Rosneft stake. Looney had become increasingly uncomfortable with BP PLC’s nearly 20% stake in the Kremlin’s state oil champion, according to the three BP executives and another person close to Looney, despite publicly defending the investment.
The chief executive has staked his future on a bet that BP can make the transition to clean energy much faster than its peers, moving away from the company’s 112-year history in oil. Rosneft’s strategy, by contrast, is to keep pumping oil for as long as there is demand for the fossil fuel.
""Rosneft was dissonant with our strategy,"" said one of the three BP executives, who was familiar with the Feb. 24 meeting. The speed at which Looney, a 51-year old Irishman, moved to exit Russia reflects what was a clear-cut decision for him, the three executives said.
Looney had privately expressed his concern about Rosneft’s place in BP’s strategy to other top executives, according to a second of the BP executives plus the person close to Looney. The Rosneft investment had become a liability for BP because of Russia’s growing political isolation since 2014 but Looney didn’t know who to sell it to, said two western oil executive familiar with BP’s leadership thinking.
Within three days of Looney’s summoning his team, BP announced it was abandoning its Rosneft stake at a cost of up to $25 billion, becoming the first major Western company to pull out. The rapid retreat represents a dramatic exit for BP, one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, wiping out half of BP's oil and gas reserves, a third of its production and almost $1 billion in annual dividend.
The move put pressure on other oil majors, with London-based Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) of the United States quickly following suit by quitting multi-billion dollar investments in Russia. Those decisions will be harder to execute because both companies operate large projects in Russia; BP is a passive shareholder in Rosneft, although it has a joint oilfields project with the Russian firm. 
The exit by Western firms adds to energy market uncertainties and disruptions. With gas and oil at or near record levels, analysts predict a further spike in inflation and a possible economic recession in the West in the coming months and a deep recession in Russia.
Other Western companies have since said they’re exiting business activities or putting them on hold as a result of the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special operation” to demilitarize Ukraine and capture what it says are dangerous nationalists.
""There was only one decision we could make,” the first senior BP executive said. “The exit was the only viable way.” 
Speaking at an energy conference in Houston Tuesday, Looney said the decision to leave Russia was the ""right thing.""
In response to Reuters questions for this article, BP referred to the company’s Feb. 27 statement. The situation in Ukraine “caused us to fundamentally rethink BP’s position with Rosneft,” Looney said in the statement.
The Russian company, whose full name is NK Rosneft' PAO, didn't respond to a request for comment. Rosneft has said it regretted BP's departure and that BP came under unprecedented political pressure from ""regulators and shareholders"" to quit the partnership, without elaborating.
On Feb. 28, the European Union imposed sanctions on Rosneft’s CEO, Igor Sechin. The EU described the former deputy Russian prime minister as one a close advisor and personal friend of President Vladimir Putin. France last week impounded a luxury yacht - the 88-metre (190-foot) Amore Vero, or True Love in Italian - which it linked to Sechin.
Rosneft has said Sechin was unaware that any company linked to him owned the yacht. Sechin, who couldn’t be reached for comment, has in the past accused the West of using energy as a political weapon.
The day after Looney’s management meeting, Britain’s business secretary expressed concern to the BP CEO over the energy company’s large interests in Russia. In response to Reuters questions about whether the British government pressed BP to exit the stake, a government spokesperson said: “While this is ultimately a commercial matter, we welcome the growing number of organisations and governments” joining international efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and financially.
BP has said it didn't come under political pressure.
STRAINED RELATIONSHIP
By contrast with Looney, his predecessor Bob Dudley stood by the stake when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and sought to act as a bridge between Moscow and the West. Dudley had spent several years of his career in Russia. He sought to prevent Western sanctions imposed at the time from impacting BP and used his personal relationship with President Putin and Sechin to broker diplomatic talks between Western and Russian leaders.
BP had entered Russian oil production soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It bought a stake in a small Russian producer in 1998 and through a series of deals came to own 19.75% of the Russian company in 2013. For Rosneft, the partnership with BP gave it access to international financial markets and constituted an important link for the Kremlin with the West.
In an early sign of his hesitation about the stake, Looney didn’t take a seat on Rosneft’s board until four months after becoming BP CEO in February 2020. Meanwhile, Dudley stayed on Rosneft’s board, where he remained until last month.
""Unlike with Bob (Dudley), there was nothing that connected Bernard to Russia,” said the second BP executive. “He never worked in Russia, he never drank with Sechin.""
Dudley didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Looney’s relationship with Sechin has been strained at times, according to the person close to Looney and the two western oil executives. According to one of those executives, when Looney announced plans to dramatically cut BP’s oil output by 2030 as part of its clean-energy transition, Sechin said in a private meeting with other Western oil executives that Looney was destroying everything Dudley had built.
Looney felt he and Dudley lacked sway over Sechin to influence Rosneft’s development to bring it more in line with BP’s, according to two of the three senior BP executives. BP urged Rosneft over the past two years to outline a strategy to reduce its own carbon emissions, which helped prompt the Kremlin-controlled company to publish targets to reduce emissions from its operations to net zero by 2050 at the end of last year.
The targets, however, fell far short of BP's climate ambitions. Rosneft targets focused on emissions from extracting oil and gas and did not include the much larger emissions from fuels sold to customers.
Still, Rosneft generated profits for BP. During a February 2021 call with investors, Looney highlighted that Rosneft had been a good financial investment, noting BP had received $4 billion in dividends since 2013.
Under its transition strategy, BP has said it would retain the most profitable oil and gas operations, designating them as resilient hydrocarbons, to fund the transition.
""It felt like we could hold on to the Rosneft stake under the 'resilient oil' pillar of our strategy for a while, but it wasn't deeply strategic,"" said the first BP executive.
‘A BIT RASH’
During a meeting on Friday Feb. 25, the day after Looney’s management meeting, BP’s board discussed the exit of the Rosneft stake at length, according to the three executives. The topics included the impact of the move on BP, its 190 employees in Russia and wider energy security as a result of the conflict. The three executives said the attendees included BP’s chairman, the Norwegian businessman Helge Lund, and the former head of Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence service, John Sawers.
BP said Lund declined to comment beyond his remarks in the company’s Feb. 27 announcement, in which the chairman said the board concluded that Russia’s military action meant BP’s involvement in state-owned Rosneft was no longer tenable and that the holding was “no longer aligned with BP’s business and strategy.” Sawers declined to comment, BP said.
A brief board meeting followed Sunday, where members voted to immediately exit the Rosneft stake, the executives told Reuters. Shortly after, Lund and Looney spoke to Rosneft boss Sechin to deliver the news about the exit, according to the three executives, who said the call was cordial.
The following day, Looney addressed BP employees. He told them the company couldn’t reasonably carry on in Russia and that the board had made an informed and rapid decision, according to a person on the call.
BP faces a large writedown. It will lose a large revenue stream: the company received a $640 million dividend last year from Rosneft. By contrast, Shell and Exxon both receive billions of dollars of oil and gas annually, rather than dividends, from their Russian projects, and both have long-term contracts to sell that output that they now need to figure out how to make good on.
""While there may be a significant financial cost to BP in exiting Rosneft, it is unquestionably the right thing to do,"" said Andrew Millington, the head of UK equities at fund manager Abrdn, which owns 0.2% of BP.
Not all shareholders agree. “It seems a bit rash on the part of BP to make such a momentous decision so quickly,” said one fund manager with a stake in BP. “Rosneft is an important part of the business.”
BP's shares have risen 4% since the start of the invasion, while Exxon and Shell stocks are trading 16% and 4% higher, respectively, boosted by the strong rally in oil and gas prices.

As of Tuesday, the company had no buyer for the Rosneft stake, the three senior BP executives said. BP has begun the internal process for selling the stake, they said, but for now that’s more of a formality given there are few potential buyers as more and more countries impose sanctions on Russia.
""Aside, perhaps, from Rosneft itself, there are no clear buyers for its stake at this time in our view,"" said Jason Kenney, an analyst at Santander (MC:SAN) Bank, wrote in a Feb. 28 analyst note.

Investing.com – Oatly Group AB ADR (NASDAQ:OTLY) traded 5.5% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company issued a strong forecast for the ongoing financial year, hoping to make more consumers shift to its plant-based milk. 
The company is guiding its 2022 revenue to be $900 million at the center of its guidance range, a new record following $643 million in 2021.  
The robust outlook comes in even as the company tackled higher logistics and raw material costs in 2021. Oatly is banking on new supply tie-ups, like the one it struck with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) about a year back.   
According to a Reuters report, performance of Oatly's oatmilk at the coffee chain had exceeded expectations. CEO Toni Petersson has said Oatly aims to provide 85-90% of Starbucks' oatmilk needs in 2022.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose over 46% to a record $186 million on broad-based growth across retail and foodservice channels.
The contribution of foodservice channel to the company’s revenue rose as Western markets relaxed restrictions. Some closures in Asia, particularly in China, offset that growth a little.
The company said it is positioning itself “for an increased rate of growth” as the situation in Europe and other macro headwinds subside.
Oatly is adding capacity and, in the long term, aims to generate a gross profit margin of over 40% with an adjusted basic operating margin of near 20%. It expects its new capacities to lower costs and deliver economies of scale.
Fourth quarter loss before income tax more than doubled to over $85 million, owing to higher finance costs and depreciation due to three new facilities."

LONDON (Reuters) - A global food crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine escalated on Wednesday as Indonesia tightened curbs on palm oil exports, adding to a growing list of key producing countries seeking to keep vital food supplies within their borders.
The conflict in Ukraine is threatening global grain production, the supply of edible oils and fertiliser exports, sending basic commodity prices rocketing and mirroring the crisis in energy markets.
Palm oil is the world's most widely used vegetable oil and is used in the manufacture of many products including biscuits, margarine, laundry detergents and chocolate. Palm oil prices have risen by more than 50% this year.
Indonesia's Trade Minister Muhammad Lufti said the export curbs aimed to ensure that cooking oil prices at home remain affordable to consumers.
The rise in prices comes at a time when affordability of food is a major challenge as economies seek to recover from the coronavirus crisis and is also helping to fuel a broader surge in inflation across the globe. 
Russia and Ukraine are also important suppliers of edible oils as well as contributing nearly 30% of global wheat exports.
Ukraine announced on Wednesday it had banned a wide range of agricultural exports including barley, sugar and meat until the end of the year.
The conflict has not only disrupted shipments from the Black Sea region but is also jeopardising prospects for harvests as fertilizer prices soar and supplies shrink in response to a sharp rise in the cost of natural gas - a key component in the manufacturing process for many products.
World food prices rose to a record high in February to post a year-on-year increase of 20.7%, according to the United Nations food agency, while many markets have continued to climb this month.
Malaysian palm oil futures rose to an all-time high following Indonesia's announcement while soybean oil prices jumped to a 14-year peak.
Soybean oil prices have climbed by almost 40% this year.
SCRAMBLING FOR SUPPLIES
Russia and Ukraine are both major producers of sunflower oil and the two countries account for almost 80% of global exports, leaving customers such as India scrambling to secure supplies of alternatives such as palm oil and soyoil.
Chicago wheat futures have climbed around 60% so far this year, threatening to raise the cost of key food staples such as bread.
The loss of two major exporters in Ukraine and Russia has been compounded by news that the condition of the wheat crop in the world's top producer, China, may be the ""worst in history"" according to the country's agriculture minister.
Poor growing conditions in drought-affected parts of the U.S. Plains look set to further tighten supplies.
Serbia announced on Wednesday it will ban exports of wheat, corn, flour and cooking oil as of Thursday to counter price increases while Hungary banned all grain exports last week.
Bulgaria has also announced it will increase its grain reserves and might restrict exports until it has carried out planned purchases.
Grain supplies in Romania, a major exporter, have also tightened as international buyers seek alternatives to Russia or Ukrainian supplies although there are currently no plans to restrict shipments.
Global grain production could also decline as the production of fertilizers, which help to boost crop yields, is curtailed following a rise in natural gas prices.
Yara, one of the world's largest fertiliser makers, said on Wednesday it was curtailing its ammonia and urea output in Italy and France.

The Norwegian company warned last week that the conflict was threatening global food supplies.
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" rather than an invasion, had been a major supplier of fertilisers but the country's trade and industry ministry recommended on Friday that producers temporarily halt exports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, rebounding after recent losses amid the first signs of compromise from the Russian and Ukrainian governments while investors digest volatile oil prices.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 430 points, or 1.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 63 points, or 1.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 245 points, or 1.9%.
The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Tuesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 185 points, or 0.6%, moving deeper into correction territory after giving up gains of almost 600 points. The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, also into correction territory, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%, after moving into a bear market on Monday.
There were tentative signs of a diplomatic shift in the conflict after Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia has no intention of occupying Ukraine or overthrowing its government.
These comments came a day after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had “cooled” on the idea of joining NATO, the prospect of which was a prime factor behind Russia’s invasion.
The war in Ukraine and the associated Western sanctions on Russia have sent commodity prices, and the crude market, in particular, soaring to multi-year records. 
This has prompted concerns that this will force the Federal Reserve, already concerned about surging inflation, to hike interest rates more aggressively than initially expected.
The Biden administration added to the volatility late Tuesday by announcing the United States would ban Russian oil imports. However, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday it could release more oil from stocks and will draw up an action plan to swiftly reduce oil usage.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, also weighed by the news that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 4, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday, against forecasts of a drop. 
If confirmed by the official Energy Information Administration numbers later Wednesday, this would suggest consumers are reacting to the surging prices at the pump by pulling back on travel.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3% lower at $119.99 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2.8% to $124.35. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
In corporate news,  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) will be in the spotlight after the dating app offered up an optimistic forecast for 2022, expecting revenue to rise by more than 23%, even following its decision to leave the Russian market.
Macy's (NYSE:M) will also be in focus after the retailer chose to repay some debt and refinance existing notes at cheaper interest rates. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its newest version of the iPhone SE with its latest mobile processor and 5G capability on Tuesday and people will likely still be talking about it this week.
The major economic release Wednesday will be the January JOLTS jobs openings number, at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), with last week’s official monthly jobs report showing a vibrant labor market.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Adidas warned of a hit to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam but a brighter China outlook helped send the German sportswear group's shares 10% higher on Wednesday.
The company operates about 500 stores in Russia, a quarter of its total, which it said on Monday it had closed along with online sales there. 
For 2022, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) forecast an 11-13% increase in currency-neutral sales, including the risk to its business in Russia and Ukraine, with Greater China set to see sales increase in the mid-single digits after a consumer boycott in 2021.
The closure of factories in Vietnam due to COVID-19 means a shortage of products will cut first-quarter sales by 600 million euros ($658 million) before a strong rebound from the second quarter, CEO Kasper Rorsted told journalists.
Adidas shares traded up 10.2% at 1030 GMT, helped by the relatively upbeat outlook for 2022, especially for China, with analysts noting the earnings forecast was ahead of consensus expectations.
""The tone appears more constructive here than Puma was a couple of weeks ago,"" said Jefferies analyst James Grzinic.
Puma said last month it expected sales to grow at least 10% in 2022 and cautioned that a consumer boycott in China and cost pressures would limit profit growth.
Adidas said the Ukraine crisis posed a risk to sales of up to 250 million euros, about half its revenue in the region in 2021, or about 1% of total group sales.
Adidas had already recorded sales of about 100 million euros in the region prior to closing its stores and could make a further 100 million if it resumes operations in Russia or if it shifts products to other markets, finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said.
Adidas has not seen a broader impact on consumer confidence from the Ukraine crisis and is sticking to its medium-term targets, Rorsted said, noting that the sporting goods industry is usually resilient during times of financial turmoil. 
Adidas fourth-quarter sales fell 24% in Greater China, where it said on Tuesday it has appointed Adrian Siu as its new head of the regional business. Siu joined Adidas in 2002 in Hong Kong but left in 2019 to head Chinese brand Cosmo Lady. 
Rorsted said he expected sales to start growing in China from the second quarter, noting the company had signed up local athletes and was making a drive to design more products especially for China to compete with local brands.

The company was targeted during a boycott of Western brands by Chinese consumers who criticised companies for saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses there. Beijing denies any abuses.

Investing.com – Adidas stock (DE:ADSGN) soared 10% in Frankfurt trading Wednesday after the shoe and sports apparel maker forecast strong sales in 2022.
The company is expecting its China business to bounce back and help offset the loss of business in Russia. Overall margins are seen higher too with price hikes expected to have a role, according to Bloomberg.
Sales will grow by 11%-13% on a currency-neutral basis as demand for sneakers remains robust, the company said while disclosing its 2021 results.
Adidas expects Greater China sales to increase in mid-single digits, compared to the 3% growth last year when consumer boycott and a push for products made by local manufacturers hurt its sales. Adidas said on Tuesday that it had replaced the head of its Chinese operations, promoting Adrian Siu who also has experience in managing a local brand in China, namely fashion label Cosmo Lady.
Adidas said the war in Ukraine is putting as much as 250 million euros ($273 million) of revenue, or half of its business from Russia and the CIS region, at risk. That reflects the suspension of retail and e-commerce operations in Russia and represents about 1 percentage point of growth in total sales, according to the wire agency.
The company said on Monday it had suspended operations in Russia - where it operates about 500 stores, one-quarter of its total.
North America and Latin America are seen as the biggest sales drivers, with growth even going up to 19%, according to the company's projections. Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific are seen growing around 16%.
Adidas reported a 3% fall in currency-neutral sales in the fourth quarter to 5.14 billion euros, pulled down by Greater China."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a U.S. court, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner Tim Leissner has admitted to taking $60 million in kickbacks, lying to the bank about his corrupt deals, and twice forging divorce documents to take on new wives. 
Despite his history of deceit, Leissner is the key witness prosecutors are asking jurors to believe in the trial of Roger Ng, a former colleague of Leissner's at Goldman who is charged with helping loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund during a scheme that lasted from 2009 to 2014.
Leissner in 2018 pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Ng, 49, pleaded not guilty to similar charges and is standing trial in Brooklyn federal court.
In more than a week of testimony, Leissner has described his high-flying lifestyle as the lucrative 1MDB deals made him a ""star,"" and the steps he took to avoid getting caught.
Leissner, 52, said he hoped coming clean would ""clear this chapter of my life."" 
""It's not the proudest time of my life, but at the time I wanted to make more money, even though I was well-paid,"" Leissner testified.
The charges stem from some $6.5 billion in bonds Goldman helped 1MDB sell in 2012 and 2013. Prosecutors say $4.5 billion of that was embezzled by officials, bankers and their associates, in one of the biggest scandals in Wall Street history. 
Goldman in 2020 agreed to pay a $3 billion fine and have its Malaysia subsidiary plead guilty in U.S. court. The bank said at the time it did not adequately ""scrutinize the representations of certain members of the deal team."" 
Leissner said he and Ng, Goldman's top banker for Malaysia, secretly liased with conspirators outside Goldman, and received kickbacks. 
Ng's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argues Leissner is falsely implicating Ng to lower his own sentence. Prosecutors say Leissner's assertions are backed by other evidence.
Leissner said he spent the kickbacks on a $15 million 170-foot yacht, apartments in London and New York, and an investment in Italian soccer team Inter Milan. 
In 2013 he met Kimora Lee Simmons, an American model and ex-wife of music producer Russell Simmons. They set a wedding date before Leissner finalized a divorce with another woman, so he forged divorce documents - the second time he had pulled such a stunt, he said.
Through it all, Leissner said he privately worried about getting caught. While preparing the final 1MDB bond deal months ahead of Malaysia's 2013 presidential election, Leissner said he was concerned the opposition could win and investigate the deal. 
The ruling party won, but Leissner said critical press coverage of 1MDB kept him on edge. In February 2016, FBI agents served him with a subpoena. Hoping for a green card to live in Los Angeles with his new family, he said he hired a lawyer to explore cooperating. 

But he was arrested in June 2018. He said he pleaded guilty to lighten his sentence, aware it would dash his hopes of a green card. He and Lee Simmons are estranged, her lawyers said. 
""I hope that I don't have to go to prison,"" Leissner testified.

SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Asian battery makers for electric vehicles are shielded from a big, immediate hit from surging nickel prices amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, thanks to long-term contracts and a diversified supply chain, companies and industry sources said.
Nickel prices doubled on Tuesday to more than $100,000 per tonne, a surge sources blamed on short covering by one of the world's top producers, forcing the London Metal Exchange (LME) to halt nickel trading.
Tsingshan Holding Group bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its short bets on the metal, sources said. Shares of companies exposed to the Chinese producer tumbled on Wednesday.. 
""We have long-term supply contracts with metal suppliers and producers, so we are not expecting any immediate impact on our nickel supplies,"" said an official at South Korea's SK Innovation, whose battery unit SK On supplies to Ford and Kia.
Another official at a South Korean major battery manufacturer, who declined to be identified because the company has not made a statement on the matter, said the firm sources nickel from various countries including Australia and Indonesia so there was ""very limited impact"" on its nickel procurement for now.
Both officials said the companies were closely monitoring the situation after LME's unusual move.
The recent surge in nickel have not had a serious impact on the EV supply chain because Indonesia and other places have the largest nickel mines and the size of Russia's nickel mines is not particularly big, Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said.
Russia accounts for 5% of global nickel production but supplies a fifth of the world's high-grade nickel, according to an estimate from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI).
Prices of the metal were rising even before Russia invaded Ukraine as inventory dwindled due to battery makers such as SK Innovation and compatriots LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, China's CATL and Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) increasing production to meet growing demand.
Nickel prices rose 25% last year, and before the invasion on Feb. 24 prices were already up about 20% this year. 
Graphic: Nickel Prices surge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdpzybajdvw/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(5).png 
Most battery makers have long-term contracts.
For instance, last year, LGES bought a 4.8% stake in China's Greatpower Nickel & Cobalt Materials and signed a six-year contract with the company to source 20,000 tonnes of nickel starting in 2023.
Some industry sources say rising costs in the long term could hurt automakers, which are already grappling with an acute shortage of semiconductor chips and are likely to pass the cost on to customers.
""I think it depends on how long this ultra high price will last,"" said a U.S.-based board member of a battery materials supplier who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak with media.

""If it sustains, then the nickel suppliers will have no choice but to ask their customers to accept a renegotiated price. They can always cite the force majeure clause in their contract. No one could predict a war like this.""

Investing.com – Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stock gained 3% in premarket Wednesday as the retailer pushes to repay debt and refinance the existing one at cheaper interest rates. 
In the latest exercise, the company has refinanced $850 million debt at its 100% subsidiary Macy’s Retail Holdings. The debt was split into equal tranches of $425 million each at coupon rates of 5.875% and 6.125% respectively. This is cheaper than the debt Macy’s took in 2020 and comes in at a time when interest rates are likely to harden.
The new debt, one note maturing in 2030 and the other in 2032, means Macy’s has no significant repayment coming up till 2027 when it repays $71 million carrying an interest rate of 6.79%. It has one note of $6 million due in 2025.  
Macy’s in August repaid $1.3 billion in secured notes with an 8.375% interest rate, one of the highest rates in its debt portfolio at the time, The Wall Street Journal quoted Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell as saying.
Macy’s was close to running out of cash even before the pandemic struck. The business has bounced back in recent quarters, allowing it to repay debt, issue bigger dividends, and do share repurchases.
It closed its fourth quarter ended January 29 with net debt of $1.58 billion, down over 50% from a year earlier, according to Macy’s.
The company last month said it will pay a 5% higher quarterly dividend of 15.75 cents per share. It also announced a new $2 billion share buyback that follows the $500 million repurchases completed in the fourth quarter.
Efforts at pushing sales through digital channels yielded results in the recent quarter. The retailer gained around 7.2 million new customers during the quarter with 58% of them coming through the digital channels.
Margins expanded due to higher pricing of products as well as tighter control on promotion expenses. Net sales rose 28% to $8.7 billion."

Investing.com -- First signs of movement in the diplomatic positions of Russia and Ukraine lent some much-needed support to global markets on Wednesday, even as the military campaign continued with undimmed ferocity.
Russia's Foreign Ministry was reported by newswires on Wednesday as saying that Russia's aims do not include overthrowing the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. That's a clear change in tone from the last two weeks, in which President Vladimir Putin and others have talked up the 'denazification of Ukraine' as one of the aims of what it still insists on calling a 'special military operation'. 
Russia ""has no goal to occupy Ukraine, destroy its statehood nor to topple its leadership,"" Interfax quoted Maria Zakharova as saying. 
The comments boosted European stock markets that had already started to show signs of dip-buying earlier in the day. By 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the euro was up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.0985. The STOXX 600 rose 3.3%, while the German DAX, Italian FTSE MIB and French CAC 40 all rose over 4.5%.
The Ministry's comments clarify more ambiguous ones from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to Reuters earlier this week, in which Peskov held out the prospect of stopping military action if its demands were met. 
There have also been tentative signs of compromise from Zelensky, who told ABC News in an interview aired on Monday that he has ""cooled"" on the idea of taking Ukraine into NATO, a move that Russia fears would lead to tactical nuclear missiles aimed at Moscow being based on Ukrainian soil.
""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that ... NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,"" Zelensky said. 
Zelensky also signaled a willingness to discuss the future of the two breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as independent, eight years after establishing them with its first invasion of Ukraine.
""We can discuss and find the compromise on how these territories will live on,"" Zelensky said, hinting that he may be willing to give up those territories, with their majority-Russian-speaking populations, in order to create a more unified country in the long term. 
""What is important to me is how the people in those territories are going to live who want to be part of Ukraine, who in Ukraine will say that they want to have them in,"" Zelensky said.
The third important shift in diplomatic circles has been in China, one of few countries seen as capable of acting as a mediator between the two warring sides. While China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China's relationship with Russia is still ""rock solid"", Beijing has appeared increasingly concerned about the impact of the war on the global economy, and consequently to its own economic well-being. 
""China's exposure to the Ukraine war really comes in three forms,"" Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management, said in a morning briefing. ""Directly, through the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy; indirectly through the impact on U.S., European and U.K. demand for goods; and tangentially through quirky effects, like Chinese entities' losses from holding short positions in the nickel market."" The impact on demand for Chinese exports is likely to be the strongest concern over time, Donovan added.

Investing.com –  Bumble  Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock surged 19% in premarket trade after the company said 2022 revenue could rise by more than 23%, an optimistic forecast, given the company’s exposure to Russia and its decision to leave the Russian market.
Bumble has a large portion of its engineering talent in Russia and its Badoo app gets 12% of its monthly users from the country, according to Bloomberg. The company employs 120 people in Moscow, the wire agency said.
The company behind the namesake dating app said revenue in the current year could come in between $934 million and $944 million compared to almost $767 million it clocked in 2021.
This is even as the company removes all its apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Russia and Belarus.
The full-year forecast includes a loss of about $22 million in revenue from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, which will mostly impact Bumble’s Badoo app. Combined sales from the three countries made up about 2.8% of Bumble’s annual revenue.
Adjusted margins at the basic operating level could erode slightly to come in between 26.5% and 27% compared to 27.1% in 2021, according to the company.
The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the use of dating apps as people confined to their homes used virtual platforms to meet new people and develop new relationships, personal and professional. Now even as economies reopen, the pandemic-led surge in users is still holding up and users are only paying more.
Total paying users grew 11% to 2.98 million even as users of Badoo declined. Total average revenue per user rose by $2.81 to near $23.
In the fourth quarter, revenue jumped about 26% to top $208 million while net loss nearly halved to go below $15 million.",,,,,

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, recovering some of the sharp losses since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war ahead of this week’s European Central Bank meeting.
By 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 3.5%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 traded 1.7% higher.
European stock markets have been hit hard by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the associated Western sanctions pushing commodity prices to record levels, with oil prices, in particular, soaring amid concerns about supply disruptions.
The announcement late Tuesday that the U.S. will ban Russian oil imports added to the volatility, while the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, responded Wednesday, stating that the agency is ready to bring more oil to the markets by releasing additional stocks, and it would come up with an action plan to ""reduce oil in a hurry.""
Investors have decided to take advantage of these sharp losses - the DAX is down more than 8% over the last week - to buy some heavily discounted stocks ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting, with the specter of stagflation raising expectations that policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.
In corporate news, Adidas (LON:0OLD) stock soared over 8% after the German sportswear company forecast an increase in sales of 11-13% for 2022, with a recovery in its China business more than making up for the 250 million euros ($273 million) hit that it expects to take from halting its business in Russia.
Oil prices pushed higher, extending the recent rally which has seen crude surging more than 30% since Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine. Countries have scrambled for oil from different sources amid escalating sanctions on Moscow and fears of further disruptions to oil supply.
Gains have been partially held back by the news that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 4, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday, against forecasts of a drop. This suggests consumers are reacting to the surging prices at the pump by pulling back on travel.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $124.99 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $129.84. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.

As part of the initial public offering (IPO), Eni has committed to underwrite 17.5 million pounds of the capital increase, with an option to go up to 25 million pounds, the company added in a statement.
LiveStream and Eni are financial backers of NEOA which will be the UK's largest special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) focused on the energy transition.
The vehicle will look for a business target to acquire in Europe or the UK in areas that include hydrogen, green ammonia, carbon capture and energy storage.
""Our partnership with NEOA highlights our commitment to accelerating the path of decarbonisation of fossil fuels and hard to abate industrial processes in the short term"", Eni's Chief Financial Officer Francesco Gattei said.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering to merge with a privately held company, which then becomes publicly traded as a result.

(Reuters) -Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd returned to profit in the second half of last year but has since been hamstrung by tough new quarantine rules for crew and said it is trying to boost cargo capacity as much as possible in an effort to cope.
Hong Kong's flagship airline managed a profit of about HK$2 billion in the second half, thanks to cost cuts and strong cargo demand and pricing, even though it flew 85% fewer passengers than in 2020, when it was also affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
That helped it book a slightly smaller-than-expected annual loss of HK$5.5 billion ($700 million) - also a big improvement from a loss of HK$21.65 billion the prior year. 
Cathay shares closed 4.7% higher, outperforming a 0.7% decline in the broader market. 
Chairman Patrick Healy said, however, that the airline has had an ""extremely challenging"" start to 2022 after Hong Kong tightened crew quarantine requirements and banned passenger flights from major markets like the United States, Britain and Australia to contain COVID-19 cases.
""Exactly when current restrictions might change, we have no way of knowing,"" he told reporters.
The airline has forecast it will burn through HK$1 billion to HK$1.5 billion of cash a month starting in February due to the new rules.
Since January, the airline has been operating just 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity and less than a third of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity due to those constraints.
But the airline, which relied on cargo for 79% of its revenue last year, could benefit from rising freight prices as a result of disruptions to the Europe-Asia market as European and Japanese carriers avoid Russian airspace.
Air freight rates between China and northern Europe have jumped 34% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the Freightos Air Index.
Cathay, like rivals in mainland China and South Korea, is continuing to use Russian airspace on flights to Europe, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, keeping flight times shorter at a time of high fuel prices.
However, crew quarantine rules make it difficult for Cathay to add freight flights to take advantage of rising demand.
Cathay is reliant on pilots volunteering to fly tough rosters that involve at least three weeks of confinement to hotel rooms when flying and then upon return to Hong Kong an additional week of quarantine for cargo pilots and an additional two weeks for passenger pilots.
""We are not too concerned about the demand side,"" Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said. ""The biggest hurdle for the outlook for the rest of 2022 is on the supply side – mainly on crew quarantine arrangements. If there is any relaxation in the coming months we would have a more positive outlook for the rest of the year.""
Cathay said it had HK$30.3 billion of liquidity as of Dec. 31, including a HK$7.8 billion undrawn loan from the Hong Kong government. 
""Depending on the situation we may draw down or we may not,"" Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Sharpe said of the loan.

Rival Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd which also lacks a domestic market but has less-strict travel rules, reported a profit in the December quarter and has forecast it will reach around 51% of pre-pandemic passenger capacity this month.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain said on Tuesday it would force Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and other online platforms to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts after calls from regulators and consumer groups for a stronger crackdown on scams.
The government said its draft law on preventing online harms would include the requirement for large platforms to improve protection from criminals impersonating celebrities or companies to steal personal data, peddle unsafe financial investments or break into bank accounts.
Communications regulator Ofcom will check if platforms have put in place systems to prevent and remove fake adverts. The watchdog could block services or issue a fine of up to 18 million pounds ($24 million) or 10% of annual turnover, the government said.
""These changes to the upcoming Online Safety bill will help stop fraudsters conning people out of their hard-earned cash using fake online adverts,"" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a statement.
Online scams from advertisements on Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media mushroomed as more people went online during lockdowns to fight COVID-19.
A British record of 754 million pounds was stolen in the first six months of 2021 in banking scams, up by almost a third from the same period in 2020, according to data from UK Finance, a banking industry body.
In response to pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), some online services are limiting adverts for financial products to companies regulated by the FCA, which has called for stronger powers.
""This could make a huge difference to stemming the tide of fake and fraudulent ads on social media and search engines which cause devastating financial and emotional harm to innocent victims,"" said Anabel Hoult, chief executive of consumer campaign group Which?
The government said it was also launching a public consultation on tightening rules for the online advertising industry, either by strengthening the current self-regulation approach, or by creating a new watchdog.
Harmful or misleading adverts, such as those promoting negative body images, and adverts for illegal activities such as weapons sales could face tougher rules and sanctions, it said.

Influencers failing to declare they are being paid to promote products on social media could also be subject to stronger penalties, the government said.

When McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) opened in central Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, it became a symbol of thriving American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. 
Now, news that McDonald's, together with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), have stopped sales in Russia, is a further sign of a new dividing line being drawn between East and West following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russia, meanwhile, warned on Wednesday it was working on a broad response to sanctions that would be swift and felt in the West's most sensitive areas. 
For some, the move by companies such as McDonald's is overdue - after all a slew of major corporations had already cut ties with Russia as the West ramped up sanctions. Others argue such action can harm public opinion among Russians, suffering from the economic pain unleashed by the conflict.
After days of selling, some respite appears on the cards for world stock markets. European and U.S. stock futures are trading in positive territory and MSCI's world stock index is steady near one-year lows.
Perhaps, the bad news is priced in for now?
Oil prices remain one to watch, having risen again following a new U.S. ban on Russian oil. Britain also announced it will phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by end-2022.
Brent crude is above $131 a barrel, taking its gains since the Feb 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine to almost 35%. 
That surge is already being felt by consumers via rocketing fuel prices at the pump. 
Prices for aluminium a key Russian export, jumped 5% on Wednesday, a day after the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading following a doubling of prices that was blamed on short-covering by a top producer.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit said a full write-off of its Russian business, including cross-border exposure, would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), leaving its capital distribution plans hanging by a thread.
UniCredit, which is one of Europe's banks most exposed to Russia, said it would still be able to pay proposed cash dividends for 2021 even in an extreme scenario where it zeroed its exposure.
That would shave two percentage points off a key capital ratio, which stood at 15.03% at the end of last year - lowering it to just above 13%.
Provided this key measure of financial strength stays above 13%, UniCredit said it remained committed to buying back its own shares for up to 2.58 billion euros under the strategy new CEO Andrea Orcel announced in December.
""Whilst we do not consider this extreme scenario as our base case, we are taking a prudent and sustainable approach to our distributions,"" UniCredit said.
UniCredit said it would provide quarterly updates on the up to 200 basis point impact, and if the ultimate capital hit was smaller than its worst-case scenario it would use up to an equivalent amount for the share buyback.
""The buyback (or at least part of it) could now be delayed pending clarity on eventual Russian-related losses,"" Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford said.
Orcel's payout pledge had lifted UniCredit shares to a near four-year high of 15.85 euros a share last month, before tensions over Ukraine mounted.
The stock closed up 6% at 9.017 euros on Tuesday, having lost more than 40% from last month's highs.
Analysts had warned Russian exposure cast a shadow over Orcel's payout plans, which in turn are a key element in the former UBS banker's M&A strategy.
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Orcel had been poised to launch a takeover offer for smaller rival Banco BPM in an all-share deal that aimed to capitalise on the stock price recovery, sources have told Reuters.
UniCredit said its Russian client cross-border exposure stood at 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees of around 1 billion euros by non-Russian state export agencies. 
Around 30% of the exposure is to oil and gas companies with sanction-hit counterparties accounting for less than 5% of the total.
UniCredit Bank Russia, its local arm and Russia's 14th largest lender, had risk-weighted assets of 9.4 billion euros at the end of 2021.

""Net of foreign exchange hedges, our direct exposure to UniCredit Bank Russia is reduced to around 1.9 billion euros,"" it said.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are having conversations with potential buyers on how to get rid of their exposure to Russian corporate loans, but sanctions fears and pricing uncertainty are limiting trading activity and the ability of buyers to act, several banking sources said.
Punishing Western sanctions on Moscow in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine have prompted some distressed debt buyers to approach banks holding Russian loans to sound out their appetite to potentially sell that exposure at a discount, two bankers said.
Another banker said he had an opportunity to buy some Russian companies' loans but dismissed the offer because of fears that more sanctions could further limit the ability to recover value.
The discussions, though tentative, highlight foreign banks' uncertainty on how to manage their exposure to Russia, which according to Bank for International Settlements data is to the tune of $120 billion. 
Banks tend to hold loans in their portfolios, only selling down their exposure quietly through bilateral transactions as they do not want to be seen as dumping the paper in the market. 
One of the sources said he was approached by distressed debt desks at two U.S. banks last week to discuss any potential interest in selling loans, but he said he was sceptical talks would lead anywhere.
""I think they might say they’re interested, it’s exciting for distressed markets, but I think we’re some way off from seeing any real liquidity,"" the banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.
Global banks have experience with sanctions but the curbs on Russia are unmatched in their scale, speed and complexity and may yet grow, prompting banks to adopt extreme caution in all of their dealings involving Russian entities and assets.
A loan banker at a U.S. lender said that while there had been some talks on transacting Russian bank debt in the secondary market, activity was limited also because of lack of clarity on how any deal would be settled.
""Every distressed desk in this situation, they can see something that they can buy at 20, 30 cents on the dollar ... they will talk to banks but not necessarily agreeing anything,"" he added.
In addition to sanctions risk, activity is further constrained because it is difficult to put a price on Russian assets, as some hope drops are temporary and prefer to hold tight rather than sell at huge discounts, some sources said.
The discussions are not limited to bank loans: funds specialising in distressed debt have also been looking at buying Russian bonds, said a lawyer in London who said his firm was contacted by funds looking at such trades.
""I don't know a single distressed fund that is doing nothing right now, sitting around,"" said the lawyer.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) this week said all Russian bonds will be excluded from its emerging markets indexes at the end of the month, a move that will add more constraints to trading Russian paper. 

""Liquidity isn't great obviously, but there is a bid and there is an offer in the market today,"" said Marcelo Assalin, head of Emerging Market Debt at William Blair Investment Management, adding Russian bonds were being sold at around 15 cents on the dollar.
""Index exclusion will cause more forced selling... Sooner or later the bond prices will be close to zero and most fund managers won't be able to hold them,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Plummeting stocks, soaring commodity prices and tightening global financial conditions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are clouding the outlook for markets already unsettled by the prospect of a hawkish Federal Reserve.
Dramatic moves are everywhere you look, from a bear market in the Nasdaq Composite Index and wild rallies in oil and other raw materials to surges in popular haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar.
Hanging over it all is the Fed, which is widely expected to raise rates at its monetary policy meeting next week for the first time in more than three years. Some investors now worry that the U.S. central bank will have to keep raising rates to contain rising inflation despite an expected hit to growth from geopolitical instability, risking a recession. 
“Traders are not used to this kind of volatility in markets,” said Michael O’Rourke of Jones Trading. ""Everyone is trying to figure out what is the next threat and where the next distortion is.” 
RAW MATERIALS RALLY
Sanctions against commodity-export giant Russia by the United States and its allies have stoked a rally in the price of oil, metals, wheat and other commodities, a move investors fear will exacerbate already high inflation while weighing on global growth - a condition known as stagflation.
Brent crude is up more than 25% since the beginning of March while nickel prices more than doubled on Tuesday, forcing the London Metal Exchange to halt trading in the metal. 
""For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the (Ukraine) war. A recession can no longer be ruled out,"" strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research wrote in a recent note to clients.
BEARS EMERGING
The Nasdaq slipped 3.6% on Monday, taking it more than 20% below its recent peak, confirming that the index is in a bear market, according to a common definition. Germany’s DAX is in bear territory as well, while the benchmark S&P 500, down nearly 12% this year, recently confirmed a correction.
CREAKY PLUMBING
Financial indicators are showing increasing signs of stress throughout markets. One of these is the so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate. It was recently at its highest level since May 2020.
A higher spread reflects rising interbank lending risk or banks hoarding U.S. dollars, meaning that it is widely viewed as a proxy for banking sector risk.
The rush for dollars has been a major contributor to the greenback's advance against the euro over the last two weeks, according to Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight in New York.
More broadly, global financial conditions – the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding in the economy – are at their tightest in around two years. 
GYRATIONS
Volatility in stocks, currencies and rates is at multi-year highs, as investors calibrate their portfolios for higher commodity prices and a potentially prolonged conflict in eastern Europe.
The Cboe, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was recently at 33 and has shot up by about 16 points this year.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) rises and falls in Treasury yields – fueled by bets on how aggressive the Fed will be in raising rates in 2022 as well as a flight to safety in U.S. government bonds, have taken the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BoFAML MOVE Index to its highest level since March 2020.
Meanwhile, gyrations in currencies and a rally in the U.S. dollar has lifted the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Currency Volatility Index to a near-two-year high.

FLIGHT TO SAFETY
Not surprisingly, investors have been sheltering in gold, the dollar, the Swiss franc and other so-called safe havens, driving up their prices to multi-month highs. Prices for the yellow metal are up more than 10% this year.

658,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 12:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The price of oil has surged to its highest point since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding to airline costs at a time when carriers have been struggling to recover from a pandemic-related collapse in demand.
Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but the conflict in Ukraine has sent prices into overdrive; the northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market has soared by 85% since Feb. 25 to $1,649 a tonne on Wednesday.
Malaysia's AirAsia on Saturday introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help to offset some of the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline has hedged its entire first-quarter consumption and about half of its expected second-quarter consumption, it said on Wednesday. It has also hedged lower amounts through the end of 2023.
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows.
In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange, to $775 in the third quarter with 56% of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged and $795 in the final quarter with a little less than half of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said on Tuesday, adding it had also hedged 50% of its fuel for the following quarter.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. It said on Monday that it had no updates from guidance in November.
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with China releasing factory-gate data and the U.S. as well as the U.K. banning on Russian oil.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.15% by 9:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.07%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 0.9% year-on-year in February 2022. The producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.23%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.23%, with the GDP growing 1.1% quarter-on-quarter and 4.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.94% after the Westpac consumer sentiment contracted 4.2% in March.
South Korean markets were closed, with voting for the country’s next president currently underway.
The U.S. will ban imports of Russian fossil fuels, while the U.K. will prohibit Russian oil but not natural gas and coal. The moves are the latest response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and contributed to an already-volatile commodities market.
Supply disruptions and inflationary shocks as the sanctions on resources-rich Russia could also impact economic recovery. This could add to U.S. Federal Reserve’s inflation challenge ahead of its policy decision, to be handed down in the following week.
Investors are widely expecting the Fed to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its decision, but some expect the central bank to take a slightly less hawkish stance over 2022.
“The Fed doesn’t seem to be getting a break in terms of the inflation problem that they are trying to solve by raising these rates, so it doesn’t look likely that we’ll see a less aggressive Fed over the next year or so,” Advisors Capital Management portfolio manager JoAnne Feeney told Bloomberg.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said an interest rate hike later in 2022 is “plausible” as Russia’s invasion creates a new supply shock. The European Central Bank will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
“The duration of this incursion is really going to weigh on the economics of both Europe and the U.S.,” Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told Bloomberg. The firm is cautious but has been in the market trying to be “opportunistic,” she added.
On the data front, the U.S. will release its own CPI on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO),  McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE:MCD), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are the latest companies to suspend operations in Russia in protest at the invasion of Ukraine. Fitch Ratings also slashed Russia’s credit rating and warned that a bond default is “imminent.”
Russia intensified its bombardment of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, according to the U.S. The Russian stock market extended a trading halt, attempting to slow tumbling prices as the Western sanctions start to take their toll. Although currency trading could reopen, the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading on Tuesday until at least Mar. 11 due to highly volatile prices."

IAC Chairman Diller, his stepson von Furstenberg, and music mogul Geffen have an unrealized profit of about $60 million on the options trade, based on the recent Activision share price of around $80, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Justice Department is investigating whether any of the options trades violated insider-trading laws, the report said, adding that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is separately conducting a civil insider-trading investigation.
Diller told Reuters that none of them had any knowledge about a potential acquisition of Activision by Microsoft and that they acted simply on the belief that Activision was undervalued and therefore had the potential for going private or being acquired.
""If we had any such information we would never have traded on it – it strains credulity to believe we would have done so three days before Microsoft and Activision made their announcement,"" he added in a statement.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the SEC did not respond to Reuters' request for comment, while von Furstenberg and Geffen could not be immediately reached.
In January, Microsoft announced plans to buy Activision the ""Call of Duty"" maker for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Yum Brands Inc, parent company of fried chicken chain KFC, said it was pausing investment in Russia, a key market that helped the brand achieve record development last year.
Yum also said it was suspending operations of its 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in the country and finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations in Russia, in partnership with its master franchisee.
Yum, which has at least 1,000 KFC and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia that are nearly all independent franchisees, said in a post on its website dated Monday that it had ""suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia while we continue to assess additional options.""
The restaurants are owned and operated independently through franchise agreements, meaning Yum does not have as much control as if it ran them itself but also has less exposure to financial and operational risks.
Last year was a record year of development for KFC, led by new restaurants opening in China, India and Russia, executives said during an earnings call on Feb. 9.
Overall, KFC international opened more than 2,400 gross units in 2021. In Russia, the company was opening about 100 new restaurants annually and had expected to continue ""a similar expansion strategy going forward.""
Many companies have begun to pull their business out of Russia amid sanctions and outrage over the invasion of Ukraine. Calls for more companies to follow suit are growing.

McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said on Tuesday it would temporarily close all 847 of its restaurants in Russia including its iconic Pushkin Square location, increasing pressure on other global brands to pause operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Major global brands, including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors such as the New York state's pension fund.

At the event, titled ""Peek Performance"", Apple also introduced its fastest chipset, a brand new high-performance computer and brought nearly all of its devices on the 5G bandwagon. 
iPHONE SE - FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPER
It is the first update to iPhone SE since 2020 and it will now come with 5G and a faster A15 Bionic chip. 
The $429 phone gives Apple a better chance to compete with industry leaders Samsung (KS:005930), Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and others in the mid-range smartphone market and bring more users looking for faster connectivity on the Apple ecosystem. 
In comparison, iPhone 13 with 5G, which was launched last year, starts at $799. The previous iPhone SE had a $399 price tag. 
The new iPhone SE will start shipping from March 18.
IPAD REFRESH
The iPad Air gets its first refresh in two years with a new design, 5G connectivity and a faster M1 chipset found in MacBooks.
The advanced chip would make the device two times faster than the best-selling laptop in its range, Apple claimed. The iPad is priced at $599 and will be available from March 18.
""MONSTER"" CHIP
Apple launched a new in-house chip, M1 Ultra, made by fusing two M1 Max chips, previously Apple's most powerful chip for MacBooks. The chip is twice as fast and will be loaded in the newly launched Mac Studio.
BRAND NEW MAC STUDIO
Apple launched ""Mac Studio,"" a powerful high performance computer for musicians, video editors and filmmakers.
Mac Studio uses the M1 Max chip, which is 3.4 times faster than iMac, while the one with M1 Ultra is 80% faster than Apple's top Mac Pro.

With the 27-inch, 5-K retina display ""Studio Display,"" the MacStudio looks similar to the MacMini, and can be tucked under the display.
Mac Studio, a first of its kind, is priced at $1,999 for the version with the M1 chip and costs as high as $3,999 for the M1 Ultra loaded computer. Studio Display is priced at $1,599.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -McDonald's Corp said on Tuesday it would temporarily close all 847 of its restaurants in Russia including its iconic Pushkin Square location, increasing pressure on other global brands to pause operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
The closure of the McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurants will also carry symbolic importance in Russia, where the first location to open, in central Moscow in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. 
McDonald's said it would continue to pay salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other brands if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change.
""If they decide to do something, then probably others will follow,"" said international franchise consultant William Edwards of companies' conversations about whether to follow McDonald's by closing locations in Russia on moral grounds.
Major global brands, including McDonald's and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors including the New York state's pension fund. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
McDonald's opened in Pushkin Square 32 years ago as the Soviet Union was collapsing. That new restaurant represented the thawing Cold War tensions at a time when some young Russians were desperate to get their hands on blue jeans and other Americana. 
""It's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia,"" McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said in a note emailed companywide on Tuesday and posted on the company's website. ""We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation."" 
Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts political science professor, said the McDonald's closures show how the quick and broad imposition of Western sanctions on Russia will have a lasting economic impact.
He also said the decision puts to rest the theory that business ties will inevitably lead to closer U.S.-Russian relations. ""It's the spiritual end to any hope that commercial ties by themselves would sustain political integration."" 
Added Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' stances on Russia: ""I'm so glad that they realized it's a complicated situation, and I'm glad they came around and made the right decision ... It's a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive.""
Of its nearly 850 Russian McDonald's locations, 84% are owned by the company. The remainder are mostly operated by Moscow-based franchisee Rosinter Restaurants Holding.
COMPLEXITIES 
Because McDonald's owns many locations in Russia, it has more direct access to shutting operations. That may not be as easy for other fast-food chains in Russia - including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Pizza Hut, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Burger King, Subway, Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) Inc,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc. The companies' Russian locations are almost entirely run by independent operators and subject to complex international franchise agreements.
For example, Burger King's owner, Restaurant Brands, on Tuesday told Reuters that because Burger King ""is a stand-alone business owned and operated by franchisees in Russia,"" the company has ""long-standing legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future.""

Some fast-food franchisees with locations in Russia are not even based in Russia, such as Netherlands-based DP Eurasia, which runs Domino's restaurants in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
""These are often long, complicated, heavily negotiated agreements. Every one of them can be different from everyone else,"" said Larry Weinberg, who chairs the franchise practice at the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -McDonald's, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia on Tuesday, offering a united rebuke of the war on Ukraine by companies that define America for much of the world.
Pepsi and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) were corporate pioneers whose work with the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet Russian state decades ago were seen as improving international relations. 
All four companies have major operations in Russia.
McDonald's said it would go on paying salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia as it closed 847 restaurants. The first location to open in Russia, in central Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell.
""I’m glad they came around and made the right decision,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies’ stances on Russia, said after the move by McDonald's. ""It’s a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive."" 
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) is temporarily closing hundreds of stores. PepsiCo Inc will suspend all advertising in Russia and stop the sale of its drinks brands, while continuing to sell essentials such as milk and baby food. Rival  Coca-Cola Co  said it will suspend its business there.
Coca-Cola was the official drink of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, despite the United States boycotting the event in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Scores of other companies also have rebuked Russia, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Tuesday it would stop accepting new customers for its cloud services in Russia and Ukraine. Universal Music (AS:UMG) suspended all operations in Russia, and online dating service Bumble Inc will remove its apps from stores in Russia and Belarus.
Earlier, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports.
Moscow has termed the attack a ""special military operation"" aimed not at occupying territory but at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities.
The West's moves to isolate Russia economically for attacking its neighbour have hit hard global commodity and energy markets, sending prices soaring and threatening to derail the nascent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Britain too said it would ban imports of Russian oil but only by gradually phasing them out during 2022 to give businesses time to find alternative sources of supply.
The London Metal Exchange (LME) halted trade in nickel on Tuesday after prices of the metal, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, doubled to more than $100,000 a tonne.
Shell's decision to abandon Russia comes days after it faced a barrage of criticism for buying Russian oil – a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine.
""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel - despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking - was not the right one, and we are sorry,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said.
Shell and rivals BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) have all announced plans to sell holdings in Russia and exit the country, leaving France's TotalEnergies relatively isolated in hanging on to its investments there.
HYBRID DELAYS
Mining group BHP warned the surge in commodity prices could spill over into already-skyrocketing inflation and potentially affect global growth.
Nickel prices soared when China's Tsingshan Holding Group, one of the world's top nickel and stainless steel producers, bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its bets that prices would fall, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Tsingshan and the LME declined to comment.
As well as high-grade nickel, the price of other metals used in car production, from aluminium in bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters, has soared, and industry supply chains have been broken.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it would stop taking orders for numerous plug-in hybrid models from Wednesday, as supply-chain troubles exacerbated the production delays caused by chip shortages.

The carmaker had already halted production in Russia and has also suspended production at several factories in Germany as it has struggled to obtain components.
Orders for the plug-in hybrid versions of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Golf, Tiguan, Passat, Arteon and Touareg models would be halted until further notice and delivery of already-placed orders might not happen this year, the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apple Inc on Tuesday added 5G connectivity to its low-cost iPhone SE and iPad Air and introduced a faster chip for a new desktop, a high point in Apple's move to power its devices with microprocessors designed in house.
The new Studio desktop starts at $3,999 with the new M1 Ultra chip. The iPad Air also got Apple's M1 chip that was developed for laptops.
""Apple Silicon strategy is the key highlight,"" said analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. ""Apple is scaling the portfolio of its in-house semiconductor capabilities to power a broader set of richer devices from affordable iPhone SE to the most powerful product Mac Studio.""
Apple's Mac Pro still runs on  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) microprocessors.
Apple slightly hiked the price on the iPhone SE to $429 from $399 for the previous model. The new phone starts shipping March 18.
The iPhone SE comes with an A15 Bionic chip, which Apple says is the fastest among competition, a 4.7-inch retina display and a home button with touch ID.
""This is important for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone at a great value,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said.
Nabila Popal, an analyst at IDC, said the new iPhone SE will cater to consumers looking for a budget 5G device, and it could be particularly popular given the economic uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
""A cheaper iPhone with 5G is good news for Apple, especially in these times of uncertainty,"" Popal said.
But demand for larger screens could negatively impact iPhone SE sales, Popal added. Some consumers might instead opt for older iPhone models with bigger screens in the same price range.
The M1 Ultra is made by connecting two M1 Max chips and is eight times faster than M1 chips. Its first use will be in the creative professional-focused Mac Studio computer.
Apple will offer two versions of the Mac Studio, one with the M1 Max chip and the other utilizing the M1 Ultra chip.
Mac Studio pricing starts at $1,999 for the version with the M1 Max chip and $3,999 for the M1 Ultra loaded computer. 
Apple also debuted a new monitor called Studio Display that can be paired with any Mac, including Macbook Air and Macbook Pro models, and which is priced at $1,599. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were about flat for the day in mid-afternoon trading.
The company which has been broadening its services and other products also said its Apple TV+ product would begin showing Major League Baseball games on Friday nights. The weekly double header will be available in eight countries. 
The new iPad Air gets its first refresh in two years with a new design, 5G connectivity and the M1, popular in MacBooks. The starting price remained $599 and it will be available starting March 18.
The new iPad Air also features a 12-megapixel front camera. 
Apple also announced new iPhone 13 models in two new finishes, including alpine green.

During the presentation, Cook made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine. Apple said on March 1 it had paused all product sales in Russia in response to the Russian invasion. The Russian state media, RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the Apple Store outside Russia.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”

MILAN (Reuters) - The new boss of Salvatore Ferragamo aims to boost sales by revitalising its product offer, though the Italian luxury group said the war in Ukraine and the lingering pandemic in some areas meant it could not give an outlook for 2022.
Marco Gobbetti, who became chief executive of Ferragamo in January after 4-1/2 years at British rival Burberry, said he planned to appoint a new creative director to inject ""energy and newness"" in the product range. 
""For sure growth is for me the overall priority,"" Gobbetti said in his first conference call with analysts since he took the role, adding he would give more details on his strategy in May when Ferragamo reports first-quarter results.
The leather goods maker, which has been without a creative director since May after parting ways with British designer Paul Andrew, swung back to profit in 2021, posting earnings before interests and taxes of 143 million euros ($156 million). 
That was above an operating profit of 112 million euros expected on average by analysts. In January, Ferragamo had already reported a rise in sales of more than 30% for last year, though revenues were still far below pre-pandemic levels, underperforming most other luxury groups, which have largely exceeded 2019 results.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit hard Ferragamo, more exposed than rivals to travel spending, just as the family-owned firm strived to rejuvenate a brand famous for making shoes for Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn.

The group said it ""does not deem appropriate to provide guidance for the current year"" due to the persistence of the pandemic in certain regions and the geopolitical implications of the conflict in Ukraine, even though its direct exposure to Russia is less than 1% of sales.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global share markets fell on Tuesday as oil prices climbed yet further, driven by the United States banning Russian oil and other energy imports over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden made the announcement on Tuesday, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022. 
Benchmark Brent crude for May rose to an intra-day high of $131.27 a barrel before settling at $127.98 a barrel, 3.9% higher, while U.S. crude futures settled at $123.70 a barrel, a 3.6% increase.
Russia, which ships 7 million to 8 million barrels per day of crude and fuel to global markets, has been the target of Western sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia calls its actions a ""special operation,"" and it said earlier this week that prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it could close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West blocked its oil exports. 
Jason McMann, head of geopolitical risk analysis at Morning Consult, called the U.S. ban noteworthy, but said the ""real show-stopper"" would be Europe banning Russian energy imports. 
""Given Europe's relatively high dependence on energy supplies from Russia, such a move, if it materializes, would have major economic and geopolitical ramifications,"" he said.
The news added to volatility in the markets and stoked fears of inflation rising as European and other economies cooled.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, fell by 0.8% as of 5:40 p.m. ET (2250 GMT).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 184.74 points, or 0.56%, the S&P 500 lost 30.39 points, or 0.72% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 35.41 points, or 0.28%. The STOXX 600 was down 0.51%. 
Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer in the Americas for UBS's wealth management arm, said the increase in oil prices over the past week - the second-biggest jump in 30 years - is likely to stick, causing continued market volatility.
""The Russia-Ukraine war has driven oil prices up faster than we previously expected, but we continue to see a tight supply-demand balance for crude oil globally, even if the hostilities end and the geopolitical risk premium attached to crude declines,"" Marcelli said.
Gold held near record highs on Tuesday, after investors made a beeline for the traditional safe-haven metal on mounting fears around the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $2,050.97 an ounce. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) halted nickel trading on Tuesday after prices doubled in just hours to a record $100,000 per tonne, fueled by a race to cover short positions. 
UBS Global Wealth Management recommended a neutral stance on equities and advised clients to hold commodities, energy stocks and the U.S. dollar as portfolio hedges in the short term.
The rally in oil and other commodities has heightened investor fears about global inflation. Data this week is expected to show the U.S. consumer price index climbed a stratospheric 7.9% on a year-on-year basis in February, up from 7.5% in January.
Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the European Union plans as soon as this week to jointly issue bonds on a potentially massive scale to finance energy and defense spending.
The news pushed up both the euro and the yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes. The euro bounced back from a 22-month low against the dollar, which it hit the previous session, and was last flat against the dollar at $1.0899. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 11.2 basis points to 1.861% after hitting a two-month low on Monday.

The dollar index fell 0.082%. 
Investors are carefully watching a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. The prospect of stagflation has prompted economists to suggest policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.

LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Investors managing $2.4 trillion are calling on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to take tougher climate action, including cutting its exposure to fossil fuel assets.
""The message from investors is clear: Credit Suisse must urgently back its long-term net-zero ambition with robust fossil fuel disclosures, policies, and targets,"" Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction, said in a statement.
The 11-strong group, which includes Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi, said Switzerland's second-biggest bank also needed to improve its climate disclosures, align its coal, oil and gas policies with best-practice and set short-term targets to cut fossil fuel-related lending.
The group, which includes the municipal pension fund for Credit Suisse's home city of Zurich and the Swiss federal pension fund, said it was submitting a resolution to Credit Suisse's annual general meeting (AGM) on April 29.
If taken to a vote, the resolution, coordinated by responsible investment NGO ShareAction and Swiss pension fund adviser Ethos Foundation together with the Swiss Association for Responsible Investments, would be the first climate-related vote to be put to a Swiss company at its AGM.
Credit Suisse said it was engaged in dialogue with shareholders and would outline reductions to its oil, gas and coal financing in its sustainability report on Thursday.
""Credit Suisse's sustainability position is clear,"" the bank said in an emailed statement. ""We have made a public commitment to achieve net zero across our operations, supply chain and financing activities by 2050."" 
Interim targets include monitoring the reduction of both emissions and lending exposure to the oil, gas and coal sector.
The resolution follows the retraction of one at last year's AGM calling for the phasing out of coal financing.
Credit Suisse published a new coal policy at the COP26 climate talks in November.
The investor group said that policy had ""several concerning loopholes,"" including allowing the bank to keep funding companies for ""energy transition"" purposes without a clear definition of what that meant.

Credit Suisse had a torrid 2021, with scandals prompting executive oustings, a full-year loss and a strategic overhaul. A recently created sustainability division was folded back into its business units under new leadership.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York state judge on Tuesday said Smartmatic can pursue its $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit claiming that Fox News Network, Rudolph Giuliani and others falsely accused the electronic voting systems maker of helping rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election to favor Democrat Joe Biden.
Justice David Cohen of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected bids by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp, anchor Maria Bartiromo and former anchor Lou Dobbs to dismiss Smartmatic's claims against them.
Cohen also said Smartmatic can pursue some claims against Giuliani, who worked as a lawyer for former Republican President Donald Trump. He dismissed all claims against Fox host Jeanine Pirro and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.
Smartmatic accused the defendants of turning it into a ""villain"" by fabricating a story that its technology helped Biden steal the 2020 election from Trump.
The Florida-based company said Fox News did this to boost ratings, cater to Trump supporters, and avoid losing viewers to smaller, right-wing networks Newsmax and One America News.
Smartmatic said it provided technology for the election only to Los Angeles County, which Biden won.
Without ruling on the merits, Cohen found a ""substantial basis"" for the claim that Fox News ""turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims about [Smartmatic], unprecedented in the history of American elections, so inherently improbable that it evinced a reckless disregard for the truth.""
In a 61-page decision, Cohen said Giuliani's ""barrage"" of criticism, including that Smartmatic fixed elections in Venezuela and was up to its ""old tricks"" on election night, justified letting some claims against him proceed.
But the judge said an alleged misstatement by Pirro was not defamatory, and he lacked jurisdiction over claims against Powell.
Another company, Dominion Voting Systems, is pursuing similar litigation. A Delaware judge refused in December to dismiss its $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.
In a statement on behalf of the Fox News defendants, the network said it planned to appeal the Smartmatic decision, calling the company's claims ""baseless.""
Fox News also said it planned to file a counterclaim for fees and costs ""to prevent the full-blown assault on the First Amendment which stands in stark contrast to the highest tradition of American journalism.""
Powell's lawyer Howard Kleinhendler said his client was ""confident that any subsequent litigation by Smartmatic or others will reach the same result."" Lawyers for Giuliani did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Smartmatic's lawyer J. Erik Connolly said Fox News caused ""catastrophic damage"" to his client's business and reputation. ""This lawsuit will help to undo that damage,"" he said.
The case is Smartmatic USA Corp et al v Fox Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 151136/2021.

Several foreign companies including Ford and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia in order to put pressure on the Kremlin to stop its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and as their supply chains are disrupted.
In a statement published on Monday evening on the United Russia website, the secretary of the ruling party's general council Andrei Turchak said shutting operations was a ""war"" against the citizens of Russia. 
The statement mentioned Finnish privately owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures in Russia. 
""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak said.
""This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate being stabbed in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, not against Russia as a whole, but against our citizens,"" he said.
""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said.
Paulig Chief Executive told Reuters in an email this would not change its plans to withdraw from Russia. Fazer and Valio did not wish to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Fazer, which makes chocolate, bread and pastries, has three bakeries in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, employing around 2,300 people.

Valio has a cheese factory and employs 400 people in Russia, and Paulig has a coffee roastery and employs 200 people in the country.
Last week, non-NATO member Finland, which shares a border with Russia, agreed to strengthen security ties with the United States as it nervously watches Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Tuesday asked a federal judge to terminate his 2018 agreement with the top U.S. securities regulator requiring some of his tweets to be vetted by a lawyer.
Musk also asked the judge to block a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoena requesting records of pre-approval of a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll he conducted in November on potentially selling some of his stock.
""The SEC's pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment, which is quintessential bad faith,"" Musk's lawyers wrote to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan.
Musk's lawyers said the 2018 consent decree resolving SEC securities fraud charges should not allow ""roving and unbounded investigations"" into the outspoken government critic, while impeding his constitutional right to free speech.
Legal analysts said Musk's push to end the consent decree may fail.
""The SEC clearly has authority to enforce a consent decree issued by a federal court without having to conduct a new investigation,"" said Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
""Apart from concerns that the consent decree is overbroad and difficult to enforce, which seem plausible, Musk's other legal arguments are an exercise in legal silliness,"" she added.
UPHILL FIGHT
In early November, Musk posted on Twitter that he would offload 10% of his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stake if users approved.
A majority did, and the poll sent Tesla shares into a slump. Musk has since sold $16.4 billion of stock. 
The tweet renewed questions about whether Musk complied with his SEC agreement to obtain approval from a Tesla lawyer before issuing written communications about information material to his company or its shareholders.
Tesla said on Tuesday that Musk's tweet on stock sales ""is behavior the SEC should encourage: a CEO's transparency with the public and shareholders about a proposed stock sale."" 
Musk faces a ""real uphill fight,"" according to Stephen Crimmins, a partner at Murphy & McGonigle in New York City.
""Courts generally give the SEC a lot of leeway to enforce subpoenas,"" said Crimmins, who is not connected to the Musk case.
""Judges generally take the approach that if you agree to a consent decree, you're stuck with it. Saying you don't like the deal is not going to get you out of it.""
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
MICRO-MANAGING MUSK
The regulator sued Musk after he tweeted in August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take his electric-car company private at $420 per share.
In reality, a buyout was not close.
Tesla and Musk settled by agreeing to each pay $20 million in civil fines and let lawyers vet some of Musk's communications in advance, including Twitter posts that could affect Tesla's stock price. Musk also gave up Tesla's chairmanship. 
""I never lied to shareholders,"" Musk told Nathan in a separate court filing. ""I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders."" 
In his filing, Musk said he was ""forced"" to sign the decree, citing the SEC's ""unrelenting regulatory pressure"" and as the ""SEC's action stood to jeopardize the company’s financing.""
He said Tesla's investor relations teams said at that time that several large shareholders ""could cede their ownership in Tesla - substantially impacting Tesla's financing - if the case was not settled expediently.""
The company on Tuesday accused the SEC of exploiting the consent decree to ""micro-manage Mr. Musk's Twitter activity"" and retaliate against him for criticizing the agency. 

Musk has also mocked the agency in his tweets since the 2018 probe: ""SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.""
He also tweeted in 2020 that Tesla would make short pants in radiant red satin with gold trim and send them to the SEC, which he called the ""shortseller enrichment commission.""

(Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes ended lower in rocky trading on Tuesday, as investors weighed fast-paced developments around the crisis in Ukraine as the United States banned Russian oil and other energy imports over the invasion.
Losses accelerated into the end of Tuesday's up-and-down session, a day after steep declines that saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirm it was in a bear market. The benchmark S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight session.
U.S. President Joe Biden announced the ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, underscoring strong bipartisan support for a move that he acknowledged would drive up U.S. energy prices, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022.
""I think it is just investors trying to probe whether it is worth buying the dips and we had a real big one yesterday,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""Anytime that the buying seems to get a little out of hand on the upside there seems to be willing sellers coming in.""
“To me, it’s a trader’s market and people looking for very short-term momentum shifts to trade,” Carlson said.

Defensive sectors were the biggest decliners, with consumer staples falling 2.6%, healthcare dropping 2.1% and utilities down 1.6%. 
Gains in megacap growth stocks, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), helped mitigate losses for the S&P 500.
The energy sector, a standout performer this year, continued its charge higher, rising 1.4%. 
Brent crude topped $130 per barrel along with other commodities, triggering alarm over surging inflation and the impact on global economic growth. U.S. gasoline prices hit a record on Tuesday.
""There is a just a lot of uncertainty right now of what the impact is going to be on the U.S. economy,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""I think we will see a little pullback in the U.S. consumer. Obviously, the gasoline prices are going to cause people to pause a little bit.""
Ukraine's government accused Russian forces of shelling a humanitarian corridor that Moscow, which describes its actions as a ""special operation"", had promised to open to let residents flee the besieged port of Mariupol.
Stocks have struggled as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. 
On Monday, the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, falling over 20% from its record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average confirmed it was in a correction as it closed more than 10% lower from its record peak.
In company news, shares of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) jumped 6.8% after Jefferies upgraded the construction equipment maker's stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"" as a hedge against inflation and prospects of more investments.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - An auditor has questioned SoftBank's bookkeeping at the French unit that designed its Pepper robot, documents show, casting doubt on the Japanese firm's treatment of a subsidiary it is now trying to sell as the venture has floundered.
The French auditor, in a report seen by Reuters, expresses doubt about the treatment under which the local unit of SoftBank Group Corp's robotics business, according to two people familiar with the matter, booked losses and did not pay tax.
Specifically, the 196-page July report by auditor Cabinet Boisseau, which has not been previously reported, questions SoftBank's decision to treat its Paris-based robotics business as having a high level of autonomy for accounting purposes.
The report says this treatment is ""clearly debatable"", citing the local company's ""extremely limited"" ability to make its own decisions. It does not accuse SoftBank of legal wrongdoing, draw specific conclusions about the company's French tax liability or say the firm sought to avoid tax. 
The auditor was hired by staff representatives at SoftBank Robotics Europe amid tensions with management over the direction of the company, the two sources said. French law required SoftBank to pay for and cooperate with the audit. 
""Cabinet Boisseau's reasoning is based on assumption and does not accurately reflect the facts,"" SoftBank said in a statement to Reuters. 
The auditor's report sheds light on the troubled relations between Tokyo and Paris at SoftBank's robotics business, which is best known for the wide-eyed Pepper android that group founder Masayoshi Son once touted as being the first personal robot that can read emotions.
Cabinet Boisseau took particular issue with SoftBank's decision to designate Paris-based SoftBank Robotics Europe as the ""main entrepreneur"", meaning residual profit and loss from the robotics business accrued to the French unit, the auditor said.
Under the scheme, the two sources told Reuters, SoftBank Robotics Europe booked losses for years and did not have to pay tax.
The report says ""the risk of fraud cannot be ruled out"" due to SoftBank's failure to share with the auditor its response to a 2018 government tax audit and a lack of clarity about the unit's accounting designation. The report does not detail any potentially fraudulent behaviour.
""SoftBank Robotics Europe operates with a high degree of autonomy, and both SoftBank Robotics Europe and SoftBank Robotics Group have paid taxes appropriately in each country, have properly conducted all tax audits, and have dealt with tax authorities with responses and interviews,"" SoftBank said in the statement. 
In SoftBank's view, the accounting designation was justified because the French unit took the main role in the development, production and sale of the robots and bore the main risks, according to the report, which cites internal documents. 
""Deloitte, an independent accounting firm, has appropriately conducted our audit in recognition of Cabinet Boisseau's conjecture, which forms the basis of the article, and has not changed its conclusion,"" SoftBank said in its statement.
Deloitte said it does not comment on client matters as it is bound by a statutory duty of confidentiality. Phone calls to the French tax authorities went unanswered. Cabinet Boisseau did not respond to requests for comment. Staff representatives of SoftBank Robotics Europe declined to comment, citing confidentiality.
SHORT CIRCUIT 
SoftBank acquired the French business in 2012 as part of Son's ambition to revolutionise commercial robotics. That dream has all but short-circuited, and the Japanese tech investment firm is in talks to sell the company to Germany's United Robotics Group, Reuters has reported.
United Robotics declined to comment on the outlook for the talks.
A sale would mark SoftBank pulling back at one of the few businesses it is still directly involved in operating. The Japanese firm has halted production of Pepper and slashed robotics jobs globally, Reuters has reported.
The auditor's report does not specify to what extent SoftBank's accounting contributed to losses at the unit.
The auditor says Japanese managers were prominent in making decisions at the French unit, Japan was the largest market for the robots and Tokyo had a direct relationship with the company that assembled the robots, Taiwan's Foxconn.
French management recognised that Japan called the shots, telling staff representatives in one meeting that Pepper production numbers were ""imposed"" by Tokyo, in a ""unilateral decision"", the report says. 
The report refers to the French business developing other robots including the humanoid Romeo, which was a research project begun in 2009 looking at helping people with reduced physical autonomy, and a food-serving robot, Plato.
After SoftBank bought another robotics business, Boston Dynamics, it told the French unit to suspend work on legs for Romeo as Boston Dynamics had its own walking robot, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO), the report says.
But there was never any meaningful collaboration between the two companies, the two sources said. In the end, Romeo never got legs, they said.

""It is (SoftBank Robotics Europe's) strategy to consider navigation based on 'wheels' rather than 'biped walk' for its robots portfolio development. Romeo was a European collaborative project that has been duly completed with all partners,"" SoftBank said.
Boston Dynamics declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc defended the safety benefits of its advanced driver assistance system Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability but acknowledged they require ""constant monitoring and attention of the driver.""
Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey wrote Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Feb. 8 raising ""significant concerns"" about the electric-car maker's Autopilot and FSD systems which have prompted scrutiny from safety regulators.
In a previously unreported March 4 letter to the senators, Tesla's senior director, public policy and business development Rohan Patel, said the features enhance the ability of its customers ""to drive safer than the average driver in the U.S.""
Patel noted that both systems ""require the constant monitoring and attention of the driver."" Tesla vehicles are capable of performing ""some but not all of the Dynamic Driving Tasks"" that can be performed by human drivers, he added.
Tesla says on its website that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically and ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""
Blumenthal and Markey said in a statement to Reuters the letter was ""just more evasion and deflection from Tesla. Despite its troubling safety track record and deadly crashes, the company seemingly wants to carry on with business as usual.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Patel said in the letter that Tesla ""understands the importance of educating owners on the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD Capability.""
Autopilot allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel at times but Patel said its torque-based hands-on-wheel detection helps ensure drivers remain attentive.
Tesla launched a test version of its FSD system more than a year ago, enabling its vehicles to navigate city streets. Tesla has expanded the FSD deployment to 60,000 users, sparking criticism that it is risking safety by testing its technology with untrained drivers on public roads.

The automaker faces a number of investigations. The senators said in their letter the ""complaints and investigations paint a troubling picture: Tesla repeatedly releases software without fully considering its risks and implications, creating grave dangers for all on the roads.""
Under pressure from regulators, Tesla in January agreed to recall about 54,000 U.S. vehicles to revise software to prevent vehicles from disregarding stop signs.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A senior Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) executive said on Tuesday the company had no current plans to offer a streaming option that included advertising but declined to rule it out in the future.
""Never say never,"" CFO Spencer Neumann said when asked if the company would change its long-standing position that its service should remain ad-free, adding ""it's not something in our plan right now.""
Some Wall Street analysts have urged Netflix, the world's largest streaming service, to develop a lower-cost tier with advertising to boost revenue. The company's pace of new subscribers has slowed in recent quarters, and Netflix shares have fallen nearly 43% this year. 
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co on Friday announced it would offer an ad-supported streaming option for Disney+, joining AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and others trying to attract customers who are willing to watch commercials to avoid paying a monthly fee.
For Netflix, ""it's not like we have religion against advertising,"" Neumann said at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media & Telecom Conference.
But he said the company was focused on building its current business for customers who want to watch movies and TV shows without commercials. ""We think we have a great model, a subscription business that scales globally really well,"" Neumann said.
""It's hard for us to ignore that others are doing it, but for now it doesn't make sense for us,"" he added.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wrapped its first product event Tuesday with a number of announcements including a new budget iPhone that some bet will drive new user adoption, boosting sales by 30 million units from launch.   
Apple is hoping that is better that the new budget iPhone can spur a supercycle of iPhone sales just like the iPhone 12 SE did in 2020.  The ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup achieved 100 million sales within seven months of its launch.
“This past fall we've added more new users to the iPhone 13 line-up than in each of the previous five launches and we're excited for the iPhone SE to build on this momentum,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said Tuesday.
Some on Wall Street also share the tech giant’s confidence that the launch of the budget iPhone - equipped with 5G and Apple's latest A15 bionic chip - will prove difficult for consumers to pass up.
“Overall, with the A15 chip this smartphone will be the fastest and most powerful phone at these price points by a wide margin and we believe based on our initial supply chain checks should translate into 30 million+ iPhone units out of the gates for this product launch,” Wedbush said following the event.
The new iPhone at $439, is $30 more expensive than its predecessor, raising some concern as to whether the price tag could prove a stumbling block to user adoption. Pre-orders starting Friday, March 18.
Wedbush said, however, that the “modest” price hike was reasonable given the supply-chain costs faced by the tech giant, and wasn’t likely to impact demand.
“In a backdrop of massive supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures, a modest increase is not surprising and should not impact overall demand in our opinion,” Wedbush added.

Investing.com – Stocks rode up and down in a volatile session after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will ban imports of oil and energy products from Russia.
The U.K. also said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and other energy products by the end of the year, Reuters reported.
The price of oil rocketed past $130 a barrel for the international benchmark Brent and gasoline prices at the pump in the United States are at record highs above $4 nationally. In some locations, gas prices are as high as $6 a barrel and climbing.
Biden has promised American voters he would try to get a handle on rising prices that are crimping household budgets.
 The U.S. and allies agreed to release a total of 60 million barrels from their strategic oil reserves – half of that to come from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But rising gasoline prices may make Biden’s clean energy promise more difficult to sell, at least in the near term.
Stocks have been on a roller coaster ride this year amid an escalating crisis in Ukraine brought on by the invasion of Russia. Since late February, a growing list of Western companies have pulled their business from Russia, including on Tuesday McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. New Apple gadgets
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its newest version of the iPhone SE with its latest mobile processor and 5G capability on Tuesday and people will likely still be talking about it this week. The tech giant said the latest edition of its entry-level iPhone will include the ""toughest glass on a smartphone"" and starts at $429, with pre-orders starting Friday, March 18. The new SE will also have the advanced features of Apple's latest A15 bionic chip.
2. Oil ban from Russia
The U.S.’s unilateral move to ban Russian oil imports adds to a raft of global sanctions already imposed on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. European allies may be too dependent for now on Russia, particularly for its natural gas, to institute similar action. Biden acknowledged that European allies might not yet be in a position to join the U.S. in this extra step to exert pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin. But stay tuned for news from EU.
3. Google cybersecurity deal
Not to be overlooked was Tuesday’s deal by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google to acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant for approximately $5.4 billion, which could inspire a chain of similar deals. Google will pay $23 per share for Mandiant in a move it says is to protect against risks facing its Google Cloud customers. Mandiant will join Google Cloud once the deal goes through.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed lower Tuesday, after swinging between gains and losses as investors weighed up the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict in the wake of the U.S. announcing a ban on imports of Russian energy.
S&P 500 fell 0.70%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, or 184 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.28%.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday. “That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports…”  The embargo will ban new shipments of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal imports to the U.S. 
Oil prices jumped sharply, pushing U.S. gas prices to record highs and exacerbated concerns that inflation pressures will remain elevated and dent economic growth.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate rose to 2.876%, pointing to bets on inflation averaging 2.9% a year for the next decade.
Industrials, meanwhile, were led higher by surge in  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and a rebound in airline stocks.
Caterpillar jumped more than 7% after Jefferies upgraded its rating on the industrial equipment maker to buy from hold and raised its price target to $260 from $215, as the stock has historically been a strong inflation hedge.
Airline stocks, which have come under pressure amid concerns about rising jet fuel costs, rebounded from a slump a day earlier.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were up more than 5%.
Technology stocks struggled to hold onto gains after turning positive intraday, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ending the day more than 1% lower.  
At its product launch event, Apple rolled out a new budget iPhone, an update to the iPad Air and an updated Mac chip, which will used in the new Mac Studio computer. Wedbush has estimated the new budget iPhone could rack up 30 million sales over the next year. 
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bucked the trend lower, rising 0.6% after agreeing to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant in a deal worth $5.4 billion. The acquisition is expected to bolster cybersecurity for Google’s cloud customers.
On the earnings front, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reported quarter-results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 2% higher.
In other news,  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) rallied 5% after UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on expectation that the company's spectrum assets are undervalued.
""Questions remain regarding DISH's wireless business model, but we believe DISH's network build protects the company's spectrum licenses, whose value serves as a backstop,"" UBS said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rate hike cycle that started last year and low valuations had already made Latin America a darling destination for investors in 2022, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to keep cash flowing to the commodity-exposed region.
The risks are country-specific, and mostly coming from electoral exposure or a further spike in inflation, analysts said.
Latin American stock markets measured in dollars are outperforming larger economies by close to 25 percentage points this year, with MSCI's Latam index up 11% YTD while the developed world index is down close to 13%.
So far this year, foreign flows to Latam stock and bond portfolios totaled about $18 billion through February, while the rest of EM pulled in a net $7.5 billion.
The Ukrainian invasion, dubbed a ""special operation"" by Moscow, has heightened risk aversion across emerging Europe but could add to the ongoing outperformance from Latin America. 
""Amid all the current volatility, Latin America may have some opportunities. Some markets may be positively impacted by higher commodity prices, and also by a higher volume of investment flows by Emerging Market portfolio managers,"" said Alfonso Eyzaguirre, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Latin America and Canada.
He added that investment restrictions in Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries can increase Latin America's weight in emerging market portfolios.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and a barrel of oil hit this week its highest price since mid 2008. 
Regional currencies have also performed better this year. The four best-performing across emerging markets against the dollar are from Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Alongside spikes in the price of oil and food, the currency moves have added to the regional tailwind.
""The main impact on Latin America is coming via commodity price moves – this seems to have supported currencies like the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. Insofar as there are clearer beneficiaries from these commodity price moves, it’s the oil exporters like Colombia."" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""But there will be a cost across the region from higher commodity prices – it’s likely to lift inflation, and central banks are likely to hike interest rates more aggressively.""
The rate hike cycle that started in Latam ahead of a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve has also boosted bond performance in relative terms.
Even as sovereign and quasi-sovereign spreads have widened across EM, emerging markets in Latin America have seen a 72 basis point widening this year, while Asia is wider at 92 bps, Africa at 161 bps and Europe at 778.
""My overall view that if you're a long-term fundamental bull it probably has to be Chile,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX at BK Asset Management.
""If you're looking for a short-term bounce, or a really strong reversal, it's Brazil. And Argentina has a long-shot trade here on the commodity boom - it's so hated by everybody, and is basically so oversold, that there's little risk of downside at this point.""
He said Brazilian stocks, already up 7% in local terms YTD and near 20% in dollars, ""are going to be probably the most sensitive to the upside.""
But political uncertainty, as well as overall risk aversion, could get in the way of the region's outperformance.
Colombia's congressional election this weekend will give a clearer picture of the odds on the May presidential race, which so far points to a sharp move towards the left.
Similar expectations exist for Brazil's election in October, while Chile is set to ratify the re-writing of the constitution made by a majority center- and left-leaning convention.

""Latam remains a difficult region to allocate to structurally given several idiosyncratic risk events such as upcoming elections in Colombia and Brazil, domestic political tension in Peru and a re-drafting of the constitution in Chile,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a client note on Monday.
""In Mexico, the currency and local rates are likely to be negatively impacted by a more hawkish Fed and higher inflation pressures.""

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer, will offer its Walmart Plus membership service free for part-time and full-time workers in the United States, it said on Tuesday, joining a growing list of retailer perks being offered in a tight labor market.
Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, said on a blog post https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/03/08/walmart-unveils-new-spotify-promotion-and-rolls-out-free-membership-for-associates on its website that the scheme is available for workers employed at its stores, distribution centers and fulfillment centers. 
Walmart last September bumped up wages by at least $1 for 565,000 store workers ahead of the holiday season and earlier said it would cover 100% of college tuition and book costs for its associates.
Members of Walmart Plus, launched in September 2020, are offered unlimited free delivery, fuel discounts and no checkout lines, among other benefits, for $98 per year. On Tuesday, the retailer said it would also offer a six-month Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Premium membership for new and existing Walmart+ members for free.
The service, touted as a rival to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime subscription, reached more than 30 million subscribers in 2021, and the latest move could bring Walmart's 1.6 million-person workforce into its subscriber base.
Employers of all kinds are fast-tracking their hiring processes, expanding healthcare benefits and offering sign-on bonuses to lock in workers, particularly in retail, where job openings continue to outnumber applicants. 

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment remains 2.9 million jobs below its pre-pandemic peak, but signs are emerging that the tide may be turning after a strong recovery in hiring in February.
Walmart rival  Target  (NYSE:TGT) last month laid plans to spend $300 million more in the next year on improving wages and healthcare benefits and set a new starting wage ranging from $15 to $24 per hour for store and warehouse workers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Europe's economy is likely already in a recession as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. economy may not be far behind, which will likely prompt companies and consumers to look toward technology to lower costs, star stock picker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
Wood, whose ARK Innovation fund outperformed all other U.S. equity funds following the coronavirus lockdowns in 2020 before stalling in February 2021, said that soaring oil prices should accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, while genomics companies should benefit as a form of cost-saving compared to existing forms of treatment. 
""The good news is that innovation solves problems,"" Wood said. 
Wood's optimism comes as her flagship ARK Innovation fund is down 38.6% for the year to date as high inflation saps investor appetite for the high-growth and low-revenue companies that are mainstays of her portfolio. Her largest position, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, is down 32% for the year to date, while streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, another top holding, is down nearly 52% over the same time.
The benchmark S&P 500 is down 11.8% for the year to date. 

The shock of high gas prices may prompt the Federal Reserve to back off its plan to raise interest rates repeatedly this year, Wood said. 
""We've got a lot of fear baked into the markets,"" she said.

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive Inc has been sued by a shareholder who claimed the startup failed to tell investors it had underpriced its electric vehicles, leading to unpopular price hikes that it swiftly rolled back.
In a complaint filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, shareholder Charles Larry Crews said Rivian concealed how its R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck were so underpriced that it needed to raise prices soon after its November initial public offering.
Crews said the increases ""would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company,"" and risk cancellation of a large number of 55,400 preorders dating back to 2018.
He called the rollback, including an apology from Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe, a ""futile attempt at damage control.""
Rivian did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. 
The proposed class action came after Irvine, California-based Rivian sparked a customer backlash, including on social media, on March 1 by raising the R1S's price to $84,500 from $70,000, and the R1T's price to about $79,500 from $67,500.
Rivian backtracked two days later, saying customers with existing preorders would not face the higher prices, and customers who had canceled orders could reinstate them.
""It was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian,"" Scaringe wrote customers in a March 3 letter. Rivian cited inflation pressures for the price increases.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com-backed company went public at $78.00 per share on Nov. 10, raising about $12 billion in the world's largest IPO of 2021.
Its shares closed Monday at $42.43, after losing 37% of their value in the prior five trading days.
Crews said he bought 35 Rivian shares on its first day of trading at $112.83 each, 45% above the IPO price.
In an email, his lawyer Jacob Walker said federal securities laws provide ""a very strong remedy"" for investors when companies omit key facts from IPO materials.

The lawsuit names more than 30 defendants including Scaringe and lead IPO underwriters Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The case is Crews v Rivian Automotive Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01433.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ukraine has urged cloud-computing and software giants including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP SE (DE:SAPG) to cut off Russia to stop Moscow's invasion. Here's what's at stake.
WHAT IS UKRAINE DEMANDING?
The Ukrainian ministry of digital transformation wants North American and European technology companies to completely pause any dealings with Russian clients, potentially disrupting Russia's economy and forcing the Kremlin to reconsider what it has called a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Some companies like Microsoft have stopped accepting new customers in Russia since the invasion began last month. But many have not ended deals with existing customers, except for those targeted by new sanctions and export controls.
WHAT ROLE DO WESTERN COMPANIES PLAY IN RUSSIA'S IT SYSTEMS?
Russian companies and government agencies long have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their owned-and-operated IT systems. Servers from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (NYSE:HPE) top the market in Russia. 
Also popular are applications from SAP, Microsoft,  IBM ,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM). The tools help organizations send emails, analyze data, store records and generally manage their operations.
Vendors cannot remotely turn off some of the technology. But there are options to choke clients' systems.
Banking, telecom, transport and other organizations in Russia could be hampered if vendors stop providing replacement parts, security patches, software updates and technical support, according to two former senior salespeople for IBM in Eastern Europe.
Clients could be forced to find alternatives, even pen-and-paper bookkeeping, if services go offline or degrade due to a lack of updates.
HOW WOULD A WESTERN CLOUD SHUTDOWN AFFECT RUSSIA?
Russian companies have been largely reluctant to rely completely on cloud services, especially from U.S.-based providers such as Microsoft Azure and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud, according to IDC analyst Philip Carter. As a proportion of overall domestic IT spending, cloud accounts for 5% in Russia compared with 19% in the United States, Carter said.
As a result, Russian companies dropped from the cloud would not be overly crippled, he said.
Still, the Russian cloud market has grown fast over the last two years, with the pandemic driving commerce online, according to researchers.
Microsoft has the largest market share in Russia at 17%, followed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud unit at 14% and IBM at 10%, according to 2020 estimates from IDC.  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) NV, a Russian company, comes in fourth with 3% market share.
But IDC has said Russia and Ukraine combined only account for 5.5% of all information and communication technology spending in Europe and 1% worldwide.
WHAT HAVE THE WESTERN COMPANIES SAID?
Salesforce on Monday said it had began exiting its customer relationships in Russia, which it said added up to a small, non-material number. 
Other companies declined to comment on whether they are considering dropping existing clients. 
Amazon Web Services has said its biggest customers in Russia are companies headquartered elsewhere, and that it has had a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government.
IBM and Oracle have said they suspended all business in Russia, and IBM added that it does not do business with Russian military organizations. HPE, Dell, SAP and Microsoft have said they are stopping sales. Google Cloud did not respond to a request for comment.
WHO COULD BENEFIT IF WESTERN COMPANIES BOW OUT?
Russian companies could turn to homegrown workplace software such as MyOffice or local cloud providers including Yandex and ActiveCloud. Prices and quality may be less favorable, though, IDC's Carter said.

Blake Murray of research company Canalys said Chinese technology companies could fill the gap. Cloud providers include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd . China-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd last year opened a data center in Moscow to the Russian scientific and academic community.
Still, any use of Western components in their operations could complicate Russian sales under trade curbs the United States recently imposed.

(Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers are protesting on social media over record U.S. gasoline prices eating into their earnings just as the ride-hailing firm raised its profitability outlook, with some asking whether it was still worth getting behind the wheel.
U.S. retail gasoline prices hit an all-time of $4.173 on Tuesday after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent the price of crude oil rocketing. The price per gallon is now around 60% higher than it was two years ago before the COVID-19 crisis.
""There is no driver that's not complaining about these high prices of gasoline,"" Sergio Avedian, a Los Angeles-based ride-hail driver, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.
For Uber and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), driver discontent comes as the ride-hailing pioneers seek to turn the page on the coronavirus pandemic as customers return to in greater numbers.
""Our platform only works if it works for drivers, so we'll continue to monitor gas prices and listen to drivers over the coming weeks,"" Uber said in a statement.
Lyft said in a statement to Reuters that it ""cared deeply about the driver experience.""
Uber on Monday raised its first-quarter core profit outlook on faster-than-expected demand rises, with February ride-hail trips only 10% below the pre-pandemic 2019 level.
That demand recovery requires a greater influx of drivers, many of whom left the sector during the pandemic, while pain at the pump coincides with general price increases for anything from car loans to tires, piling further pressure on them.
CASH-BACK SCHEME 
Many drivers shared their frustration in private online forums, with some hanging up their car keys.
""It's just not worth me driving any longer,"" Andrea Golde, a driver near Columbus, Ohio, told Reuters, saying she drives part-time and barely broke even in recent weeks.
Uber said driver earnings remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels despite higher gas prices, adding that the number of active drivers in the U.S. and Canada has been relatively stable from January to February, with driver numbers increasing during the final week of February.
Both Uber and Lyft have entered a partnership with GetUpside, which offers cash-back programs for fuel purchases, in an attempt to ameliorate the situation.
GetUpside said it had seen more than two million transactions from Uber and Lyft drivers over the past eight months, who on average earn $0.10 per gallon in cash-back at the pump. It said registrations had increased in recent weeks.
Uber said more than 200,000 drivers had signed up.

Desperate drivers are also signing an online petition https://www.coworker.org/petitions/gas-prices-3 that urges Uber and Lyft to have passengers pick up the fuel tab.
While it was launched in 2018, the petition has gained momentum in recent weeks, with 500 of the nearly 6,000 signatures coming in this month, Tim Newman, campaigns director at Coworker.org, said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Cosmetics giant L'Oreal is temporarily closing its stores in Russia and suspending investments in the country, it said on Tuesday, joining dozens of Western companies pausing operations over the invasion of Ukraine.
""We strongly condemn the Russian invasion and the war in Ukraine, which is causing so much suffering to the Ukrainian people,"" the French company said in a statement.
L'Oreal's Russian business, which includes a production plant, accounts for a low, single-digit percentage of annual sales, according to the company.
Companies operating in Russia have faced political pressure to halt their activities in the country, which has been hit by sweeping sanctions from the United States, Britain and the Europe Union.
L'Oreal said it was fully aligned with the position of French and European Union authorities.
The world's biggest cosmetics firm, which owns the Lancome and Maybelline brands, said it was considering additional measures while seeking to take care of its 2,200 employees in Russia.
L'Oreal has 326 Ukrainian employees, the majority of whom remain in their country under what the company said were increasingly unbearable conditions.
""We are concerned for them and fear for their safety,"" L'Oreal said, noting that it was providing financial and psychological support.
The company is also donating 5 million euros ($5.4 million) to international and regional aid organisations as well as United Nations agencies providing humanitarian aid.
Leading international luxury companies LVMH, Hermes,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Chanel announced plans to temporarily shut operations in Russia last week.

French food multinational Danone said over the weekend that it was suspending investments in the country.

Leonardo said in December it had received two expressions of interest in OTO Melara, which produces naval and terrestrial cannons, and Wass, which makes torpedoes, and was waiting for binding offers.
Leonardo said at the time it wanted to focus on helicopters, aircraft and electronics for defence, adding OTO Melara and Wass could have better growth opportunities outside the group. 
Franco-German consortium KMW+Nexter Defence Systems (KNDS) and Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri have both expressed an interest in the two units.
But the Italian government, which controls both Leonardo and Fincantieri, wants to have a say in the deal, sources have previously said.
With Europe weighing the urgent need for closer cooperation on defence, Rome believes any choice over the future of the two units has to be part of a broader strategy.
In particular, Rome wants to have a role in an Europe-wide consortium for terrestrial military equipment, in which some of the assets of OTO Melara and Wass could be folded, a senior government official said. 
The official said negotiations to reach the government's goals were complex, and the current crisis made it difficult to pursue talks.

""The issue is suspended due to the war,"" one of the sources said, asking not to be named given that deliberations are private.
Leonardo declined to comment.

(Reuters) -European shares slipped on Tuesday, as the United States banned Russian oil imports, raising volatility and fears of global stagflation, and offsetting a recovery in financial stocks.
The region-wide STOXX 600 index ended a choppy session down 0.5% with technology, healthcare and the materials sector weighing. 
London's FTSE and the German DAX were flat, while the bank-heavy indices of Spain and Italy outperformed, rising 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.
President Joe Biden announced a U.S. ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, ramping up a campaign against Moscow in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022.
The European Union has so far refrained from a ban on imports given its dependence on Russian gas and oil and the possible inflation repurcussions.
While markets had priced in the bans to an extent, the crisis is fuelling worries about slower economic growth coupled with higher commodity prices and inflation, Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Private Bank, said.
Fears of a severe supply crunch sent crude prices soaring past $132 per barrel, boosting London-listed oil majors BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) up 5.1% and 3.0% respectively. [O/R] 
Germany's DAX and Italy's MIB were confirmed as being in a bear market, or a decline of 20% or more from the most recent closing highs, on the prospect of a Russian oil import ban.
The STOXX 600 is down almost 15% so far this year, slipping from January's record highs as the Ukraine crisis has escalated.
""If there is a further escalation in terms of sanctions and you have an actual stopping in physical supply of gas to Europe, you can even be faced with rolling blackouts in the industrial sector,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard.
Euro zone banks closed 2.5% higher after hitting a one-year low in the previous session. 
Most euro zone sovereign bond yields soared and a key gauge of market inflation expectations jumped to its highest level since late 2013 amid unease over rising price pressures two days before a European Central Bank meeting.

 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) gained 5.9% after an Italian newspaper reported that U.S. fund KKR was still interested in a takeover, albeit at a lower price.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's satellite builder and operator MDA Ltd. is providing Ukraine with near real-time satellite images to track Russian troop movements even at night or through cloud cover, Chief Executive Officer Mike Greenley said on Tuesday.
""We can deliver intelligence reports and people can make determinations of what's going on the ground, or on the sea, from our radar imagery,"" Greenley said in a Zoom interview. ""It's all about... doing the right thing and giving Ukraine the support that they need."" 
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, made an appeal to the international community on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) a week ago, asking for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data.
""We badly need the opportunity to watch the movement of Russian troops, especially at night when our technologies are blind,"" Fedorov said on March 1.
With the war in its 13th day, the main Russian assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital. But to the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory.
In the SAR images, ""you can see groups of vehicles, you can see changes to buildings, you can see changes to bridges, you can see ships at sea through all weather conditions day and night,"" Greenley said.

The intelligence is communicated securely to Ukraine through Western-based commercial agencies or governments, he said. MDA received approval from the Canadian government on Friday to share the SAR images of Ukraine, Greenley said.
Asked whether he feared Russian retaliation, Greenley said his company had adopted a ""slightly heightened security posture"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Shares in German utility Uniper gave up earlier gains to close flat after the group signalled an exit from Russia and wrote down its exposure to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, key areas of investor concern since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shares in Uniper had soared as much as 9.1% earlier on the news, while Finnish parent Fortum, which holds 78% in Uniper, had gained as much as 6.9%. Shares in both firms closed virtually flat.
""We have to put our business on a new footing,"" Harald Seegatz, deputy chairman of Uniper's supervisory board, told Reuters. ""Security of supply is the highest priority.""
This includes pushing ahead with plans for a terminal to import liquefied natural gas in the German port of Wilhelmshaven, which Seegatz said could be available from the 2023/24 winter season if the government provides sufficient support and red tape is reduced.
Fortum and Uniper are heavily exposed to Russia, where they have 12 power plants with a combined power generation capacity of 15.5 gigawatts. Uniper also owns an 83.7% stake in Russian utility Unipro, which it intends to divest.
Their combined Russian generation assets as well as the 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) exposure to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had a book value of about 5.5 billion euros, Fortum has said.
Berlin has halted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would have doubled Russian gas flows to Germany, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"".
Unipro said late on Monday that it had initiated a sales process for its Unipro stake at the end of last year, although those plans were now on hold given recent events. They would be resumed as soon as possible, it said. Its stake in Unipro is currently worth 97 billion roubles ($770 million).
Sources told Reuters last year that Uniper has held talks with Russia's InterRAO about a potential deal involving Unipro which laid bare differences between the two parties about price.

703,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Shale giants EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG). and  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN). are sitting on thousands of federal drilling permits, many of which could be used to produce oil from the prolific Permian basin as a U.S. ban on Russian oil increases demand for other crude.
EOG and Devon hold more permits than other company, according to a Bloomberg analysis of federal onshore permitting data, but neither plans to grow production beyond 5% even as U.S. oil futures top $120 a barrel and global markets face historic disruptions. That dissonance is at the center of tension between the U.S. shale industry — which argues it needs long-term government support before it can sustainably raise production — and the Biden administration — which says oil companies should use up the more-than 9,000 drilling permits they already have before asking for further concessions.
The war of words between the two has intensified as the U.S. moved to ban Russian oil imports in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine. U.S. producers “have 9,000 permits to drill now -- they can be drilling right now, yesterday last week, last year,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday. “They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved. So let me be clear, let me be clear: they are not using them for production now.” The comments came a day after the American Petroleum Institute, the biggest U.S. oil lobby group, accused the administration of “ misusing facts” when it comes to federal leasing data.

“Just because you have a lease doesn’t mean there’s actually oil and gas in that lease, and there has to be a lot of development that occurs between the leasing and then ultimately permitting for that acreage to be productive,” said Mike Sommers, chief executive of the API. 
But a review of federal drilling permits shows that half of unused onshore permits are for acreage in New Mexico’s Lea and Eddy counties, part of the Permian Basin that’s responsible for most of U.S. oil output. EOG held the most permits there, followed by Devon and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).
Devon and Occidental declined to comment. EOG didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The American Exploration and Production Council, a trade group representing EOG, Devon and others, pushed back on the notion that holding permits constitutes an obligation to drill. “This claim shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how exploration and production works,” said Anne Bradbury, chief executive officer of the association. And Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, speaking Tuesday at the CERAWeek by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) conference in Houston, said that U.S. oil drillers can’t significantly expand production in the near term because of personnel shortages and supply-chain snarls.
READ ALSO: Devon CEO ‘Mystified’ Biden Doesn’t Reach Out to Talk Oil
Oil companies may believe it prudent to hold onto drilling permits now in case Biden — who campaigned on pledges to combat climate change, accelerate the transition into renewables and limit new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters — clamps down on drilling later. The administration initially halted oil and gas lease sales --a move later reversed by a Louisiana-based federal district court — and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management has yet to auction onshore oil leases under Biden. It is still issuing permits on existing leases, with nearly 4,000 authorized onshore last year, in line with recent, pre-2020 levels. And more of those leases actually have wells in production, according to Bureau of Land Management data cited by the industry.
There are barriers to ramping up output in Lea and Eddy counties. Oil produced on that side of the Permian tends to generate higher quantities of associated natural gas and water, which are more costly to dispose of in New Mexico, where air and water regulations are stricter than in Texas. 
Publicly-traded oil and gas companies are also trying to limit production growth and return more cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after a decade of overspending burned investors. Oil CEOs have in recent weeks made clear that they want a nod from Biden before accelerating production, in part to give them cover with shareholders. 
“The energy industry doesn't have a permitting problem,” said Aaron Weiss, a deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, which is conducting its own analysis of federal drilling permits. “It has a financing problem.”

(Reuters) - Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB is expected to forecast strong sales growth for 2022 when it reports results on Wednesday as health-conscious consumers consistently turn to the company's plant-based milk, a contrast to the demand slowdown seen by Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND).
Many restaurants and retailers have partnered with Oatly in recent months to offer vegan options to customers. One of the biggest boosts has, however, come from a U.S. oatmilk supply agreement with  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). 
As a result, Wall Street's sentiment on Oatly has become more favorable than that on alternative meat maker  Beyond Meat Inc , which has seen its sales growth fizzle through the pandemic for a number of reasons.
""Beyond Meat has not meaningfully expanded distribution in the U.S. over the past year or so ... Oatly's sales growth is currently being driven by expanded distribution,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.
CONTEXT
Oatly is expecting to provide 85% to 90% of Starbucks oatmilk needs in 2022. Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson said late last year performance of Oatly's oatmilk at the coffee chain exceeded expectations.
About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20, according to U.S. National Library of Medicine's MedlinePlus, making alternative milk a must-buy product for many of them.
Oatly said in November it had opened its first production facility in Ma'anshan, China, just a few months after opening its first Asian factory in Singapore, signaling its margins would improve by bringing more production in-house. 
FUNDAMENTALS
Analysts project Oatly to record a near 58% increase in revenue for 2022, with loss also shrinking from 2021 levels. In contrast, Beyond Meat's revenue is expected to rise only 27%. 
Graphic: Oatly usurps Beyond Meat as Wall Street's alternative food darling: https://graphics.reuters.com/OATLY-RESULTS/xmvjoeqlbpr/chart.png 
Oatly has the second highest projected revenue growth among its food and beverage growth peers, only behind energy drink maker  Celsius Holdings  (NASDAQ:CELH) Inc, according to brokerage Piper Sandler.
Still, Oatly will need to overcome potential mechanical and automation issues during its production ramp up as well as broader supply-chain disruptions to ensure demand for its milk, ice cream and yogurt converts into sales.
Revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to rise 2% sequentially, despite recalling a few products and discarding less than one million liters of inventory due to a quality issue in November.
WALL STREET SENTIMENT

** Around 68% of analysts rate Oatly ""buy"" or higher, compared with just 10% for Beyond Meat.
** Oatly's current mean price target implies an upside of 136% to Monday's close, versus Beyond Meat's 25%.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google is buying cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc for $5.4 billion in a deal that could trigger a ""ripple effect"" as cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also ramp up efforts to fortify the fast-growing business.
A shift to remote working during the pandemic, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has fueled a spike in cyberattacks and bolstered demand for security software, a market expected to more than double to $352.25 billion by 2026 from 2020, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), according to news reports, was also a suitor for Mandiant, which has emerged as a go-to for companies investigating cyberattacks, including recent breaches at News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. 
""This is just the beginning of what we're going to see in terms of cybersecurity acquisitions for all the big cloud firms,"" Jeff Pollard, principal analyst at  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR), said.
The deal will enhance Google's cloud computing business, which generates more than $19 billion annually, and beef up its security operations and advisory services.
Google's $23 per share offer represents a premium of about 53% to Mandiant's stock price levels before reports emerged of Microsoft eyeing a deal. Mandiant shares were down 3% in morning trading on Tuesday, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) edged up 0.5%.
Mandiant, which focuses on cyber-incident response and cybersecurity testing, became a standalone entity last year after acquirer FireEye (NASDAQ:MNDT) Inc sold its products business and the FireEye name for $1.2 billion to a consortium led by private equity firm Symphony Technology Group.

""The capital necessary for Mandiant to succeed as a standalone cybersecurity business was going to require an external entity or an acquisition,"" Pollard added. 
""It would have been really capital intensive for the company to compete with larger firms having a similar set of capabilities.""

China says Hong Kong must stick to ""dynamic zero"" COVID strategy
A top Chinese health official rallied embattled Hong Kong on Tuesday to stick with a ""dynamic zero"" coronavirus strategy and warned that the city's ""lifeline"" health system was at risk and the situation had to be turned around as soon as possible.
Hong Kong reported more than 43,100 new cases on Tuesday after the launch of an online platform for people to record infections in a surge that has seen the city suffering the most deaths globally per million people in the week to March 6, according to the Our World in Data publication.
China has championed the ""dynamic zero"" strategy that involves stamping out infections with strict mitigation measures as opposed to the approach adopted in other places of relying on high vaccination rates and moderate mitigation like masks in an effort to ""live with COVID"". [nL2N2VB099] 
Scientists identify new gene differences in severe COVID patients
Scientists have pinpointed 16 new genetic variants in people who developed severe COVID-19 in a large study published on Monday that could help researchers develop treatments for very sick patients.
The results suggest that people with severe COVID have genes that predispose them to one of two problems: failure to limit the ability of the virus to make copies of itself, or excessive inflammation and blood clotting.
The scientists said their discoveries, published in the journal Nature, could help prioritise the likely treatments that could work against the disease. [nL3N2VA2H9] 
COVID can cause brain shrinkage, memory loss - study
COVID-19 can cause the brain to shrink, reduce grey matter in the regions that control emotion and memory, and damage areas that control the sense of smell, an Oxford University study has found.
The scientists said that the effects were even seen in people who had not been hospitalised with COVID, and whether the impact could be partially reversed or if they would persist in the long term needed further investigation. [nL3N2VB144] 
Florida breaks with CDC, recommends no COVID vaccine for healthy children
Florida's top health official said on Monday the state would recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children, breaking with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In announcing the move during press briefing convened by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the state's surgeon general Dr. Joseph Lapado cited studies that showed few COVID fatalities among healthy children and elevated risk among young boys receiving the vaccine of side effects such as myocarditis.

Malaysia to reopen borders from April with quarantine waiver
Malaysia will reopen its borders fully from April 1 and allow entry without quarantine for visitors vaccinated against COVID-19, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Tuesday.
Malaysia has since March 2020 maintained some of the tightest entry curbs in Asia to try to contain coronavirus outbreaks, with most foreign nationals barred from entry and returning Malaysians required to undergo quarantine. [nL2N2VB0MG]

Investing.com --  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) rose over 7% Tuesday after Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, increasing the price target to $260 per share from $215.
The analyst told investors in a note that his prior Hold rating reflected “constrained capex and ESG themes in both mining and oil and gas markets,” which account for around 40% of Caterpillar revenue.
However, the analyst now believes the “recent turmoil in Eastern Europe fundamentally reshapes global commodity markets, driving structurally higher pricing and after years of underinvestment capacity additions and supply diversification will be necessary in both mining and oil & gas sectors, though new projects will take time.”
Volkmann went on to say that he also sees Deere (NYSE:DE) outperforming as Russia will ""likely be mostly locked out of global commodity markets for the foreseeable future, and capacity for mined, energy and ag commodities will have to be expanded elsewhere to compensate.”
“To be clear, we don't expect much change in commodity market spending in the near- term,"" he explained, adding that they are pegging the company's earnings power at $25 per share ""over the next several years."" "

LONDON (Reuters) - From European banks to the Polish zloty, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has triggered massive price falls as well as a number of winners in assets that investors are racing to stock up on.
Commodity prices are soaring, defence stocks are benefiting from higher security spending pledges and emerging market investors are finding refuge in Latin America. With the world still awash with pandemic-era cheap cash, many assets are displaying eye-catching moves.
Below is a list of some of the winners. All price moves are since Feb. 24, the day of Russia's invasion. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation"".
COMMODITY SHARES
A 30% jump in oil prices since Moscow sent troops and tanks into Ukraine has turbocharged the shares of energy producers. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas index has risen 14%, and some individual energy companies have gained far more. 
Graphic: Commodity prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgaqedvb/commod%20prices.PNG 
Russia's large role in metals has driven even bigger jumps in other commodities. 
It supplies about 10% of global nickel, and concern about Russian supplies and a short squeeze have sent London three-month nickel prices up four-fold since the invasion to a record above $100,000-a-tonne. That prompted the London Metal Exchange to halt trading on Tuesday.
Russia and Ukraine together account for about 29% of global wheat exports, and 19% of corn exports. Chicago wheat futures have jumped 40% to 14-year highs.
The S&P GSCI, a composite index of commodity sector returns, has risen 24% since Feb. 24 and stands 9% off record highs hit in 2008.
Commodity trading firms are booming too. Shares in Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) are up 15%, and in Archer-Daniels-Midland 13% higher, while agribusiness  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) has gained 11%. 
COMMODITY CURRENCIES
Currencies of commodity-exporting nations are outperforming. 
The Australian and the New Zealand dollars are up nearly 1% since the invasion. 
Those moves are striking because both currencies typically struggle when global market sentiment deteriorates and traders tend to scramble for safer assets, such as the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar, which are also strong. 
Graphic: G10 FX performance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mypmnxqrgvr/fx%20performance.PNG 
The Norwegian crown, lifted by rising prices of Norway's major export, oil, has risen 2.7% versus the euro.
Emerging market currencies tend to weaken in the face of a robust dollar, but those of resource-rich South Africa and Brazil have also performed well. 
SUN AND WIND
The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Clean Energy Index has gained 14.6% since the invasion on a bet Western countries will push harder to wean themselves off fossil fuels.
Wind energy suppliers Nordex and Vestas Wind have risen around 50%. Citi reckons many European companies could see sharp revenue upgrades if Germany meets its wind energy expansion plans.
Invesco's Solar ETF has climbed 31%. 
DEFENCE AND CYBER
Manufacturers of jets, missiles and radar are big gainers after several European countries, notably Germany, pledged to spend more on defence.
Since Feb. 24, arms companies dominate the list of the top-performers in the MSCI World index, led by 60%-80% gains for German military sensor maker Hensoldt and armoured vehicle manufacturer Rheinmetall.
U.S. firm Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) - the manufacturer of Stinger missiles that Western allies are dispatching to Ukraine - is up around 15%.
The SPDR S&P Aerospace and Defence ETF is 11% higher. 
Graphic: Defence ETF: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdpxokjzqvx/Pasted%20image%201646746894016.png 
The Global X Cybersecurity ETF, which includes Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), has gained 9%. 
""Cyber is one of our preferred long-term themes and that's been borne out further with this crisis,"" said Kiran Ganesh, at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
He said many sustainably-focused investors usually exclude defence shares but ""it's a debate the industry needs to have... many would argue that security is a social good too.""
INTO LATAM
Investors are heading into Latin American markets, commodity-heavy and more insulated from the Russian fallout than other emerging markets.
Data from the Institute of International Finance shows Latin American markets received $8.7 billion of investment inflows and Asian emerging economies took in $6.8 billion over February. 
Graphic: Latam stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaqyyvo/Pasted%20image%201646747493067.png 
The MSCI Latin America index is higher versus pre-invasion levels, while its materials sub-index has jumped 16% since Feb. 24.
""The commodity factor - whether agri commods or metals is supporting capital flows to LatAm,"" said Jeremy Schwartz, chief investment officer at asset manager WisdomTree.
INFLATION PROTECTION
As the commodity surge threatens to lift inflation even further, inflation-linked bonds have proved a winner, especially in the euro zone where they have returned 7% since the invasion, BofA's index shows. 

The rally is most dramatic in short-dated 'linkers' with the yield on Germany's two-year issue down 190 basis points since the invasion.

Investing.com -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) intends to acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant Inc (NASDAQ:MNDT) in a deal worth approximately $5.4 billion, the company announced Tuesday. 
Google will pay $23 per share for Mandiant in a move it says is to protect against risks facing its Google Cloud customers. Mandiant will join Google Cloud once the deal goes through.
""The acquisition of Mandiant will complement Google Cloud’s existing strengths in security,"" Google stated.
Mandiant — founded in 2004 — is publicly traded. Its shares are down 3.4% Tuesday after a 16% gain Monday following initial reports of the deal.
“Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. 
“We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help customers address their most important security challenges,"" he added.
If the deal gains approval, it will be Google’s second-largest acquisition behind its $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility in 2012.
Google's parent company Alphabet Inc has declined 0.2% Tuesday."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd expects airfares will need to rise to cover the cost of higher fuel prices as its oil hedging contracts expire, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Qantas has hedged 90% of its fuel needs through the end of June and 50% in the following quarter, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. 
""(Hedging) gives us time to react to that higher fuel price,"" he said at a conference hosted by The Australian Financial Review. ""If we stay at these levels, airfares are going to have to go up.""
Oil prices, which touched 14-year highs on Monday, see-sawed on Tuesday as the United States considered acting alone to ban Russian oil imports rather than teaming up with allies in Europe.
Qantas shares were steady in afternoon trade on Tuesday, following an 8% fall on Monday.
Joyce said based on current oil prices, Qantas would need to raise revenue per available seat kilometre - an industry measure mixing fares and the percentage of seats filled - by 7%.
""Seven percent is not massive but it will have an impact on some levels of travel out there,"" he said.
Joyce said domestic leisure travel demand had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but business travel demand was lagging.

Demand for international flights was strong in key destinations, with demand for tickets between Australia and London and Australia and Los Angeles higher than before the pandemic, he said.
Jefferies analyst Anthony Moulder said in a note to clients that Qantas was well positioned to raise fares and to slow capacity additions in response to higher oil prices.

""Given the ongoing situation Ferrari has taken the decision to suspend the production of vehicles for the Russian market until further notice,"" the Italian company said in a statement.
""We continue to monitor the situation closely and will always respect all rules, regulations and sanctions,"" it said.
Ferrari adds to a number of companies, including carmakers, other manufacturers and luxury goods groups, that have taken action to limit, put on hold or exit business activities in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Rival sports car maker Lamborghini, a unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said on Tuesday it had put on hold its business with Russia.
Last week Ferrari said Russia was a very small market for it and that it did not see any impact on its supply chain at the moment as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

717,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 10:14AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese airline ANA Holdings Inc plans to launch a new international low-cost carrier in late 2023 or early 2024, joining its rival Japan Airlines Co in a bet on a revival in tourism as the impact of the COVID pandemic fades.
ANA said on Tuesday the carrier, Air Japan, would fly mid-range international flights to Asia-Pacific destinations, without disclosing planned routes. ANA already has a separate low cost carrier (LCC), Peach Aviation, which flies domestic routes as well as to a handful of short-haul Asian destinations.
The launch plan comes as airlines around the world have been hammered by the collapse in international travel triggered by the pandemic, and are now grappling with uncertainty and higher fuel costs sparked by the crisis in Ukraine. 
Air Japan will fly to destinations more than four hours from its base at Tokyo's Narita airport to differentiate itself from Peach, said Hideki Mineguchi, Air Japan President, speaking during a news conference.
""The new brand (Air Japan) is a new model that combines the best aspects of full service and LCC in terms of offering affordable prices,"" Mineguchi said. The carrier didn't disclose details but said Air Japan customers will be able to pay more for some services on top of the ticket price.
The carrier would rebrand Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 airplanes with around 300 seats that ANA has used for international flights.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) customers would be families and students in Asia who want to visit Japan, as well as those who live in Japan wanting to travel to Asian countries on a budget once the pandemic is over, Mineguchi said.
Air Japan had been aiming to commence services by the financial year beginning next month at the earliest, but was forced to delay the start due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan Airlines founded its low cost carrier for mid-range international travel, Zip Air, in 2018.
The launch plans comes amid signs the outlook for tourism is brightening in Asia.
The Indonesian resort island of Bali this week welcomed its first foreign tourists under relaxed coronavirus rules that don't require quarantine, similar to programmes already in place in Thailand and the Philippines.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia faces further economic sanctions, as European officials prepared to meet on Tuesday to debate new restrictions, and more investors withdrew from the country.
The European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus designed to hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians and three Belarusian banks, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The draft sanctions were adopted by the EU executive early on Tuesday and will be discussed by EU ambassadors at a meeting later in the day, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity.
The package, provided it is endorsed by the ambassadors, will ban three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system and add several oligarchs and Russian lawmakers to the EU blacklist, the sources told Reuters.
They said the package also proposes bans on exports of naval equipment and of software from the EU to Russia and gives guidance on the monitoring of cryptocurrencies to avoid their use to circumvent EU sanctions.
At the same time, lenders and investors have continued to cut their ties with Russia, with British asset manager and insurer M&G the latest to describe the country as uninvestable.
The company's Russian assets have been marked down to almost zero, and CEO John Foley said it had no plans to buy more.
""Russia is an uninvestable market from a ratings perspective. Any additional investment is clearly unthinkable,"" he said.
Britain's finance ministry has met asset managers to explore how the sector could offload holdings in Russian companies that face sanctions, the Investment Association said on Tuesday.
Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said he believed Britain's insurers and the wider financial sector would be able to absorb the impact of sanctions. 
Britain has banned Russian companies from the multi-billion dollar aviation and space insurance market, and some Russian banks are being sanctioned and disconnected from SWIFT. 
""We looked very carefully at whether we think these are manageable in terms of any collateral damage or impact on the UK financial services sector, and so far we are comfortable that they are,"" Woods told an upper house committee.
Ukrainian civilians began leaving two besieged areas on Tuesday after Russia opened ""humanitarian corridors"" for them, but Kyiv said Russian forces had shelled an evacuation route from the port city of Mariupol.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, describing its actions as a ""special military operation"". 
Since then, at least five commercial ships have been hit by projectiles and London’s marine insurance market has widened the area of waters around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that it deems high risk.
The euro zone banking share index made a 6.3% gain, as it recovered from 13-month lows on Monday.
Bank stocks had fallen sharply as investors prepared for the conflict's economic cost, with lenders with operations in Russia - including Austria's Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) - the hardest hit.

They staged a double-digit rebound on Tuesday. Raiffeisen gained 13% and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Societe Generale 10%, recouping some of their earlier falls.

""The markets are extremely treacherous at the moment,"" Troy Rohrbaugh explained at an investor conference. ""There is a lot of uncertainty. There are a lot of clients that are under extreme stress. That creates potentially very significant counterparty risk exposure.""
Turbulence stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war and related sanctions from western nations has spread across commodities especially but also through fixed income and equity markets, he said.

""It is broad-based, but clearly relating to sanctions, whether it be sanctioned counterparties, sanctioned products, unwinds,"" he said. 
JPMorgan had said last month that markets revenue would likely be down about 10% from a year earlier. Rohrbaugh said that the outlook had proven true through this past Friday.

The carmaker has paid for licences for 2G and 3G patents, but has been using 4G technology in its cars for the past two years without the appropriate licence, Acer claimed.

In order to settle the dispute, Volkswagen struck an agreement for 4G patents with patent pool Avanci, a consortium of companies which cross-license patents relating to a particular technology, also used by Mercedes-Benz and BMW as well as Volkswagen's brands Porsche and Audi.

(Reuters) -The British franchisee of pizza chain Domino's is expecting more cost inflation this year and has hedged itself against wheat prices which have soared in response to the conflict in Ukraine, it said on Tuesday.
Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Group Plc, a franchisee of U.S.-based Domino's Pizza Inc, sources its wheat from the UK and Germany, and is hedged against wheat price inflation for the majority of 2022, Chief Executive Dominic Paul said in an interview.
Russia and Ukraine account for 29% of the world's wheat exports and their conflict has driven wheat prices to multi-year highs on supply concerns.
""We buy (wheat) in scale, which means we already have good, strong relationships with our key suppliers,"" Paul said. ""I think we are better able than most to mitigate some of those inflationary pressures.""
The chain was already hedged against wheat price inflation prior to the Ukraine conflict, and has continued that strategy, Paul said.
Domino's Pizza also unveiled a 46 million-pound ($60 million) share buyback programme. It reported a 12.5% higher annual profit, helped by a marketing campaign that boosted post-lockdown sales.
The company's media and TV ad campaign, targeting families and friends reuniting after coronavirus lockdowns, as well as England reaching the final of soccer's European Championship in July, helped boost orders, Domino's said.
The pizza company also said 2022 earnings should fall in line with current market expectations, adding that its first-quarter trading had ""started well"".

PARIS (Reuters) -French food group Danone targets 3-5% annual sales growth over three years and will step up investment in its brands and part with non-performing assets under a fresh strategy outlined by new chief Antoine de Saint-Affrique on Tuesday.
Saint-Affrique, who took over as the chief executive of the world's largest yoghurt maker in September, must conduct his revival plan amid mounting input costs, coupled with further uncertainties caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has forced Danone to suspend investments in Russia.
Danone's brands include Activia yoghurt, Evian and Badoit water as well as Aptamil baby formula. 
The ""Renew Danone"" plan is ""all about creating the conditions for sustainable and competitive growth and then delivering consistently in a way that creates value for all,"" Saint-Affrique told investors meting in Evian, near the French Alps.
While ""there is nothing wrong"" with Danone's three businesses - dairy and plant-based products, infant formula and bottled water - the key to stoke sales growth was to improve execution, invest sufficiently behind worthy brands and innovation and part with underperforming assets in those businesses.
""There will be no sacred cows, there will be no taboos,"" Saint-Affrique said.
About 25% of Danone's sales come from businesses that were underperforming.""So, we will fix them or sell them,"" he added.
The Chinese water brand Mizone has been one of these challenged brands though it returned to growth in 2021. Danone was also looking at how to fix its business in Morocco.
Danone announced on Sunday that it is suspending investments in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine but would continue to operate its dairy and baby food business there. Saint-Affrique said it is working on plans to mitigate the impact of sanctions there and ""all options are on the table"".
MARGIN RESET FOR 2022
The food giant said it would reinvest all of the 700 million euros ($761.04 million) of Local First savings in 2022. It targets a productivity higher than last year's 5% and a low to mid-teens level of input cost inflation against 8% last year.
As a result, Danone expects its operating profit margin to decline to more than 12% of sales in 2022 from 13.7% in 2021, with like-for-like sales growth in a range of 3% to 5% against 3.4% in the year-ago period.
By 1409 GMT Danone shares were up 0.4%, having erased earlier losses.
""Announcement on the portfolio rotation is clearly good news. Guidance for 2022 is with no surprise despite the fact a part of the consensus will have to revise down,"" Oddo analysts said in a note. The consensus forecast a 2022 margin of 13.5%.
For the 2023-2024 period, Danone set a goal for ""profitable growth"" and said it targeted like-for-like sales growth between 3% and 5% with a recurring operating income growing faster than like-for-like net sales.
Under the plan, Danone will selectively expand in terms of segments, channels and geographies and seek bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures, with a portfolio rotation reaching around 10% of net sales and an annual capital expenditures enveloppe equivalent to up to 4.5% of net sales.

Saint-Affrique replaced Emmanuel Faber, who was abruptly ousted as chairman and CEO last year following clashes with some board members over strategy and calls from activist funds for him to resign over the group's lacklustre returns compared with some rivals.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Tuesday as the news of an imminent U.S. ban on Russian energy imports kept the financial cost of the Ukraine war at the front of the market's mind.
President Joe Biden is due to make an announcement at 10:45 AM ET on ""Actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine"" according to a White House briefing sheet. Various reports indicate that Biden intends an immediate stop to U.S. imports of Russian crude, refined products and coal.

Soaring prices for other commodities, both industrial and agricultural, are fueling fears of sustained inflation and a global economic slowdown.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eked out a gain of 21 points, less than 0.1%, to 32,839 points. That follows a drop of over 2.3% on Monday. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%.
Precise details of the planned actions weren't immediately available. The measures are unlikely to bring about a total halt to Russian energy exports: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday that his country would continue to buy energy from Russia as there were no short-term alternatives available. The EU is set to outline a wide-ranging plan for a rapid reduction in its reliance on Russian energy later Tuesday, however.
The U.S. imported less than half a million barrels of oil a day on average from Russia in 2021, or less than one-tenth of what it imports from Canada and Mexico. However, Russia was the largest source of gasoline imports into the U.S. last year.  The news comes at a time when gasoline prices across the U.S. are at their highest ever (they averaged $4.17 a gallon on Monday, according to the American Automobile Association).
Among individual movers, Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock stood out with a 6% gain as investors encouraged by Monday's profit outlook upgrade took advantage of the shift in market momentum to buy the dip. The stock had hit a 19-month low during Monday's rout. 
Electric vehicle stocks also remained under pressure after extreme volatility in the nickel market illustrated the risks associated with shutting Russia - one of the the world's biggest producers - out of the market. Nickel is an essential metal for the current generation of batteries, and Monday's 80%+ rise in futures prices would put another couple of thousand dollars on the price of every EV if it were sustained. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.3%, while Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock fell 1.7%. Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rose 0.4% but struggled to pull away from the record low it posted at the outbreak of the war."

Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree, which is valued at roughly $31 billion, is expanding the size of its board to 12 people and is seating Richard Dreiling, a former Dollar General chief executive, as executive chairman. Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal will join the board as vice chair.
Five current directors, including the CEO, are staying and another five people independent of Mantle Ridge will also join. Dollar Tree is also adding a new finance committee and restructuring existing committees to create a new committee to focus on Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility.
""Dollar Tree has a powerful legacy to build on in the years ahead,"" CEO Michael Witynski said in a statement.
The settlement comes at a time when several retailers, including Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) are facing activist investors who are pushing management to consider alternatives including possible sales.
Mantle Ridge, which owns 5.7% of Dollar Tree's common stock and ranks as its third-largest investor, sought to take over the entire board when it nominated 11 directors in December, arguing that the company's stock price was lagging and to push for a review of the retailer's business strategy. 
Mantle Ridge has an economic interest of 9.85%, including 4.19% in cash-settled derivatives.
Dollar Tree's share price is roughly flat this year while the S&P 500 General Merchandise Stores Index has climbed 22%.
In premarket trading, shares climbed 1.5%, signaling investors welcome the settlement.
Dollar Tree traditionally sold items for one dollar but said last year that it would raise prices of most goods to $1.25 by
the end of April in the wake of spiraling freight costs and
other COVID-19 pandemic-driven challenges.

The retailer faced off against another activist investment firm in 2019 when Starboard Value urged it to consider raising its prices.
For Mantle Ridge's Hilal, this marks the third time he has won board seats at a target company since founding his firm in 2016. Both railroad CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) and food services company Aramark appointed new chief executives soon after Mantle Ridge began pushing for changes.

(Reuters) - Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) are among U.S. apparel brands likely to be worst hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which is again clogging supply chains in Europe where they derive at least a quarter of sales, Wall Street analysts say.
American clothes firms' European businesses were just recovering from two years of pandemic restrictions. But war-related Western sanctions on Moscow, airspace bans and shipping route changes have put new squeezes on East-West supply chains. 
""Cargo checks are now one of the biggest disruptions to shippers, making sure they are not breaking sanctions at ports in the EU (European Union) and the UK,"" said Jane Hali, CEO of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates.
Analysts see particular exposure to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH (NYSE:PVH), Levi Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), who get roughly 25%-40% of sales from Europe.

""Europe is definitely going to feel the brunt of the economic damage ... which will impact consumer sentiment and consumer wallets,"" CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring said on the fallout for apparel retailers.
DOWNGRADES
Due to the war, Wedbush analysts have reduced yearly revenue growth estimates by anywhere from 100 to 400 basis points for Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN). and at least eight U.S.-based companies including Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX) Inc and Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd. 
The brokerage also downgraded ratings on PVH and Ralph Lauren's stock to ""neutral"" from ""outperform,"" while reducing Nike's price target.
Adding to sales pressures, numerous brands have also halted operations in Russia altogether in protest or because of the newly-difficult operating environment. Chinese manufacturers had been sending more goods to Europe by rail across Russia.

Companies with a smaller European presence, such as Carter's (NYSE:CRI) Inc, Bath & Body Works Inc and Kate Spade-owner Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc, are likely to be more insulated, analysts said, but the challenge remains sector-wide.

731,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 08:26AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Shell stopped buying Russian crude on Tuesday and said it would phase out its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons from oil to natural gas over Ukraine, becoming one of the first major Western oil companies to abandon Russia entirely.
While Russian crude and gas has been exempt so far from Western sanctions, oil soared above $139 a barrel on Monday to its highest since July 2008 as the United States and European allies began to consider banning Russian oil imports.
U.S. lawmakers have called for bans but President Joe Biden's administration has only sanctioned Russian oil tankers. Britain and Canada have also barred Russian vessels from landing at their ports in protest at Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shell (LON:RDSa) apologised on Tuesday for buying Russian oil last week after it had said it would pull out of its Russian operations, including the Sakhalin 2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake and which is operated by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil ... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said.
Shell bought a cargo of Russian crude oil from Swiss trader Trafigura at a record low of dated Brent minus $28.50 a barrel, traders said on Friday.
British rival BP (NYSE:BP) said last month it was abandoning its 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft in an abrupt move that could cost it up to $25 billion.
TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Monday that the French company had stopped buying oil from Russia, although one its landlocked refineries in Germany continued to receive Russian crude by pipeline.
Shell said it would change its crude oil supply chain to remove volumes from Russia ""as fast as possible"" and shut its service stations in Russia, as well as its aviation fuels and lubricants operations in the country.

The company said the supply chain change could take weeks to complete and would lead to reduced output from some of its refineries while its withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be phased.
The company also plans to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which it helped finance as a part of a consortium.

Investing.com – Shell ADR (NYSE:SHEL) traded 1% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company decided to stop buying any crude or gas from Russia, saying it will withdraw completely from any involvement in the communist country’s hydrocarbons over its invasion of Ukraine.
The company had attracted much flak last week over buying a cargo of Russian crude. Faced with rising criticism then, it went on to commit its profits from any Russian oil purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
“We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil ... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said.
Shell last week said it would exit all its Russian operations, including the flagship Sakhalin-2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake, and which is 50% owned and operated by Russia’s Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
But it was still one of the few Western companies to have continued buying crude oil from Russia since the conflict in Ukraine escalated.
Shell said it will, “as fast as possible,” change its crude oil supply chain to remove Russian volumes and shut its service stations, and aviation fuels, and lubricants operations in Russia.
The company also plans to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which it helped fund as a part of a consortium.

MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish law passed last year forcing food delivery companies to contract their couriers as staff has caused a labour shortage as many prefer to remain self-employed and work for rivals that flout the regulation, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats said on Tuesday. 
The Spanish branch of Uber's online food delivery platform published on Tuesday an open letter to the Labour Ministry complaining that the contracts it offered to freelance 'riders' failed to retain enough of them to assure its services.
""Our fleets of collaborators can't find enough couriers because these prefer to be self-employed to work with Glovo,... the only company that allows it, against the Rider Law,"" Uber Eats said, referring to the May 2021 decree demanding firms grant formal work contracts to protect gig-economy workers.
A spokesperson for Glovo said the company, which has been taken over by Germany's Delivery Heros, did not break any law and said it had taken steps to ensure it complied.
The Uber Eats letter fuels a European controversy over the legal status of the thousands of cyclists who criss-cross city centres with oversized branded backpacks, and who generally lack benefits such as minimum wage, paid holidays and pension rights. 
The European Commission in December recommended other EU countries follow Spain's lead, a move that is long overdue, according to unions, but which firms say may lead to job losses. 
The Labour Ministry said it demanded all platforms abide by the new law. ""The majority of digital platforms respect this rule,"" the ministry said, without mentioning any names of firms that did not adhere to the rules.

The Spanish decree, backed by trade unions and business associations, was met with scepticism by several riders associations and labour experts who said the new legislation did not completely resolve the legal situation of the couriers.
Uber Eats said couriers preferred the flexibility to focus on lucrative rush hours they enjoy as self-employed than the better social protection work contracts offered, but which also came with requirements to work at other less lucrative times.

(Reuters) - Office rental company IWG said it would merge its digital assets with flexible workspace platform The Instant Group, as office space providers benefit from the hybrid work trend, sending the London-listed firm's shares sharply higher.
IWG's decision comes at a time when office landlords are slowly recovering as tenants reassess their options following the COVID-19 pandemic, including a shift to a permanent hybrid model, in which employees split work between home and office.
""We are merging our digital business with a company, which is serving the rest of the industry, to achieve a high growth rate and give more focus to the digital platform for the broader industry,"" IWG Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon told Reuters in a interview.
Shares of IWG rose as much as 15% to 267.5 pence and the stock was among the top percentage gainers on the FSTE 250 index.
IWG's digital assets offer services including platforms to book office spaces, while the London-headquartered The Instant Group caters to the flexible workspace market, with presence in 18 countries globally.
IWG will invest about 270 million pounds ($353.65 million) to buy the stakes of selling shareholders, while The Instant Group's management will invest about 50 million pounds into the combined business, which is expected to be spun out by 2023-end through a listing either in the United States or UK.
The London-listed owner of the Spaces and Regus brands, IWG said it expected the deal to be earnings-accretive in the first full year of ownership.
Dixon said the consensus as of now was for a return to strong profitability in 2022.
The Switzerland-headquartered firm, which operates in more than 3,300 locations across 120 countries, posted a loss before tax from continuing operations of 259.4 million pounds for 2021, compared with a loss of 613.3 million pounds a year earlier.
The CEO said Ukraine and Russia account for only 7 million pounds each of the group's overall annual revenue of nearly 2.5 billion pounds, adding that its centres in the countries were operational wherever possible.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's biggest utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) is ready to dust off plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in southern Italy as Rome steps up its efforts to find alternative supplies to replace Russian gas.
The plan will form part of Italian efforts to wean itself off Russian gas. Italy aims to become independent of Russian gas imports within 24-30 months, Energy Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani said on Tuesday.
In comments to Reuters on Tuesday Enel said it would be useful for Italy to have two additional LNG terminals so as to be less tied to gas pipelines.
""For this reason, Enel has given availability to resume the Porto Empedocle LNG plant project, that is fully permitted,"" an Enel spokesperson said.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Italy has ramped up efforts to secure alternative gas sources, with LNG-rich Qatar a particular focus of attention.
Industry sources said to build a plant like Porto Empedocle in southern Sicily, originally designed to have a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres per year, could take more than three years.
""At the start of the year they had canceled this (Porto Empedocle) project because it was unsustainable. Now they've resurrected it,"" Sicily energy manager Daniela Baglieri told Reuters.
Italy’s byzantine permitting process has virtually stopped development of LNG facilities beyond the three plants currently operative and which now account for around 20% of daily imports.
RACE AGAINST TIME
Italy, which uses gas to generate some 40% of electricity, imports more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian piped flows accounting for around 40%. 
It has other pipeline connections to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya and the North Sea. But while the pipelines are underused, analysts say the problem is the lack of gas to fill them because of chronic underinvestment in recent years.
World demand for gas could rise if sanctions against Russia are extended to include oil or Russia opts to cut supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany.
Given the time needed to boost upstream gas production, Rome is keen to expand LNG infrastructure and is looking to find at least one floating terminal, or FSRU.
On Tuesday Cingolani said Italy planned to install a new FSRU by the middle of this year.
A source familiar with the matter said energy group Eni and gas infrastructure group Snam had been asked to help out on the logistics including looking for the FSRU to charter.
""Competition is hot. Italy, Germany and at least one other European country are in the market looking for FSRUs,"" the source said.
European countries are seeking to build LNG facilities to reduce their reliance on Russian gas. On Saturday Germany unveiled plans for a terminal.
Eni and Snam declined to comment. 

Snam, which runs most of Italy's gas storage business, has stakes in all three LNG terminals operating in Italy. Eni has an extensive worldwide LNG business.
The Italian state is the largest shareholder in Eni, Snam and Enel.

LONDON (Reuters) -Saving up for a new ride? Better start putting more cash aside.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ramping up the price of metals used in cars, from aluminium in the bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters to the high-grade nickel in electric vehicle batteries, and drivers are likely to foot the bill.
While metals have not been the target of Western sanctions yet, some shippers and autoparts suppliers are already steering clear of Russian goods, putting more pressure on carmakers already reeling from a chip shortage and higher energy prices.
""So what happens from here?"" asked Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, the world's fourth-biggest automaker, when speaking to reporters last week. 
""First, what happens is that we have an escalation of cost that comes from raw materials and energy that is going to put more pressure on the business model,"" he said.
Aluminium and palladium both hit record highs on Monday while nickel, which is also used to make stainless steel, crossed the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time ever on Tuesday.
Andreas Weller, chief executive of Aludyne, which makes aluminium and magnesium die-cast parts for automakers, said his European business has seen a 60% rise in the cost of aluminium over the past four months, as well as soaring energy bills.
With annual sales of $1.2 billion and a surge of costs in the ""hundreds of millions of dollars"", Weller, whose company is based in Southfield, Michigan, said he has been forced to ask customers to pay more than the prices already agreed.
""Some are more understanding and cooperative than others, but we cannot survive without that,"" Weller, who has four foundries and one machining plant in Europe, told Reuters. 
Stellantis chief executive Tavares said an end to the chip shortage could help carmakers offset higher metal and energy prices, but he did not expect any resolution to the semiconductor issues this year.
'WE QUIT'
Consumers are already paying for the chip shortage as it has pushed car inventories down and prices up - even before higher metals prices feed through to the forecourt.
According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the United States was $44,460 in February, up 18.5% from the same month in 2021.
German carmakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have already been hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as it has forced makers of wire harnesses in the west of the country to halt production. A wire harness is a vital set of parts which neatly bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car - and Ukraine is a key supplier.
And when it comes to metals, Russia companies are major suppliers to Germany. In 2020, they accounted for 44% of Germany's nickel imports, 41% of its titanium, a third of its iron, and 18% of its palladium.
With production of 108 million tonnes last year, Russia is the world's fifth-largest producer of iron ore, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), supplying European steelmakers who now face higher prices and possible difficulties procuring the metal. Austria's Voestalpine and Sweden's SSAB are both exposed to this risk, according to U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Voestalpine said it had enough inventory for the coming months, but expected it would have to source raw materials from other suppliers thereafter. SSAB did not respond to a request for comment about supplies from Russia.
Faced with the choice of buying Russian goods and indirectly funding Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, Germany steel and aluminium supplier Voss Edelstahlhandel has decided to draw the line. 
""Even though aluminium is not on the sanctions list, it is used by Russia to get money into the country and therefore we quit,"" Chief Executive Thorsten Studemund told Reuters. 
Russia is a big manufacturer of aluminium, the most energy-intensive metal to produce, accounting for 6% of global output.
'BATTERY MINERAL WOES'
Studemund's company has also been contending with high prices for nickel.
Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at specialist consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), said that while Russia accounts for 5% of global nickel production, it supplies about 20% of the world's high-grade nickel.
The metal is used to make batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), posing a fresh challenge for carmakers already investing billions to move away for combustion engines just as demand for zero-emission models is starting to take off.
Some of Russia's high-grade nickel will probably end up in China, which is unlikely to impose sanctions on Russia, but this all comes at a time when carmakers are facing rising bills for other EV battery minerals as demand outstrips supply.
""That's the main concern for the battery supply chain in that you've got record high lithium prices, and very, very high cobalt and nickel prices,"" Rawles said. ""This is just adding to battery mineral woes."" 
Batteries are one the most expensive components in EVs and automakers have been hoping they will become cheaper so they can offer more affordable electric cars.
BMW said it was focusing as much as possible on recycling battery nickel, with up to 50% scrap nickel used in the high-voltage battery of its new BMW iX model.
When it comes to palladium, carmakers are also in a bind.
The auto industry uses it in catalytic converters for gasoline models - or platinum for diesel models - both of which still make up the vast majority of car sales.
Palladium prices have been rising for about six years and Russia accounts for about 40% of the global market.
""There is no other option beyond palladium and platinum for catalytic converters, and you can't build a car without a catalytic converter,"" said Chris Blasi, chief executive of precious metals dealer Neptune Global.
He said he bought a lot of palladium in December at $1,940 an ounce. On Monday, it hit a record $3,440. 

Blasi estimated that the value of the palladium used in the average car is about $200, but that could easily double.
""Either consumers will pay more for cars, or if automakers can't pass it on they'll have to find cost savings somewhere else,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp falls with investors remaining on edge as the war in Ukraine continues, pushing oil prices higher and potentially stunting global growth.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 110 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 35 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices slumped on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 800 points or 2.4%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropping almost 3%, its biggest one-day decline in more than a year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6%.
The conflict in Ukraine, and the associated Western sanctions on Russia, have prompted concerns about supply shocks, sending commodity prices soaring to multi-year records.
The U.S. national average for gasoline surged to $4.104 per gallon on Monday, just ahead of the previous all-time of $4.103 per gallon in 2008, before the onset of the Great Recession.
These inflationary pressures are raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to hike interest rates more aggressively than the market has factored in, potentially stunting the recovery in the world’s largest economy and global growth driver.
The U.S. central bank meets next week, and Chairman Jerome Powell last week backed a quarter-point rate increase in his Semiannual Testimony to Congress, adding he would move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
Oil prices remain firm Tuesday, not far removed from the previous session’s 14-year highs. The latest weekly inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is due later and follows a drop of just over 6 million barrels last week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% higher at $122.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.9% to $126.77. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.

740,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family that own Purdue Pharma struck a new settlement last week with a group of eight states and the District of Columbia to resolve widespread litigation accusing the OxyContin maker of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The following details next steps for Purdue and potential hurdles as it moves closer to exiting bankruptcy.
What is in the revised deal?
Under the new settlement, the Sacklers will pay between $5.5 and $6 billion to a trust that will be used to pay the claims of opioid creditors, including states, victims of addiction, hospitals, and municipalities.
The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing, but expressed ""regret"" that OxyContin played a role in the opioid crisis. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain must approve the settlement and will consider the matter at a hearing on Wednesday.
The deal replaces a previous $4.3 billion agreement, which was upended on appeal after nine attorneys general argued that the Sacklers should not receive sweeping protection from current and future opioid lawsuits as part of the deal. 
Does the settlement protect the Sacklers from future lawsuits? 
Not directly. 
The Sacklers have said in court testimony and filings that a settlement is predicated on them being shielded from opioid-related lawsuits.
But these sweeping legal protections must first be written into a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and approved by a bankruptcy judge. 
To do this, Purdue must overcome the December ruling concluding that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to release non-bankrupt parties, like the Sacklers, from litigation. 
Purdue is appealing that decision to the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, and will make oral arguments in that court on April 25. Purdue filed its briefs on Feb. 11, and opposing papers are due on March 11.
Do creditors need to vote on the new deal?
Purdue may have to ask creditors to vote on the new settlement, even though they already voted to support the previous $4.3 billion deal. Purdue has argued that no one is worse off under the new deal and the bankruptcy judge could conclude that a new vote is not necessary. 
A new vote would be expensive and time consuming, and there is no guarantee that Purdue could maintain the broad support it achieved the first time around. 
Who might oppose the new settlement? 
The Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog has consistently opposed the use of bankruptcy law to grant the kind of sweeping legal protections sought by the Sacklers, who are not bankrupt themselves. The DOJ has opposed Purdue's appeal in the 2nd Circuit, and its written arguments are due on March 11.
The DOJ did not participate in the negotiations that led to the new Sackler settlement, and declined to comment when asked whether the agreement would change its position in the 2nd Circuit appeal.
Other states also could attempt to upend the new settlement before Tuesday's 7pm ET deadline. Other creditors, including individual victims, may also object.
Seventeen states, including Florida, West Virginia and Ohio, have already objected, saying in court papers that the latest Sackler settlement gives too much money to the states that negotiated it, through a $277 million ""side deal"" that will not be shared with other states.

The objecting states argued that they are receiving a lower percentage of the opioid abatement money than they would have under the $4.3 billion deal. The new settlement violates a bankruptcy principle that similarly-situated creditors must be treated equally, according to the states' objections. 
Other creditors may object as well, including individual victims of the opioid crisis, who will be given a platform to speak before the bankruptcy court approves the deal. A group of Canadian municipalities and tribes is also fighting Purdue's appeal in the 2nd Circuit.

Investing.com – Stocks of U.K.’s insurer and asset manager M&G (LON:MNG) surged 11.5% in London Tuesday after it revealed a 500 million pound ($654.30 million) share buyback offer to shareholders, supported by strong capital generation in the business.
The financial services firm will also pay a second interim dividend of 12.2 pence per share, taking the total for the year to 18.3 pence.
Plans to return more capital to the shareholders have come in after the life insurer achieved a total capital generation of 2.8 billion pounds over two years. The company, which split off from Prudential in 2019, is targeting the operating capital generation of 2.5 billion pounds in three years through 2024.
The firm’s operating profit in 2021 was 721 million, down 9%, but ahead of the forecasts. Changes in longevity assumptions hurt profit.
Banking and finance companies have had a good run in the last two years, even though 2021 was relatively volatile, while interest rates began to firm up. Most businesses grew, from lending to wealth management to advisory.
Total assets under management gained 0.8% to 370 billion pounds, mostly owing to a positive market. Net client inflows were 600 million pounds.

ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Women remain rare visitors to the highest echelons of European banks.
The 25 biggest banks by assets have seen 22 changes in chief executive and chair over the past two years, including announcements of upcoming appointments, according to a Reuters review of senior industry roles. Twenty-one of those 22 jobs went to men. 
Only one lender - Britain's NatWest - has a female CEO, while two - Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and the Netherlands' Rabobank - have a woman chairing their governing boards.
""Tim goes away, so who looks like Tim?"" said Claire Godding, the former long-time head of diversity for BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in Belgium, citing unconscious bias as the prime culprit.
""It's usually not a Sarah.""
The review, on International Women's Day, provides just a snapshot of the industry, yet indicates how far banks have to travel to achieve equality at the top. 
It suggests that, while Europe is making progress in diversifying its C-Suite, it has fallen behind Wall Street in an area that could provide a competitive edge.
Some of the most stubborn obstacles to change revolve around the intangible working culture at institutions long dominated by men, such as bosses favouring staff who stay late, according to interviews with more than two dozen specialists including senior executives, board members, investors and academics.
There is a greater degree of diversity within European banks' wider executive teams, which typically comprise around 10-20 senior managers under the CEO. 
The review found that women make up about 25% of such teams. Yet the Europeans lag the eight U.S. banks with major global reach - including the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) - where the proportion is 30% on average.
The data, collected by Reuters through early February, does not reflect pending appointments which will affect several lenders' gender diversity. Some banks said they already had female top managers lined up in the months to come.
At the European banks, the most common executive role filled by women was chief human resources officer, a job that industry experts say does not usually involve the level of operational experience that would feed into becoming a future CEO or chair. 
'ROOM SUDDENLY FELL SILENT'
Citigroup's Europe head Kristine Braden sees training as a crucial tool to make staff aware of the gender dynamics at play. 
""When I moved to EMEA, I became the first woman appointed to one of our executive committees. I remember walking into my first meeting and looking forward to meeting everyone,"" she said.  
""What had been a room full of cheerful banter suddenly fell silent."" 
    ""Men and women develop relationships in different ways. When a woman wants to establish rapport with another woman, she may compliment her in some way,"" Braden added. ""Men often banter with each other. Establishing professional rapport across the genders requires building trust with each other.""
Citi's CEO Jane Fraser, who made history when she became the first female chief executive of a Wall Street bank a year ago, credited work flexibility early in her career when she had young children as a key factor enabling her to rise to the top.
""That phase for me of being part-time working, but being able to be with the kids when they were very little, was very precious,"" Fraser told a conference shortly after being named new Citi CEO, referring to her time at consulting firm McKinsey. 
""I honestly don't think I would be here today if I hadn't.""
The equality drive goes beyond social justice.
""We see a lack of diversity as a lack of competitive advantage over time,"" said Stephanie Niven, Global Sustainable Equity Portfolio Manager at investment manager Ninety One. ""Broadening the voices in a room broadens the understanding and context of decision-making."" 
BOOST IN BOARDROOMS
Women are closer to parity on bank boards, partly a result of these supervisory panels being the main focus of governance scrutiny from policymakers and investors. The female representation is about 37% on both sides of the Atlantic.
""We vote on board members, so pressure is first on the board,"" said Vincent Kaufmann, director at proxy advisor Ethos. ""But I can imagine, once we've solved those problems, progressive investors will start focusing on management in coming years.""
Some of the industry figures interviewed cited the predominant focus on board diversity as one reason for the lack of progress in the C-Suite. 
""With that push for more women at the board level, I think there was an opportunity for women,"" said Simone Stebler, head of executive search firm Egon Zehnder's financial services and legal practices in Switzerland. 
""But there was also the demand for them to leave their management roles and step onto the board, sometimes even without having passed through this executive committee rank."" 
Globally, a 2021 study by finance think-tank OMFIF found that European commercial banks fared above-average on board-level representation but lagged peers in North America, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets at the executive committee level.
WHAT'S WITH THE CULTURE? 
Despite policymakers' efforts to reform banking culture, Europe's sector still rewards inflexible hours, which often favour men, according to many of the people interviewed. 
And an ""old-boys"" network of men helping each other get ahead in their careers is still alive and kicking, they said.
""Every year many talented women are leaving universities and schools - too few are visible after 10 or 20 years,"" said Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a former member of the European Central Bank's executive board who is now on the supervisory board of Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Yet overhauling a company's DNA is a long-term endeavour, multiple interviewees said. Filling up a diverse candidate list for executive roles can take many years as it often relies on a pipeline of experienced middle managers.
""The easiest part is achieving gender diversity at board level, the more difficult part is actually at the second and third layers down in an organisation,"" said Gavin Rochussen, CEO at London-based fund manager Polar Capital.
Former BNP Paribas executive Godding, who now focuses on diversity at the Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin, said some executives were not aware of the scale of the challenge. 
""Most banks discover they have two or three glass ceilings instead of one,"" she said. ""They lose women in the middle of middle management."" 
'FEEL IT IN THE BANK' 
UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told Reuters that banks needed to change their mindsets.
""We take this commitment seriously, recognising that meaningful progress comes not from quotas but from establishing a fundamental change in culture within our business,"" he said. 
Elena Carletti, a finance professor at Bocconi University who joined UniCredit's board in 2019, believes meaningful change can happen quickly if the will exists, citing the progress made by Italy's second-biggest bank under Orcel and chair Pietro Carlo Padoan, who were both appointed last year. 
Of the 25 banks reviewed by Reuters, UniCredit has made the greatest senior executive-level progress since 2019, boosting women's representation from 4% to 40%.

Carletti said almost half the CEO's direct reports were women compared to one under his predecessor.
""The change has been dramatic, and you can feel it in the bank.""

KKR could confirm its interest in a deal but at a price of around 0.40 euros per share, Italian daily Il Messaggero reported. 
KKR made a non-binding approach to TIM in November which was pitched at 0.505 euros per share, valuing Italy's largest telecoms company at 10.8 billion euros ($11.8 billion).
KKR and Telecom Italia declined to comment on Tuesday. 
TIM shares, which have plunged over the past three sessions, were up 10.7% at 0.2614 euros by 0950 GMT against a 3% rise in Italy's blue chip index.
A board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal could be held on Sunday once TIM's advisers complete an analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Ahead of their assessment this week, TIM's advisers have asked the U.S. fund to clarify whether the terms of its November offer still stand, the sources added.
The shares have remained well below the takeover approach as leading TIM shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) had indicated it was too low. 
A big annual loss reported last week and a standalone plan that has so far failed to win over investors added to the pressure.
SPLITTING UP
TIM CEO Pietro Labriola's plan is centred around the structural separation of TIM's fixed-network business from its retail operations. 
Last week Labriola said that KKR's plan for TIM was similar but that he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors, including minority shareholders.
Some members of TIM's board of directors have reservations about ditching KKR's proposal without further talks with the fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
Splitting TIM's wholesale network operations from its retail arm could ease a mooted merger of the former phone monopoly's fixed assets network with those of fiber optic rival Open Fiber, a move advocated by TIM second largest investor, state lender CDP. 

But a preliminary agreement on the plan failed to materialise so far, as Italy's Innovation Minister Vittorio Colao warned it could create regulatory problems with EU funded tenders to boost fast connectivity across the country, people familiar with the matter said.
CDP controls a 60% stake in Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9180 euros)

Investing.com – Greggs PLC (LON:GRG) stock slumped 8.3% in London trading Tuesday after it flagged significant cost pressures in its bakery business, saying it does not expect “material profit progression” in the year ahead.
CEO Roger Whiteside told Reuters,  Greggs  was having to deal with raw material price increases ""right across the board, all food stuffs.""
“All the proteins, all the cereals, all the oils - everything's going up in price,"" Whiteside told the news agency.
Some 29% of Greggs' total costs are in food ingredients, labor being its biggest cost.
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has sent prices of food grains and other farm-based commodities to multi-year highs. Crude prices are at their highest since 2008. Supply chains, which began to return to normalcy after the pandemic, are in turmoil again.
The price of wheat rocketed past $10 a bushel last week for the first time in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg. Corn also leaped to a nine-year high and soybean oil traded near record highs.
Russia and Ukraine account for about a quarter of global wheat and barley trade and a fifth of corn. Farming activity in Ukraine is in disarray as many farmers have rushed to perform military roles.
Whiteside said Greggs had raised prices for consumers at the beginning of 2022, but not since then.
In the year ended January 1, Greggs’ total sales rose 5.3% to 1.23 billion pounds. Pre-tax profit was near 146 million pounds compared to a loss last time."

Investing.com –  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock is trading sideways in premarket Tuesday after it signaled that it may begin to enforce patents of its Covid-19 vaccine in wealthier countries.
The stock was up 1.2% initially but gave up all the gains to trade 0.6% lower. It later traded 0.1% up.
Moderna’s latest view is a departure from its previous stand of eschewing enforcing patents anywhere.  
“If people have used, or are using our technology to make a vaccine, I don’t understand why, once we’re in an endemic setting when there’s plenty of vaccine and there’s no issue to supply vaccines, why we should not get rewarded for the things we invented,” CEO Stéphane Bancel told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.
Notwithstanding any revised stance, Moderna is maintaining its previous pledge of not enforcing its Covid-19 vaccine patents in 92 countries that are part of an international program, called Covax, that provides Covid-19 vaccines.
These countries include South Africa, India, Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Rwanda, Vietnam, Egypt, and Algeria.
Moderna has been hailed for its mRNA-based Spikevax vaccine that has saved millions of lives. At one point, along with Pfizer-BioNTech and Russia’s Gamaleya, Moderna was the only other company in the world making Covid-19 vaccines. It decided to undervalue the price of its vaccine while the pandemic lasts.
In 2021, the company delivered 807 million doses of the only product it sells; a fourth of those went to low- and middle-income countries. The biotech firm expects $19 billion in sales of its Spikevax vaccine this year compared to the $18.5 billion it had forecast earlier.",,,,,

Investing.com - European stock markets climbed in volatile trading Tuesday, but sentiment remains fragile amid ongoing concerns that the Russia/Ukraine war will hurt global growth by pushing commodity prices sharply higher.
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.6% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 traded flat.
Russia and Ukraine have said they will continue to hold talks on a potential ceasefire, although a third round of discussions on Monday made scant progress, with Moscow continuing its bombardment of several Ukrainian cities, deepening the humanitarian crisis. 
Kyiv has rejected Moscow's offer of possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, claiming that Russia violated three previous attempts to create them.
The conflict, and the sanctions the West has levied on Moscow as a result, have pushed oil prices up to 14-year highs, while European gas, nickel, and wheat have also climbed to record levels amid concerns about supply disruptions.
These widespread price rises have put the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday firmly into focus as policymakers must now grapple with the prospect of inflation, already at record highs, rising yet further just as a new crisis threatens the economy.
On the economic data front, Eurozone GDP data for the fourth quarter of last year are expected to show a surge in growth of 4.6% on the year, while data already released show German industrial production rose 2.7% on the month in January, much more than expected.

All problems pale when compared with the tragedy of Ukrainians fleeing bombed-out cities. 
Others are seeing damage of a different kind -- from near worthless Russian securities on investors' books to soaring commodity prices that will show up the grocery and energy bills of consumers everywhere. 
And the ripple effects are still spreading.
After the S&P 500's worst day since October 2020, stock markets show no sign of recovery on Tuesday, with Wall Street futures down another 1% and Europe faring worse. Since mid-February, European banks have lost a quarter of their share value and an earnings hit looks inevitable 
The next move contemplated -- a ban on Russian energy imports -- could make matters worse; Capital Economics reckons that will push Brent (currently around $120) to $160 a barrel and European natural gas to 300 euros a megawatt hour from the current 215 euros or so. 
Europe as well as a raft of emerging economies would tip into recession.
Europe is resisting that ban, but it hasn't stopped Brent from jumping another $4 a barrel. Meanwhile, the green transition gets ever costlier -- from aluminium and steel used in wind turbines to nickel, a crucial component in electric vehicle batteries, prices continue to soar. 
Estimates suggest supply chain glitches pushed average new vehicle transaction prices in the United States almost fifth above year-ago levels. The hit might be bigger in the coming year, and more so in Europe -- almost half of Germany's nickel is sourced from Russia.
Fast unfolding events and daily commodity price jumps render economic data outdated. Yet they are useful to gauge what might come next; oil import costs triggered the biggest Japanese current account deficit since 2014, data showed.
U.S. February CPI, due Thursday, is expected at 7.9% year-on-year, but with last week bringing the fastest gasoline price surge in 17 years, the March print could eclipse that.
It leaves central banks facing the growth-inflation conundrum. In the euro zone where policy options are arguably most limited, two-year German ""breakevens"" a future inflation gauge, have soared above 5%.

SYDNEY/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd has postponed a plan to raise $347 million in a Hong Kong listing due to elevated market uncertainty after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its managing director said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
The manufacturer, which benefited from demand for disposable medical gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic, has a primary listing in Kuala Lumpur and secondary in Singapore, and had planned the Hong Kong listing to broaden its investor base.
""Due to the changing developments in the industry and the current equity market conditions, we have decided to give ourselves more time to pursue this exercise in Hong Kong,"" Lee Kim Meow told Reuters, referring to the impact of ""Russian military action"" on market sentiment.
He said the world's largest medical glove maker was in no hurry to list as the plan was for the long-term benefit.
Top Glove's Kuala Lumpur-listed shares fell 6.3% after the news. The stock has fallen 31% in 2022.
The glove maker, which reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, initially aimed to raise $1 billion in what would have been a dual primary listing.
Shareholders in December approved the issuance of up to 793.5 million shares which at the current price of 1.83 ringgit would have raised about $347 million.
Top Glove had planned to launch the deal in February but postponed it because Russia's invasion of Ukraine has weighed on investor sentiment and heightened market volatility has impacted the listing progress, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier, declining to be identified as the information was not yet public.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
SHARE SALE HALT
A growing number of Asian share sales are being put on hold as markets remain roiled by the invasion.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares has dropped 13% year-to-date, as geopolitical uncertainty causes investors to flee equities and pile into safer assets.
Chinese fast fashion retailer Shein postponed its U.S. listing ambitions due to the upheaval, Reuters previously reported.
Life Insurance Corp's plan to raise $8 billion before March-end in India's largest-ever initial public offering (IPO) is also now in doubt.
""The prospects of ever increasing sanctions on Russia, the ongoing crackdown on real estate, tech and other sectors in China, passing of the peak of loose monetary policy in the West and it all portends to a rather quiet period for equity capital market activity until the equity and commodity markets settle down,"" Sumeet Singh, Aequitas Research director who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.

Hong Kong has recorded the slowest start to the year for IPOs and secondary listings in six years with $1.17 billion raised in 2022, Refinitiv data showed.
That compares with $10.16 billion in the same period of 2021 and the lowest since 2016.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to rival Reliance Industries (NS:RELI), the country's biggest conglomerate.
After trading barbs in courtrooms for months, Amazon and Future unexpectedly agreed on March 3 to hold discussions to resolve their dispute.
Here's what the dispute, seen as key to deciding who gets an upper hand in one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets, is all about and what led to the sudden change in tone. 
WHAT TRIGGERED THE DISPUTE?
In 2019, Amazon and Future, number two player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a unit of the Indian group. 
That deal, Amazon argues, came with non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by one of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani. The deal also included clauses for settlement of any disputes under rules laid down by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
But in 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance. 
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other with lawsuits in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, since the ""seat of arbitration"" remains in New Delhi and Indian law governs the proceedings.
WHAT DO AMAZON AND FUTURE SAY?
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation and its more than 27,000 employees can become jobless if the Reliance deal fails. 
Both sides have deployed a battery of lawyers and top Indian legal firms are involved in the high-profile matter. Two lawyers who formerly occupied the position of Solicitor General of India have played a key role in arguing for Amazon and Future.
WHAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE?
At stake is whether Amazon can become a bigger force in a $900 billion retail market, with 1.3 billion consumers, than Reliance.
Reliance has 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has around 1,500. Both are expanding fast into e-commerce, but the Future deal will immediately boost the retail footprint of Reliance, which has attracted marquee foreign investors in the business. 
For its part, Amazon has invested $6.5 billion in India, which it counts as a key growth market where it is a leading e-commerce player. The Future partnership had already allowed Amazon to boost its online portfolio of grocery deliveries by integrating the Indian company's stores on its website.
Keeping Future away from Reliance chimes with Amazon's efforts to combat billionaire Ambani's growth plans. In one confidential legal filing, Amazon said Reliance's consolidated position with Future ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"". 
HOW DID INDIA ANTITRUST AGENCY GET INVOLVED?
Future last year complained to India's antitrust agency that Amazon was making incorrect and contradictory submissions about the intent of the 2019 deal.
Amazon said it never concealed any information, but last December the watchdog suspended its approval of the 2019 deal with Future, saying there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope"" of the deal and its interest in Future's retail businesses. 
In a setback for the U.S. giant, an Indian court in January halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings between the two sides in light of the antitrust decision.
WHY AMAZON EXTENDED AN OLIVE BRANCH
In a sudden move on Feb. 25, Reliance, which had not played a public role in the dispute, started executing a de facto takeover of some 500 Future stores that represent the crown jewels of its retail network.

Reliance had assumed many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future and has now moved to take over possession citing missed rental payments.
That spooked Amazon, sources say. On March 3, Amazon cited takeover of shops and extended an olive branch during a Supreme Court hearing, saying the ""whirlpool"" of litigation must end. Future agreed to the talks, which are currently ongoing.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Tuesday, amid ongoing concern that the Ukraine/Russia war will hurt global growth by pushing commodity prices sharply higher.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.1%.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine to halt the conflict made scant progress on Monday, with Moscow continuing its bombardment of several Ukrainian cities, deepening the humanitarian crisis. 
Kyiv has rejected Moscow's offer of possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, claiming that Russia violated three previous attempts to create them.
The conflict, and the sanctions the West has levied on Moscow as a result, has pushed oil prices up to 14-year highs, while European gas, nickel, and wheat have also climbed to record levels amid concerns about supply disruptions.
These widespread price rises have put the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday firmly into focus as policymakers must now grapple with the prospect of inflation, already at record highs, rising yet further just as a new crisis threatens the economy.
The ECB is due to cut bond buying over the coming quarters, but further big decisions look unlikely with the central bank unlikely to commit to anything given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Ukraine conflict.
On the economic data front, Eurozone GDP data for the fourth quarter of last year are expected to show a surge in growth of 4.6% on the year, while data already released show German industrial production rose 2.7% on the month in January, much more than expected.
In corporate news,  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) will be in the spotlight Tuesday after it announced its decision to suspend all commercial activities in Russia, including closing all its stores in the country.
Oil prices traded higher, remaining near the previous session’s 14-year highs, The latest weekly inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is due later Tuesday, and follows a drop of just over 6 million barrels last week.
Crude had soared on Monday after the U.S. said it was discussing a ban on Russian oil with its major European allies, but gains dissipated after Germany, the biggest buyer of Russian oil, rejected plans for an energy embargo.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.5% higher at $122.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $126.90. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.4% to $2,022.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0856.

The U.S. lender said on Monday that along with launching in new markets and expanding its digital capabilities, the Citi Commercial Bank (CCB) unit is looking to ramp up its presence in high-growth and emerging markets. 
The bank, which currently operates in 60 countries and focuses on lending to mid-sized companies, said a bulk of the hires are expected to be in areas where it sees an increase in business activity, particularly the United States, China, Brazil, India and countries in Western Europe.
The move comes at a time when the Wall Street institution has been cutting down its international footprint by exiting non-core markets. Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who took the helm last year, has looked to simplify the bank and bring its profitability more in line with its peers.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, Citi said, as part of its global headcount expansion plan, it would hire close to 350 people, including nearly 200 commercial bankers, over the next three years to accelerate growth in the Asia Pacific region.
The hiring represents the largest investment in headcount across the bank globally, it said. 
A majority of these hires will be placed in China, Hong Kong, India and Singapore. China and India will each get around 80 new hires. Hong Kong will add close to 100 people, while another over 30 will go to Singapore.
The arrangement will strengthen Citi's services, including treasury and trade solutions, securities, and its collaboration with global wealth management. 

In 2021, the Asia Pacific business contributed 41% to the bank's global revenues of $2.7 billion.
Earlier this year, Citigroup said it will exit its Citibanamex consumer banking business in Mexico and also announced a deal to sell its retail unit in Taiwan.

Investing.com –  China Meheco  Co. Ltd. (SS:600056) saw its shares jump over 9% on Tuesday, and more than 50% in the past week. Speculation is growing that the Beijing-based drug maker is  Pfizer  Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) local partner to distribute its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid.
The company’s shares jumped 9.35% to HK$17.77 ($2.27) by 12:24 AM ET (5:24 AM GMT), after rallying by the 10% daily limit for four consecutive days. This is a big turnaround for the shares, which fell to their lowest level since 2014 in February 2022.
The state-owned company warned of uncertainties of the deal with “a certain multinational drug maker” in a statement on Monday, which did not mention Pfizer by name. Contribution to earnings would be small, and even if the deal goes smoothly, “the usage and sales of the drug may depend on factors such as virus control situation,” the statement added.
China’s National Medical Products Administration conditionally approved Paxlovid in February, the first foreign pharmaceutical product endorsed for COVID-19 in the country. The drug is approved to treat adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 with a high risk of progressing to a severe condition.
With China Meheco the sole drug company overseen by the central government, investors are increasing their bets that the company will be the local distributor.",,,,,

(Reuters) - Russia's size and close integration into the global aviation industry since the end of the Cold War means sanctions related to its invasion of Ukraine are having outsized consequences relative to earlier freezes on Iran and North Korea.
Manufacturers, lessors, insurers and maintenance providers to Russian carriers like Aeroflot, S7 Airlines and AirBridgeCargo are among those outside Russia that are hit directly by sanctions.
Foreign airlines, meanwhile, are reeling from higher oil prices and longer routes needed to bypass airspace over Russia that are expected to drive up ticket prices and air freight rates.
AIRCRAFT LEASING, INSURANCE IMPACT
Russian airlines have been highly reliant on the global aircraft leasing industry to modernise their fleets with the latest Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes.
Russian carriers have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium.
Of these, 515 jets with an estimated market value of about $10 billion are rented from foreign firms such as AerCap and Air Lease (NYSE:AL).
The European Union has given leasing companies until March 28 to wind up current rental contracts in Russia. 
But getting the planes back could be challenging due to airspace bans, potential SWIFT payment transfer issues and industry concerns the Russian government could nationalise the fleet to maintain domestic capacity.
Russia's state aviation authority recommended that airlines with foreign-leased planes stop flying them abroad.
Even if the planes are returned quickly, the huge number needing to be placed elsewhere could depress rental prices globally, analysts say.
Russian airlines have also been cut off from the insurance and reinsurance markets in the European Union and Britain. 
An insurance industry source said it was unclear if lessors unable to repossess planes would be covered for losses under their own policies, which typically contain clauses cancelling coverage in the event of sanctions. 
Legal action may be needed to settle the issue, said the source, who was not authorised to speak publicly. 
SALES, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND PARTS BANS
Russian airlines have 62 planes on order with Airbus and Boeing, according to aviation consulting firm IBA, and those deliveries will be barred.
Manufacturers and maintenance firms are also banned from providing parts and services for the existing fleet.
Germany's Lufthansa Technik said it had stopped serving Russian customers, involving hundreds of planes.
Tass news agency reported the Russian transport ministry had drawn up a draft bill to help airlines until September 2022 that would allow maintenance by third-party firms and suspend all inspections of carriers.
Some aviation executives are concerned that the sanctions prevent planemakers from sharing service bulletins and airworthiness directives that are key for safety.
Viktor Berta, vice president of aviation finance advisory at ACC Aviation, said there was also a high risk that Russian airlines would need to strip parts from their existing fleet once spares run out. 
RISING OIL PRICES, LONGER FLIGHT TIMES 
Oil prices have surged to the highest level since 2008 as the United States said it was willing to ban Russian oil imports.
Oil hedging, fuel surcharges and fare increases are among the measures airlines are taking to offset some of the pain at a time when demand remains low due to the pandemic.
High oil prices are in some cases compounded by circuitous flight paths needed to avoid Russian airspace after reciprocal bans that can add up to 3.5 hours of flying.
The biggest impact is on flights between Europe and north Asian destinations like Japan, South Korea and China but other affected routes include those between southeast Asia and Europe and the United States and India.
Longer flight times also lead to higher staff costs, less cargo carrying ability and higher maintenance costs on contracts that are charged on a flight hour basis, said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst based in Singapore.

""Another concern is the impact on international passenger demand in some markets, resulting in a setback in the overall recovery of international air travel,"" he added.

Oil continued an upward trend after closing near a 14-year high on Monday. European gas, nickel, and wheat also climbed to record levels as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to drive concerns about supply disruption. The U.S. is also looking to bar imports of Russian oil, while Russia threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in response.
Central banks are also looking to tighten their monetary policies, adding to the challenge. The gap between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields is the smallest since March 2020, a warning sign of smaller growth prospects.
“It’s all about slowing growth and rising inflation,” Rock Creek co-chief investment officer Alifia Doriwala told Bloomberg. “With the sanctions on Russia intensifying, it’s hitting all sectors. Then you are going to have some central bank action amidst much uncertain economic growth.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 80 environmental groups and other organizations on Monday urged California Governor Gavin Newsom to impose tougher rules promoting electric vehicles even as the state is moving faster than President Joe Biden's administration.
""Californians being punished by high gas prices and climate disasters deserve the fastest all-electric future Gov. Newsom can deliver,"" said Scott Hochberg of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, one of the groups signing the letter.
The groups want Newsom and California air regulators to back requiring more electric vehicles faster than the current plans and to set more stringent annual emissions reductions for gasoline-powered vehicles. They called for 7% annual increases in emissions reductions for gasoline vehicles compared with 5% on average under standards adopted under President Barack Obama.
Hochberg said Newsom ""needs to prove the state’s climate leadership with a much faster electrification timeline.”
Newsom is set to deliver his State of the State address on Tuesday. In 2020, Newsom said the state planned to phaseout the sale of new light duty internal combustion vehicles by 2035.
California accounts for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, the biggest individual state market, and many states adopt its green vehicle mandates.
California aims to reach 61% zero emission electric vehicle (EV) sales by 2030, the groups noted. President Joe Biden has set a goal of 50% of new vehicle sales being electric or plug-in electric, but has not endorsed a date to phaseout gasoline-vehicle sales.
The letter https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming/fuel_economy_standards/pdfs/Clean-Cars-Letter-to-Gov-Newsom-March-2022.pdf, also signed by Greenpeace USA, the California Democratic Party Environmental Caucus and Friends of the Earth, want Newsom to consider requiring 80% or more zero emission vehicles by 2030.
Newsom's office did not immediately comment.
In April, the EPA said it was moving to restore legal authority to California to set tough vehicle emission rules and zero-emission vehicle mandates. In 2013, the EPA granted California a waiver to set vehicle rules. Under former President Donald Trump, it revoked the waiver in 2019.
EPA spokesman Nick Conger said Monday the agency is ""working to finalize a decision on the California waiver and expects to issue a decision in the near future.""
Some automakers have raised concerns if the EPA makes the waiver retroactive and the impact it could have on emissions requirements.

The EPA in December finalized new vehicle emissions rules restoring targets undone by Trump and require a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026.
Biden's push in Congress to boost EV tax credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle and reinstate them for General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains stalled along with other provisions to boost EVs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said on Monday it will review progress by regulators in establishing the basis for certifying lower-altitude aircraft known as ""flying taxis.""
While interest in Urban Air Mobility, or highly automated aircraft that can be used for passengers and cargo and are designed to operate in populated areas, has grown substantially, it creates ""new and complex safety challenges"" for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is currently reviewing applications for certifying eVTOL aircraft, the watchdog said.
The sector includes electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft, which use electrical propulsion to take off, hover and land vertically. The aircraft typically carry only a few passengers per pilot.
The FAA said it ""will cooperate fully with the Office of the Inspector General’s audit and looks forward to providing information about our extensive safety work in this area.""
In highlighting the challenges for the FAA, the inspector general's office noted that the existing regulation for aircraft certification that is being used is ""still primarily intended for traditional small aircraft with a pilot onboard, whereas eVTOL aircraft may be entirely autonomous.""
Well-established aviation and automotive manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Embraer, Airbus, United Airlines,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Stellantis are among companies pouring money into the nascent eVTOL sector.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts last year estimated the potential market for eVTOLs could be worth $1 trillion by 2040, assuming favorable regulatory outcomes. But they said regulatory risks were one of the most underestimated for the sector given strict safety requirements, especially for operating in dense urban environments, as well as noise and pollution concerns.
The FAA said last week the agency and UK civil aviation authorities have a range of discussions ""focused on facilitating certification and validating new eVTOL aircraft, production, continued airworthiness, operations, and personnel licensing.""

Nasdaq ended down 20.1% from its Nov. 19 record high close, confirming the tech-heavy index has been in a bear market since hitting that record high, according to a widely used definition. That marks the Nasdaq's first bear market since 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak crushed global economies.

Oil prices jumped to their highest levels since 2008 as the United States and European allies considered banning Russian oil imports, in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine, while it looked less likely that Iranian crude would return swiftly to global markets. 
Russia calls the campaign a ""special operation"".

“That concern on oil has led to concerns on higher inflation and potential for stagflation,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""I think there is just a broader concern that there may be a hit to growth from the consumer given higher prices at the pump.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 797.42 points, or 2.37%, to 32,817.38, the S&P 500 lost 127.79 points, or 2.95%, to 4,201.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 482.48 points, or 3.62%, to 12,830.96. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were among the top individual drags on the S&P 500 while the financials sector fell 3.7%. The utilities sector, one of the defensive areas of the stock market, gained 1.3%.
Ukrainian officials said a bread factory had been hit by a Russian air strike as the country's negotiators assembled for talks with Russian officials after previous rounds that brought no respite in the conflict.
Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc fell 15% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings dropped 11.6%, among a broad downswing in travel and leisure stocks as the jump in oil prices threatened to disrupt a nascent recovery. 
Stocks have struggled to start 2022 as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. The S&P 500 marked its lowest closing level since June 2021.
“The market was already nervous about a Fed rate hike cycle,"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. ""Now when you layer on higher energy prices on top of that... that has the investment community increasingly concerned that we may end up quickly moving toward the late stages of the market cycle.”
Investors are waiting for a U.S. consumer prices report on Thursday, with the Fed widely expected to hike rates later this month to combat surging inflation.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.74-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 69 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 546 new lows.

(Reuters) -General Motors Co and South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) Chemical will build a $400 million facility to produce battery materials in Canada as the carmaker ramps up plans to produce mainly electric vehicles (EVs) in the future, the companies said on Monday.
The plant will produce cathode active material (CAM) for vehicle batteries in Becancour, Quebec. Cathodes are the most complex and costly chemical component of an electric vehicle battery. 
The cathode ""represents about 40% of the cost of every EV battery cell,"" said Scott Bell, GM Canada's President and Managing Director, in a news conference. ""We plan to have capacity by 2025 to build a million EVs in North America."" 
The plant's construction will begin immediately and the goal is to have it running by 2025. Once completed, it will create an estimated 200 jobs, according to a statement. GM aims to produce light vehicles that run exclusively on electricity by 2035.
The CAM produced at the plant will be used to make GM's Ultium batteries that will power the company's EVs, such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV and Cadillac LYRIQ. GM's Ingersoll, Ontario, factory will launch EV production later this year, Bell said. 
Both Canada's federal government and Quebec's provincial government are working with GM and POSCO Chemical, the companies said, though details were not released.
Rich in key materials for EV battery production - including lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel - Canada has been wooing battery makers to safeguard the future of its car manufacturing industry as the world seeks to cut emissions.
It is the second CAM plant announcement for Becancour in less than a week. On Friday, BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) said it was planning one there, too. 

Canada's Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that Becancour will become a hub for the country's EV battery ""ecosystem"". More ""good news"" is on the way, Champagne said, adding that there were ""very live discussions"" under way about building a battery factory in Canada.
""Starting from this announcement, we will be integrated in the global supply chain for cars in North America,"" Champagne said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Real yields in the U.S. Treasury market have gone even more negative as inflation surged, which is typically viewed as a positive factor for stocks, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has placed more emphasis on shedding risk than on the possibility of getting higher returns on Wall Street.
The decline in benchmark U.S. real yields, which have been mainly below zero since 2019, suggested that investors are piling into TIPS because of concerns about high inflation. Indeed, the war has propelled global benchmark Brent crude futures to a roughly 14-year high of just under $140 per barrel.
U.S. stocks, even with a strong earnings outlook and backed by a robust economy, may not be the best asset to hold during this geopolitical crisis, analysts said, though there was some divide in views.
""If all else equal and you sat there and saw that one of the largest countries in the world is attacking a country one-third its size and it has aspirations to reconstitute the old Russian empire, is that really a good backdrop for stocks?"" said David Petrosinelli, managing director and senior trader at broker-dealer InspereX in New York. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin, brushing aside worldwide condemnation of the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" vowed to press ahead with his offensive, which he said was going to plan, unless Kyiv surrendered.
Since Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24, the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), also called the real yield because it strips out inflation, has fallen about 45 basis points.
The 10-year TIPS yield has collapsed by roughly 64 basis points, since the release on Feb. 10 of U.S. consumer price data showing the annual U.S. inflation for January hitting a 40-year high. On Monday, the 10-year real yield dropped to a two-month low of -1.027%. 
Real yields are an important input to broader financial conditions, and when they are low, that typically underpins U.S. equities.
""Equities like many financial assets are evaluated on the present value of their expected future cash flows,"" said Tim Wessel, macro strategist, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
""When real yields are falling, that means the expected value of a stock's future cash flow is going to be higher. If you look at the sector breakdown of equities, if you look at the S&P 500 and compare its returns to big tech stocks or FANG stocks, they outperform the S&P on days when real yields fall,"" he added, referring to the growth-stock grouping of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
After a sharp fall to start the year accelerated with Russia-Ukraine tensions, the benchmark S&P 500 has bounced back about 4% from its Feb 24 intraday low. But Wall Street's fear index, the VIX, has climbed and the market sold off late last week and opened down on Monday.
The S&P 500 technology index did slip slightly last week, mainly due to selling on Thursday and Friday. Since its intra-day trough on Feb. 24, that index has actually gained 4.2%.
Analysts said aside from the tumble in real yields, U.S. stocks have benefited from the view that the latest geopolitical turmoil means the Federal Reserve would take a gradual approach to tightening monetary policy, starting next week.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week he would back an initial quarter percentage-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate at the March 15-16 meeting, but held out the prospect of hiking more aggressively this year if inflation does not ease.
""This uncertainty is going to cause the Fed to move more slowly, to tighten more slowly and as a result fall behind the curve on inflation, which is positive for risk assets and a support for them,"" said Ryan Swift, bond strategist, at BCA Research in Montreal.

InspereX's Petrosinelli thinks though that the risk in equities is in the medium to long term.
""The expectations component is really the wild card here,"" Petrosinelli said. ""We could be sitting at oil of $150 per barrel very, very easily here in the coming days and I'm not saying it's going to happen. But that can't be good for stocks.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil and other commodities prices soared while global shares tanked on Monday as the United States said it was willing to ban Russian oil imports, stoking investor fears over inflation and slowing economic growth. 
Brent, the international benchmark, briefly hit more than $139 a barrel, its highest level since 2008. Nickel prices rocketed 90%, gold broke through $2,000 an ounce and wheat jumped to a 14-year high, as industrial buyers and traders scrambled amid supply disruptions linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Euro zone real government bond yields fell sharply as surging energy prices fueled concerns that global economies are at risk of stagflation, a condition in which prices soar while growth stagnates.
Germany's 10-year and 30-year inflation-linked government bond yields fell to new record lows, while the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly after touching its lowest level in two months.
Wall Street's main indexes fell sharply, with the Nasdaq Composite confirming it was in a bear market, and the pan-European STOXX 600 index cut losses of around 3% to close at a near one-year low.
President Joe Biden's administration is willing to move ahead with a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports even if European allies do not, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" but it has triggered sweeping sanctions by the United States and Europe that aim to isolate Russia to a degree never before experienced by such a large economy.
""The crippling effect of oil prices above $130 would send many European economies into a recession,"" and that scenario caused European stocks to move into bear market territory, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA.
""The U.S. can handle not having any Russian energy supplies, but that is not the case for Europe.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 797.42 points, or 2.37%, the S&P 500 lost 127.79 points, or 2.95% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 482.48 points, or 3.62%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.73%.
Brent crude futures settled up 4.3% at $123.21 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 3.22% at $119.40 a barrel. [O/R]
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts estimate that the loss of Russia's 5 million barrels a day could cause crude oil prices to hit $200 a barrel. 
The Russia-Ukraine conflict also weighed on talks aimed at reviving Iran's nuclear deal with major powers, after Tehran accused Russia of ""interference.""
Nickel prices, which reached $55,000 a ton earlier in the trading session, last traded up 76% at $50,925 a ton. 
Russia supplies around 10% of the world's nickel, and investors fear that Western sanctions against Russia could disrupt air and sea shipments of commodities produced and exported by Russia.
The conflict and broader supply-chain disruptions provide a challenging backdrop for upcoming central bank meetings, ANZ economist Finn Robinson wrote in a note to investors. 
""Policy makers will need to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy whilst also shoring up their inflation credentials at a time of surging inflation pressures and growing evidence of second round effects,"" Robinson wrote.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters now expect the European Central Bank will wait until the end of the year to raise interest rates. 
In the United States, investors are closely watching the consumer prices report due out on Thursday. The data is expected to show core U.S. CPI for February rose 6.4% year-on-year, up from 6% in January.
A hotter reading will likely seal a Federal Reserve rate hike later this month.
Traders now see a 99% probability of a 25 basis-point rate hike by the Fed at its March meeting, while seeing a 1% chance of no change in rates. 

The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against six global peers, was last up 0.33% at 99.24.
The euro was down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.08575.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Procter & Gamble Co is ending all new capital investments in Russia and ""significantly reducing"" its portfolio to focus on basic hygiene, health and personal care items, CEO Jon Moeller said in a letter to employees posted on its website on Monday. 
Big investors such as New York State's pension fund are telling companies they should consider pausing operations in Russia as Russia invades neighboring Ukraine.
Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G is also suspending all media, advertising and promotional activity, Moeller said in the post. The company said on its website that its Russian division makes Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette razors.

P&G has 2,500 direct employees in Russia and 500 in Ukraine, according to a spokesperson. Moeller said in the blog post that the company ""proactively suspended"" operations in Ukraine and is providing evacuation support, financial assistance, food and shelter to help employees. 
P&G's business in Russia and Ukraine accounts for less than 2% of the company's global sales, a spokesperson said. P&G had $76.1 billion in global net sales in its last fiscal year.

JPMorgan had placed Russia on index watch on March 1 after sanctions were imposed on the country.
The Wall Street bank runs the widely followed family of sovereign hard-currency indexes EMBI, as well as a corporate debt counterpart CEMBI. It also has the GBI-EM benchmark for local debt in emerging currencies and the JESG index governed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
Russia will be excluded from the EMBI indexes, including the investment grade and other credit bucket sub-indexes, the bank said on Monday.
Local-currency denominated Russian bonds will be excluded from the GBI-EM indices and accrued interest for such bonds will be set to zero and suspended as of March 7, it said.
Russia and Belarus will be excluded from the JESG EMBI, JESG GBI-EM, and JESG CEMBI indices, it added.
Global assets worth $842 billion are benchmarked against JPMorgan's indexes, according to the bank. Russia has a weighting of 0.89% in the EMBIG Diversified index, and a 1.03% weighting in the ESG version of the index.

Russia's weighting in key emerging market indexes took a sharp hit after sanctions were imposed in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The weightings subsequently recovered some ground, only to take another dive this year as tensions over Ukraine sharply escalated in recent weeks.
Index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI said last week they were taking similar steps as deepening sanctions and public pressure isolate Russia's economy from Western investment and trading partners.

(Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Monday it had suspended buying titanium from Russia, while its European rival Airbus continues to use supplies from the nation that hosts the world's largest supplier of the commodity, VSMPO-AVISMA. The U.S. planemaker said it had ""substantial"" inventory of the metal, prized in aerospace for its strength relative to its weight and its compatibility with the latest generation of carbon-fibre, long-distance passenger jets. ""We have suspended purchasing titanium from Russia. Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for airplane production,"" Boeing (NYSE:BA) said in an emailed statement. The suspension was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. The head of state-controlled VSMPO-AVISMA hit out at Boeing's decision to suspend the contract, which had been renewed four months ago at the Dubai Airshow where Boeing pledged to keep the Russian company as its largest titanium supplier.
The two companies had also agreed to increase the use of a forgings manufacturing joint-venture - Ural Boeing Manufacturing - in Russia's Titanium Valley in the Urals. ""We sincerely regret that the contracts with our long-term partner are suspended,"" VSMPO-AVISMA Chief Executive Dmitry Osipov said in an emailed statement on Monday. ""We are now reorienting our sales policy to other markets,"" he said, adding that the company had prepared for such an outcome for several months.
Western governments imposed sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine in what it calls a “special military operation,” but they have not targeted VSMPO-AVISMA, 25% of which is owned by state defense conglomerate Rostec. It relies on aerospace for three quarters of its sales. The potential for disruption to Russian commodity supplies has thrown a spotlight on titanium, which is also used in the marine, auto and nuclear industries.
AIRBUS SUPPLIES In France, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) said it continued to source titanium from Russia and other countries. In an emailed statement, it said it was also obtaining titanium indirectly via its first-tier suppliers, all in compliance with sanctions.
The European planemaker has said it relies on Russia for half of its overall titanium needs, while VSMPO-AVISMA provides a third of Boeing's requirements.
Industry sources say Airbus receives its Russian titanium primarily from VSMPO-AVISMA with some titanium parts for landing gear supplied by Nizhny Novgorod-based Hydromash.
It has said that its general ability to boost jet output depends on the availability of raw materials, including titanium. Its NH90 and Tiger military helicopter programmes have relied on Russian titanium, according to Airbus' 2019 annual report.

Airbus did not immediately respond to a query about the specific status of its VSMPO-AVISMA contract.
Aerospace companies worldwide have been increasing stocks of titanium and moving to diversify sources since the Crimea crisis in 2014.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Vanguard Group has suspended purchases of Russian securities from its actively managed funds, the top mutual fund manager said on Monday.
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard said the suspension applies ""across our internally and externally managed active funds."" It said the company is also working to exit positions across its index funds.
The statement https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguards-response-to-war-in-ukraine.html on the Vanguard website took a more aggressive line than the company did on Friday when it said it would not restrict managers' investment decisions and on Monday morning in a statement sent by a Vanguard spokesperson that it was in talks with external managers. 
A Vanguard representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change.
Some rival fund companies had already taken similar steps as deepening sanctions and public pressure isolate Russia's economy from Western investment and trading partners. 
On Thursday, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said it had suspended the purchase of all Russian securities in its active and index funds. 
Franklin Templeton said https://investors.franklinresources.com/news-center/media-statements/Media-Statement-Details/2022/Franklin-Templeton-Statement-on-Russia-and-Belarus/default.aspx on Friday it would make no new investments in Russia or Belarus in sovereign or corporate debt, or public or private equity, and may take further steps.
Russia has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" 
Passive index funds account for most of Vanguard's roughly $8.1 trillion under management, but $1.7 trillion of that is in actively managed funds, with $767 billion run by external managers such as Wellington Management of Boston and Baillie Gifford of Scotland.
Total exposure to Russia accounts for less than 0.01% of client assets, Vanguard said. Its statement said it moved quickly to carry out sanctions against Russian banks and others, ""and to make needed adjustments prompted by market closures and index provider changes.""

Major index providers, including MSCI and FTSE Russell, also have been removing Russian equities and debt. 
Morningstar Inc on Monday said it would take steps to remove Russian equities from certain Morningstar indexes, and make similar change removing certain Russian debt from fixed-income indexes.

(Reuters) -Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing will keep its stores in Russia open, joining a small group of international firms that are staying put even as dozens of big brands temporarily shutter operations or exit the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
Political pressure is building on companies to halt business in Russia, while operations have also been complicated by sweeping sanctions affecting everything from global payments systems to a range of high-tech products. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Monday said it had suspended buying titanium from Russia, since it had sufficient supply for plane production, while European rival Airbus said it was sourcing titanium from Russia and other countries in accordance with sanctions.
Large shippers have suspended container routes to and from Russia and many Western companies, from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and home furnishings giant Ikea to energy majors BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), have closed shop or announced plans to exit the country.
Dutch technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) will write off a $700-million stake in Moscow-headquartered online platform VK Group, known for the VKontakte social network, Russia's answer to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). VK Group's CEO Vladimir Kirienko was added to a U.S. sanctions list after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A spokesperson told Reuters the company had seen no noticeable impact on its supply chain or logistics in Russia, where Uniqlo has 49 stores. 
""Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do,"" said CEO Tadashi Yanai of Japan-based Fast Retailing, in remarks first reported by Nikkei, adding that every country should oppose war.
In contrast,  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI) suspended its Russian operations, including any new investments.
Some American companies are continuing to operate in Russia, including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, prompting New York state's pension fund - a shareholder in the pair - to urge them and others to consider pausing their operations there.
The conflict may create opportunities, potentially including Europe scrapping a ban on several Brazilian meatpackers imposed in 2018 after a food sector scandal, sources said.
""The (Brazilian) industry is prepared to cover gaps and support the food security of nations that may be short-supplied by the likely suspension or decrease in exports of chicken and pork from Russia and Ukraine,"" said Ricardo Santin, president of meat lobby ABPA.

Major global companies are continuing to join the exit from Russia. The Big Four accounting firms KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte moved one by one to cut their ties with Russia, as did credit card company  American Express  (NYSE:AXP). 
Mutual fund manager Vanguard Group has suspended purchases of Russian securities from its actively managed funds, the top mutual fund manager said on Monday.

Investing.com – Stocks tumbled on Monday after a weekend of escalating attacks by Russia in Ukraine and talk that the U.S. and western allies might ban imports of Russian oil.
Talk of a ban helped push oil prices to $130 overnight on Monday, though they did ease back in the U.S. session. Still, the concern about supply shocks resulting from the conflict in Ukraine is sending commodity prices soaring to multi-year records.
Gasoline prices in the U.S. are near levels not seen since 2008.
The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide the course of interest rate increases, though many are concerned the Fed might misstep in its bid to tame inflation amid this crisis in Eastern Europe.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week backed a quarter-point rate increase at the March 15-16 policy meeting. He told Congress he would  move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
The Biden administration is considering banning Russian oil imports as a way of turning up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who himself is the subject of sanctions over Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. 
Tens of thousands of refugees continued to stream across Ukraine’s western borders with Poland and other neighboring countries, creating a humanitarian crisis that western allies were rushing to aid. Congress is expected to consider a $10 billion relief package for Ukraine this week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Apple peek
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has its first product event of the year, which is named ""Peek Performance."" At the event, Apple is expected to announce various product updates, including Macbook and iMac upgrades, while an updated iPhone SE with 5G is highly anticipated. 
The iPhone SE is Apple's entry-level iPhone. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives — who has an outperform rating and $200 price target on Apple — told investors in a note Monday that he expects the company to launch its third iPhone SE alongside a revamped iPad Air and a new Mac version. 
2. AMC ticket sales
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) recorded its third-highest attended weekend since movie theaters reopened in the summer of 2020. More than 4 million tickets were sold globally at AMC locations Thursday through Sunday, with AMC citing the success of the Warner Bros. release of the latest Batman movie. The attendance outpaced the year-over-year attendance for the same weekend in 2019 and 2020.
3. Oil climbs
Crude Oil WTI Futures prices hit 2008 highs on Monday as the United States and Europe kept open their proposed ban on Russian oil. Analysts warned of record highs of $150 a barrel next, although a survey suggested that Americans may already be driving less, with pump prices of fuel hitting all-time highs.
The U.S. national average for gasoline surged to $4.104 per gallon on Monday, just ahead of the previous all-time of $4.103 per gallon in 2008, before the onset of the Great Recession.

778,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:37PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Companies across Europe and North America have begun offering aid to Ukrainian authorities and people fleeing war following Russia's invasion, as over a million leave their homes and head to safety in Poland and other neighbouring countries.
The following are some companies which have offered support. More are expected to follow in the coming days.
ENERGY
TotalEnergies said on Tuesday it would provide fuel to the Ukrainian authorities and aid to refugees in Europe, but stopped short of joining rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in planning to exit positions in oil-rich Russia.
COMMUNICATIONS
Ukraine said on Monday it had received Starlink satellite internet terminals donated by SpaceX, but CEO Elon Musk and an internet security researcher warned these could become Russian targets.
More than a dozen telecom providers are providing free international calls to Ukraine or scrapping roaming charges there. Firms taking measures include A1 Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY) Group, Altice Portugal, AT&T (NYSE:T), Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Orange, Proximus, Swisscom, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Telenor, Telia Company, TIM, KPN, Vivacom and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD).

Poland's largest food retailer Biedronka said it would hire family members of its 1,800 Ukrainian employees, who would each receive a 1,000 zloty ($233) grant. It also pledged over $1 million to bring food, hygiene and cleaning products to refugees. 
Jysk will provide refugees in need with blankets or other items from the Danish home retailer's stock, a spokesman told Reuters on Thursday as the group reopened eight stores in western Ukraine. 
ACCOMMODATION
Airbnb said it was working with its hosts to offer free, short-term housing to up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, and that it was temporarily waiving its booking fees there.
Nordic Choice has offered free lodging in its Vilnius hotel, while Poland's Arche Hotels said three days after Russia launched the invasion that it had already put up 1,000 refugees as it prepared to lodge 5,000, and called for clothes, Polish language books and toy donations for children fleeing Ukraine. 
HEALTHCARE
Sweden's Medicover and private Polish provider LuxMed said they were providing free medical assistance at the border, while Gdansk-based Nivique clinic offered free gynaecological services to female refugees.
Merck & Co said it has delivered 135,000 courses of its COVID-19 antiviral pill through an agreement with the government and donated 100,000 courses of the drug to an aid organization providing medical support in the region. 
French cosmetics group L'Oreal said it aimed to deliver 300,000 hygiene products to Ukraine in coming weeks, while U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) pledged over $9 million-worth in insulin and COVID-19 medicine supplies for aid organisations there and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) $4 million in medical equipment such as mobile x-ray units and ventilators.
TRAVEL
Train operators across Central and Western Europe have offered free travel to Ukrainians, including Polish PKP Intercity trains and Germany's Deutsche Bahn, while Flixbus said it would send more free buses to run routes from the main Polish border crossing of Medyka.
Car rental companies Panek CarSharing and 4Mobility said they would allocate parts of their fleet for transport to the border and invited volunteers to help, while Uber (NYSE:UBER) announced unlimited free rides from the border to Polish cities.
LOGISTICS
Low-cost airline Ryanair, which has suspended all its flights to and from Ukraine, has begun carrying medical supplies from the UK and Ireland to Polish airports, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Trans.EU said it was organising a network of carriers to bring supplies to Ukraine from Western Europe and the CEO of Krakow-based InPost said he would mobilise parts of the parcel group's fleet to bring aid to the border. 
BANKING
Several banks have promised to waive or refund fees for transfers to Ukraine, including Dutch lender ING, Poland's mBank and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)'s Polish branch, which offered free withdrawals to Ukrainian customers. Nordea Bank ABP also waived transaction fees on donations to charities offering emergency aid.
DONATIONS OVER $5 MLN

Multinational firms and their foundations have pledged cash for aid organisations, including around $16 million from Danish toymaker Lego, $10 million each from crypto giant Binance and Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), and $5 million each from Biedronka-owner Jeronimo Martins, French luxury group LVMH, U.S. internet giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to propose its landmark climate risk rule as early as next Wednesday, March 16, said two people familiar with the agency's planning.
One of the people, who spoke anonymously about private agency plans, said the Wall Street regulator is ""committed"" to issuing the proposal by month end.
An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.
Last year, the SEC began working on its new measure that would require U.S.-listed companies to provide investors with detailed disclosures on how climate change could affect their business.
The move to issue the rule, which would be subject to public consultation, comes after a number of delays. The SEC initially said it would publish a draft in October, but Chair Gary Gensler subsequently pushed that deadline to January.
At issue: the agency was trying to decide whether it should require companies to disclose not only their own greenhouse gas emissions, but those generated by their suppliers and other partners. Media reports last month highlighted that the commissioners were divided on how far to go, Reuters previously reported.
Last month, however, lawmakers, including Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, criticized the agency and called for ""quick action"" on the issue. 
Corporate groups have said they will continue to push for a narrower final rule that will make it easier and less expensive to gather and report emissions data, and which will protect them from being sued over potential mistakes.
Advocates, however, will likely herald the agency's measure. 

""It's great to see the SEC beginning this important effort,"" said Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation and corporate governance at the Washington-based Center for American Progress.
""Investors and asset managers can only make sound investing decisions when they have standardized and comparable information about companies' greenhouse gas emissions.""

780,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:32PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday warned financial institutions to watch out for potential Russian sanctions evasion attempts following rafts of sanctions imposed by Washington on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an alert on Monday advising all financial institutions to be vigilant and laying out examples of red flags that it said would help identify sanctions evasion activity, including the use of shell companies.
""In the face of mounting economic pressure on Russia, it is vitally important for U.S. financial institutions to be vigilant about potential Russian sanctions evasion, including by both state actors and oligarchs,"" FinCEN Acting Director Him Das said in a statement. 
The United States has imposed several rounds of sanctions - targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, oligarchs, the central bank, and major lenders - after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""
FinCEN said in the alert on Monday that as a result of the measures, targeted Russian and Belarusian actors may seek to evade sanctions. The activities could be conducted through a variety of actors, the alert said, including convertible virtual currency exchangers and administrators.
The alert also warned of possible ransomware attacks.

FinCEN called on financial institutions to report suspicious activity related to possible sanctions evasion quickly and conduct risk-based customer due diligence.
""Although we have not seen widespread evasion of our sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency, prompt reporting of suspicious activity contributes to our national security and our efforts to support Ukraine and its people,"" Das said.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Monday, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to push oil prices to 14-year highs, stoking fears that red-hot inflation will be here to stay longer than expected and derail economic growth.
The S&P 500 fell 3.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4%, or 797 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6%.
The third round of Ukraine-Russia talks ended with both sides indicating little progress had been made in search of a resolution to the conflict. The failure to reach a breakthrough heightened concerns about the economic impact of soaring commodity prices including wheat, corn, nickel and oil.
Oil prices topped their highest level since 2008 after the U.S. said it was mulling imposing a ban on Russia oil and gas.
There is a hope the U.S. and Iran will reach a new nuclear deal, bringing much-needed Iranian oil barrels onto the market, but the potential supply from the Islamic Republic isn’t enough to offset the risk of loss of Russian oil.
“Iran could export up to 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, yet Russian crude oil exports total 4.6 million barrels per day,” Commerabank said in a note.
The surging in oil prices hurt airline stocks as higher fuel costs are expected to weigh on the growth. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) suffered heavy losses.  
Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest sector decliner, led by U.S. luxury fashion and apparel stocks on concerns that weaker investor sentiment in Europe will weigh on growth.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), PVH (NYSE:PVH), were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 15%.
Wedbush downgraded Ralph Lauren and PVH to neutral from outperform as both companies are “very reliant” on European growth, which will likely take a hit from the Ukraine-Russia conflict.  
The selling in bank stocks showed no sign of end. Regional banks including Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) and  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY) continued to take a hammering, while megacap banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (NYSE:BA) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were also deeply in the red.
In other news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) surged more than 37% after GameStop’s Chairman Ryan Cohen said the retailer should consider a sale and a spin-off its buybuy Baby chain. Cohen has a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond.
Mandiant (NASDAQ:MNDT) surged more than 16% on reports that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is reportedly in talks to acquire cyber security firm.
The broader market, which has slipped deeper in correction – a more than 10% loss from its recent peak – appears to be trying to find a bottom.
""Small-caps are starting to bottom …  a positive sign that U.S. equity markets in general are now searching for some type of bottom in earnest,” Janney Montgomery Scott, but added that “this does not necessarily preclude more volatility ahead.”"

Investing.com -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) recorded its third-highest attended weekend since movie theaters reopened in the summer of 2020, the company said Monday.
Still, AMC shares fell more than 8% for the day.
More than 4 million tickets were sold globally at AMC locations Thursday through Sunday, with AMC stating it was due to ""the strength of the successful opening weekend of THE BATMAN from Warner Bros. and DC."" 
The attendance outpaced the year-over-year attendance for the same weekend in 2019 and 2020.
According to the company's press release, AMC recorded a greater than 29% market share of THE BATMAN box office in the United States, with the top three theaters in the U. S. based on The Batman box office all AMCs. Furthermore, eight of the top 10 locations were AMCs.
In addition to ticket sales, the company recorded its third-highest popcorn sales weekend since reopening, while two of its ""key strategic"" location acquisitions in 2021 saw big attendance numbers. 
""We are gratified to see AMC's U.S. market share of 29% be this high, signaling that millions of guests chose to see this very successful theatrical release with us. And materially leading the way were our premium screens, namely IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) at AMC, Dolby Cinema at AMC and PRIME at AMC,"" said Adam Aron, chairman and CEO of AMC.
Peer Cinemark Holdings Inc (NYSE:CNK) dropped 15% on Monday as well.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a ""big wake up call"" for European governments hoping to balance the need for fossil fuels with environmental concerns, the head of French energy giant TotalEnergies said on Monday.
Europe depends on Russian natural gas, which supplies around 40% of its needs. On Monday, benchmark gas prices shot to their highest on record, as traders worried Russia could curtail supplies.
""What is happening today in Europe is a big wake up call to a lot of policy makers if they are serious about security of supply, affordability and of course climate change compatibility,"" TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. 
""We must think about the three parts of this triangle and not think that only one part is important.""
Europe aims to sharply reduce its reliance on fossil fuels in the coming decades to battle climate change, with governments restricting oil and gas production and financing of fossil fuel projects. 
While Europe's solar and wind power generation capacity has grown sharply in recent years, its power and energy systems remain heavily reliant on natural gas and coal.
Pouyanne said Europe needs to build more infrastructure to import additional LNG if it wants an alternative to Russian gas.
""The reality in Europe is that we don't have enough re-gas terminals today to replace the volume of piped gas from Russia by LNG.""
NO PRESSURE
Pouyanne said TotalEnergies did not come under government pressure to fully exit Russia following the Ukraine invasion.
TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy company that does not plan to fully exit Russia; BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) all announced their intentions to withdraw. TotalEnergies has said it will halt all new spending in Russia.
The French oil major holds a 19.4% stake in Novatek, Russia's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as a stake in the Novatek-led Arctic LNG project.
""I had discussions obviously with the highest authority in my country and there is no push from them for us to exit Russia,"" Pouyanne told a gathering of energy executives. 

Pouyanne said that Western sanctions on Russia exclude natural gas and that it would therefore be inconsistent for companies that produce the gas to exit the country. 
TotalEnergies nevertheless has stopped buying oil from Russia, Pouyanne added, although one its landlocked refineries in Germany continues to receive Russian crude by pipeline.

MILAN (Reuters) -Shares in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) hit record lows on Monday as the head of Italy's biggest phone group met investors to try to persuade them of the merits of his plans to revive the former phone monopoly.
The TIM roadshow comes ahead of a decision expected shortly on a 10.8 billion euro ($11.7 billion) takeover proposal made by U.S. fund KKR in November.
A board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal could be held next weekend once TIM's advisers complete their analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, said two sources close to the matter.
Ahead of their assessment this week, TIM's advisers have asked the U.S. fund to clarify whether the terms of its November offer still stand, the sources added.
TIM shares, which lost about 30% of their value in the final two sessions of last week, had another torrid day on Monday. The shares ended down 5.5% at 0.236 euros after touching a record low of 0.22 euros.
Volumes today were more than six time the 30-day average, with nearly 5% of voting capital changing hands.
The shares remain way below the 0.505 euro level at which the KKR approach was pitched. 
Backed by TIM's leading investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which billed KKR's proposal as too low, CEO Pietro Labriola's plan is centred around the structural separation of TIM's fixed-network business from its retail operations.
Last week Labriola said that KKR's plan for TIM was similar but that he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors, including minority shareholders. 
However, a third source said that some members of TIM's board of directors have reservations about ditching KKR's proposal without further talks with the fund.
Labriola was holding face-to-face meetings with investors in Milan and will also give a series of teleconference briefings between now and Wednesday, the sources said.
VIDEO MESSAGE
The sources said that Labriola had met representatives from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager and a main shareholder in TIM. Foreign institutional investors own 41.3% of the group.
Labriola, a veteran TIM executive who in January became TIM's fifth CEO in six years, sought to reassure employees about the future of the company in a video message to the group's 42,500 domestic staff over the weekend. 
Labriola urged them not to panic and to focus on serving customers and take pride in TIM's role as Italy's main telecoms operator.
""Many of you are worried; I am too, but make sure you distinguish between a healthy concern and panic,"" he said in the video.
The message went down badly with unions, which labelled his plan destructive and vowed to oppose it.

Hit by stiff competition in its core domestic market as well as regulatory constraints, debt-laden TIM reported a record 8.7 billion euro loss for 2021 and said it expected a low-teens decrease in its 2022 core profit, based on the current group structure..

(Reuters) -Intel Corp's self-driving car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States on Monday, setting the stage for what is expected to be one of the biggest stock market flotations of the year. 
The move to list Mobileye is part of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s broader strategy under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger to turn around its core business.
Investors have made big bets on new technologies in the business of global transportation over the past few years, and Intel is aiming to take advantage of the demand for autonomous vehicles by listing Mobileye's shares. 
Technology powering driverless cars has been gaining traction even among legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which have been investing on models with features such as driver-assist and self-driving systems.
Intel, however, is looking to test capital markets at a time when investor interest in IPOs has waned significantly due to recent stock market volatility amid fears of looming rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. 
Traditional U.S. IPOs have raised about $2.33 billion since the beginning of the year, compared to $26.67 billion during the same period last year, according to Dealogic. In recent weeks, several companies have postponed or scrapped their plans to go public. 
BLOCKBUSTER DEAL
Intel did not disclose more details about the IPO, but it had previously said it would receive the majority of the proceeds from the share sale. Some of those funds will be used to build more Intel chip plants, Gelsinger said in December.
The chip giant will also retain a majority stake in the unit after the IPO, it had said previously. In December, Reuters and other media outlets reported that the IPO could value Mobileye at more than $50 billion, although Mobileye may now struggle to get the same valuation given the recent market volatility, people familiar with the matter said. 
Mobileye, an Israeli company that Intel bought for about $15.3 billion in 2017, uses a camera-based system with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance in driverless cars.
The company, founded in 1999, plans to eventually build its own ""lidar"" sensor to help its cars map out a three-dimensional view of the road. It is currently using lidar units from Luminar Technologies on its initial robotaxis in the meantime.

Mobileye, which counts BMW, Audi, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and General Motors as its clients, has been a bright spot for Intel, which faces stiff competition in the chip-making segment from rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. 
Gelsinger has been under pressure from activist investors to consider spinning off Intel's chip operations, but the company still plans to invest billions to expand its chip-manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and grow its market share.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Soaring grain prices in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine are hurting Brazilian meatpackers, but trade disruptions facing Ukrainian and Russian meat producers may be an opportunity to boost Brazil's share in global trade, industry sources said. 
Russia and Ukraine together account for about 29% of global wheat exports and 19% of corn exports, both of which can be used as livestock feed.
Depending on how the situation plays out, the conflict may also lead to Brazil accessing markets served by competitors. According to the sources, one potential development is Europe scrapping a ban on several Brazilian meatpackers imposed in 2018 after a food sector scandal. 
""The industry is prepared to cover gaps and support the food security of nations that may be short-supplied by the likely suspension or decrease in exports of chicken and pork from Russia and Ukraine,"" said Ricardo Santin, president of meat lobby ABPA.
ABPA, which represents companies including JBS and BRF in Brazil, the largest global exporter of chicken meat, said Russia and Ukraine compete with Brazilians in important markets of Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
If Ukrainian exporters stop shipping meats amid difficulties caused by the war, Santin said Europe will face a ""great challenge."" 
According ABPA, there are about 20 Brazilian plants currently suspended by the Europeans. 

Ukraine's poultry exports totals about 430,000 tonnes per year, representing some 10% of what Brazil traded in 2021, said Alcides Torres, director at Scot Consultoria.
""If Europe really needs Brazilian meat, it is clear that these suspended slaughterhouses .... will be reviewed quickly,"" Torres said.

The investment group said its new board, led by Chairman Mervyn Davies, would work to protect the 120,000 jobs associated with the group's holdings after the European Union slapped sanctions on Fridman and co-founder Petr Aven last week.
LetterOne, which counts telecoms groups Veon and Turkcell in its portfolio, said the three departing directors - German Khan, Alexey Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov - had not been sanctioned but they believed stepping down was the right thing to do.
Fridman and Aven's shareholdings are frozen indefinitely and they cannot receive dividends or any other financial benefit from LetterOne, the company said.

Both said EU allegations against them were false and defamatory.

""As we have seen time and again, corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,"" Chapek wrote. ""Instead, they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame. Simply put, they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change."" 
Disney's Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, is the company's largest theme park. Its sprawling businesses also include movie studios, broadcast and cable television networks, streaming services, cruise lines and retail products. 
Florida’s House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed bill last month that Democrats denounced as being anti-LGBTQ. The legislation, referred to by opponents as the “don’t say gay” bill, has stirred national controversy as the debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender has grown increasingly partisan.

Critics, including Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of company co-founder Roy O. Disney, tweeted Sunday that she is ""deeply angered by Disney thinking it can look the other way for this hateful 'Don't Say Gay' bill."" She also took issue with Disney's political contributions to the legislators who drafted the bill. 
Chapek wrote that Disney has not made political contributions ""based on this issue,"" and has supported Republican and Democratic legislators who have taken positions on both sides of the measure. He said the company's new chief corporate affairs officer, Geoff Morrell, will reassess the company's advocacy strategies -- including political giving.

(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc revealed a more than $5 billion stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), as oil prices soared to their highest level in about a decade.
Berkshire said it owns 91.2 million Occidental shares, or nearly 10% of those outstanding, including 61.4 million bought from March 2 to March 4.
Buffett's company disclosed the stake in a Friday night filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Occidental's share price, which jumped 45% last week, rose as much as 4.7% on Monday before retreating.
The shares were down 4.8% at $53.45 in early afternoon trading. Occidental traded below $9 as recently as October 2020.
Oil prices have surged higher following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, prompting fears of supply shortages.
Berkshire also has warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares at $59.62 each, or $5 billion.
It obtained these in 2019, when it also purchased $10 billion of preferred stock - which throws off $800 million of annual dividends - to help finance Occidental's $35.7 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
News of Berkshire's latest investment came as billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, a critic of the Anadarko merger, last week exited his own Occidental stake.
Berkshire did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment.
Buffett had lamented in his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter that ""we find little that excites us"" in equity markets.
The billionaire's Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose businesses include Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad, ended December with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents.
It also invested $350.7 billion in equities such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co.
Berkshire did not say whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made the latest Occidental investment, though larger investments are normally Buffett's.
Combs and Weschler recently invested a combined $34 billion.
Buffett has gone six years without a major acquisition, and Berkshire has slowed share repurchases following a record $27 billion in 2021.

James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" in a research report said ""we are becoming more optimistic about cash deployment"" at Berkshire.
He said Berkshire could buy the 8.9% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy it does not already own.

(Reuters) -Billionaire investor Ryan Cohen said on Sunday he now owns nearly 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and wants the housewares retailer to explore strategic alternatives that include a full sale of the company.
Cohen, who co-founded online pet products retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and is chairman of the board of videogame retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), criticized Bed Bath & Beyond, which is worth roughly $1.6 billion, for an ""overly ambitious"" strategy, overpaying its top executives and failing to reverse market share losses.
""We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby, Inc and a full sale of the Company,"" Cohen wrote in a letter to the company's board.
Cohen said in the letter he owns 9.8% of the company through his investment company RC Ventures LLC. 
Bed Bath & Beyond said it would review Cohen's letter. Shares of the highly shorted company were up about 60% at $26 on Monday. 
Short interest in the company has risen 12% over the past week, with 30.9 million shares shorted, about 33.3% of the free float, S3 Partners said. The analytics company expects the trend to reverse on the back of the RC Ventures news this morning.
Bed Bath & Beyond was a part of the meme stocks phenomenon last year where retail investors fueled eye-popping rallies in certain shares coordinating through online message boards Reddit and Stocktwits, costing short sellers billions of dollars. 
Cohen is pushing for changes after three activists and the company reached a settlement in 2019 where four new directors were added to the board. The group criticized the retailer for failing to adapt to shoppers' growing preferences to buy online.
Soon after the settlement, the company hired Mark Tritton as CEO, but Cohen said Tritton has failed to navigate supply chain volatility and presided over a 14% drop in core sales from a year ago in the most recent quarter.
Still Tritton was paid about $27 million over the past two fiscal years, Cohen said, noting it was far more than what CEOs earned at far bigger retailers including Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).

Cohen said he is focused on the long term and won't criticize management for laying the foundation for future value creation, underscoring his own style at GameStop where he has given few details about how he plans to resuscitate the company.
At Bed Bath & Beyond, Cohen wants the company to streamline what he calls a ""scattershot strategy"" and consider separating the buybuy Baby chain or selling the whole company, which he says might be better off owned by a private equity company.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Surging raw materials costs, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, could set back the dream of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk and other auto executives to roll out more affordable electric vehicles.
Rising prices of nickel, lithium and other materials threaten to slow and even temporarily reverse the long-term trend of falling costs of batteries, the most expensive part of EVs, hampering the broader adoption of the technology, said Gregory Miller, an analyst at industry forecaster Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
And that is on top of a supply chain already snarled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global chip shortage.
""Rising raw material prices certainly have the potential to delay the timeline on cost parity between EV and ICE (NYSE:ICE) vehicles, which could hamper the wider adoption of EVs,"" Miller said, referring to internal-combustion engine vehicles that dominate the market. 
This year could mark the first year-over-year increase in the average price of lithium-ion battery cells, he said. 
The conflict in Ukraine has only raised the stakes, pushing nickel and aluminium prices to record highs on Monday on growing fears exports from leading producer Russia could be disrupted. Lithium prices also have increased, more than doubling since year end, as supply fell short of rising demand. 
Russia’s largest miner Nornickel produces around 20% of the world’s supplies of high purity class 1 nickel, which is used in EV batteries, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Russia is also a large provider of aluminum, used in batteries.
To be sure, oil prices, which jumped to the highest levels since 2008 on Monday, could serve as a counterbalance, spurring greater interest in EVs after years of growing demand for gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
Rising EV prices - marked by hikes over the past year by Tesla and startup Rivian Automotive - matter because mainstream consumers are not going to pay a massive premium for a technology that many do not yet fully embrace.
The average EV sold for almost $63,000 in January in the United States, about 35% higher than the overall industry average for all vehicles of just over $46,000, according to research firm Cox Automotive. 
While consumers worry less now about being stranded without power on the roadside, price remains a major concern, according to a Cox survey.
SLOWER EV ADOPTION
""Anything that adds to the cost will impede EV adoption,"" Cox analyst Michelle Krebs said. 
EVs made up about 9% of total global vehicle sales last year according to the International Energy Agency, and consulting firm AlixPartners expects that share to hit about 24% by 2030.
More than half of consumers are not prepared to pay $500 extra upfront to buy an EV, despite lower operating costs, according to a 2021 study by OC&C Global Speedometer on consumers in the United States, China and other countries.
That could put vehicle makers in a bind if they want to attract mainstream buyers, rather than luxury customers to whom they currently cater. 
Tesla raised the price for its least expensive Model 3 sedan by 18% to $44,990 since December 2020, as supply chain woes weigh. Musk also said in January that Tesla is not developing a $25,000 car he promised during 2020 battery day, saying there are too many things on his plate. 
Some U.S. dealers have taken advantage of vehicle shortages to charge more for EVs, sparking warnings from automakers like Hyundai and Ford.
Rivian tried last week to push through a 20% price increase on its electric pickups and SUVs to offset higher parts costs, but retreated for those who had already placed orders when faced with a backlash that included possible sale cancellations.
Another EV startup, Lucid Group Inc, has not raised prices yet, but Chief Financial Officer Sherry House said in February the company was ""definitely studying price"" to offset higher supply chain costs.
In China, lithium price hikes have pressured the makers of such entry-level models as Great Wall's Ora EV and Wuling Hong Guang's Mini EV because they have less room to push through a higher price tag, investors said.
For startups, the pressure is particularly intense.
""If you're a small company, you don't have the ability to tell your suppliers to give you a lower price,"" said Brett Smith, technology director at Center for Automotive Research. 
Battery makers typically have long-term contracts with automakers, under which prices rise to reflect the increased cost of key raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, industry officials said. 

LG Energy Solution, a supplier to Tesla and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), said raw materials account for 70% or 80% of the cost of its batteries.
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said battery producers started increasing lithium-ion cell prices late last year in response to the higher raw material prices they had seen throughout 2021.

ROME (Reuters) -Prime Minister Mario Draghi has approved a decree allowing Italy's state broadcaster RAI to cut its holding in towers unit Rai Way below 51%, three government officials said, in a move expected to trigger sector consolidation.
The decree could pave the way for merger talks between Rai Way and EI Towers, the officials said, a long-mooted tie-up that would create a group worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the television and radio mast sector.
Rome is reversing a provision made in 2014, when Italy ruled that at least 51% of Rai Way should remain in public ownership due to the strategic importance of its infrastructure.
The decree needs approval from Italy's audit court before it can enter into force, the sources told Reuters.
EI Towers launched a takeover bid for Rai Way in 2015, but this was thwarted by the centre-left coalition government of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
At that time, former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's family controlled EI Towers through broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) and Renzi did not want to see the media magnate take control of Rai Way's assets.
""Had it been done then, there could have been synergies on investments to repurpose spectrum bands,"" Equita SIM senior analyst Stefano Gamberini said.
""But a tie-up would still create a more profitable player with greater cash generation capacity.""
RAI holds 65% of Rai Way, while EI Towers is now 60% controlled by fund F2i and 40% owned by MediaForEurope (MFE), which is Mediaset's new name.
The book value of MFE's 40% stake in unlisted EI Towers is around 437 million euros, based on MFE's 2020 financial statements, implying an overall valuation of EI Towers at more than 1 billion euros.
Listed in 2014, Rai Way has a market capitalisation of approximately 1.3 billion euros.
Gamberini said Rai Way's very low debt burden, currently in line with its core profit, would rise in a tie-up with EI Towers but still leave room for an extraordinary dividend Equita estimated could top 1 euros per share.
RAI has traditionally been subject to political influence and the potential merger of its towers arm with a private player is opposed by several ruling politicians.
Michele Anzaldi, a lawmaker in Renzi's Italia Viva party and member of an influential parliamentary committee supervising the state broadcaster, told Reuters the government's move was ""a grave measure, taken without any transparency on what this extra cash in RAI's coffers will be used for.""
According to one of the sources, governance agreements between RAI and the shareholders of Rai Way's prospective merger partner will ensure Italian strategic interests in any deal.

Draghi's office, RAI and F2i declined to comment. Rai Way, EI Towers and MFE were not immediately available for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines said on Monday it has indefinitely suspended two flights to India after halting flights that flew over Russia last week.
The Chicago-based airline said last week it had stopped service between San Francisco and Delhi and between Newark, New Jersey, and Mumbai. The airline said it plans to continue flying to Delhi from both Chicago and Newark.
The Biden administration last week joined the European Union and Canada in banning Russian airlines from U.S. airspace.

United's last Delhi-to-San Francisco and Mumbai-to-Newark flights were on March 2. The Mumbai flight had to stop in Bangor, Maine, on the way to Newark. United's last U.S.-departing legs of those two flights to India were on Feb. 28.
Without access to Russian airspace some international flights to Asia are taking significantly longer routes and some must make a stop. Prior to the current turmoil, about 1,000 U.S. flights a week -- including many cargo flights -- typically flew over Russia, officials said.

(Reuters) - The number of women employed in senior management of the UK financial sector will take 30 years to reach parity with men at the current pace, a UK government-backed initiative said on Monday as it announced steps to kick start ""urgent action"".
The Woman in Finance Charter (WIFC) was founded in 2016 by the Treasury in the form of a voluntary agreement among over 400 institutions, including the Bank of England, to push for equal gender representation in the financial sector. 
Yet the proportion of women in senior management roles has increased by only 1% to 32% in the two years to 2020, said Amanda Blanc, chief executive of British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) and ""champion"" of the initiative.
""Progress towards gender equality in the financial sector remains frustratingly low,"" Blanc said. ""Women, companies and society cannot afford to wait 30 years when we can achieve this in 10.""
In a paper co-published with Bain & Co on the eve of International Women's day, the WIFC, drawing on the results of a survey issued to all signatories, outlined some guidelines to close the current gender gap. 
Its recommendations include a commitment to interview 50% women for roles at all levels, offer flexible options for all job and vacancies, advocate zero tolerance towards exclusionary behaviour and hold CEOs financially accountable for gender targets.

The research showed gender diversity is often not seen as a business issue and prioritised accordingly, with only 18% of signatories conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis linked to corporate initiatives.
""We've got to work quicker and harder, for the sake of women, for the sake of society and because a more diverse business is a more productive and innovative one,"" said Blanc.

(Reuters) -Board members at Russian companies, including the British chairmen of gold and silver producer Polymetal and metals and hydropower group EN+, have quit in response to the conflict in Ukraine.
Polymetal said on Monday Chairman Ian Cockerill and five other non-executive independent directors — Ollie Oliveira, Tracey Kerr, Italia Boninelli, Victor Flores and Andrea Abt — had left the London-listed company's board.
Polymetal gave no further details of the departures that coincide with concerns over the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions on Russia.
Russia has called the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation.""
Directors realise ""the optics of being linked to these businesses are toxic,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""As soon as the (British) Institute of Directors, hardly an organisation known for its radicalism, pushed for Britons involved to take the jump this mass exodus was almost an inevitability,"" Mould said.
The lobby group last week called on British directors to end any involvement in governance roles in the Russian economy.
Polymetal's London-listed shares fell 85% over the last two weeks, although they rebounded on Monday. The London Stock Exchange said it cancelled some trades in Polymetal on Monday after an unusual 726% jump in its shares in early trading.
EN+ Chairman Gregory Barker is also stepping down after more than four years in the role, the company announced on Monday.
Barker is a former British minister from the Conservative Party and several British politicians have said he should fully cut links with EN+ and its sanctioned Russian founder Oleg Deripaska, the Sunday Times reported. Another EN+ board member, independent director Joan MacNaughton, also resigned.
Barker will be replaced by Christopher Bancroft Burnham, a U.S. national. Barker could lead a new company that EN+ is considering carving out from its aluminium business Rusal.
Russia-focused gold miner Nordgold also said four of its directors - Michael Nossal, Brian Beamish, David Morgan and John Munro - stepped down from the board effective immediately. 
Nossal, who had been non-executive chair, is an Australian national, Morgan is British while Beamish and Munro are South African. Nordgold, a private company, had planned to list in London but postponed its IPO in June last year. 
London-listed Russian internet group VK said on Monday three of its non-executive directors — Jaco Van Der Merwe, Charles Searle and Mark Remon Sorour — as well as Chief Financial Officer Matthew Hammond had resigned.
Russian steelmaker Evraz said on Monday non-executive director Sandra Stash was leaving its board with immediate effect.

Shares in London-listed Evraz have fallen by nearly 80% over the last two weeks but recovered some losses on Monday and were up 51% by 1245 GMT. Polymetal's shares were last up 18% at 199.80 pence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Monday said it was proposing new rules to cut smog-forming and greenhouse gas emissions from heavy duty vehicles.
The EPA is proposing to require cuts in nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy trucks that would result in a drop of 47% to 61% by 2045, the first proposed cuts to NOx for heavy duty trucks since 2001. The new standards would begin in the 2027 model year.
The administration also proposes https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-03/hd2027stds-nprm-2022-03.pdf stricter new greenhouse gas emissions standards for some types of heavy vehicles. 
""These new standards will drastically cut dangerous pollution by harnessing recent advancements in vehicle technologies from across the trucking industry as it advances toward a zero-emissions transportation future,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.
The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association said it would work ""with EPA to ensure that the final version of today’s rule is practical, technically feasible, cost-effective, and will result in the necessary fleet turnover to achieve the nation’s environmental objectives.""
The group noted engines made after 2010 emit roughly 30 times less NOx than those made before 2010, but only about 50% of the fleet has turned over. 
The EPA also proposes lengthening emission warranty periods.
The EPA said the rules would dramatically improve air quality could reduce up to 2,100 fewer premature deaths and 3.1 million fewer cases of asthma symptoms and other health issues.
EPA separately plans to set new greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles as soon as 2030.
The EPA estimates the program will cost manufacturers $19 billion to $31 billion through 2045 but will have net benefits of up to $220 billion.

EPA said the rules could result in up to 2% increase in Class 8 trucks in the months before the 2031 standards begin and a commensurate decrease in sales in the year after they take effect.
Separately, the Transportation Department announced $1.5 billion in funding to help state and local governments purchase electric transit buses and low-emission models and $2.2 billion in funding to 35 transit agencies in 18 states.

LONDON (Reuters) - European asset managers Carmignac and Fidelity International will no longer buy Russian securities, they said on Monday, joining a string of fund managers who have made similar announcements since Russia invaded Ukraine.
U.S. value investor Brandes Investment Partners also said it had put a moratorium on deploying new capital to Russian securities.
Asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and abrdn have already said they are halting purchases of Russian securities or plan to reduce existing holdings as western governments impose tough sanctions on Russia.
But efforts by investors to cut positions have been complicated by a Russian ban on local brokers from selling securities held by foreigners. 
""We have decided not to purchase any Russian securities until further notice,"" Carmignac, which has 42 billion euros ($45.6 billion) of assets under management, said in a statement.
""We are committed to divesting from any remaining Russian securities in our portfolios, considering extra-financial aspects as well as market conditions, in order to preserve the interests of our clients, our primary objective.""
The firm's emerging market fund Carmignac Portfolio EM Debt had the world's longest Russia debt position in January at over 43%, industry tracker Morningstar data shows.
Carmignac has already cut its position in Russian debt as well as in shares and the rouble, a spokesperson said.
""Since the end of January, we have adopted a more cautious position and have either reduced our exposures in the wake of the deterioration of the situation and/or implemented some hedging strategies,"" it said. 
Carmignac funds that contain Russian assets have no more than 2% in Russia, the spokesperson added.
Fidelity International said it would not invest in Russia and Belarus ""for the foreseeable future"" and was looking at ways to cut its existing exposure.
The asset manager said it had been marking down prices of Russian securities in its funds and that where there is no trade, prices could be adjusted to zero.
Vanguard Group also said that it had implemented international sanctions imposed against Russian institutions and is working to further reduce its exposure to Russia.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said its London-listed global emerging markets income trust had only 0.25% in Russian equities as of March 4, versus 3.6% at the end of January.
Invesco said its exposure to Russia and Ukraine was ""very small"".

More than $3 billion in unlisted funds exposed to Russia were suspended last week, while several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also frozen.

(Reuters) - European stocks ended off session lows on Monday, helped by a 4.3% rally in energy stocks as oil prices rose above $130 a barrel, but inflation fears amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict saw German and Italian shares confirm a bear market. 
London's commodity-heavy FTSE 100 lost the least, down 0.4% with oil majors BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Shell (LON:RDSa) jumping 3.8% and 8%, respectively, as the U.S. and Western allies weigh a ban on importing Russian oil over its invasion of Ukraine which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". [O/R]
Europe's largest economy, Germany, is not currently planning to stop importing Russian oil, gas and coal but is keeping the option open, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Monday.
""Germany is one of those European economies who is going to get a severe hit if the allies and the U.S. impose sanctions on Russian oil,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. 
""We are already at skyrocketing inflation... We could see a situation where we have a high inflation and high unemployment and a weakened global growth. A stagflation is, unfortunately, a very highly likely scenario.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 index cut losses of around 3% to close at a near one-year low, down 1.1%. Banking and auto stocks led declines. 
The German DAX and Italy's MIB have shed more than 20% from their record closing highs on Jan. 5, confirming bear market levels. The indexes were down 2.0% and 1.4% respectively for the day. 
""We were expecting European stocks to outperform their U.S. peers (this year). But, right now, with the war at Germany's doorstep, it's not going to be the case anymore.""
The euro-zone bank index tumbled 4.1% to a 13-month low ahead of a European Central Bank meeting later this week, with mixed views about how the central bank will respond to the potential economic impact of the Ukraine conflict.
Shares in UniCredit, Raiffeisen and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), among banks exposed to Russia, all fell between 4.2% and 5.7%. 

Russia supplies accounted for 17% of global natural gas consumption, 40% of Western European consumption as of 2021, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) note.
Italian steel pipe maker Tenaris surged 13.0%. With Russian steel exports expected to lose access to the European market, Jefferies sees a market opportunity for established producers like Tenaris and France's Vallourec of about $200 million.

The biotech firm fell as much as 7.3% on Monday amid a broader market selloff and has erased more than $50 billion in value this year. Investors were concerned over the future revenue of Covid-19 vaccines and increasing competition in the space. The stock has lost more than 70% from its record closing high of $484.47 set in August 2021. 
“Increasing competition and lack of visibility” about future sales has led to a loss of investor interest across the Covid-19 complex, Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh, who has a market perform rating on Moderna, said in an interview. 
Moderna soared during the pandemic as it raced to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. Its 143% gain last year made it the third-best stock in the S&P 500. It’s been on a breakneck ascent upward since debuting in 2018, skyrocketing by 434% in 2020. 
By 2022, investors were looking ahead to future Covid-19 vaccine demand amid growing debate about the timing and need for boosters, as interest in pandemic-focused healthcare names waned. Impending Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have also hurt sentiment across global stock markets. The S&P 500 Index has dropped 11% this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index is down 17%.
Among other vaccine makers, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. have each fallen by at least 50% this year, while the S&P 500 Health Care Index has declined 7.9%. 
“I think there’s a Covid loss of interest,” SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch, who has a market perform rating on BioNTech and does not cover Moderna, said in an interview. “I see it across the board.”

(Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine last week, some of social media's youngest users experienced the conflict from the front lines on TikTok.
Videos of people huddling and crying in windowless bomb shelters, explosions blasting through urban settings and missiles streaking across Ukrainian cities took over the app from its usual offerings of fashion, fitness and dance videos. 
Ukrainian social media influencers uploaded bleak scenes of themselves wrapped in blankets in underground bunkers and army tanks rolling down residential streets, juxtaposed against photos of blooming flowers and laughing friends at restaurants that honored more peaceful memories of their hometowns.
They urged their followers to pray for Ukraine, donate to support the Ukrainian military and demanded Russian users in particular to join anti-war efforts.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a ""special operation,"" is the latest example of the central role TikTok has played in bringing news and current events to the app's large Gen Z audience. Its famed algorithm is known for serving trending content even if users do not follow certain people, allowing topics to quickly go viral among its 1 billion monthly users.
The app has become so influential in this conflict that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to ""TikTokers"" as a group that could help end the war, in a speech directed at Russian citizens. Some TikTokers picked up where the politician left off.
A Ukrainian travel blogger named Alina Volik, who has over 36,000 followers on TikTok, took a break from posting highlights of her trips to Egypt, Spain and Turkey, to upload videos of life in the invasion, of emergency backpacks filled with first aid supplies and of sealed windows to protect against glass shards in a blast. In TikTok videos posted on Monday, Volik also urged her international followers to watch her Instagram Stories to ""see the truth"" about Ukraine.
In an email to Reuters, Volik said she wanted to combat misinformation in the Russian news that the country's actions were a ""military operation"" rather than a war that is hurting Ukrainians.
Montages of residential buildings destroyed by missiles, empty grocery store shelves and long lines of cars piled up outside gas stations could be seen on the TikTok pages of top Ukrainian influencers.
""@zaluznik"" who has 2 million followers, posted one such montage on Sunday with the caption ""Russians open your eyes!""
Russian influencers have also taken to the app to share their reaction. Niki Proshin, who has over 763,000 TikTok followers, said in a video on Thursday that ""normal people"" in Russia do not support the war.
""None of my friends and none of the people I personally talk to supported today's events,"" he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine.
On Monday, Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor demanded the app stop including military-related content in recommended posts to minors, saying much of the content was anti-Russian in character. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Online misinformation researchers warned that false information about the conflict were now mixed in with authentic ones and has spread widely on TikTok and other tech platforms including Meta Platforms's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube.
Footage of military simulator video game Arma 3, images of explosions from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza Strip, old footage of heavy firing and animations of flying aircraft have been shared on social media sites as if they depict the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.
""We continue to closely monitor the situation, with increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence,"" a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that it works with fact checking organizations. 
Some Ukrainian TikTok users have made it a mission to share information and spread awareness with Western audiences. 
""I want people to understand this is not a joke, this is a serious situation that Ukrainians face,"" Marta Vasyuta, 20, said in an interview on Monday.

One of Vasyuta's TikTok videos showed what appeared to be a missile in the sky with the caption ""Kyiv 4:23 am."" It had over 131,000 comments by Monday as users flooded the video to offer their prayers and express disbelief.
""Never thought I would get WAR updates on TIKTOK,"" commented one user.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has catapulted defence spending up the political agenda in Europe and could herald a new era of purchases led by Germany, according to weapons makers gathering at an arms fair in Saudi Arabia this week.
The World Defense Show, where Europe's Airbus, MBDA and Leonardo are exhibiting alongside nearly 600 other weapons makers, is taking place amid the largest assault on an European state in 70 years. 
The conflict has reignited interest in security issues after years of European defence spending cuts and fatigue following NATO failures in Afghanistan. 
Germany, which has long played down the role of its military in foreign policy, Denmark and Poland have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.
""There was peace for decades and people thought there would be peace forever. Unfortunately, that assumption has been proven wrong,"" Hristo Ibouchev, the executive director of Bulgarian firearms and munitions maker Arsenal, told Reuters.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Berlin could buy F-35 stealth warplanes from the United States, but also that future advanced weaponry would be purchased from European consortia.
The German budget this year will allocate 100 billion euros ($109 billion) for a one-time increase in defence spending, Scholz said on Feb. 27, which is more than double the entire 2021 defence bill of 47 billion euros.
""The German announcement alone is a new era of defence spending for the EU if it's followed through on,"" manager of Jane's Defence Budgets Andrew MacDonald told Reuters, predicting such a major cultural shift would likely see others follow suit.
Some executives were sceptical of any dramatic increase, bemoaning what they see as years of sluggish investment and predicting states would not follow through on new commitments. 
Others argued EU states, after years of Russian aggression like the 2014 annexation of Crimea, were already paying more attention to security and this war would just ramp plans up.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation. 
""The defence role is changing dramatically,"" an European executive said, predicting higher spending not only because of the war but also because former U.S. President Donald Trump's ""American First"" policy underscored the need for self-reliance. 
At the fair, Russia's weapons makers displayed precision guided missiles and artillery like those used by its forces besieging Ukrainian cities.
Russian executives declined to comment on whether their firms could still be paid for exports amid Western sanctions on banks and other businesses aimed at crippling Russia's economy. 
Western executives said the sanctions would make it difficult for Russian firms to be paid, but not impossible.
Elsewhere, armoured vehicles and other weaponry at a near-empty Ukrainian booth will be sent back as soon as the trade show finishes to be used in the conflict.

""Ukraine is in martial law and everything that can be used for the Ukrainian army will be used for the Ukrainian army,"" said the sole representative of a Ukrainian state defence firm.

Investing.com -- Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall told investors in a note Monday that Netflix Inc's (NASDAQ:NFLX) long-term net adds are more likely 20 million. 
According to TheFly, the analyst cited a deep dive he did into global connectivity and subscriber penetration. Cahall was quoted by the stock market news site as saying net adds are ""more likely 20m or better than 15m or worse.""
He added that if correct, Netflix shares are floored, and earnings per share estimates will trend higher. 
Cahall explained that his analysis will take time to take shape, and the note is a ""foundation for patient investors.""
Pointing back to connectivity, the analyst says data suggests there will be 110 million or more new broadband and mobile phone connections per year on average over the coming years, and at the current valuation, he believes Netflix shares are pricing in something nearer to his bear case.
However, he is ""extremely confident"" that the average net adds will exceed 15 million in the medium term.

Investing.com – Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) stock traded 7.5% lower Monday as the retailer disclosed long-term growth targets that fell short of expectations.
The company's plans to grow sales by a low-single-digit percentage annually and make Sephora a $2 billion annual sales business come in at the time when the retailer has been under pressure from activist investors to consider a sale and unlock value from its real estate. One such investor, hedge fund Engine Capital which owns around 1% of the company, has been urging the department store chain to consider separation of its faster growing e-commerce business.
‘Sephora at Kohl’s’ stores is an attempt to position the company as a beauty destination. At these stores, customers can explore an assortment of prestige makeup, skincare, hair, and fragrance brands. The company plans to have 850 of them by 2023, it said last week, while disclosing its fourth quarter results.
For most retailers, digital is the faster growing business compared to their legacy physical stores. Financial investors thus see more value in them and consider the old businesses as dragging down the more lucrative piece, and hence the push for such sales. Kohl's statement today didn't reflect the company meeting those demands. 
Kohl’s also plans to open more than 100 smaller format shops to attract new customers over the next four years. CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC these stores would be around 35,000 square feet, compared to about 80,000 square feet that many Kohl’s outlets go up to.
The company said it will target operating margins of 7-8% annually and per share earnings growth of a mid-to-high single-digit percentage.
According to CNBC, Macellum Advisors, another activist investor, called Kohl’s results disappointing, saying it remained skeptical of the retailer’s future, given the current board of directors and management configuration.
Kohl’s fourth quarter total revenue rose about 6% to $6.5 billion. Adjusted EPS fell by 2 cents to $2.20.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) -Deloitte and EY will sever links with Russia, they said on Monday, mirroring moves by fellow Big Four accounting and consultancy firms KPMG and PwC.
The Big Four audit the books of a catalogue of blue-chip companies and their work is often key to businesses obtaining international investor backing.
""The EY global organisation will no longer serve any Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world,"" EY said in a statement, citing Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.

The bank, which currently operates in 60 countries and focuses on lending to mid-sized companies, said a bulk of the hires are expected to be in areas where it sees an increase in business activity, particularly the United States, China, Brazil, India and countries in Western Europe. 

The move comes at a time when the Wall Street institution has been cutting down its international footprint by exiting non-core markets. Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who took the helm last year, has looked to simplify the bank and bring its profitability more in line with its peers.
Earlier this year, Citigroup said it will exit its Citibanamex consumer banking business in Mexico and also announced a deal to sell its retail unit in Taiwan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's attempt to nix a lawsuit by shareholders accusing the Google parent company of fraudulently concealing a security glitch that left private user data exposed.
The justices left in place a lower court's ruling that revived the lawsuit brought over the 2018 incident that the company was slow to disclose, turning away Alphabet's appeal.
The lawsuit, led by the state of Rhode Island, was filed after the Wall Street Journal published an article in October 2018 that said Google concealed the exposure of private data for nearly 500,000 users of Google+ - a social network owned by Google - because it feared regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. The lawsuit accused the company of making false or misleading statements in violation of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act.
Alphabet's share price fell after the disclosure, reducing the Mountain View, California-based company's market value by more than $50 billion.
Google ultimately admitted it had discovered the data exposure in March 2018, though there was no evidence of misuse, and decided to shut down the consumer version of Google+.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco dismissed the lawsuit in February 2020, prompting the plaintiffs to appeal.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2021 decided that the lawsuit raised a ""strong inference"" that Alphabet's then-Chief Executive Larry Page and his successor, Sundar Pichai, knew about the problem and an internal memo on security matters but intentionally concealed the information from investors.
The 9th Circuit credited the plaintiff's argument that Alphabet stayed silent to ""buy time"" and avoid the spotlight that Meta Platform's  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was then under because Britain's Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from tens of millions of its users.

""Over the coming days, customers in Russia and Belarus will no longer be able to sign up for new accounts, initiate new contracts, or be visible in search. Existing contracts with talent and clients in the region will remain open, with final billing due by May 1, 2022,"" the freelancing platform stated.
The withdrawal of guidance was put down to ""rapidly evolving, increased risks and uncertainties,"" and an ""untenable operational position and dire geopolitical situation associated with the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine.""
Around 10% of Upwork's total revenue in 2021 was derived from work where the talent or the client was located in the region. Ukraine represented approximately 6%, and Russia and Belarus represented about 4% combined. Nearly all such revenue emanated from work performed by talent inside the region for clients in other parts of the world.
Upwork said it has seen a ""meaningful decrease"" in activity from talent in the region, most notably in Ukraine, since the start of the invasion in late February.
The company said it has provided financial and other support, including paying certain expenses for team members aiming to relocate from the affected region. In addition, Upwork added that it has already incurred or committed several million dollars of other unplanned expenses, including a donation of $1 million to Direct Relief International, and expects to incur further costs as events unfold. 
As a result, Upwork explained that the unforeseen expenses and decreased activity from talent in the region will impact its first-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results, including revenue and adjusted EBITDA."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Monday but were well off the lows posted overnight by futures contracts, as fears of a squeeze on global oil supplies receded a little. 
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had said on Sunday that the U.S. was actively talking with European allies about the possibility of imposing a full embargo on Russian oil, essentially putting 10% of world oil supply off limits and triggering a mad dash for alternative supplies. 
However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country wouldn't go along with any such initiative, arguing that there was no other way in the short term to guarantee European energy supply. Crude oil futures, which had surged as much as 17% overnight to a new 14-year high over $130 a barrel, fell back to trade below $120 a barrel by the opening on Wall Street.  That's still a level that has in the past led to widespread demand destruction and an economic slowdown.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 253 points, or 0.8%, at 33,362 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was effectively flat from Friday's close. All three had posted losses last week. 
Sentiment was also improved at the margins by the first sign of Russia tempering its demands with regard to finding a way to peace. Reuters quoted a Kremlin spokesman as saying that what it calls a 'special military operation' could end immediately, even without the replacement of the current Ukrainian government. However, its remaining demands - that Ukraine embrace neutrality and recognize the Russian conquest of Crimea and the independence of two breakaway 'republics' - are still unacceptable to a Ukrainian government that has been emboldened by the successful defense of nearly all the country's major cities and increasing signs of dysfunction in the Russian military. 
Among early movers, Bed Bath & Beyond stock (NASDAQ:BBBY) stood out with a 63% leap after news that Ryan Cohen, the founder of pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), had amassed a stake in the troubled retailer. Cohen has previously been welcomed as a savior for GameStop (NYSE:GME), another retailer trying to move beyond an outdated brick-and-mortar distribution model.  However, GameStop stock has struggled to keep the momentum Cohen gave it last year, when an army of retail investors bought into what they perceived as his vision for the company. GameStop stock was down 0.6% in early trading and is down 25% so far this year.
However, for the most part, stocks continued to slide on fears of the economic damage that the rise in global commodity prices and economic boycotts will do, notably in Europe, a key market for many U.S. companies.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 0.8% after it said it will suspend purchases of titanium and titanium products from a joint venture that it has in Russia, a venture on which it relies for lightweight components for the aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner. Problems in delivering the Dreamliner due to other production issues may have made that decision easier for the company. 
Boeing was joined over the weekend by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and accounting giants KPMG and PwC in pulling their products and services from Russia, while Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) further reduced the services they will offer in the country. The exodus of western companies from IKEA to Ford has put an increasingly harsh spotlight on those who have chosen to continue operating normally there, such as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Elsewhere, oil and gas companies continued to outperform on the prospect for windfall profits in the current quarter.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.3% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 0.9%, while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 3.2% after news that Carl Icahn has exited his stake in the company, removing a long-standing stock overhang. The company is also enjoying inflows from Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb). "

(Reuters) - Western sanctions banning several Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network with the potential threat of more to come if there is no end to the Ukraine conflict is likely to push Moscow to seek alternatives. 
Russia could in theory try to replace SWIFT's communications system that keeps international trade flowing smoothly. But any alternatives would add significant costs and risks for Russian businesses, money transfer experts said. The impact on Russia would be a reduction in imports and export volumes, at least in the short term, they added.
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a secure messaging system for banks, which facilitates rapid cross-border payments. Senders of SWIFT's secure messages can be confident they will be acted upon, as recipients are contractually liable if they fail to respond.
Russia has become one of the top users of the system, having had a board seat since 2015 and with more than 300 Russian banks using it as their primary method of communicating with domestic and international banks. 
Here is a rundown of the potential alternatives and why it is not easy to replace SWIFT: 
RUSSIAN MESSAGING PLATFORM 
Russian banks could move to a messaging system developed by Russia's central bank - System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS). Last year, the central bank was reported as saying domestic interbank traffic could easily be transferred to this platform.
A spokesperson for the Russian Central Bank was not immediately available for comment. 
But the ""SWIFT analogue"", as the central bank calls it, has limitations. It only operates during weekday working hours, while SWIFT operates 24 hours a day, every day. Also, SPFS messages have size limitations potentially making it less able to handle more complex transactions.
The SPFS system also lacks international connectivity.
“Currently, international services are limited to countries such as Armenia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan,” analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said this week.
Russian banks could in theory use SPFS messaging to send international payments to a connected bank in one of the countries that belong to the network. This bank could then use SWIFT to pipe the instruction into the international banking system, said Alistair Milne, Professor of Financial Economics at Loughborough University.
But a sudden surge in transactions via such a route would be likely to attract the attention of international regulators, thereby deterring the non-Russian partner bank from continuing this activity.
Professor Markos Zachariadis of University of Manchester, author of a book on SWIFT, said even if regulators did not take action, the banks could soon find themselves ostracised by Western banks, which have grown wary of engaging in activity seen as undermining sanctions.
CHINA’S CIPS SYSTEM
Another possible response to a SWIFT ban would be for Russian banks to connect to China’s CIPS payment platform. However, China’s platform can only be used for settling payments in yuan.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley said only 1.9% of international payments are made in the Chinese currency, against around 40% for U.S. dollars, which limited the effectiveness of CIPS as a method for funding cross-border trade.
Also, since CIPS itself relies on the SWIFT network for its operations, piggybacking on CIPS could also be seen as a breach of a SWIFT ban, analysts said.
Indirect CIPs participants still need to go through SWIFT to complete settlements.
BESPOKE, BILATERAL SYSTEMS
A more suitable SWIFT alternative for Russian banks would be to set up bespoke, bilateral systems using phones, faxes or messaging Apps with an overseas partner who would take payment from importers of Russian goods and make payments to exporters to Russia. 
Such a system was created by one foreign lender when Iran was cut off from the SWIFT network by sanctions tied to its nuclear programme, a former SWIFT executive familiar with the matter said.
This required a small team of people processing payments on the basis of sending two faxes and making two phone calls for each transaction.
But however effective, such systems are also prone to error and face security challenges. While SWIFT is plugged straight into a bank’s systems, faxes or WhatsApp messages may involve manual transfer of data.

Errors and the necessity for extra checks to avoid them would raise costs and could make smaller ticket transactions uneconomic, industry experts said. 
“It’s not an easy workaround” Zachariadis said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicle (EV) battery startup Britishvolt is to develop high-performance batteries with Aston Martin as the British luxury carmaker gears up to launch its first fully electric vehicle in 2025, the two companies said on Monday.
A joint research and development team from fictional secret agent James Bond's car brand and the battery company will design and develop battery packs and a battery management system. 
Aston Martin is the second carmaker customer for Britishvolt, which has also entered a battery partnership with Britain's Lotus.
By 2026 the Aston Martin plans to offer electric versions of all of its new models.
""Working together with Britishvolt, I believe we can create new technologies to power benchmark-setting Aston Martin electric cars that will match our reputation for high performance and ultra-luxury with the highest standards of sustainability,"" Aston Martin Chief Executive Tobias Moers said in a statement.
Last month Britishvolt launched a Series C funding round with a starting investment of 40 million pounds ($53 million) from mining giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
It has also secured UK government backing for a battery plant project in northern England, unlocking 1.7 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in private funding.

When the 3.8 billion pound, 45 GWh Blythe plant is fully operational in 2027 it should be able to produce battery packs for more than 450,000 electric vehicles per year.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded 0.6% lower in premarket Monday after the company suspended purchasing titanium from Russia.
""Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for airplane production, and we will continue to take the right steps to ensure long-term continuity,"" the company said.
The step holds wide implications for the planemaker's relationship with its largest supplier of the commodity, VSMPO-Avisma.
The titanium supplier is now reorienting its sales policy to other markets, it said in a statement.

VSMPO-Avisma, which is owned 25% by state conglomerate Rostec, is currently not under any sanctions.

825,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 09:01AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Russia is resuming a support programme for critically important firms, hoping to protect companies from the effects of international sanctions by reviving measures first introduced in 2020 to shield them from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has triggered an unprecedented wave of economic and financial sanctions from Western and allied governments, and of international firms suspending or ending business in Russia or with Russian companies.
In a statement, the Russian government said it was proposing a ""comprehensive package"", first introduced as an anti-crisis measure in 2020, to ""support the economy and business in the face of external sanctions"".
The measures will include state guarantees to enable the firms to restructure existing loans or take out new ones, as well as subsidies to help them recover costs.
The relevant firms will also be exempted from financial stress tests, the government said. 
Sectors that benefited from support during the COVID-19 crisis included banking and aviation.
President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and defended the invasion of Ukraine, saying Moscow needed to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine's east as well as its own interests.
The war and the sanctions have shattered the outlook for a commodity-dependent economy, already suffering 9% inflation before the invasion, that analysts had seen growing by around 2.5% this year in a poll conducted in January.
Moscow's stock exchanges have been closed since Feb. 25, after dropping sharply on news of the invasion.

But the rouble currency, which would usually have been supported by a surge in the price of oil, Russia's main export, has lost more than 40% of its value this year, despite the central bank more than doubling its benchmark interest rate to 20% last week.
On Monday, a holiday in Russia, it was being bid at 131.00 to the dollar in thin offshore trade, according to Refinitiv data. [RU/RUB]

BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire investor William Ackman has built a new stake in railroad operator  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP), returning to one of his most profitable investments as rail firms eye a boost from the drive to cut carbon emissions and as manufacturing is brought back to the United States and Mexico from abroad.
Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management reported owning 2.8 million Canadian Pacific shares at the end of Dec. 31, 2021, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. That would value the stake at roughly C$280 million ($220 million) at the stock's closing price on Friday, a fraction of Canadian Pacific's market value of about C$92 billion.
Pershing Square had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to delay disclosing its holding on a recent regulatory filing so that it could continue accumulating more stock. Ackman had told investors earlier this year that he had an undisclosed new position in the portfolio.
By Monday, Pershing Square owned an additional 12 million shares through forward contracts that it intends to exercise, Ackman said. The investment will make Pershing Square one of Canadian Pacific's top 20 shareholders.
With this new stake in Canadian Pacific, Ackman is going back to a company that had been one of Pershing Square's biggest winners, earning the firm some $2.6 billion on its investment.
Pershing Square first began buying into the railroad in September 2011, but was forced to sell in 2016 to pay back investors who were pulling out cash as the fund faced losses. Ackman called those sales one of the firm's ""greatest investment regrets."" 
Six years on Canadian Pacific is being run by Keith Creel, who took the top job in 2017 after his mentor Hunter Harrison left Canadian Pacific to run rival railway CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX).
""Keith and the team have done a superb job since,"" Ackman said, adding: ""We are delighted to again be an owner of this remarkable and growing franchise at a time when transcontinental rail infrastructure could not be more important for our economy and our continent.""
Creel engineered a major win last year when Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) after a protracted battle. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board still needs to give the deal full regulatory clearance.

The merger would set Canadian Pacific up as the first rail company to have a network that extends from Canada to Mexico.

827,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 08:57AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The price of oil has surged to its highest since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding to airline costs at a time when carriers have been struggling to recover from a pandemic-related collapse in demand.
Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but the conflict in Ukraine has sent prices into overdrive and the northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market has soared by 50% since Feb. 25 to $1,341 a tonne on Monday.
Malaysia's AirAsia on Saturday introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help to offset some of the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline had hedged more than 60% of its expected first-quarter consumption and about half of its second-quarter consumption by the time of its interim results last August, as well as lower amounts in future quarters through 2023. Cathay will release full-year results on Wednesday. 
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows.
In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange, to $775 in the third quarter with 56% of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged and $795 in the final quarter with a little less than half of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. It also has a lower level of hedges in place for the following half-year period.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. It said on Monday that it had no updates from guidance in November.
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Travel in Asia-Pacific is trailing the rest of the world and should expect a bumpy recovery, a Booking.com executive said on Monday, as countries in the region have been slower to open borders than other destinations. 
With North Asian countries still largely restricting entry and Southeast Asian countries reopening cautiously, the region's tourism recovery will not be quick, Laura Houldsworth, the online travel agency's managing director for Asia-Pacific said in an interview. 
The region should also expect a hit from fewer arrivals from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered a spike in flight cancellations last month. Beach destinations in Thailand, Indonesia, India and the Maldives are usually popular among Russian tourists.
""Any of these situations will have people rethink their travel plans,"" she said, noting that the conflict would have an impact on travel demand among Eastern Europeans in general.
Booking.com, a subsidiary of U.S. company Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc, last week suspended its operations in Russia, joining a host of other Western firms aiming to isolate Moscow.
The Amsterdam-based company has stopped all bookings to Russia, Houldsworth said, while outbound travel is expected to ""depress significantly"". 
However, a recent flurry of reopenings in the region was cause for optimism, said Houldsworth, pointing to Australia, Cambodia and the Philippines, which have dropped quarantine requirements for vaccinated tourists. Vietnam will soon follow suit. 
The Indonesian island of Bali on Monday welcomed its first foreign tourists under similarly relaxed travel restrictions. Meanwhile, Thailand resumed its quarantine waiver in February, but local hotel operators have called for further easing, saying the entry process is still too onerous.

Destinations with less cumbersome entry rules will have an advantage, and countries that still have entry restrictions in place like South Korea, Japan and China will be watching the impact of recent re-opening programmes closely, Houldsworth said. 
""The message is: simpler the better for travellers,"" she said.

Investing.com – Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) stock was up 2.4% in premarket Monday as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict pushes prices of farm-based commodities to record highs, both the countries being big exporters of many of them.
The price of wheat rocketed past $10 a bushel last week for the first time in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg. Corn also leaped to a nine-year high and soybean oil edged down from a record. Tight supplies, owing to harvest setbacks and labor shortages, had anyway kept corn prices elevated even before the current crisis erupted.
Russia and Ukraine account for about a quarter of global wheat and barley trade and a fifth of corn. The invasion and ensuing sweeping sanctions from the U.S. and its allies in Europe have sent the grain markets into turmoil.
Farming activity in Ukraine has been disturbed, too, as many farmers have rushed to perform military roles. Wheat and barley were sown before winter, but the fate of how much can be gathered now hangs in the balance, Bloomberg said.
Ukraine accounts for around half of global sunflower oil exports and is scheduled to seed the crop April-May. That’s around the same time as corn, part of the nation’s spring planting campaign.
ADM shuttered its facilities in Ukraine in the last week of February as Russia began an invasion of its neighbor. This included an oilseed crush plant and a grain export terminal."

""Our mobility business is bouncing back from Omicron much faster than we expected,"" Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. He said consumers were eager to book rides for travel, commuting or nightlife.
Khosrowshahi said gross bookings for airports, which are among the most profitable routes for Uber, were up over 50% month-on-month in February and headed to be one of the strongest ever in the upcoming travel season.
Several companies are also bringing staff back to offices over two years after the pandemic forced many to shift to working from home. 
During the peak of the pandemic, Uber's delivery business thrived as consumers became more dependent on ordering food and groceries online. 

Ride-hail trips in February remain only 10% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels in the same month, Uber said. February mobility gross bookings had recovered to 95% compared with February 2019.
On the delivery side, gross bookings reached an all-time high in February, the company said.

Under the terms of the deal, Whiting shareholders will receive 0.5774 shares of Oasis common stock and $6.25 in cash for each share held, giving the merger an equity value of $3.52 billion.
Upon completion of the deal, which is expected in the second half of 2022, Whiting shareholders will own about 53% and Oasis shareholders will own about 47% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis.
Oasis shareholders will also receive a special dividend of $15 per share once the deal is closed. 

Whiting Chief Executive Offer Lynn Peterson will serve as Executive Chair of the Board of the combined company while Oasis CEO Danny Brown will become the top boss.
Brent crude soared to near $130 a barrel on Monday, its highest since 2008, as the United States and European allies mull a Russian oil import ban and delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets fuel tight supply fears. [O/R]

Investing.com – Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stock traded 4.4% higher in premarket Monday after a “significant” improvement in February demand for mobility led the ride-hailing company to raise its current quarter guidance.
The company is now expecting its basic operating income on an adjusted basis to come in between $130 million and $150 million in the first quarter. This range was earlier $100 million-$130 million.
Uber said it expects a sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA for both Mobility and Delivery segments.
“Our mobility business is bouncing back from Omicron much faster than we expected,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.
“Whether for travel, commuting, or going out at night, we’re seeing healthy and growing demand across all use cases, highlighting just how eager consumers are to get moving again. In fact, airport gross bookings exiting February were up over 50% month-on-month, and we’re preparing for the upcoming travel season to be one of the strongest ever.”
The company said trips had recovered 90% and gross bookings 95% compared to February 2019, a clear sign of traffic nearing pre-pandemic levels.  
Uber had, in February, reported its second quarterly operating profit while its food delivery business delivered its maiden profit at a basic operating level. The company also reported the most active users in its history.
According to the company’s forecast then, revenue this quarter was seen at $26 billion.",

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Danone fell 3% on Monday after the French food group said it was suspending investments in Russia and had closed one of its two factories in Ukraine, following Russia's invasion of the country. 
However, the world's largest yoghurt maker, which announced the measures on Sunday, said it would continue to sell dairy and baby food in Russia, its third largest market after France and Spain.
Danone's new CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique was among French bosses who met with President Emmanuel Macron on Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine, a company spokesman said on Monday, adding it was too early to assess the financial impact of the decisions announced on Sunday.
Danone, which generates around 6% of its sales in Russia and Ukraine combined, controls Russian dairy brand Prostokvashino. 
It employs 1,000 people in Ukraine and 8,000 in Russia.
Danone shares had already fallen 9.9% since the start of this year before Monday's decline. 
Danone General Secretary Laurent Sacchi said in a statement on the company’s website on Sunday that the company will continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine, and would apply any decisions made by the French authorities.
""We have decided to suspend all investment projects in Russia but currently maintain our production and distribution of fresh dairy products and infant nutrition to still meet the essential food needs of the local population,"" he said.

Danone is due to hold a Capital Market Day on Tuesday when Saint-Affrique will give details of his turnaround strategy for the group.
He replaced Emmanuel Faber who was abruptly ousted as chairman and CEO last year following clashes with some board members over strategy and calls from activist funds for him to resign over the group's lacklustre returns compared with some rivals.

Investing.com – Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock surged 12% in premarket trading Monday on reports of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) adding it to its holdings while activist investor Carl Icahn exits as a shareholder.
According to reports, Buffett’s company owns roughly $5 billion worth of OXY shares. The company had a market cap of over $52 billion as of Friday.
Icahn’s exit brings to end a three-year-long relationship that was much thorny in the first year. The two finally reached a settlement at the onset of the pandemic.
Two representatives of Carl Icahn on Occidental’s board are also resigning, Icahn said in a letter to the company’s board on Sunday. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Icahn booked a profit of around $1 billion on the investment and still owns over 15 million warrants.
At one point, Icahn almost had a 10% stake in the company.
Icahn had earlier criticized Occidental for outbidding larger rival  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) to strike a $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) in May 2019. He also objected to the $10 billion pricey financing that Occidental took from Buffett to pay for the deal. The truce between the parties at that point brought back former CEO Stephen Chazen as Chairman and added three directors, including Icahn’s two representatives."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday, with surging oil prices on the back of the Ukraine/Russia conflict prompting fears of global stagflation..
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 400 points, or 1.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 50 points, or 1.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 190 points, or 1.4%.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heads toward the two-week mark and shows no signs of easing, with the key southeastern port city of Mariupol under bombardment.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked the international community earlier Monday to provide Ukraine with military aircraft and to boycott Russian oil, oil products, and other exports.
He’s unlikely to get aircraft, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the United States and European allies are exploring banning imports of Russian oil.
This resulted in crude prices surging to levels not seen since 2008, while the national gasoline average topped $4 a gallon, according to AAA.
 At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 7.1% higher at $123.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 6.8% to $126.16.
Soaring commodity prices have raised fears of even greater inflation, with data due on Thursday expected to show U.S.CPI climbed to 7.9% year-on-year in February, after January's four-decade high of 7.5%. 
With Friday’s monthly labor market report showing the U.S. economy is in rude health, such elevated inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in a more forceful manner than the market is currently pricing in.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week he would support a 25 basis point interest rate increase at the central bank's upcoming meeting next week but added that he would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" later if inflation does not subside as quickly as expected.
In corporate news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is likely to be in the spotlight following a report in The Wall Street Journal that Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Co-Founder Ryan Cohen has built a large stake in the retailer and is pushing for changes.
Additionally, the stocks of Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corporation and  Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS) soared in premarket trading on reports of a merger between the two. As of close Friday, Whiting had a market cap of about $3.3 billion while Oasis was valued at $2.8 billion.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could also be in focus with the tech giant expected to announce a new low-cost version of its iPhone SE with 5G capabilities at a launch event on Tuesday.

Investing.com – Stocks of Whiting Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:WLL) and Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NASDAQ:OAS) soared in premarket trading Monday on reports of a merger between the two.
Whiting stock was up 6% and Oasis 8%. As of close Friday, Whiting had a market cap of about $3.3 billion while Oasis was valued at $2.8 billion.  
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks of an all-stock deal Sunday.
The possible deal comes in as crude prices surged to their highest levels since 2008 after reports said US is pushing for a ban on Russian oil. 
Record crude prices have revived the fortunes of an industry that’s been facing an existential crisis.  
The Biden administration is considering whether to prohibit Russian oil imports into the U.S. without the participation of allies in Europe, at least initially, Bloomberg reported.
Brent oil touched a high of $130.89 earlier in the day before giving up some of the gains to trade over $125, still up 6% at 06:00 ET. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded just over $122 after retreating from a high of $130.33.
Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, with Whiting being the first publicly traded shale producer to do so in April, as worries about the global economy sent the energy industry reeling under an unprecedented crash.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will likely announce a new low-cost version of its iPhone SE with 5G capabilities at its annual spring product launch event on Tuesday, analysts say.
The iPhone maker is also expected to launch a new version of the iPad Air and a high-end Mac Mini at the event.
Apple's iPhone SE is currently priced at $399. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Apple could attract more price-sensitive consumers if the price remains the same for the new version.
""It could potentially provide upside to our unit iPhone estimate for 2022 if they keep that price point unchanged,"" Zino said. ""The iPhone SE really caters well to a lot of first-time buyers on the iPhone ecosystem that may be younger individuals, where their parents are going out there buying that device.""
The new phone would be the first update to the iPhone SE model in two years and is rumored to come with an improved camera and a faster processor.
The United States, Japan and Western Europe have been the top markets for iPhone SE sales in recent years, said analyst Ryan Reith of IDC. Reith said these regions will likely remain the top markets after the anticipated launch of the third-generation iPhone SE.
""We probably won't see big geography shifts,"" Reith said, adding that he expects the new iPhone SE to account for 10% of iPhone shipments globally after the launch.
IPhones with 5G capabilities have been a big part of Apple's focus for its flagship product, with its latest-model iPhone 13 showing off custom 5G antennas and radio components for faster speeds as customers look for powerful devices with better connectivity.
But some analysts still point to the limitations of 5G technology globally.
""Currently in most countries in the world, that (5G) technology simply isn't good enough to create a unique and differentiated experience ... the fact that the iPhone SE comes with 5G is more a way to enable users to leverage 5G when that technology evolves over the next year or two,"" Canalys research analyst Runar Bjørhovde said.
Zino said he does not anticipate services or accessories launches at the Tuesday event, though an unexpected announcement in the services sector is still possible.
Apple usually hosts three events every year to launch new products, starting in spring and announcing the launch of its latest iPhone range just before the holiday shopping season.

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Apple said on March 1 it has paused all product sales in Russia. The company also said it has stopped all exports into its sales channels in the country and limited Apple Pay and other services in Russia. 
The Russian state media, RT News and Sputnik News, are no longer available for download from the Apple Store outside Russia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms are under deepening pressure over their ties to Russia and are scrambling to assess their operations, company and government insiders say, after Western rivals halted businesses and condemned Moscow for invading Ukraine.
While environmental, social and governance (ESG) investors have previously targeted Japan Inc for use fossil fuels, scrutiny over Russia could become intense. Executives say privately they are worried about reputational damage, a sign corporate Japan is - however reluctantly - becoming more responsive to pressure on social issues. 
Japan's trading houses, commodities giants long seen as quasi-governmental arms integral to Japan's energy supply, have big ties to Russia. Last year Russia was Japan's second-biggest supplier of thermal coal and its fifth-largest of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
""The energy issue has implications for national and public interest, so it has to be discussed properly with the government,"" said one trading house insider, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""But we also have to think about our corporate value and about how we explain this to our shareholders. It's a difficult position.""
Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp have stakes in the giant Sakhalin-2 LNG project Shell (LON:RDSa) is now exiting. Itochu Corp and Marubeni Corp have invested in the Sakhalin-1 oil project that  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) is pulling out of. 
Mitsui and Mitsubishi said they would consider the situation, together with the Japanese government and partners. Itochu and Marubeni declined to comment on their plans related to Sakhalin-1.
Japanese firms have largely said they are watching the situation. Those that have halted activity have tended to cite supply-chain disruption rather than human rights. 
A senior executive at an automaker said management at his company was holding daily meetings to gauge the impact of financial sanctions and the implication for parts supply.
""We're also discussing reputational risk and how to deal with the news from the point of view of human rights and ESG - of course we're aware of that,"" said the executive.
""But we can't just immediately decide we're going to pull out because we can't tell how long the Ukraine crisis will continue.""
Japanese firms typically do not face the same level of scrutiny from shareholders, customers, regulators and even their own employees that Western companies now confront, said Jana Jevcakova, the international head of ESG at shareholder services firm Morrow Sodali.
""Most Japanese companies still don't have a majority of international institutional investors. Those that do will very shortly, or already are, feel the pressure.""
RELIANT ON RUSSIA
A manufacturing executive said his company felt a responsibility to local staff in Russia but was also concerned about the risk of saying nothing.
""Japanese companies have been slow to react. Too slow. And I can't agree with that,"" he said. ""If we keep quiet and just continue manufacturing and selling, we will likely face a risk to our reputation."" 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has unveiled steps to help cushion the blow from higher oil prices, but it is unclear what the government will do about broader dependence on Russia. Japan's imports from Russia totalled around $11 billion in 2020. 
Government officials say privately Japan cannot just walk away from Russian energy, even as they acknowledge the peril.
""If Japan remains invested in Russia, that itself runs the risk of drawing criticism"" should the conflict be prolonged, said an official close to Kishida.
In a moment of rare outspokenness for the leader of a state-owned lender, the head of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation said last week that ""it would not be right"" for companies to stick to business as usual in Russia.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co have stopped exports to Russia, citing logistics issues, with Toyota halting local production.
Nissan, Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp are all likely to stop local production when parts inventories run out, they say. Japan's most prominent companies will likely feel more heat as Western investors themselves pare back ties to Russia. 

""We believe good corporate citizenship includes support of governmental sanctions, as well as closing down activities that might fall outside the current sanctions,"" said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at Danish pension fund AkademikerPension, which has $21.3 billion of assets under management and $342 million exposure to Japanese equities.
""From a financial point of view this might mean companies suffer short-term losses, but given the long-term stigmatisation of Russia that is likely, the long-term cost will not change much.""

Investing.com – Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock surged 47% in premarket trade Monday on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Co-Founder Ryan Cohen has built a large stake in the retailer and is pushing for changes.
According to the report, Cohen, who also serves as the Chairman of videogames retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME)  has a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath, making him a top-five shareholder in the company. As of Friday, Bed Bath had a market cap of $1.55 billion. The stock is down over 42% in the last year against the near 13% rise in S&P500.
Cohen claims that Bed Bath’s strategy is failing to stem sustained market share losses, the WSJ report said. He wants the chain to simplify its structure and consider a sale or separation of BuyBuy Baby, its brand of stores selling a wide range of baby products including strollers, car seats, and diapers. He believes BuyBuy is worth several billion dollars. Cohen has even suggested selling the entire company, WSJ said.
Other than those options, he wants the company to narrow the focus of its turnaround plan and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand.
The chain’s turnaround plan has so far centered around reducing the number of products in stores and launching new private labels.
Like most retailers, Bed Bath has been troubled by surging inflation and extended supply chains as factories in China and Vietnam have had temporary shutdowns owing to the pandemic. That has resulted in inadequate inventories at stores at a time when buyers are keen to shop after the pandemic. "

The Biden administration is considering whether to prohibit Russian oil imports into the U.S. without the participation of allies in Europe, at least initially, Bloomberg reported. Crude prices soared, climbing to their 14-year high.
Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer behind the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The OPEC+ member exported 7.8 million barrels a day of crude, condensate, and oil products in December last year, according to the International Energy Agency, supplying key fuels such as diesel, fuel oil, vacuum gas oil, and a petrochemical feedstock known as naphtha to buyers across Europe, the U.S., and Asia.
Brent Oil Futures touched a high of $130.89 earlier in the day before giving up some of the gains to trade near $126, still up 6.3% at 04:30 ET. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded just over $123 after retreating from a high of $130.33.
Brent’s backwardation, a market structure where prompt barrels are more expensive than later-dated ones, rose to $5.17 a barrel, highlighting the rising anxiety about short-term supply, according to Bloomberg.
Shell got much flak last week for buying a cargo of Russia’s flagship crude at a record discount after saying it would limit business with the Communist country, including divesting from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), a Russian majority state-owned energy company.
Defending its action, Shell cited concerns over market interruptions and supply security for ""the difficult decision"". It went on to commit putting profits from any Russian oil it purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine."

“Downside risk remains most acute over the next 6-8 weeks,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price.”
Separately, Citi strategists led by Jamie Fahy said a global gauge tracking analyst estimates on corporate profits has turned negative for the first time since September 2020. This is a potential “game-changer,” eroding their conviction on the prospects of risk assets, they wrote.
Earnings delivery is “paramount” at a time when liquidity is being sucked out by central banks across the world, the Citi strategists said. “Removing this support could leave some indices floating on air.”
A ferocious rally in developed market stocks came to an abrupt end at the start of this year amid concerns that record inflation readings will cause central banks to aggressively tighten policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another spike in commodity prices, adding to fears that economies are heading to a stagflationary shock.
Several major benchmark gauges across Europe have dropped more than 20% from their recent highs, while the S&P 500 is hovering around a 10% correction. With gas and oil prices soaring, Citi and Morgan Stanley strategists say “demand destruction” may now be unavoidable.
Optimists Wavering
“Any relief should be sold,” said Wilson. “We recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal and searching for companies with superior operational efficiency and earnings stability.”
While the Morgan Stanley strategist has consistently been one of Wall Street’s most outspoken bears, even optimists are now wavering.

Switzerland's biggest bank said while its direct exposure was limited and had been reduced since year-end 2021 this could be affected by sanctions and other measures.
""Our current direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is limited,"" UBS said. ""However, market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realise on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures.""
That included open transactions with Russian counterparties, including both Russian banks and other Russian entities, it said. 
Its Russian subsidiary additionally held some $51 million in net assets not reflected in the total amount.
The global banking industry has been thrown into turmoil since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as Western banks exposed face fallout from the resulting sanctions on Russia and as financial markets show signs of stress over the potential wider economic fallout.
UBS highlighted risks from heightened threat of cyber-attacks as well as the risk of not quickly identifying client activity subject to new sanctions.
""We are working to implement sanctions imposed by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others – all of which have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals,"" Chairman Axel Weber and Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said in a letter to shareholders.
UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, said it had identified a small number of global wealth management clients subject to recently introduced sanctions, with total loans outstanding to such customers amounting to less than $10 million.

The Zurich-based bank said as of March 3 its wealth management business also had around $200 million in so-called Lombard loans - loans to wealthy customers secured against stocks or other assets - and secured financing backed by Russian assets as collateral.
The wealth management business's gross loans at end-2021 totalled $234.1 billion, based on the annual report.

Oil prices posted their largest weekly gains since mid-2020 last week, with the Brent benchmark up 21% and U.S. crude gaining 26%.
This sharp rise has raised concerns about the impact on global economic growth and inflation, particularly with many of the world’s major central banks looking to raise interest rates to cope with soaring consumer prices.
The European Central Bank meets later this week, and these surging commodity prices complicate the central bank’s policy picture.
The ECB is expected on Thursday to stick to its plans to end asset purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, while doubling asset-buying under its longer running Asset Purchase Program in the second quarter.

Oil's relentless climb, hitting almost $140 on Monday, means another turbulent start to the week for world markets. 
The United States and European allies are exploring banning imports of Russian oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.
That sent Brent crude oil to its highest since 2008. Up some 30% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the surge deals another shock to global price pressures already at their highest levels in decades.

European stock futures have dived more than 2%, U.S. equivalents are deep in the red, while in Asia, Japan's blue-chip Nikkei sank to a 15-month low and was last down around 3%.
The euro too is reeling by the fresh surge in oil prices. It hit a new 22-month low against the dollar and briefly fell below parity to the Swiss franc for the first time since January 2015 -- when Switzerland abandoned its currency peg against the euro.
The single currency appears increasingly correlated with the oil prices -- the higher oil climbs, the lower the euro descends -- as higher inflation and the blow to the economy higher energy prices threaten to squeeze consumption.
According to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a sustained $20 oil rise shock will lower real economic growth in the euro area by 0.6% and by 0.3% in the United States. 
European Central Bank policy makers meeting later this week have reason to be worried. So do other major central banks, and investors will be looking for any signs of a shift from policymakers speaking in the days ahead.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open sharply lower while crude prices soar to multi-year highs on fears that Western powers will ban Russian oil exports, potentially triggering a major inflationary shock for the global economy.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 2.9% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 2.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.8%.
This follows comments from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who  said on Sunday that the Biden administration was in “very active discussions” with European governments about banning imports of Russian crude and natural gas.
Oil prices, already elevated after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a week ago, climbed to levels last seen in July 2008 as the market adjusted to the potential of Russia’s supply no longer being available.
Russia is the world's top exporter of crude and oil products combined, with exports at around 7 million barrels per day, or 7% of global supply.

858,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 01:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), TikTok, Samsung (KS:005930) and credit card operators have joined the lengthening list of businesses cutting ties with Russia or reviewing their operations in the country as reputational and financial risks mount.
International sanctions, the closure of airspace and transports links due to the war, and the financial restrictions on SWIFT and capital controls have made it difficult if not impossible for many companies to supply parts, make payments and deliver goods to and from Russia. Added to that, the potential international consumer backlash against any company perceived as helping Vladimir Putin’s regime means that the exodus of corporations from Russia has become a stampede.
The rout reverses three decades of investment there by foreign businesses after the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991, especially in energy. Here are some of the biggest companies that have begun to unravel their connections:
Oil and Gas
Russia’s largest foreign investor, BP (NYSE:BP), led the way with its surprise announcement on Feb. 27 that it would exit its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft, a move that could result in a $25 billion write-off and cut the company’s global oil and gas production by a third.
Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc followed, citing Russia’s “senseless act of military aggression.” The company said it would end partnerships with state-controlled Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), including the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Germany blocked last week. Both projects are worth about $3 billion.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) said it would “discontinue” its Sakhalin-1 operations.
Equinor (NYSE:EQNR), Norway’s state-owned energy giant, said will start withdrawing from its joint ventures in Russia, worth about $1.2 billion. In parallel, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, said it’s freezing Russian assets worth about $2.8 billion and will come up with a plan to exit by March 15.
Finance
Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) said on Saturday they are suspending operations in Russia. In separate statements that arrived within minutes of each other, Visa cited “Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” while Mastercard referred to the “unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had called on the companies to halt all business in Russia during a video call with U.S. lawmakers. Each gets about 4% of its net revenue from business linked to Russia.  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) followed on Sunday.
Some critics argue that the steps aren’t enough. While the companies said any transactions initiated with their cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and cards issued outside of Russia won’t work at Russian merchants or ATMs, consumers inside Russia who have a locally issued card can still pay for goods and services there.
Two of the Big Four auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP also said on Sunday they would cut ties with Russian businesses.
Automakers
In the space of a week, most of the world’s biggest carmakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY), and  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) announced they would halt shipments to Russia or idle plants in the country. Truckmakers Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) also halted business activities there.
However, the automaker with the most to lose,  Renault  (OTC:RNLSY), has remained .
The French company’s majority control of AvtoVaz, the Soviet-era maker of Ladas, and reliance on Russia for about 12% of its revenue have unnerved investors and Renault (PA:RENA) has lost more than a third of its market value in two weeks. “Renault has promised to abide by sanctions,” Gabriel Attal, the French government spokesman, said Thursday on France Info radio.
Consumer Goods
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), the leading smartphone seller in Russia with more than 30% of the market, suspended exports to the country of all its products. Samsung said it will donate $6 million to humanitarian efforts in the region, including $1 million in consumer electronics products.
Before the announcement, Mykhailo Fedorov, who serves as Ukraine’s vice prime minister and oversees digital operations, posted a letter on his Twitter account to Samsung vice chairman Han Jong-hee, urging the Korean tech giant to temporarily cease supplying services and products to Russia. “We need your support -- in 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles targeting residential neighborhoods, kindergartens, and hospitals,” he wrote.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Friday condemned Russia’s “unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion” of Ukraine and said it’s suspending all new sales of products and services in Russia. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). has halted sales of iPhones and started limiting Apple Pay services and other popular products in Russia, and removed the RT News and Sputnik News applications from App Stores outside the country. HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the largest supplier of PCs to Russia, has stopped exports to the country as has  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE). is one of several consumer goods companies that have cited logistical problems as a reason for suspending sales in Russia. Spanish fashion retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which has has 502 stores in Russia including 86 Zara outlets, is also temporarily closing all its shops in Russia and halting online sales, saying it “cannot guarantee the continuity of operations and trading conditions.” 
Other companies have so far taken limited steps to halt business. Dairy company Danone SA’s General Secretary Laurent Sacchi said the world’s largest yogurt maker would suspend investment in Russia, but will continue to sell dairy and baby food. 
Danone Chief Executive Officer Antoine de Saint-Affrique was among CEOs and chairmen of some of France’s biggest companies who met with Emmanuel Macron on Friday, according to Le Figaro. The French president urged them not to leave Russia hastily, and in any case not without consulting the government, the newspaper reported.
Media
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). is shutting its operations in Russia and said no new customers will be able to sign up, though it’s unclear what will happen with existing accounts.
Netflix has fewer than one million customers in Russia and has been operating in the country through a joint venture with National Media Group. The streaming giant said previously it won’t be carrying required Russian news channels on its local-language service in the country and has paused all projects and acquisitions from Russia, including four programs in production.
Hollywood studios including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Paramount Pictures, Sony (T:6758), and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Universal Pictures have also halted or postponed the release of movies in Russia.
Meanwhile other platforms, including TikTok, are suspending or closing services because of Russia’s new “fake news” law aimed at silencing dissent and limiting information about the invasion of Ukraine.
“We have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law,” TikTok announced in a series of tweets. “The safety of our employees and our users remain our highest priority.”
The company, owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., said its in-app messaging service would not be affected.
On Friday, the Russian government said it was blocking access to Meta Platform Inc.’s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as part of the crackdown. Hours after the announcement, Meta said it would pause all advertising in the nation and would stop selling ads to Russian businesses.
Law and Accounting
Baker McKenzie said last week it was reviewing its operations in Russia and will sever ties with several Russian clients in order to comply with sanctions. The Chicago-headquartered firm’s clients include Russia’s finance ministry and VTB, Russia’s second largest bank.
London-based Linklaters said in a statement it was “reviewing all of the firm’s Russia-related work.” KPMG LLP’s U.K. chief, Jonathan Holt, said the firm will cut ties with certain clients subjected to the recent wave of sanctions against Russia.
Rising Criticism
Even as more companies sever ties with Russia, criticism is rising of banks and corporations that are perceived as profiting from the war or not doing enough to punish Putin’s invasion.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of Wall Street, said some banks are “undermining” sanctions by snapping up Russian corporate bonds and suggesting clients buy the nations’ assets on the cheap.
In a statement released late Friday, Warren called out market makers JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) following a Bloomberg report that the two banks had been purchasing beaten-down bonds. Banks routinely scoop up debt because clients ask them to, or because they expect to find ready buyers.
JPMorgan analysts also published a note recommending that investors boost holdings of Russian-linked debt to take advantage of a “recovery play” stemming from the sell-off that accompanied the country’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Giant Wall Street banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs never miss out on an opportunity to get richer even if it means capitalizing on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and undermining sanctions placed on Russian businesses,” said Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat.
Representatives for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment on the Bloomberg report that they had been buying up Russian bonds.
Last week, McKinsey & Co.’s global managing partner Bob Sternfels took to LinkedIn to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and declare that the firm will no longer do business with any government entity in Russia. But the consultancy’s most senior executive in Ukraine called on companies to go further, and begin, where possible, shutting “offices and outlets” in the country, where McKinsey has operated for nearly 30 years.
The founder of Fast Retailing, which owns fashion giant Uniqlo, said the company wouldn’t be withdrawing from Russia, according to the Nikkei. “Clothes are essential items in daily life,” Tadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing’s chairman and CEO, reportedly said. “Russians have a right to live as well.”
Representatives for Fast Retailing in Tokyo didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from Bloomberg News. The company operated 50 stores in Russia, as of Feb. 28. Fast said on March 4 that it would donate $10 million and 200,000 items of clothing to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support those fleeing Ukraine.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks are becoming a haven for international investors fleeing a worsening outlook for global equities who are hoping for sustained strength in the commodity-heavy economies of the region.
Driving the renewed interest is a surge in commodity prices that spells good news, particularly for key producers Indonesia and Malaysia, coupled with the sparse economic links between Southeast Asia and the warring nations of Russia and Ukraine.
Supply disruptions caused by the conflict and subsequent Western sanctions have sent commodities prices soaring, with Brent crude, coal, palm oil and nickel hitting multi-year highs.
""Commodity prices are now likely to be higher for longer,"" said Jerry Goh, an Asian equities investment manager at fund house abrdn.
""We expect Malaysia and Indonesia to continue enjoying trade surpluses, which should bolster government revenues and encourage consumer spending.""
Foreign flows into stocks in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, rose to $1.2 billion in February, Reuters data shows, the most since April 2019, following net outflows for much of 2019 and 2020 and only small inflows in 2021.
February's flows into Thai stocks were their highest since at least 2008 and the Philippines also saw inflows. In contrast, India and Taiwan, investor darlings in 2021, both saw outflows in February.
Indonesia is the world's top exporter of palm oil, thermal coal and a major producer of nickel, copper and refined tin, while Malaysia is the world's second largest producer and exporter of palm.
""As economic activity resumes in these two markets, this should also support a recovery in domestic earnings,"" Goh added. 
Defensive qualities in the ASEAN grouping of nations could exert themselves in the coming months, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalates, said Kenneth Tang, a senior portfolio manager for Asian equities at Nikko Asset Management. 
MSCI's broadest index of world shares has fallen 11% year-to-date, but Indonesia, with year-to-date gains of nearly 5%, is the best performing Asian market after the Jakarta Composite Index hit a record last week. 
Coal producers Adaro Energy and Bayan Resources have soared to record highs.
Stocks in neighbouring Malaysia hit a 10-month high last week, after February's jump of 6.3%.
Thus Indonesia and Malaysia offer a ""perfect stagflation hedge"" as the the only two net commodity exporters in Asia ex-Japan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said.
Abrdn says it fancies sectors exposed to commodity markets, but also highlighted that low-cost Southeast Asia was well placed to draw more foreign direct investment in building supply chains in areas such as electric vehicles and energy storage.
The strong performance in Indonesian markets could bode well for equity listings, as its biggest tech firm, GoTo, looks to launch a domestic IPO that could raise at least $1 billion in the first half, sources have said.
Last year, Indonesian fundraising via IPOs rose to its highest in a decade, fuelled by investor interest in tech firms.
""SELL WHAT YOU OWN""
The foreign flows into Southeast Asian stocks are a sharp change from previous years, when the COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on lives and economic growth in many countries in the region.
Economic prospects are brightening.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, booked a budget surplus of $2 billion in January as tax revenues soared.
That has driven a shift in perception that Malaysia and Indonesia are vulnerable during periods of Fed policy tightening, such as now, thanks to a large foreign presence in their bond markets.
Foreign ownership accounted for 28% of Indonesian stocks in January, down from 37% in March 2013, according to Nomura. Non-residents now hold only a quarter of Malaysian government debt. They hold less than a fifth of Indonesian government debt, down from 39% at the end of 2019.

""There's an adage, 'You sell what you own', and what foreign investors own at the moment in Asia is India, Taiwan, and a little bit of Korea,"" said Chetan Seth, an Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Nomura. 
""They don't own much Southeast Asia, so how much can they sell?""

(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil and gas producers  Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS) Inc and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp are close to agreeing an all-stock merger that could be announced as soon as this week, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The combined value of the two companies would be around $6.07 billion, according to Reuters calculations based upon Friday's closing prices, which valued Oasis at $2.80 billion and Whiting at $3.27 billion.
The person with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private information.
The deal talks between the pair, which both operate in the Bakken shale formation of North Dakota, come amid a significant spike in crude oil prices on the back of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Both Brent and U.S. benchmarks temporarily hit their highest levels since 2008 as trading began the week in Asia, as the United States and European allies mulled a Russian oil import ban in response to the conflict, which Russia calls a ""special operation"". [O/R]
The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported the talks between Oasis and Whiting. 
Oasis Petroleum and Whiting Petroleum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 after the energy industry reeled under an unprecedented crash in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Whiting the first publicly traded shale producer to file for bankruptcy when it did so in April of that year. 
Last year, oil and gas pipeline operator Crestwood Equity (NYSE:CEQP) Partners LP said it would buy Oasis Petroleum's midstream unit in a $1.8 billion deal.

861,"<span>Mar 06, 2022 10:15PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Twenty-four Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) investors are urging the tech giant to step up transparency in tax disclosures and adopt a new reporting standard, the Financial Times said on Sunday.
Asset managers Nordea, Royal London and several large European and U.S. pension funds are among those pushing for Amazon to issue a transparency report in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) tax standard, the newspaper said.
They want to bring a shareholders' resolution demanding the new standard at the company's annual meeting this year, it said, citing a letter to be sent this week to the U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""Aggressive tax practices can expose a company and its investors to increased scrutiny from tax authorities, adjustment risks, and increase their vulnerability to changes in tax rules,"" the investors said.
These measures come at a time when nations are looking to protect their tax bases from deleterious practices, they added in the letter seen by the FT.
The 100 groups that signed the letter included several environmental, social and governance-focused and religious funds, although not all were investors, the paper said. 
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the resolution, but pointed to last month's no-action request when the company barred a similar shareholder proposal.
""The proposal implicates exactly the type of ordinary business issues for which resolution should remain with the company’s management and board,"" Amazon said.
It would be impractical for shareholders to exercise direct oversight of such issues, it added.

Amazon's current extensive tax disclosures are in line with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), it said, adding that it has publicly reported tax payments in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Spain.
A December shareholder proposal by the Greater Manchester Pension Fund and Oblate International Pastoral Investment Trust urged Amazon to adopt the new GRI tax standard, and make public breakdowns of financial, tax and worker information by country.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Monday morning, alongside U.S. equity futures. The conflict in Ukraine could last longer than expected after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the war in Ukraine would continue. Investors are also concerned about an inflation shock in the global economy, with oil soaring over a potential ban on Russian crude supplies.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1% by 9:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.92%. February’s trade data, including exports, imports, and the trade balance, is due later in the day. More data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, is due on Wednesday.
China also set its 2022 GDP target at an ambitious “about 5.5%” on Saturday. The country also signaled that more stimulus measures could be on the way, with Premier Li Keqiang vowing at the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) to take bold steps to protect the economy as risks mount. Foreign Minister Wang Yi will deliver his briefing to the NPC on Monday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 3.31%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 225 fell 3.29% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 2.35%. In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.31%.
The West is exploring a coordinated embargo on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine while ensuring appropriate global supply, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday.
In response, Putin signed a decree allowing the government and companies to pay foreign creditors in rubles, and the Ministry of Finance warned that sanctions will determine if international investors are able to collect payments. More businesses are also starting to pull out of their operations in Russia, including Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). and TikTok.
The invasion has already led to surging prices in grains, metals, and energy, with oil hitting the $139 mark, due to concerns of supply disruptions. This, alongside high inflation, is adding to worries about the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and other key central banks will now have to juggle tightening monetary policy to curb inflation without impacting economic growth and risky assets.
“For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the war,” Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni said in a note.
“For stock investors, we think 2022 will continue to be one of this bull market’s toughest years.”
The Fed should increase interest rates to close to its “neutral” setting this year, implying as many as seven quarter-point hikes, Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said on Friday. Markets are pricing in around five interest rates of that size in 2022.
“Central banks are facing an exogenous stagflationary shock they cannot do much about,” Federated Hermes senior economist Silvia Dall’Angelo said in a note.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -At a large Future Retail supermarket in Mumbai last week, workers were unloading hundreds of bright blue grocery crates belonging to India's biggest retailer Reliance.
Prospective customers were turned back by security, disappointed at the closed state of the store that still carries the signage of Future's biggest brand, Big Bazaar, but which will likely soon be rebranded as a Reliance outlet.
Across India, similar scenes are being played out as Reliance Industries, India's biggest conglomerate run by Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man, presses ahead with a shock de facto takeover of prized retail real estate that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been keen to take part-ownership of.
The high-profile bitter dispute between corporate titans in which Amazon has sought to block Reliance's planned $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group's retail assets is currently before India's Supreme Court.
Reliance's takeover began with utmost stealth on the night of Feb. 25 when its staff began arriving at Future stores. Many in Future's management were in the dark about the plans as store employees from all over the country frantically began to call, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
""It was tense, everybody was panicking. We didn't know who they were. They wanted access and seniors didn't know about it,"" a New Delhi Big Bazaar store employee said, describing what happened around 8 p.m. that day.
At a Future store in Sonipat town in northern Haryana state, announcements were made asking customers to leave as Reliance seized control, one source said. In Vadodara in western Gujarat, Future employees arriving for work the next morning were asked to go back home with no explanation, said another source.
Citing unpaid payments by Future, Reliance has taken control of operations of some 200 Big Bazaar stores and has plans to seize another 250 of Future's retail outlets. Combined, they represent the crown jewels of Future's retail network and around a third of all Future outlets.
Although Reliance had not played a large public role in the legal dispute, it had, according to sources, for some months assumed many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future, India's No. 2 retailer and Amazon's estranged business partner.
Reliance's sudden possession of the stores appears to have landed what some analysts are calling a coup de grace that spoils Amazon's chances of untangling the transfer of Future's assets to Reliance. That's despite a series of legal battles won by the U.S. e-commerce giant to date blocking the 2020 deal announced between the two Indian companies. 
""What will Amazon fight for now?"" said a source close to the U.S. company with knowledge of the legal dispute. ""The shops are gone.""
Representatives for Reliance, Amazon and Future did not respond to Reuters queries for this article. Sources asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the dispute.
AFTER THE TAKEOVER, TALKS
Future Retail said on Feb. 26 it was ""scaling down its operations"" to cut losses although it made no mention of Reliance in its statement. Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt.
Reliance plans to retain Future's employees at the stores it takes over, sources have said.
Amazon, which has a stake in a separate Future Group unit that it argues prevents Future from selling retail assets without its permission, has called the supermarkets and other stores an ""irreplaceable"" network in a sector worth $900 billion in revenues annually.
The legal wrangles had over time become increasingly high-stakes and marked by ugly rhetoric. At one point, Amazon sought for Future Chief Executive Kishore Biyani to be detained in prison for disobeying a legal order. And Future once likened Amazon to Alexander the Great and his ""ruthless ambition to scorch the earth"". 
But on Thursday, six days after Reliance's move, Amazon at a Supreme Court hearing unexpectedly called for cordial talks to end the dispute - a proposal Future agreed to.
""People have taken over shops ... let's at least have a conversation,"" Amazon's lawyer Gopal Subramanium said. 
Discussions are expected to begin soon. 
Whatever the outcome of the talks, analysts say Amazon had gravely underestimated Reliance.

""If anybody should have seen this coming, it should have been Amazon and they should have prepared against it,"" said Devangshu Dutta of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. 
""Clearly, they didn't.""

In a ""Survey Monkey"" poll seen by Reuters, the Wall Street bank asks investors to vote on their ""expectations"" over whether various sovereign and corporate hard-currency and rouble-denominated bonds and securities should be retained or removed.
Those expecting the securities to be removed are asked about their preferred timing - at the end of March or the end of April. The poll requests answers to be submitted no later than midnight on Sunday.
JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey. 
Western countries have imposed a sweeping range of sanctions on Russia's government, as well as many banks, companies and individuals in a push to isolate Moscow following the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine launched on Feb. 24.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
JPMorgan runs the widely followed family of sovereign hard-currency indexes EMBI, as well as a corporate debt counterpart CEMBI. It also has the GBI-EM benchmark for local debt in emerging currencies and the JESG index governed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
According to the bank's own information, assets worth $842 billion are benchmarked against those indexes. Russia has a weighting of 0.89% in the bank's EMBIG Diversified index, and an even larger 1.03% weighting in the ESG version of the index. 

JPMorgan placed Russia on index watch on March 1 after sanctions were imposed on the country.
Debt from Russian ally Belarus is also under review by JPMorgan for removal from its ESG index suite. The country has faced condemnation over violent crackdowns by authorities around the disputed 2020 election and the subsequent skyjacking of an opposition journalist.

Chitra Ramkrishna was arrested in New Delhi, the source at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, without sharing further details.
The market regulator penalised Ramkrishna, among others, after an investigation that showed she had sought advice for years from an outsider she described as a Himalayan yogi.

The move by the payments firms could mean more disruption for Russians who are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods.
Unprecedented Western sanctions imposed on Russia have frozen much of the country's central bank's $640 billion in assets; barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT; and sent the rouble into free-fall, erasing a third of its value this week.

Sberbank Rossii PAO, Russia's largest lender, said the moves by Visa and Mastercard would not affect users of the cards it issues in Russia, Tass news reported.
Sberbank said its customers would be able to withdraw cash, make transfers, pay both in offline stores and Russian internet stores because transactions in Russia pass through the domestic National Payment Card System which does not depend on foreign payment systems, according to Tass.
Russia has been taking steps to increase the independence of its financial system for years, particularly after ties with the West deteriorated over the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
The country set up its own banking messaging system, known as SPFS, as an alternative to SWIFT and its own card payment system MIR began operating in 2015. They were part of Moscow's efforts to develop homegrown financial tools to mirror Western ones, to protect the country in case sanctions are broadened.
Mastercard and Visa had significant business in Russia. In 2021, about 4% of Mastercard's net revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Meanwhile, business conducted within, into and out of Ukraine accounted for 2% of its net revenues, according to a filing on Tuesday.
Visa also reported that total net revenue from Russia in 2021 was about 4% of its total.
Mastercard, which has operated in Russia for 25 years, said its cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by Mastercard networks, and that any the company's card issued outside of the Russia will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Brazil's government has appointed former Petrobras executive Rodolfo Landim to chair the state-controlled oil producer's board, the company said in a filing on Saturday night.
Earlier in the day, Admiral Eduardo Bacellar Leal Ferreira told Reuters he planned to step down as chairman of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro firm is formally known.
""Petrobras chairman is a 24-hour job and I want to spend more time with my family,"" Ferreira said, adding he has two grown children living outside of Brazil.
Ferreira will stay until the end of his term. A shareholder meeting to renew the company's board is scheduled for April 13.
The replacement comes as Petrobras faces pressure from investors to raise fuel prices as oil approached $120 per barrel. The company controls gasoline and diesel prices in Brazil with more than 80% of the country's refining capacity.
Ferreira declined to comment on Petrobras' fuel price policy. 
Rodolfo Landim made a career at Petrobras before creating his own oil company, Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, and selling it to investors in 2020.
He first joined Petrobras in 1980 and worked for 26 years at the company, rising to head of the natural gas division. In 2003, during the first presidential term of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Landim was appointed by the government as chief executive of Petrobras's gas station chain subsidiary, the largest fuel retailer company in Latin America. He ran the fuel company until 2006.
Landim currently runs a soccer team in Brazil as its president.
His confirmation as chairman is expected as the government controls the board with a majority of the voting shares.
If confirmed, Landim will rejoin Petrobras with a challenge of balancing a fuel price policy that pleases both investors and the government ahead of presidential elections in October.
On Thursday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Petrobras could lower its profit to prevent fuel prices from surging.
In a weekly social media address, Bolsonaro said he was certain Petrobras would do what is necessary to shield consumers from suffering steep price increases.
Bolsonaro's comments come after Petrobras in 2021 smashed its all-time record for annual profit and dividend payouts, thanks to sky-high Brent prices. The remarks could raise fears among investors that he could seek to feature in the company's price-setting policies. 
Petrobras' policy of seeking parity between domestic fuel prices and international markets has angered many Brazilians as the cost of Brent crude has soared. A growing chorus of politicians has said Petrobras should help shoulder the burden.

On Wednesday, Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna told Reuters that Petrobras had not yet taken a decision on fuel price adjustments.
The government also appointed another seven names to the board. Those are Petrobras Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna, who will have his term at the board renewed, Carlos Eduardo Lessa Brandão, Luiz Henrique Caroli, Márcio Andrade Weber, Murilo Marroquim de Souza, Ruy Flaks Schneider and Sonia Julia Sulzbeck Villalobos.

LONDON (Reuters) - France's TotalEnergies cuts a lonely figure hanging onto its Russian investments during a mass exodus of western oil majors from the country after its invasion of Ukraine, even though no sanctions have forced such divestments.
""For existing assets, the company says it will respect European sanctions whatever the consequences. But for the moment, there are no sanctions on energy,"" said a source familiar with the thinking inside TotalEnergies. 
TotalEnergies has a future-oriented position in Russia, heavily weighted towards liquefied natural gas (LNG), with stakes in the yet-to-be built $21 billion Arctic LNG 2 project as well as in the producing Yamal LNG operation.
With the world trying to slash carbon emissions, oil majors are betting on LNG to replace more-polluting coal and oil. TotalEnergies first bought a stake in Russian gas producer Novatek in 2011 for $4 billion and gradually increased its stake to just under 20% by 2018.
""The company cannot divest assets from one day to the next unless sanctions force it to do so. One must take time to reflect,"" said the source.
The French government has declined to comment on specific companies and Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron, who convened members of a Franco-Russian forum on Tuesday, did not urge TotalEnergies or French companies to leave Russia, two participants told Reuters. Among those present was TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne.
In contrast, Britain's government immediately applauded Shell (LON:RDSa)'s and BP (NYSE:BP)'s decision to exit Russia. Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told employees BP ""couldn't reasonably carry on in Russia given the conflict in Ukraine,"" according to a company source.
Billions of dollars of impending write-downs are piling up for the companies that have said they would exit their Russian assets: BP, Shell, Equinor and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM). For now, there are few potential buyers for the stakes and operations they are leaving in Russia.
Share prices of the companies that have exited Russia have outperformed TotalEnergies in recent days.

""We see a potential exit by TTE being much more complicated than it is for peers,"" said RBC equity analyst Biraj Borkhataria
on Wednesday. ""We see Russia as strategically important for TTE, particularly for its LNG business."" 
TotalEnergies aims to satisfy 10% of global LNG markets by 2025 with 50 million tonnes a year. Russia accounts for 6 million tonnes from Yamal and another 4 million tonnes from Arctic LNG 2 once operational, according to RBC.
Reuters could not verify total returns on investments in Russia by the oil majors, which do not regularly publish asset and country-specific financials. Still, it was clear that BP, for example, has already made good on its investments.
When former U.S. President Donald Trump hit Iran with sanctions, TotalEnergies also stuck with its investment in a big gas field, dropping it only after failing to obtain a sanctions waiver from Washington in 2018.
At the time, media reported that Pouyanne told Trump that continued investment could help democratic progress in Iran. 
In 2021, TotalEnergies' cashflow from Russia amounted to $1.5 billion. It declined to give further details on its Russian investments and previous years' cashflows.
Meanwhile, BP faces a write-down of up to $25 billion for dropping Russia and losing out on annual dividends from Rosneft which have fluctuated between around $300 million and $780 million, according to its quarterly results.
But the cashflow it has received from Russia over the years might soothe some of that pain. 
In 2003, BP and Russian investors created TNK-BP in which BP invested $8 billion. In the 10 years that followed, BP received around $19 billion in dividends.
In 2013, Rosneft bought BP's stake in TNK-BP for around $12 billion in cash and Rosneft shares that have yielded dividends for BP of over $4 billion.
Shell, which was an early partner in Russia's first LNG plant, Sakhalin II, sold half of its 55% stake to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) in 2007 for $4.1 billion, two years before the project came online.
Its 2021 net earnings from Sakhalin II and its Salym oilfields, which started full production in 2006, were $700 million, it said. Tax reports showed accumulated earnings from Russia were around $384 million in 2020, $455 million in 2019 and a loss of $16 million in 2018. 
Flagging impairments from its Russian exit, Shell said it had around $3 billion in non-current assets. A Shell spokesperson declined to give further details.
As for Exxon Mobil shutting the door on its $4 billion in assets in Russia and triggering what could become a write-down, it has benefited from operating large offshore oil and gas fields near Sakhalin Island since 2005.
Exxon did not break down its investments in Russia and declined to comment on a potential writedown. But Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said on Wednesday that leaving its Russian oil and gas operations would shave 1%-2% from earnings.

""All of them will struggle to repatriate future income from Russia. A difference between them is that TotalEnergies’ can argue they have less direct ties the government because Novatek is privately-owned. The question is how long that argument can hold,"" said Giacomo Romeo, Jefferies equities analyst.
""In terms of investment recoverability, direct stakes in LNG assets such as Sakhalin, Yamal and Arctic LNG are different from stakes in companies such as Rosneft and Novatek. Chinese or Indian investors might be interested in stakes in LNG assets, if the price is low enough and there are enough uncontracted volumes.""

Tass said the Russian transport ministry had drawn up a draft bill to help airlines until September 2022. It would also suspend all planned and unscheduled inspections of carriers, the Russian news agency reported.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) - the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers - have suspended the supply of components and services to Russian airlines, a move that will likely make it harder to maintain planes.
The bill would allow ""the repair of aircraft and the replacement of components by third-party companies, as long as they meet the requirements for companies that are involved in maintenance,"" Tass said. It did not give details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on Saturday said Moscow was in talks with aircraft leasing companies to resolve potential issues linked to sanctions.
Russia's state aviation authority is recommending that domestic airlines with foreign-leased aircraft suspend passenger and cargo flights abroad from Russia from March 6 and from foreign countries to Russia starting on March 8 to prevent their possible seizure.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) will put profits from any Russian oil it purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the company said on Saturday.
Shell had on Friday bought a cargo of Russian crude oil at a record low discount, the first such trade since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.
The deal, which did not violate Western sanctions on Moscow, was criticized by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
""I am told Shell discreetly bought some Russian oil yesterday. One question to @Shell: doesn't Russian oil smell (of) Ukrainian blood for you?,"" Kuleba wrote in a tweet.
In a statement published shortly afterwards, Shell defended the purchase and said it would choose alternatives to Russian oil wherever possible, but this could not happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply.
It added: ""We didn't take this decision lightly and we understand the strength of feeling around it.""

Shell said it would give any profits from the limited amount of Russian oil it has to purchase to a dedicated fund, and together with aid agencies would determine where those funds would best be used to help alleviate hardship suffered by the people of Ukraine.
Russian exporters have in recent days faced severe problems with credit lines, shipping and insurance, resulting in delays and cancellations to their attempts to find buyers for Russian crude.

(Reuters) - ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., the Chinese telecom equipment maker, will go back to U.S. federal court March 14 to face a new accusation it may have violated its probation from its 2017 guilty plea for illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran.
The possible violation relates to an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud, according to a March 4 court filing in a Texas federal court. 
An indictment unsealed last March charges a former ZTE research director in New Jersey and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology with conspiring to bring Chinese nationals to the U.S. with J-1 visas, which are designed for work and study at institutions like Georgia Tech. After arriving the Chinese nationals went to work for ZTE in New Jersey, the indictment alleges.The professor, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. ZTE is not charged in the case.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Georgia, where the visa case is pending, declined to comment.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for ZTE also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If ZTE is found to have violated its probation, the ramifications are unclear. But in the past ZTE has faced massive fines and other penalties for running afoul of U.S. authorities.
ZTE agreed to pay $892 million and pleaded guilty in Texas in 2017 to criminal charges for violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran and North Korea. 
A five-year investigation had found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. Investigators also uncovered 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea. 
At the time, ZTE agreed to three years of probation, a compliance program, and a corporate monitor. 
But in 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE lied about disciplining executives tied to the wrongdoing and banned ZTE from doing business with U.S. suppliers. 

ZTE paid $1 billion and agreed to change its leadership and cooperate with a second 10-year monitor, among other terms, to get the ban lifted.
The Texas judge also extended the company's probation from the criminal case and the monitor for another two years, until March 22, 2022.

(Reuters) -Top mutual fund manager Vanguard Group said on Friday it will adhere to international sanctions being imposed on Russia in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but will not restrict the investment decisions of managers of its actively-managed funds.
In a note https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/russiansanctionsindexchangesandvanguardfunds on its website on Friday addressing investments in Russia, Vanguard Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis said that managers of its actively-managed funds ""will decide how best to navigate liquidity challenges and balance investment risks with potential rewards.”
Although best known for its passive index funds, the closely-held U.S. firm runs actively-managed funds with about $1.7 trillion in assets, the company said. Total assets were $8.1 trillion as of January 31.
A Vanguard spokeswoman said executives were not immediately available for further comment late Friday.
In a separate note https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/exposure-to-russian-securities-in-vanguard-funds.html on its website, Vanguard listed funds with direct exposure to Russian securities as of Feb 28. The list including passive funds like its Total International Stock Index fund, with 0.2% exposure, and active funds like Emerging Markets Select Stock fund, with 1.19% exposure.
Many western funds and companies have said they would leave Russia following the invasion, which Moscow terms a ""special military action,"" including BP (NYSE:BP), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. On Friday the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in Russian securities.
Financial firms like banks can face obstacles to departure. Vanguard said ""Some Russian securities may not be traded because of sanctions restrictions,"" and that Russian Central Bank actions have effectively shut off its securities market to foreign investors.

So far the effects on Vanguard funds have been limited, Vanguard said.
Of U.S.-domiciled Vanguard funds, index funds account for about 80% of the exposure to Russia and Ukraine. Funds invested in Russia and or Ukraine had about 1% of assets there, on average. Russian stocks and bonds made up ""most of the modest exposure,"" Vanguard said.

The Zara owner is following some of the biggest western brands which have suspended operations in Russia, including its main rival H&M, following the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of economic sanctions.
""In the current circumstances Inditex cannot guarantee the continuity of the operations and commercial conditions in the Russian Federation and temporarily suspends its activity"", the world's biggest fashion company said.
Russia accounts for around 8.5% of the group's global EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) and all the Inditex stores operate on a rental basis, Inditex said. ""The investment is not relevant from a financial point of view"".
Inditex said it would give its workforce of more than 9,000 people a special support plan, without giving any details. The group had said its 79 stores in Ukraine have already been temporarily closed.
Spain's second-largest fashion retailer Mango said on Thursday it was temporarily closing its 120 Russian shops, and Tendam, the third-largest clothing group, said it had taken a similar decision on Saturday. 

""The combination of the weakness in the rouble resulting in large price increases for the Russian consumer and increased logistical difficulties will make operations difficult for all retailers importing into Russia, even if there are no direct sanctions on their product categories,"" Adam Cochrane, analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research, said.

POTSDAM, Germany (Reuters) -Tesla Inc received a conditional go-ahead for its German gigafactory near Berlin on Friday, the state of Brandenburg said, ending months of delay for the 5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) landmark plant.
The gigafactory, which is crucial to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk's ambitions to vanquish European market leader Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), was initially supposed to open last summer. 
Germany's largest automaker has the upper hand in Europe, with a 25% share of electric vehicle (EV) sales to Tesla's 13%.
Brandenburg state premier Dietmar Woidke told a news briefing that the development marked ""a big step into the future"", adding that the Tesla plant would be a major industrial and technological driver for Germany and the region.
Around 2,600 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far, unions said last month, and Tesla is in talks with numerous parts suppliers in the region to source as much as possible locally, lowering waiting times and costs.
Underlining the intense competition facing Tesla, Volkswagen said on Friday it would spend about 2 billion euros on a new factory near its Wolfsburg headquarters to make the Trinity, the first of a new generation of electric vehicles for the German carmaker, with construction due to start next year.
Friday's 536-page conditional building permit for Tesla does not mean the U.S.-based EV pioneer can start production right away. It must first prove that it fulfils numerous conditions, including in water use and air pollution control.
Only then will Tesla get its long-awaited operating permit and actually start rolling out the 500,000 battery-powered vehicles it wants to produce each year at the new plant, located in the small community of Gruenheide.
Another hurdle to secure the site's water supply emerged late on Friday, when a Frankfurt Oder administrative court sided with environmental groups who had challenged a licence given to a local water utility to supply the Tesla site. 
But the court said the procedural errors made in the licencing decision could be remedied by the water utility, leaving open the door for the water supply arrangement to be salvaged. 
Kickstarting production in Germany would mean Tesla can deliver its Model Y cars to European customers faster and more cheaply, after meeting orders in Europe from its Shanghai factory in recent months as it awaited approval for the site.
Tesla plans to show that it meets the imposed conditions within the next two weeks, Brandenburg's environment minister Axel Vogel said, while objections can be filed over the next month.
Tesla's next challenge will be to scale up production as quickly as possible, which Musk said at a fair on-site in October would take longer than building the factory.
Local environmental groups have long feared that the plant will negatively impact local habitat. Numerous public consultations, focusing primarily on that aspect, delayed the process, with Musk expressing irritation on multiple occasions over German bureaucracy.
The factory, which Tesla has begun constructing under pre-approval permits, will also include a battery plant capable of generating more than 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year - outstripping European competitors.

Batteries for cars produced on-site will initially come from China, Musk said, but he intends to reach volume production at the German battery plant by the end of next year.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has preliminary plans to boost production of its cash cow 737-family narrowbody to around 47 per month by the end of next year, as the U.S. planemaker looks to extend its recovery from successive crises, two people familiar with the matter said.
After slashing production due mainly to the pandemic, Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) are seeing more demand for their medium-haul passenger jets, with both planemakers adding eye-catching deals to their order books in recent weeks.
Boeing's production plans shift and are influenced by many factors, the people cautioned. Doubts are already swirling in the industry over whether the supply chain will be able to meet aggressive production ramp-up plans, particularly in Europe. Suppliers are grappling with labor and materials shortages and weakened balance sheets following the overlapping pandemic and 737 MAX safety grounding crises.
Boeing said in late January it was working to clear an inventory of 335 737 MAX airplanes amassed following two fatal crashes of the jet that grounded the plane for 20 months. It has estimated most of those jets would be delivered by the end of 2023.
Boeing declined to comment on its production plans and referred to its last public statements. 
In late January, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said the 737 program was producing at a rate of 27 jets per month and was on track to reach 31 per month ""fairly soon"". 
Two of the people said the 31-jet monthly stride would come during the second half of the year, though a third person said it could happen sooner.
Beyond that, Boeing aims to increase to around 38 narrowbody jets monthly during the first half of 2023, and reach about 47 jets per month in the second half of 2023, two people said.
Boeing was laying the groundwork to nearly double production by the end of 2023, the third person said, but noted the plans could change due to supply chain constraints or other factors.
A rate of 47 aircraft per month is five shy of its build rate in 2019, when the 737 MAX was grounded.

Airbus, meanwhile, has set a production target of 65 a month by summer 2023 for its A320-family narrowbody.
It has been at odds with engine makers led by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) over its ambitions to push production afterwards as high as 75 a month.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Financial indicators signalled increasing signs of stresses spreading through global markets on Friday as concerns grow over the wider economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
With stock market prices and bond yields falling, gauges regarded as stress indicators are attracting investor attention. 
The so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate, hit its highest level since May 2020.
A higher spread reflects rising interbank lending risk or banks hoarding U.S. dollars, meaning that it is widely viewed as a proxy for banking sector risk.
The U.S. FRA-OIS spread rose to 32.29 basis points on Friday, compared with 23.7 on Thursday.
Global alarm was triggered earlier by a blaze at the site of a Ukrainian nuclear power station, Europe's biggest, after it was seized by Russian forces. The fire has been extinguished.
""The market's liquidity conditions have weakened this week, and were exacerbated overnight after reports of shelling to Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine,"" said ING currency strategist Francesco Pesole. 
Nevertheless, the FRA-OIS gap remains well below levels seen at the height of market turmoil in 2020. 
""Dollar funding conditions are not too alarming at the moment, but the deterioration in the past week naturally argues in favour of a stronger dollar,"" Pesole added.
The dollar index jumped nearly 1%, mainly at the expense of the euro which has tumbled 3% this week because of Europe's exposure to the Russian economy.
Another closely-watched short-term funding stress gauge, the spread between the U.S. three-month Libor and the overnight index swap rate, rose to more than 18 basis points , its highest since May 2020, as well. 
The LIBOR-OIS spread is the credit and term premium a lender would charge for a three-month unsecured loan over an overnight bank loan, such as the effective fed funds rate, the risk-free rate set by the Federal Reserve. 
""Our sense is that this week's unsecured funding pressure reflects a precautionary build up of cash balances that is to some extent exacerbated by the upcoming Fed hike,"" wrote Joseph Abate, managing director, at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a research note.
""Although Libor has lost much of its significance since year-end and the end of banks' ability to put on new trades, the rate is still seen as an early warning barometer of financial market stress,"" he added.
DOLLAR SWAPS MARKET, OTHER STRESS METRICS
The demand for dollars was reflected in swap markets where dollar borrowing costs rose further. For instance, three-month euro-dollar swaps rose to around 27 bps from 15 bps on Thursday. 
However, swap rates remained below a March 2020 peak of nearly 40 bps hit on Monday, and analysts said the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have mechanisms to relieve funding stress. 
Stress metrics are on the rise elsewhere too. 
The cost of insuring exposure to a basket of ""junk-rated"" European company debt jumped to its highest since July 2020 at 398 bps, the iTraxx European Crossover index showed.
Another iTraxx index which measures the cost of insuring exposure to senior bonds from banks and other financial issuers rose 7 bps to 91.7 bps, a May 2020 high.
A European banking stocks index is down 16% this week, reeling from Western sanctions on Russia, a scaling back of interest rate hike forecasts and a worsening macroeconomic environment. 
Also in focus was the daily number of repo fails, which occur when a market participant is unable to deliver the security on time to complete a repo transaction. 

Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said daily repo fails of Treasuries rose to $76.1 billion on Feb. 28, the highest since June 2020 and more than double the average for this year.
While repo fails are relatively common, large nubers of failures in volatile markets suggest dislocations and stress.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The Honduran government's recent push to sharply restrict mining will not apply to existing projects, the country's environment and mining minister said on Friday, days after the ministry declared the industry harmful and pledged to cancel permits.
The government announced on Monday that permit cancellations, as well as a sweeping prohibition on open-pit mining, were needed due to harm the extractive sector poses to natural resources, public health and water access.
At a news conference in the capital Tegucigalpa, a reporter asked environment and mining Minister Lucky Medina if the government will stick to its declaration that Honduras be free from open pit mining.
""The measure never had a retroactive effect to strip those who have already obtained their licenses, nor strip them of their previous (licenses),"" responded Medina.
""That's an evidently judicial decision,"" he added, in an apparent reference to any possible retroactive actions.
Open pit mines target ore-rich soil from sprawling surface deposits that is scooped up by giant trucks. They are often criticized by environmental advocates for their impacts.
A government statement issued before the minister's remarks stressed the government ""will supervise"" some 28,000 hectares that have been granted in concessions for metallic and nonmetallic mining, but did not mention permit cancellations.
Medina's comments will likely soothe concerns over the future of Canadian company Aura Minerals' San Andres mine, an open-pit project in western Honduras.
The Aura Minerals project has been met by stiff local opposition in part due to alleged disturbances to a Maya-Chorti indigenous cemetery.
The new mining policies come from the month-old government of leftist President Xiomara Castro, who took office in January promising to pull the Central American nation ""out of the abyss"" caused by failed economic policies and rampant corruption.
Last year, Honduran mineral exports totaled $293 million, according to central bank data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Geopolitical worries are clouding the outlook for U.S. stocks, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine moderates expectations for how aggressively the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in coming months. 
Concerns over the conflict weighed on the S&P 500 on Friday, as the index pared a rally that has seen it rise 5.2% from its Feb 24 intraday low. 
The see-saw moves come as investor hopes that the Fed may raise rates less severely than anticipated vied with worries about inflation and higher commodity prices, stoked by sanctions against Russia, one of the world’s biggest commodity exporters. 
Investors have virtually priced out the chances of a hefty 50 basis point rate hike in March, giving a lift to the technology and growth stocks that had been pummeled in recent weeks by anticipation of harsh Fed tightening. Among those, shares of software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) was up over 5% since last week, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) up over 3% in the same period. 
""The stock market has been buoyed by expectations for a less aggressive Fed and lower yields in aggregate. The threat of higher interest rates has receded somewhat,"" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger. 
The impact of moderating yields has been evident below the market's surface. Since the day before Russia launched its invasion last week, the S&P 500 growth index, replete with longer-duration stocks heavily pressured by higher yields, has climbed 2.6% against a 2.3% rise for the counterpart value index. That spread narrowed on Friday as the broad market fell. 
Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns have propelled oil prices, prompting fears of slower growth and higher inflation over the long term. U.S. crude prices topped $115 a barrel this week and hit their highest levels since 2008, while other commodities such as wheat also surged. 
""The Fed will be less aggressive now that Russia has invaded Ukraine in the near term, but the problem that the Fed faces has not been ameliorated,"" Neuman said. ""In fact, it has been exacerbated."" 
Investors next week will be watching data on U.S. inflation, due out Thursday. Consumer prices in January grew at their fastest pace in nearly four decades. 
For now, however, the run-up in U.S. Treasury yields, which move opposite to bond prices, has stalled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed over 50 basis points to start the year to 2.065%, but has since pulled back and was last at 1.74%.
Strategists at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) on Thursday upgraded their rating on U.S. equities, which are heavily weighted in tech stocks, to overweight, describing them as a ""classic"" growth trade. 
""Growth stocks were hit by rising real yields, but should benefit as they reverse,"" the Citi strategists wrote in a note.
Conversely, yield-sensitive financial stocks have struggled, with the S&P 500 banks index down nearly 8% since last week.
Truist Advisory Services this week lowered its rating on the financials sector to ""neutral"", while upgrading its ratings on two defensive groups, consumer staples to ""overweight"" and utilities to ""neutral."" 
""Because of what is happening overseas, it complicates the global picture,"" said Keith Lerner, Truist's co-chief investment officer. ""The global economy will be somewhat slower, capping rates, and by itself that is a negative for financials.” 

Some investors have been wary of the rebound in stocks. The  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute is re-evaluating its asset price targets in the wake of the Ukraine turmoil, ""but we don’t want to over-react when uncertainty is so high,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells. 
""With geopolitics still lurking out there, it is going to be tricky for the market to make meaningful headway,"" Samana said.

(Reuters) - Russia is blocking Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the country's communications regulator said on Friday, in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. 
The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020, including restrictions in recent days on state-backed channels like RT and the RIA news agency. 
The move is a major escalation in an ongoing confrontation between big tech companies and Russia, which has in recent years issued a slew of fines and hobbled services through slowdowns. The tensions have ramped up amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation."" 
Tass news agency reported on Friday that Russia has restricted access to Twitter. Interfax news agency earlier said the service had been blocked.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meta's head of global affairs Nick Clegg said the company would continue to do everything it could to restore its services.
""Soon millions of ordinary Russian will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,"" he said, in a statement posted on Twitter.
Meta in a blog said it was working to keep its services available ""to the greatest extent possible"" but it had stopped showing ads to users in Russia and barred Russian advertisers from running ads anywhere in the world ""due to the difficulties of operating in Russia at this time.""
Tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google have also paused advertising in Russia amid growing censorship demands.
Last week, Moscow said it was partially limiting access to Facebook, a move the company said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.
Major tech companies have faced pressure to respond to the Feb. 24 invasion, which has led to economic sanctions against Moscow by governments around the world. Russian state-run media has emerged as a key flashpoint between Moscow and social media platforms during the conflict. 
Meta this week said it had restricted access to RT and Sputnik across the European Union and was globally demoting content from Russian state-controlled outlets' Facebook pages and Instagram accounts, as well as posts containing links to those outlets on Facebook. 
Russia has made several moves to crack down on foreign news media in recent days. It cut access to several news organizations' websites, including the BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for spreading what it says is false information about its actions in Ukraine.
Ukraine's government had called on Meta and other platforms during the conflict to withdraw their services from Russia. Online speech experts and rights advocates have raised concerns about the impact of blocking online services for Russian citizens trying to organize or get information.
Meta had about 7.5 million users on Facebook in Russia as of last year and 122.2 million users across its other services, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, according to estimates from Insider Intelligence. The leading Russia-based social network VK had 63 million users, the researcher estimated.
Popular VPN apps have been downloaded more than 1.3 million times in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began, according to data from researcher AppFigures, which described the figure as a major surge.
Meta was also one of several tech companies facing possible punitive measures in Russia after they failed to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law passed this summer. 
Tech companies globally have pulled out of Russia in response to requests from governments or to signal support for Ukraine. U.S. internet provider Cogent Communications said on Friday it was cutting internet service to Russian clients.
Earlier this week, business software giant  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) said it was suspending all operations in Russia, while rival SAP SE (DE:SAPG) said it would pause all sales in the country. A Ukraine government official had tweeted at both companies asking for support.

Roskomnadzor said in its statement that Meta had restricted access to the accounts of state-backed news outlets in recent days, listing RT, Sputnik, the RIA news agency, the defense ministry's Zvezda TV and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru. 
It said such restrictions violated the key principles of freedom of information and Russian internet users' unimpeded access to Russian media.

""We continue to actively monitor this complex situation to determine our next steps,"" the company said in a statement. 
Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics is No. 1 in handsets in Russia with 30% market share as of the fourth quarter of 2021, ahead of Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF)'s 23% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 13% respectively, according to data provider Counterpoint. 
Brands such as smartphone rival Apple,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and IKEA have stopped sales, distanced themselves or paused business in Russia as the country has been hit with sanctions and international criticism for its invasion of Ukraine. Changes in shipping routes are an additional factor.

Chinese firms, which contributed 44% of the Russia handset market in 2021 according to Counterpoint, have so far stayed largely silent about their operations in Russia, as Beijing has refrained from criticizing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine.
Samsung is also donating $6 million, including $1 million in consumer electronics, as well as voluntary donations from employees, to actively support humanitarian efforts ""around the region,"" including aid for refugees, it said.

The plan to terminate 50 employees was approved on Feb. 21, according to the regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1784168/000121390022010757/ea156449-8k_electric.htm.
The company, which is struggling with production due to supply chain hurdles, said on Feb. 1 that its top two executives, Chief Executive James Taylor and Chairman Jason Luo, had resigned following an investigation into their share purchases.

The company had also said it would restate financial statements as of Dec. 31, 2020 and the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021.
Since the resignation of the executives, the Troy, Michigan-based company's stock has tumbled about 68%.
