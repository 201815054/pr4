Storing wealth in cash is clearly a counter-intuitive call when inflation is surging towards double-digit figures for the first time in a generation. 
Yet, many investors are doing just that: BoFA said $13.2 billion was moved into cash last week and cash positions by fund managers earlier this month reached their highest levels since the pandemic market crash of March 2020.
BofA analysts also warned that commodity prices were on track for their biggest increase in over a century while government bonds were set for their worst year since 1949 as central banks raise interest rates to tame surging inflation. 
With equity markets losing more than 5% so far this quarter, many investors may feel vindicated in deserting risky stock markets where dividends and capital gains are looking less attractive compared to fast-rising government bond yields. 
Yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen nearly 40% so far this month to 2.5% while in Germany, the Bund is closing to 0.6% and moving further away from negative territory which was its home for the past three years. 
The war in Ukraine, hard-pressured supply chains, a resurgent pandemic amid buoyant inflation is making this monetary tightening cycle particularly hard to manoeuvre.
The picture, this last Monday morning of March 2022, is blurry as ever. 
The yen extended its descent to a six-year low after the Bank of Japan stepped into the market to stop government bond yields from rising and Asian shares retreated as a coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai weighed on sentiment.
Oil prices are falling about $5 amid fears of weaker demand from China but are still at levels unseen since 2014.
Some answers on the direction of travel from here are expected this week with surveys on global manufacturing, inflation readings and U.S. job data. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
- German exporters' morale slumps on war in Ukraine
- China industrial profits up, but mired in single-digit growth

- Central bank speakers: Andrea Enria, chair of the supervisory board of the ECB, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Norway Central Bank Deputy Governor Oystein Borsum

""We are considering investment in companies ranging from those that are big in scale to those that are small,"" Co-CEO of SK Hynix Park Jung-ho, who is also CEO of SK Square, said at the latter's annual shareholders meeting. 
SK Square, which owns 20.1% of SK Hynix, plans to secure 2 trillion won ($1.63 billion) or more of its own for investments over the next three years, as well as establish a joint investment base with domestic and foreign investors, to invest intensively in areas such as chips and blockchain.

The drug, branded as Fintepla, already has the U.S. approval to treat another form of childhood-onset epilepsy, Davet Syndrome (DS), in patients aged two years and older.
LGS causes cognitive dysfunction and frequent seizures that often lead to injury, and UCB's  Zogenix  (NASDAQ:ZGNX) unit estimates that about 30,000 to 50,000 people have the syndrome in the United States.
The FDA approval was supported by safety and efficacy data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in 263 patients with LGS, the biotech firm said in a statement.
Developed by Zogenix, Fintepla is available only through a restricted drug distribution program in the United States.
California-based Zogenix was acquired by UCB in a deal worth about $2 billion, which closed earlier this month.
Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia forecast worldwide peak sales for Fintepla of about $300 million by 2030 from the LGS indication alone, and of about $800 million in total from both the indications.
Fintepla adjusts a receptor called Sigma 1, which controls how brain cells communicate with each other. The drug comes with a boxed warning for heart and lung conditions such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The FDA approval pits Fintepla against  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  (NASDAQ:JAZZ)' cannabis-based drug, Epidiolex, which is U.S.-approved to treat seizures related to Dravet Syndrome and LGS.
In a late-stage study, Fintepla showed average reduction in the frequency of seizures by 39.4% at three months. Epidiolex showed a 44% reduction in seizure frequency over a similar period in its study.
Fintepla's relatively higher pricing and undifferentiated data in LGS could restrict its use to patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy, Kapadia said.

""In the DS indication it is clear that Fintepla is a superior product, but I think that's less true for the LGS indication.""
Other drugs, which could potentially add to the competition for Fintepla include Takeda Pharmaceutical's soticlestat and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY)'s lorcaserin and Fycompa.

(Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in Germany in the first three months of 2022 have dropped 10% from the same period in 2021 in what has been the slowest start to a year since 2016 due to market uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Equity capital markets in the euro zone's biggest economy have been hit harder as market jitters have led to a total dearth of deals with no initial public offerings (IPOs) or convertible offerings recorded so far this year, according to Refinitiv data.
""It is unlikely that companies will choose to list before Easter, even unlikely before the summer given current market conditions,"" said Armin von Falkenhayn, head of corporate and investment banking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). 
German equity capital markets raised only $1 billion so far this year, down 88% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
But appetite for M&A deals remains strong even if boardrooms have become more risk-averse.
""Unlike at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, the M&A market has definitely not come to a standstill and projects are continuing. But parties are examining very carefully how the conflict may affect each company,"" said Tibor Kossa, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
While the Ukraine crisis has affected only around 1-2% of German companies' sales, ""the war and its longer-term consequences absorb a lot of management capacity,"" said Berthold Mueller, chairman of DACH investment banking at Jefferies. 
Yet amid prevailing caution to begin new processes, some auctions that were launched before the war managed to get to the finish line.
One such example was Siemens' $1.3 billion carve-out of its mail and parcel logistics business, which was sold to Hamburg-based Koerber in February and led to consumer products and services accounting for one-third of German target M&A in the first quarter.
Other deals in the technology sector contributed to 31% of German target M&A including the purchase by Italian infrastructure and transport services firm Atlantia of Siemens' traffic software solutions business, Yunex.
Strong growth in the technology sector contributed to an increase in mid-market deal activity to its highest year-to-date total since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
""Private equity remains open to acquisitions and transactions can continue to be funded,"" said Christopher Droege, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs.
EYES ON TRANSATLANTIC TIE-UPS
One sector that seems resilient to the backdrop of war is telecommunications – arguably a necessity for information flow in times of crisis.
Earlier this month, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) launched the sale of its towers business and is collecting indicative offers together with adviser Goldman Sachs, in a deal that could value the business at close to 18 billion euros ($19.86 billion).
Dealmakers say there are intense dialogues with corporate clients as well as private equity and the deal pipeline for the rest of the year looks intact.
Transatlantic tie-ups could increase as the European landscape becomes more challenging.
""In the future we expect that German companies looking for takeovers will orient themselves increasingly towards North America since the growth gap between Europe and the United States is likely to widen further in the current environment,"" Goldman's Kossa said.
Nevertheless, dealmaking during wartime remains hard to stomach for some parties that prefer to wait for peacetime.

""A buyer cannot go before their board of directors and pretend this war does not exist. The question is how long this situation will last. That is why many companies tend to wait until the situation clears up,"" said Jefferies' Mueller.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a cautious manner Monday, as investors keep a wary eye on developments in the war between Ukraine and Russia with peace talks set to take place in Turkey this week.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
The war in Ukraine is now entering its second month and has resulted in the devastation of several cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis, and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of Ukraine's population.
That said, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and risks being drawn into guerrilla warfare, something Moscow would be keen to avoid, given previous difficulties in Afghanistan.
New in-person peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to take place in Turkey this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to his country on Sunday that his government would prioritize the ""territorial integrity"" of Ukraine, but hopes are rising that a compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region could be reached as part of a peace deal.
Meanwhile, the U.S. quickly backtracked from President Joe Biden’s comments that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” with Secretary of State Antony Blinken clarifying that his country does not have a strategy for regime change.
The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe Monday, with most attention on the monthly U.S. employment report due at the end of the week as this could help markets get a sense of whether the Fed’s roadmap for rate hikes is realistic.
Back in Europe, the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the chief executive of Daimler Truck (OTC:DDAIF) said electric truck costs would ""forever be higher"" than those using combustion engines, putting the EV market into the spotlight.
Oil prices slumped Monday on fears of reduced demand from China, the world’s largest crude importer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted the country’s officials to instigate a two-stage lockdown at its financial hub of Shanghai.
All firms and factories in Shanghai would suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely in a two-stage lockdown, closing half the city in turns, over nine days. Public transport, including ride-hailing services, will also be suspended.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.6% lower at $109.80 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3.3% to $113.52. 
Oil is still heading for a fourth monthly gain after Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine, prompting fears of disruptions to global supplies, driving prices above $100 a barrel.

Investing.com – Chinese food delivery provider Meituan (HK:3690) impressed in its results for the fourth quarter of 2021, reporting a net loss of CNY 5.3 billion ($832.38 million) versus the CNY7.2 billion forecast by analysts. Revenue rose 31%, the slowest in more than a year, to CNY49.5 billion, and met estimates.
The company’s Hong Kong shares soared 14% to HK$153.9 ($19.66) by 1:25 AM ET (5:25 AM GMT). The stocks snapped a two-day loss to become the best performer on the Hang Seng Tech Index on Monday.
Meituan is one of the Chinese technology giants under regulatory scrutiny in areas from the welfare of its delivery riders to the commissions it charges restaurants. It is also under pressure to share its wealth as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive, with the country facing its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
The government in February issued a call to aid the service industry, asking food delivery platforms to cut the fees they charge restaurants and wiping $26 billion off Meituan’s value in a single day. The city of Shanghai also entered a nine-day lockdown earlier in the day.
“Meituan’s fourth-quarter boost in food-delivery margin from a persistent increase in transactions could alleviate concerns about the drag from government-initiated fee cuts, meant to provide relief to merchants amid Covid-19 flare-up, to the unit’s first-half profitability. The company needs to raise first half transaction volume by at least 14% to yield more cost savings, we calculate, while lifting food-delivery margin above the year-earlier level following fee adjustments,” according to Bloomberg analysts Catherine Lim and Tiffany Tam."

(Reuters - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ made history on Sunday as the first streaming service to win a best picture Oscar for ""CODA,” a heartwarming drama about the daughter of deaf parents who pursues her passion for music.
The streaming service purchased ""CODA"" for a record $25 million following its debut in 2021 at the Sundance Film Festival, and it has gathered momentum throughout the awards season, winning top honors from the Producers Guild, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild awards. 
""CODA"" faced intense competition from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s critically acclaimed western, ""The Power of the Dog,"" which collected a dozen nominations. The film's director, Jane Campion, received an Academy Award. 
The best picture Oscar signals how far the industry has come since 2017, when the Cannes film festival prohibited movies that were not released on the big screen from competing for its most prestigious prize, the Palme d’Or. It was a deliberate snub to streaming services like Netflix.
As the global pandemic forced theaters to close in 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences modified its Oscar eligibility rules to temporarily change the requirement that a movie screen for seven days in theaters to qualify. That represented a watershed moment for movies that debut via streaming services in the home.
The best picture Oscar also marks a milestone for Apple TV+, which launched in November 2019 with a handful of original series and no library of movies and TV shows. 

Apple TV+ saw a breakthrough in September 2021, when its fish-out-of-water comedy, ""Ted Lasso,"" about an American football coach who takes a job with an English soccer club, received the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series.
""If Apple was to win the coveted best picture award with CODA it would catalyze more A+ talent coming to Apple first (or in the top bracket)"" and boost subscriptions, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote before the awards.

Citing a source close to Chinese regulators, the official China Securities Journal reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) heard opinions from some U.S.-listed Chinese companies during an online meeting on Sunday. 
""Both Chinese and U.S. regulators are fully aware of each other's concerns, and are moving toward each other, and working hard to find solutions to the issue in order to achieve effective and sustainable cooperation as soon as possible,"" the source was cited as saying.
""This is in the best interests of the capital markets of both countries and global investors."" 
CSRC said that the recent talks with U.S. regulators have been efficient, candid, and professional, the newspaper said.
The comments come days after the U.S. public company accounting regulator said that recent media speculation about an imminent deal with China was ""premature"", and it remained unclear if the Chinese government would grant the access required by a new U.S. listing law.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - a long-simmering auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake.
The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of China's biggest tech companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), jumped 3.6% on Monday morning, compared with a 1.3% gain in the benchmark index Hang Seng.
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES 
But some analysts and investors remain sceptical that a solution will be found.
""Significant differences exist between the US and Chinese regulators,"" Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, wrote on Monday. ""Many US-listed Chinese companies will face delisting eventually."" 
U.S. regulators require disclosure of government interest in the listed companies, as well as sensitive information and data, while the Chinese government ""has been tightening its control on many of China's biggest and most important companies,"" he added.
To avert the delisting risk, New York-based asset manager Krane Funds Advisors said earlier this month that its $4.9 billion KraneShare CSI China Internet ETF aims to convert all Chinese American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in its portfolio into their Hong Kong shares in the coming months. 
Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including Alibaba, Baidu and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure they remain listed in New York, Reuters reported last week.

The Financial Times and Bloomberg News also reported this month that China's securities watchdog is weighing a proposal that would allow U.S. regulators to inspect auditors' working papers for some companies as soon as this year.
CSRC cautioned market participants not to blindly believe in speculation by some media with little knowledge of the details and direction of the talks, as such reports caused unnecessary disturbances to market expectations, the China Securities Journal reported on Sunday.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.01%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.19% while the ShenzhenComponent fell 0.68%, with Shanghai locking down to curb rising numbers of COVID-19 cases.
U.S. Treasuries were mixed after a bond rout, triggered by fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest-rate hikes to curb inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell but remained above a technical trend line that has effectively served as a ceiling since the late 1980s. Bonds also fell in Australia and New Zealand.
Commodities supply chains continue to be disrupted by the war in Ukraine, alongside the trend towards tighter central bank monetary policies. Investors are pricing in two full percentage points of Fed rate rises for the rest of the year, which has led to further volatility in the stocks, bonds and currencies markets.
“The Fed is trying to create a Goldilocks scenario by engineering a soft landing,” Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik told Bloomberg. “The equity markets are buying it and the bond markets aren’t.”
Malik added she expects only a moderate impact on global growth from the war, as economic expansion will be strong enough to overcome inflation.
Ukraine and Russia will reportedly resume in-person talks within the week, with the U.S. in damage control mode after President Joe Biden said that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken quickly clarified that the U.S. does not have a strategy for regime change.
Although global shares have clawed back some losses from the Russian invasion, other investors are questioning the gains’ durability.
It may be that what we’re seeing is “more a bear-market rally,” Pepperstone Financial Pty head of research Chris Weston said in a note. Investment flows related to portfolio rebalancing at the end of March 2022 and the first quarter could lead to “big and questionable moves,” the note added.

(Reuters) -Australia's Star Entertainment Group said on Monday its chief executive officer Matt Bekier had tendered his resignation, amid an investigation over possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws at its casinos. 
The casino operator's shares, which have fallen over 12% already this year, were down as much as 1.9%. 
Bekier informed the board that as managing director and CEO, he is ""accountable for the effectiveness and adequacy of the company's processes, policies, people and culture,"" adding that the right thing to do was for him to take responsibility, a company statement said.
Bekier's decision to step down, effective immediately, followed issues raised at the public hearings in connection with the ongoing review of the Star Sydney hotel and casino, the company added in a statement. The Star Sydney is Australia's second largest casino.
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) had launched a probe in June last year into Star's casino in Sydney amid concerns over ongoing customer due diligence and compliance with laws.
Local media also had reported on a confidential review that accused Star of failure to curb fraud and money laundering at its two resorts.
""If Crown Resorts is a guide, we have a long way to go which could involve further management/board change and the now, very real possibility of Star losing its licence to operate, which could conceivably dash plans for an additional 1,000 Electronic Gaming Machines in Sydney,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.

Last week, an inquiry had declared rival casino operator Crown Resorts unfit for a gambling licence in Western Australia state, but stopped short of revoking it. 
Bekier, who was also previously the chief financial officer of Star, will work with the board to transition his executive responsibilities, the company added. His final departure date is yet to be determined.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Sunday reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond.
The decision was a win for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that could cost other automakers hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
Confirming an earlier report by Reuters, NHTSA said https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-03/2022-03-25%20CAFE%20Penalties%20FR%20-%20Website%20Version_0.pdf the decision ""increases the accountability of manufacturers for violating the nation’s fuel economy standards"" and the penalty increase ""incentivizes manufacturers to make fuel economy improvements.""
President Donald Trump's administration in its final days in January 2021 delayed a 2016 regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements starting in the 2019 model year. 
NHTSA's final rule, which takes effect 60 days after it is published, reinstated the higher penalties and boosted them further for the 2022 model year. The agency has not collected penalties for 2019 to 2021 model years while the issue was under review and is the subject of court challenges.
The final rule was signed on Thursday by NHTSA's top official, Steven Cliff, ahead of its formal publication.
For the 2019 to 2021 model years, the fine is $14, up from $5.50, for every 0.1 mile per gallon new vehicles fall short of required fuel-economy standards, multiplied by the number of noncomplying vehicles sold. For the 2022 model year, this rises to $15. 
Automakers protested the penalty hike in 2016, warning it could raise industry costs by at least $1 billion annually. The decision is expected to cost Chrysler parent Stellantis, for instance, as much as $572 million by the company's prior estimates, while boosting the value of compliance credits sold by Tesla.
Automakers whose vehicles achieve higher fuel economy than required can sell credits to automakers that do not meet CAFE rules.
Under President Barack Obama, the higher penalties were set to start with the 2019 model year, but the Trump administration set the effective date as the 2022 model year following a court decision.
NHTSA estimated that for the 2019 model year, automakers would owe $294 million at the new rate, up from $115.4 million under the prior rate. 
NHTSA added automakers that made plans for 2019 through 2021 ""thinking that penalties would not increase did so at their own risk.""
The head of a trade group representing nearly all major automakers except Tesla said Sunday it would be a ""better outcome"" if the penalties ""were invested in electric vehicles, batteries and charging infrastructure instead of disappearing into the general fund of the Treasury.""
In August, NHTSA proposed hiking CAFE requirements by 8% annually for 2024 through 2026, reversing a Trump-era regulation that rolled back higher requirements starting in the 2021 model year. NHTSA is expected to issue its final CAFE rules through 2026 this week.
On Sunday, Stellantis said it would ""like to work with the administration and Congress to allow the agencies to use the proceeds from penalties to bolster investments in the technologies and infrastructure required to accelerate a robust U.S. market for EVs.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. U.S. fuel economy fines lost 75% of their original value, having risen only once since 1975 - from $5 to $5.50 in 1997.

Scottish Widows, part of Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), said this added a further 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to its exclusions, bringing total divestments from firms deemed to pose a threat to the pension provider's environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals to 3 billion pounds. 
The firm said it would not invest in any company deriving more than 10% of its revenue from tobacco, which it said meant excluding all tobacco manufacturers and major distributors.
""Industries such as tobacco are at severe risk of becoming stranded assets, as they face intense pressure from investors, regulators and consumers, and consistently fail to properly address the social impacts of their products and within their supply chain,"" said Maria Nazarova-Doyle, Scottish Widows head of pension investments and responsible investments.
Scottish Widows, which has 190 billion pounds in assets under administration, also said it would lower the threshold for investing in firms extracting thermal coal and tar sands, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, to 5% of revenue from 10%. 
The shift out of tobacco follows similar moves by financial institutions such as Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and  Aviva  (LON:AV). 

Insurers and investors such as Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) have also been tightening their policies towards fossil fuels, as firms focus increasingly on environmentally sustainable investments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's shareholders are set to vote on a resolution at this year's annual meeting calling for Britain's second biggest supermarket group to commit to paying the so called real Living Wage to all its workers by July 2023.
Responsible investment group ShareAction, which is co-ordinating the move, said on Monday the resolution has been filed by an investor coalition managing 2.2 trillion pounds ($2.9 trillion) that includes Legal and General Investment Management, Fidelity International, HSBC Asset Management and Nest.
It is the first resolution calling for a listed firm to become a Living Wage accredited employer.
The real Living Wage is established by the Living Wage Foundation and independently calculated by the Resolution Foundation according to how much workers and their families need to live.
The rates are currently 11.05 pounds ($14.58) per hour in London and 9.90 pounds per hour in the rest of the United Kingdom.
That compares to Britain's main government-mandated minimum wage rate of 8.91 pounds an hour, which is due to rise 6.6% to 9.50 pounds an hour on April 1.
In January, Sainsbury's, one of the UK's biggest private sector employers, set new pay rates for directly employed workers that will see it hit the real Living Wage for staff in inner London and outside the capital.
However, its rate of 10.50 pounds for workers in outer London fell short of the real Living Wage for that region.
It did not make any commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff, such as cleaners and security guards.
""Furthermore, Sainsbury’s have made no commitment that pay will continue to increase in line with the cost of living in future years.  Accrediting as a Living Wage employer would remove this uncertainty and guarantee all workers a wage that they can live on,"" ShareAction said.
A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said colleague feedback from its pay review had been positive and it had to balance the needs of all its stakeholders. 
""It is vital that we not only pay our colleagues fairly but that we are able to invest significantly to offer customers great value,"" said the spokesperson.

Sainsbury's annual shareholders meeting will be held on July 7.

(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) has turned down a settlement offer from Alta Fox Capital Management LLC to have only one of its nominees added to the U.S. toy maker's board of directors, making a shareholder vote over the dispute likely, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The two sides have been discussing how to avert a proxy contest after Alta Fox, a hedge fund that holds a 2.5% stake in Hasbro, nominated five directors to the company's eleven-member board last month. 
Alta Fox has privately indicated to Hasbro, the maker of Dungeons & Dragons and Play-Doh, that it would settle for two new directors, as long as one of them is one of the five Alta Fox nominees, and a board committee focused on capital allocation, the sources said. 
Hasbro, however, has rejected giving any of the Alta Fox nominees a board seat, the sources added. The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company has indicated to Alta Fox that it believes it can replenish its board with directors of a higher caliber and more relevant experience than the Alta Fox nominees, the sources added.
It is still possible that the two sides reach a compromise before Hasbro's annual shareholder meeting where shareholders will vote on the board's composition, the sources said. That meeting is expected to take place in the spring. 
The sources requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations between the two side. 
Hasbro said in a statement it is committed to engaging with all shareholders and has held ""multiple conversations"" with Alta Fox to listen to its views and ""attempt to come to a resolution of this campaign."" 
""We are disappointed the board refuses to listen to its shareholders and appears more interested in forcing a contest than agreeing to a reasonable settlement that investors would support,"" an Alta Fox representative said.
Alta Fox, a firm founded four years ago by hedge fund veteran Connor Haley, has called on Hasbro to consider spinning off its prominent Wizards of the Coast unit to boost its lagging share price. The unit, which publishes Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, saw its revenue grow 42% in 2021, according to Hasbro.    The investment firm argued Hasbro's ""ineffective"" Brand Blueprint strategy, including ""ill-advised acquisitions"" like the 2019 purchase of Entertainment One for $4.6 billion, is holding it back and that its share price could surge to $200 a share in the next three years with ""corrective action."" 

Hasbro shares closed at $84.88 on Friday after hitting their lowest level in the last 52 weeks on Thursday, and they are down more than 10% over the past five years.Alta Fox has said its supports Chris Cocks, who took over as Hasbro's CEO last month after leading the Wizards of the Coast unit, but that he should be surrounded by a ""meaningfully refreshed board.""  
Hasbro has said it has a ""highly qualified, independent, experienced and engaged board.""

In votes Thursday and Friday at General Motors in the city of Ramos Arizpe in the border state of Coahuila, several thousand workers cast ballots to keep ties with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), the union said on Sunday.
Contract ratification votes are required under Mexico's 2019 labor reform, which underpins a new trade deal with the United States and Canada, to ensure workers are not bound to contracts that were signed behind their backs, hampering them from demanding better pay.
In the global propulsion systems area of the GM plant, 94% of 1,379 votes cast were in favor of the contract, as were 96% of 2,657 ballots cast in the larger assembly area, CTM said in a statement. 
More than 4,500 employees were eligible to vote at the 40-year-old plant, which produces Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox cars as well as two engine types. 
General Motors did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 

The outcome marks a stark contrast from a vote at a larger GM plant in the central Mexican city of Silao last year where several thousand workers rejected their contract with CTM, a process closely watched by the U.S. government after allegations of irregularities.
In February the Silao workers elected an independent union, SINTTIA, opening the door to the prospect of bigger pay rises.

Auchan, which has around 30,000 staff, 231 stores and e-commerce activities in Russia, has already been criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for remaining operational in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
In the interview published on Sunday, Auchan's chief executive Yves Claude said he feared the company risked losing assets or exposing local managers to potential legal troubles if it pulled out of Russia. 
The firm would also remain in Ukraine, Claude said, where its 43 supermarkets and around 6,000 staff, including in regions hit by the war, were operating under ""extreme conditions"".
""The most important in our eyes is to maintain our employees and ensure our primary mission, which is to continue feeding the populations of these two countries,"" Claude said.
Responding to the report, Ukraine's foreign minister called for a boycott of Auchan and all of its products.
""Apparently, job losses in Russia are more important than the loss of life in Ukraine,"" Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has said it was necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and do not cover their ""thirst for profit"" through ""cheap"" communication, explicitly citing Auchan and Swiss food giant Nestle.

The company generated 3.2 billion euros in sales in Russia last year, around 10% of its global sales, and expects losses this year in that market.
Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies calls this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

23,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 08:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Around 48,000 grocery workers voted to strike if needed when seeking higher wages from stores owned by Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Albertsons Companies Inc in Southern California, the UFCW 770 union said on Saturday.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) has been seeking significantly higher and equal pay, sufficient staffing and enough working hours in their negotiations with the grocers, which began on Jan. 28.
As U.S. food prices rise, workers are pushing big corporations that have been posting record profits to offer more.
Politicians including President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have voiced support for such demands.
The union said in a statement it would notify workers if a decision were made to strike.
It said there was a big disconnect between its proposal and the offer of an hourly raise of 60 cents, or less than a 1% increase, made by the grocers, including Ralphs, Albertsons, Pavilions and Vons.
Kroger-owned Ralphs called the union's proposal unrealistic as it is expensive to do business in California, while proposing to maintain its nearly $133 million annual investment in health care benefits.
The grocer, which has around 190 stores in California, said it might start making contingency plans, including advertising for temporary workers, to keep its business running.
As the previous workers' contract expired on March 6, the labor union has slapped unfair labor practice charges against the grocers.
The union said bargaining would resume on Wednesday and if talks failed, it would decide on the next steps.
It warned the workers not to walk out until it notified them and said it would have strike benefit funds available to support members if the companies forced the union to take action.

Ralphs said on Monday it hoped the union would return to the bargaining table with renewed interest in reaching a balanced deal.
Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment.

The country's largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, said the 40-day study included more than half a million people aged 60 to 100.
Some 58% of participants had received a second booster - or two shots in addition to the basic two-shot regimen. The remainder had received only one booster. Researchers recorded 92 deaths among the first group and 232 deaths among the second, smaller group.
""The main conclusion is that the second booster is lifesaving,"" said Ronen Arbel, Health Outcomes Researcher at Clalit and Sapir College.

The report was issued as a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. The research excluded people who received rival  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine and those who had taken oral anti-COVID therapy.
Israeli health officials have put out a number of studies on vaccine efficacy throughout the pandemic that have impacted policymaking in other countries.

Investors have also raised concerns with new Chair Axel Lehmann over the bank's decision not to publish a report into the lender's failings around the collapse of Greensill last year, the paper said.
Credit Suisse racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.72 billion) loss as a result of the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to Greensill and a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos.
Under Swiss corporate rules, directors can be held responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties, with shareholders asked each year to free them from legal liabilities for the previous year. 
Approving the vote waives the directors' or management's liabilities, but only applies to facts that have been disclosed to shareholders and the claims of the company and shareholders who approved it.
""How can we let them off the hook when we don't know the full details of what happened?"" one shareholder told the FT.
Switzerland's second-largest bank has been working to recover assets from the collapse of Greensill.
The bank said last month it had recovered $7.3 billion in the funds that it suspended in March 2021 and has filed a total of 11 insurance claims.
The bank is due to publish its agenda for the AGM in the coming days. A spokesperson declined to comment to Reuters on Sunday.
Credit Suisse commissioned Swiss lawyers Walder Wyss and accountants Deloitte to investigate the case.

The report they produced has been completed and shared with the bank's board and Swiss financial watchdog FINMA, but ""in light of the ongoing recovery process and the legal complexities of the matter, there is no intention by the Board to publish the report,"" the bank said in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Saturday named the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) safety chief as the acting leader of the agency effective Friday.
Billy Nolen, who in December was named the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, had previously been vice president for safety, security and quality for WestJet Airlines in Canada.
Nolen, who started his career as an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) pilot, will replace FAA administrator Steve Dickson, who is stepping down on March 31, until the White House nominates a permanent successor.
""Billy Nolen has extensive expertise in aviation and a deep understanding of the vital role the FAA plays in ensuring the safety of the traveling public,” said U.S Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Nolen leads a team of more than 7,600 FAA employees. The FAA’s safety efforts and oversight of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have come under fire after two fatal 737 MAX crashes in a five-month period killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month grounding. Congress in December 2020 passed legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes and delegates some duties to manufacturers like Boeing.
Dickson, 64, is resigning about halfway through his five-year term. The Biden administration ""is conducting a national search for a nominee to become the permanent FAA administrator,"" the FAA said Saturday.
Dickson headed the FAA as it oversaw a comprehensive review of the then-grounded Boeing 737 MAX. He took a hard line, warning in late 2019 that Boeing was pursuing ""a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic.""
Earlier this week, the FAA warned Boeing it may not gain certification of a lengthened version of the 737 MAX ahead of a key safety deadline set by Congress and also sought updates on progress for both the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9, Reuters reported Friday. 
The FAA is still scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing and last month said it would not allow Boeing to self-certify 787 Dreamliners.

Nolen will face the headache of the 5G wireless deployment using C-Band spectrum, an issue that saw major international airlines scramble to cancel some U.S flights amid warnings the network could interfere with sensitive aviation electronics. Nolen has been in ongoing discussions with telecom and aviation industry officials.
The FAA also said Saturday that Deputy FAA Administrator Bradley Mims ""will also take on an expanded role during this interim period, focusing on the FAA’s workforce and the nation’s airports.""

""Uber has been granted a London private hire vehicle operator's license for a period of two and a half years,"" a spokesperson for Transport for London (TfL) said in a statement to Reuters. 
In 2019, Uber lost its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time, and a year later the ride-hailing firm was granted an 18-month London license after a legal battle to restore its operations. The U.S. company first lost its license in 2017. 
Uber had previously claimed that it has assuaged safety concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.
The firm also struck a deal with Britain's GMB union last year, allowing it to represent up to 70,000 drivers. 

TfL now finds Uber to be a fit and proper person and has granted a license with conditions, the spokesperson added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as financial shares rose after the benchmark Treasury yield jumped to its highest level in nearly three years.
The Nasdaq ended lower, and tech and other big growth names mostly declined, but they finished off session lows following a late-session rally.
For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registered solid gains of 2% and 1.8%, respectively, and the Dow was nominally higher with a 0.3% rise. 
The S&P 500 financials sector gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost on Friday, rising 1.3%, while technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the only two major sectors to end lower on the day.
Investors are assessing how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be as it tightens policy after Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the central bank needed to move ""expeditiously"" to combat high inflation and raised the possibility of a 50-basis-point hike in rates in May.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note surging to nearly three-year highs, as the market grappled with high inflation and a Federal Reserve that could easily spark a downturn as it aggressively tightens policy.
Ten-year Treasury yields were last at 2.492% after earlier rising above 2.50% for the first time since May 2019. 
The equity market is pricing in a higher rate environment, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
That is causing bank stocks to outperform, while ""adding more pressure to the riskier elements of the market,"" such as growth shares, he said.
Higher borrowing rates benefit banks, while higher rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.3 points, or 0.44%, to 34,861.24, the S&P 500 gained 22.9 points, or 0.51%, to 4,543.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points, or 0.16%, to 14,169.30.
Shares of growth companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp eased after leading a Wall Street rebound earlier this week.
The utilities sector also rose sharply, hitting a record high as investors favored defensive stocks with the Russia-Ukraine war still raging after a month. 
The sector ended up 1.5% on the day and up 3.5% for the week, while the energy sector ended up 2.3% on the day and jumped more than 7% for the week following sharp gains in oil prices.
Moscow signaled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists.
Economists at Citibank are expecting four 50 basis points interest rate hikes from the Fed this year, joining other Wall Street banks in forecasting an aggressive tightening path against the backdrop of soaring inflation.
The U.S. central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
""The market's really macro driven,"" said Steve DeSanctis, small- and mid-capitalization equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""Company fundamentals haven't really mattered.""
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.92 billion shares, compared with the 14.28 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 79 new lows.

(Reuters) -Instacart Inc on late Thursday cut its valuation by nearly 40% to about $24 billion due to recent market turbulence, in an unusual move that shows how public market volatility affects high-flying private companies.The new valuation marks a substantial drop from last March, when the grocery delivery firm was valued at $39 billion in a $265 million funding round from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as the coronavirus pandemic was raging and doorstep delivery boomed. The latest valuation was not decided by investors but a fair market value study performed by an independent firm, according to a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the information was not public.

Instacart has not raised any outside capital at the current valuation, the source added.
Several public companies in the delivery space, including DoorDash Inc, have seen their shares plummet in the past three months amid a broader tech selloff, and as investors worry about growth potential. ""We are not immune to the market turbulence that has impacted leading technology companies - both public and private,"" said an Instacart spokesperson. The company said the updated valuation would help it attract and retain talent in a tight U.S. labor market by aligning new equity awards, effectively issuing more shares to employees at a lower price. Instacart will still have to take on amped up competition. Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc beefed up its grocery deliveries and DoorDash is grabbing a bigger share of the delivery market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it was again extending its target date to complete an environmental review of the proposed SpaceX Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket program in Boca Chica, Texas, to April 29.
The FAA's previous target date was March 28. The FAA noted that completing the environmental review does not guarantee a vehicle operator license will be issued, which must also meet FAA safety, risk and financial responsibility requirements.
The FAA said it ""is currently reviewing the Final (Programmatic Environmental Assessment) and completing consultation and coordination with agencies at the local, state, and federal level.""
SpaceX founder Elon Musk said last month he was ""highly confident"" his new SpaceX Starship, designed for voyages to the moon and Mars, will reach Earth orbit for the first time this year.
The FAA is deciding whether the planned build-out in Texas poses a significant environmental impact to the area - including an adjacent wildlife reserve - and must therefore undergo a far more extensive study before expanded operations at SpaceX's rocket production facility and spaceport in Boca Chica can be licensed.
Even in a ""worst-case"" scenario, in which a full environmental impact statement were required or legal wrangling over the issue threatened to drag on, Musk said SpaceX has a fall-back plan.

The company would shift its entire Starship program to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where SpaceX already has received the environmental approval it needs, Musk said.
Such a move would cause a setback of six to eight months, he added. In any case, SpaceX is still shooting for a 2023 launch of what it calls the world's first private lunar mission, flying aboard a Starship to loop around the moon and return to Earth.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched a second-weekly win Friday as late-buying in tech propelled the broader market into the green, shrugging off fresh worries about an oil-fueled rise inflation. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.49%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.44%, or 153 points. and the Nasdaq slipped 0.16%.
Investors left in a late chance to buy the dip in tech, helping the sector end well off its session lows despite a surge in Treasury yields on expectations for the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively on rate hikes to stem inflation.  
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) found support to end in the green, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the exception closing below the flatline, though well off session lows. 
U.S. Treasury yields continued to climb, with the 10-year yield briefly topping 2.5% for the first time in nearly three years as Wall Street raises bets on steeper Fed rate hikes at upcoming meetings. 
“We now look for the Fed to raise rates by 50bp at both its May and June meetings, with 25bp rate hikes penciled in for each meeting over the balance of the year,” {{|Morgan Stanley said in a note}}.
A turnaround in oil prices added to inflation jitters following reports that Iran-backed Houthi missile hit an Aramco (SE:2222) oil facility in Saudi Arabia.
The news stoked further worries about supply shortages and offset earlier optimism after the EU failed to reach consensus on joining the U.S. in banning imports of Russian oil. 
In the wake of red-hot inflation, the consumer, the backbone of the U.S. economy, continues to grow wary, with many keeping a closer eye on whether spending is likely to be reined in. 
The University of Michigan’s sentiment index showed U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated further in late March, falling to a reading of 59.4 from 59.7 earlier in the month.
Banking stocks, which benefit from a rising rate environment boosting returns on the loan products, were up sharply. Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Zions (NASDAQ:ZION), and Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) led the gains.
Other cyclical corners of the market also played a role in pushing up the broader market, with industrials underpinned by an  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK)-led move higher in airline stocks.
Alaska Air Group rose more than 1% after Bank of America backed the airline’s financial outlook, saying it was confident the low-cost airline can top the prior high single digit pre-tax margin expectation and reach its new long term target of 11% to 13%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also ended the day up more than 1%.
In other news,  cannabis stocks surged, led by Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) as the House of Representatives is set to vote on a bill to federally legalize marijuana next week.

(Reuters) -Shares on Wall Street took a breather on Friday after a tech-driven rally and U.S. Treasury yields rose to fresh heights as markets evaluated a world of elevated interest rates and the effects of Russia's war in Ukraine.
The Nasdaq fell about 0.16% as technology and healthcare stocks pulled back, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 edged up about 0.5%, with energy and financial shares rising on oil price gains and bets on interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.11%, adding a second consecutive week of gains for the first time in 2022. The pan-European STOXX 600 index also inched up 0.11%, but was down on the week.
Share prices have been supported by global flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for March this week showing the world economy was broadly resilient, but the longer-term economic outlook is making investors cautious.  Barclays  (LON:BARC), for example, cut its 2022 world economic growth forecast this week to 3.3% while traders have ramped up short bets.
Global bond markets continued to see a weeks-long sell-off.
Yields on benchmark 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped to almost three-year highs on Friday as the market anticipates inflation will spiral higher, forcing the Fed to aggressively hike interest rates. 
Ten-year Treasury yields rose 14.3 basis points to 2.484%, a rate last seen in early May 2019. The 2-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 16.2 basis points at 2.287% - a rate also last seen in early May 2019.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was the latest U.S. policymaker to sound more hawkish, saying on Thursday the Fed needs to raise interest rates ""in a timely fashion"" this year and in 2023 to curb high inflation before it is embedded in U.S. psychology and becomes even harder to get rid of.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (BofA) joined a small but growing number of top investment banks calling for more aggressive interest rate increases from the Fed against a backdrop of soaring inflation data. The bank now expects two hikes of 50 basis points (bps) each at its June and July meetings with ""risks"" of those expectations being pulled forward into May and June respectively.
Markets expect U.S. interest rates to rise by as much as 190 bps in total over the rest of this year, after a 25-bps hike last week. Investors are assigning an approximately 77% probability of a 50-bps rate hike in March.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) market analysts wrote in a note late Thursday that fast Fed action was not overly concerning for the economy.
""While a disorderly tightening of financial conditions remains a risk to the outlook, particularly in areas like credit, our baseline growth outlook remains constructive,"" they wrote. ""We think (it) helps contain risks that financial conditions become too dislocated in response to the Fed's actions.""

Oil prices turned positive on Friday after reports of a missile strike and a fire at Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco (SE:2222)'s facility.
U.S. crude rose 0.63% to $113.05 per barrel and Brent was at $119.78, also up 0.63% after dropping more than $3 earlier in the session. Both benchmarks were heading for their first weekly gains in three weeks. [O/R]
The U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday, a third straight day of gains. The euro was slightly lower.
""The one thing everyone can agree upon is inflation is going to be longer-lasting and a lot of that will be sticky and that will complicate what central banks do,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York. ""You will probably see the dollar lead the charge with rate hikes, Europe will lag and that interest rate differential should provide some support for the dollar.""

Demand for safe-haven assets including gold and the Swiss franc remained resilient as the conflict in Ukraine continued. Moscow on Friday signaled scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive, recapturing land on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.
Spot gold remained elevated at $1,955 an ounce, down about 0.10% for the day. [GOLD/]

Investing.com – The S&P 500 struggled for direction Friday as a rebound in oil prices put inflation back in the spotlight at a time when data pointing to a pinched consumer and worries about aggressive Federal Reserve remain front and center.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Side-by-side declines in U.S. equity and fixed income markets are pushing investors into cash, commodities and dividend-paying stocks as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over a hawkish Federal Reserve rock asset prices. 
With the first quarter of 2022 winding down, the S&P 500 is down around 5% year-to-date, after falling as much as 12.5% earlier in the year. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Treasury Index, meanwhile, was recently down 5.6% this year, its worst start in history. Investors have traditionally counted on a mix of stocks and bonds to blunt declines in their portfolio, with stocks ideally rising amid economic optimism and bonds strengthening during times of uncertainty. 
That strategy can go awry, however, and market gyrations stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring commodity prices and the Fed’s hawkish tilt have combined to make it harder to follow the playbook this time around. Though a sharp bounce in stocks has more than halved the S&P 500’s losses for the year-to-date, some investors are wary the rebound may not last and are seeking to cut their exposure. ""We are in a perfect storm right now,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. ""We’ve been in periods of heightened geopolitical risk before but this one feels a little different. The negative outcomes could be much more severe and broad.” 
Nixon is increasing stakes in agricultural and energy companies, as well as real estate investment trusts (REITs), which have acted as an inflation hedge in the past. Investors moved $13.2 billion to cash and $2.1 billion to gold over the last week, data from BoFA Global research showed. U.S. stocks saw $3.1 billion in outflows, their largest in nine weeks. The firm’s latest survey showed fund managers’ cash positions earlier this month at their highest since March 2020 . George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, is raising his portfolio’s cash allocation to nearly 15%, well above the typical 3% of assets he normally holds. ""Cash is paying literally nothing and is arguably negative because of inflation, but we're not seeing many things that we want to buy,"" he said. Recent declines have ""been more painful than many prior bouts of volatility"" due to the twin sell-offs in both stocks and bonds, wrote Michael Fredericks, head of income investing for BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Strategies Team, in a note Friday. He is growing more bullish on dividend-paying stocks, which trade at lower forward price to earnings valuations than the broad S&P 500, and are less sensitive to rising interest rates than growth stocks or bonds. Gains have been particularly hard to come by in the bond market, as investors recalibrate their portfolios to a Fed that appears ready to go all-out in its battle against inflation. Yields on the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, reached a three-year high of around 2.5% in the past week, with investors now pricing in more than 200 basis points of interest rate tightening this year. [FEDWATCH] With few attractive opportunities in U.S. debt, Anders Persson, head of global fixed income at Nuveen, has recently increased his positions in dollar-denominated emerging market bonds, in part due to the rally in commodity prices. ""There is not a clean play-book for a post-pandemic Fed pivot at the same time you have a war between Ukraine and Russia,"" he said. 

Investors will be watching U.S. non-farm payroll data next week as they gauge whether the economy is strong enough to handle the Fed's aggressive rate-hike trajectory. To be sure, some investors believe times of overriding pessimism are ideal for buying stocks, an idea supported by ample evidence of defensive position that has accompanied the S&P 500's recent bounce. BoFA Global Research analysts said their contrarian Bull & Bear Indicator recently gave a “buy” signal based on outflows from equity and credit and high levels of cash in investors’ portfolios. 
Adam Hetts, global head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson, said the largest risk for most investors would be ""overreacting to short-term moves"" and jumping headfirst into commodities or gold as a hedge against inflation. Hetts is steering clients into higher-quality equities with strong cash flows such as dividend stocks, and seeing increased investor interest in hedge fund strategies that can take short positions. ""We're having a historically bad start to the year, but we're trying to ensure that the cure isn't worse than the disease,"" he said.

(Reuters) - China's state-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.
The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions. 
Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.
But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.
Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multi-billion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.""
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. 
The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said.
The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment. 
The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about ""whether there are internal meetings or not"".
""China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,"" it said in a faxed statement. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Global oil majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its ""special operation"" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.
TALKS ON HOLD
Sinopec, formally China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) and Chemical Corp, has suspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the new gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said.
The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest petrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec and 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024.
""The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by building another one and were in the middle of site selection,"" said the source.
Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been sanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires with ties to Putin.
Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions.
The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the sources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key lenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank and European credit agencies.
""It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome the difficulties in financing,"" said a Beijing-based industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Sibur said it continues to cooperate with Sinopec including working jointly on implementing the Amur plant. It denied that there was a plan to team up with Sinopec for a project similar to the Amur Gas Chemical Complex in east Siberia.
""Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the project's construction management, including equipment supplies, work with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working on the issues of project financing,"" Sibur told Reuters by email.
Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture with Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S. sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the wake of the sanctions. Novatek declined to comment.

Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered a preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to create a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China as well as distributing natural gas in China.
Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were among the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector, taking minority stakes in major export project Arctic LNG 2 in 2019 and Yamal LNG in 2014.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Months after receiving a major infusion of capital, Sierra Nevada Corp's space unit, Sierra Space, has tapped a veteran Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co executive to helm its finances as it races to develop its flagship space plane and studies a public offering, two people familiar with the matter said. 
Outgoing Sierra Space CFO Robert Rodgers pitched investors and led due diligence efforts for around a year leading up to the landmark $1.4 billion capital round it announced in November, according to his LinkedIn profile. Sierra said it was the second-largest private capital infusion ever in the aerospace and defense sector and boosted Sierra's value to $4.5 billion.
Replacing Rodgers will be 10-year  Boeing Co  veteran Troy Lahr, who departed as CFO of the aerospace company's defense, space and security unit in recent weeks.
A Boeing spokesperson confirmed Lahr had left the company in recent weeks but declined further comment. 
A Sierra Space spokesperson confirmed in a statement that Lahr would join the company soon.
""Sierra Space is assembling a world class management team, including Troy, that sees many lucrative opportunities in the marketplace for investors, while at the same time driving innovation and fueling our mission to explore space and benefit life on Earth,"" the Sierra Space spokesperson said.
The spokesperson declined further comment. 
The reason for Rodgers' departure was not immediately clear. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Industry sources say Sierra is exploring a potential public offering among other options in the next two to three years but say that no decision has been made.
The financial leadership change comes as the Louisville, Colorado-based company races to develop a reusable space plane dubbed Dream Chaser to handle cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS) starting in early 2023. 
Sierra Space says Dream Chaser's ability to land on a traditional runway gives it an edge over rival solutions for delicate scientific research cargo. Rivals including Elon Musk's SpaceX are already carrying people and cargo to the ISS.
Sierra envisions a future where a fleet of its space planes - similar to the Space Shuttle, but much smaller - ferry humans and cargo from space ports across the world to a bustling new space economy. 

""We are building the next generation of space transportation systems and in-space infrastructures and destinations that will enable humanity to build and sustain thriving civilizations beyond Earth,"" Sierra Space Chief Executive Officer Tom Vice said last year. 
Sierra Space has also forged a partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to develop and operate a commercial space station in low earth orbit. Backers for the so-called orbital reef project include Boeing and Redwire Space.

Air Lease will provide Aeromexico with two new 737-8s and seven new 737-9s, which will arrive between July 2022 and August 2023, the aircraft leasing company said.
The deal comes after Aeromexico said last week it would spend $5 billion over the next five years on upgrades, including revamping its fleet to reach 147 aircraft by the end of the year.
""The 737 offers the most modern, fuel-efficient technology to enhance the global capabilities of Mexico's premier airline,"" Air Lease Corporation Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said in a statement.
Aeromexico declared bankruptcy in mid-2020 after travel demand plummeted following the coronavirus pandemic.
The airline came to an agreement with debtors in a U.S. court in January, and then it recently carried out a forward stock split and subsequent reverse split to shuffle company control, formalizing its exit from bankruptcy. 

Aeromexico shares were up 8.45% Friday morning after a volatile week on Mexico's principal market. One analyst said shares would continue to behave erratically until traders had more information about the airline's financial situation.
Shares in Air Lease were up some 1.35% on the New York Stock Exchange following the announcement.

(Reuters) -Spotify Technology SA said on Friday it will suspend its streaming service in Russia in response to the country's new media law. 
The audio streaming platform closed its office in Russia indefinitely earlier this month, citing what it described as Moscow's ""unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" 
Russia's new legislation makes it illegal to report any event that could discredit the Russian military. 
""Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) has continued to believe that it's critically important to try to keep our service operational in Russia to provide trusted, independent news and information from the region,"" Spotify said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, recently enacted legislation further restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalizing certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify's employees and the possibility of even our listeners at risk.""

The service is expected to end in early April, according to one person with knowledge of the situation.
Another streaming service, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), suspended service in Russia earlier this month after saying it had no plans to add state-run channels to its Russian service, despite a regulation that would require it to do so.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple is set to be hit with another fine next week for not fully complying with an order to open its App Store to rival forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands, Dutch antitrust watchdog ACM told Reuters.
The iPhone maker has already racked up 45 million euros ($49 million) in penalties to date as ACM (Authority for Consumers and Markets) has slapped weekly 5 million euro fines on the company since January, with the ninth penalty handed out this week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) submitted a fresh proposal to the ACM this week in a bid to halt the sanction. The offer does not fully comply with its order, an official at the Dutch watchdog, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters on Friday.
Subsequent fines once the total penalty hits 50 million euros could be higher according to ACM rules.
Apple, which requires developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases and is feeling regulatory scrutiny worldwide over this, was not immediately available for comment.
An investigation by ACM on whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. It was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH).
ACM says Apple abuses its market dominance and has ordered it to change this practice. Apple has denied market abuse. 

Under tough new rules agreed on Thursday between the European Commission, EU governments and EU lawmakers, Apple will be required to open up its App Store once the legislation comes into force in October.

BOSTON (Reuters) - One of investor Carl Icahn's director nominees at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said she would push the burger giant to tackle sustainability issues like lowering the environmental impact of farming and lessening antibiotic use.
So far Icahn, the well-known activist investor, has framed his challenge seeking two board seats at McDonald's mainly over the treatment of pigs by the chain's suppliers.
But Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, said ending the use of gestation crates, as Icahn has urged, would have other benefits like reducing crowded factory farms that cause pollution.
""While we think they're a strong company, they have some vulnerabilities they're not recognizing on reputational and governance risks,"" Samuelrich said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.
She said she conveyed her concerns to three McDonald's directors in a meeting this week, and hopes the company will make her a candidate to be elected to its board later this spring. 
A McDonald's representative declined to comment. 
Samuelrich is a well-known voice on corporate environmental issues, including an effort in 2018 that led McDonald's to agree to restrict the use of antibiotics in its beef supply. Samuelrich said she is concerned McDonald's has not followed through.
On its website McDonald's says it is working with partners on responsible antibiotic use and that amid COVID-related delays it is ""evolving our plan."" The company also has said https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.response-carl-icahn.html it would evaluate Icahn's nominees, and defended its treatment of animals.
Separately, Samuelrich said she supports steps McDonald's has taken in Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The company's temporary store closures in Russia are costing it about $50 million a month as it continues to pay staff.

Samuelrich said unless Russian President Vladimir Putin changes course, McDonald's should consider pulling out of the country entirely. 
Doing so would ""send a message to the Russian leadership and residents about how Putin's invasion has been viewed"" abroad, she said.

Investing.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) stock inched up 0.4% after UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley reiterated a buy rating and $280 price target.
The analyst's price target implied a potential 27.5% upside. 
The analyst said in a note that it was time to talk about making money from the video format Reels.
Walmsley said Instagram newsfeed changes, along with Reels monetization should help to drive a ""meaningful bump"" to time spent on the social media platform overall and lead to higher monetization at scale.
The push of Reels before monetization could see a 6% revenue challenge in the first half of the year, added Walmsley. However, as the company scales up monetization, it could turn into a 8% to 15% tailwind, he noted, driving a ""meaningful inflection"" in advertising revenue.

(Reuters) -European shares ended a choppy session slightly higher on Friday but were down on the week as investors worried about the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while a rally in the commodities sector kept a lid on declines.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.1%, with losses for banks and some defensive stocks offsetting gains in energy, basic materials and technology names. 
""Some late weakness has seen equities fall back, but overall the rally in equities is still going,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
""Nervousness remains, but equities have moved through the week without giving back too much ground.""
After two weeks of the gains that saw it rise more than 7%, the STOXX 600 lost 0.2% this week, as lofty energy and commodity prices from sanctions on Russia fanned inflation fears and stoked worries about an economic growth slowdown. 
The United States will work to supply liquefied natural gas to the European Union this year to help it wean off Russian energy supplies, Western leaders said, as Russia warned payment in roubles for natural gas exports was just days away, exacerbating supply shortage worries. 
Germany said it has made significant progress towards reducing its exposure to imports of Russian gas, oil and coal.
Europe's basic materials sector is up a whopping 20% so far this year and the energy index is 15% higher. 
The Ukraine crisis is likely to reduce prospects for global growth in the coming year, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Friday.
German business morale deteriorated in March due to worsening supply chain issues resulting from high petrol prices, but the country is not facing a recession in the first quarter due to the Ukraine war, the Ifo institute said on Friday.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) restricted the use of Apple Pay, which began operating in Russia in 2016, on March 1 in the wake of Russia's decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, preventing Russian Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) cardholders using the service.

(Reuters) -As the clock runs down to Monday's sanctions deadline for Russian airlines to hand back more than 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion, foreign lessors are fast losing hope that they will get their aircraft back.
Most of the planes are still flying Russian domestic routes, IBA consultancy says, although Bermuda and Ireland - where most are registered - have suspended airworthiness certificates which usually means they should be grounded.
Aviation was an early business casualty of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, as the West and Russia imposed tit-for-tat airspace bans. Now, lessors face big writedowns or a long insurance battle as the March 28 deadline looms for terminating plane leases under European Union sanctions.
""I'm afraid that we are going to witness the largest sort of theft of aircraft in the history of commercial civil aviation,"" said Volodymyr Bilotkach, an associate professor of air transport management at Singapore Institute of Technology.
Dual registration is not allowed under international rules, but Russia has already moved more than half of the foreign-owned aircraft to its own registry after passing a law permitting this, Russia's government said on Wednesday.
The government also said 78 planes leased to Russian carriers had been seized while abroad and would not fly back to Russia, Interfax news agency said on Tuesday.
Major aircraft lessor Avolon has terminated all its Russian airline leases and repossessed four of the 14 owned aircraft on lease with Russian airlines outside the country, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.
It wasn't clear if the four planes were part of the 78 reported by Moscow.
Although the planes are insured, the unprecedented nature and scale of the potential losses will likely mean years of litigation between lessors and insurers before any decisions on payouts are taken, analysts say.
And even if the planes are repossessed, the recoverable value would be in question because the aircraft must have accurate maintenance records to ensure they have been fitted with genuine, traceable components - another area targeted by Western sanctions on Russia.
Although the total value of the planes is huge, the impact on individual leasing firms may still be manageable even if writedowns are required as aircraft leased to Russian airlines account for less than 10% of most leasing firm portfolios.
""It's not going to cripple these businesses,"" said Brad Dailey, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy who previously worked at Ireland-based leasing giant AerCap Holdings.
""What it does do in my view is it changes the future market potential of Russia,"" he said.
COVERING LOSSES
Some private airlines have indicated their willingness to hand back planes to the lessors, although it is unclear whether the Russian government will approve the transactions.
Russia's UTair Airlines said on March 14 it would withdraw from service all nine of its leased Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 NGs, citing owner requirements, a move that could preserve longer-term relations after sanctions end.
Those planes have not flown since that announcement but remain in Russia, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 show.
In some cases, lessors have security deposits that could be forfeit and could help cover a portion of any losses - but still only a fraction of a plane's value.
For example, a security deposit on narrowbody plane worth $20 million could be about $450,000, the equivalent of three months rent, Alton's Dailey said.
Ratings agency KBRA said security deposits generally range from one to four months of rent, depending on the credit assessment of the airline leasing the plane.
Russian national carrier Aeroflot had been viewed as the best credit risk before the invasion, industry sources said, although that assessment no longer applies after Moscow's move to register its planes in Russia.
A person at a Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said no security deposits had been taken from the airline and said insurance payouts appeared to be the only route to cover losses.
The lessor plans to begin insurance claims after the March 28 deadline has passed, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.

A source at another Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said that, instead of taking a security deposit, it held U.S. dollar letters of credit from Russian banks - but the source said they had no effective value now because of Russian currency controls imposed in response to financial sanctions.
At lower-tier airlines, lessors are more likely to have stronger security deposits in place, Dailey said.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is shunning prospective Russian clients and declining credit to some existing ones, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as the bank seeks to shield itself from Western sanctions against Moscow. 
The measures affect HSBC's individual and business customers globally and go further than the bank's previously stated intentions to wind down its relations with lenders such as VTB, which were placed under Western restrictions after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
The moves by Europe's second biggest bank show how sanctions aimed at Russia's financial system and its political and business elite are also ensnaring Russian nationals outside the country as lenders seek to avoid falling foul of the restrictions and potentially hefty fines.
HSBC had said on March 14 it is ""not accepting any new business in Russia,"" without spelling out what that means for existing or prospective Russian customers in other markets.
The sources said the bank's risk and compliance staff have told business managers to apply extra scrutiny to all prospective clients bearing Russian passports or furnishing Russian addresses, with the result that many more are turned away than would have been in the past.
The checks also extend to dual passport-holders as well as those with links to Belarus, seen as an ally of Moscow, as the bank's staff scramble to ensure they do not inadvertently offer services to sanctioned individuals or businesses.
HSBC declined to comment.
Customers with business ties to Russia and receiving income in roubles, such as those deriving income from Russian employment, pensions, or investments, are also being impacted as those rouble cashflows are discounted to zero for credit purposes, one of the sources, who works at HSBC, told Reuters.
Business customers with Russian links, even those with no ties to sanctioned entities or individuals, face increased scrutiny on large deposits or withdrawals and are seeing new loan applications declined, the two sources said.
The invasion has triggered an exodus of foreign companies from Russia as Western authorities deploy sanctions at an unprecedented scale and pace to squeeze Moscow and prevent the global financial system from being a conduit for Russian money.
Reuters reported earlier this month that European Union regulators had told some banks to tighten control of all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents, to ensure they are not used to circumvent sanctions.
Russia characterises its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.
BUSINESS FREEZE
Leading European banks such as Italy's UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said they could face a multi-billion dollar write-off of their businesses in Russia, but banks also face a wider chill on business as they grapple with sanctions. 
HSBC does not operate a retail bank inside Russia but as of Feb. 22 it had around 200 staff there serving multinational corporations, its Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters at the time. The bank said on March 14 its business there ""will continue to reduce.""
The latest HSBC measures go beyond the usual background checks, and show how banks' policies are still evolving since the invasion as they try to implement multiple waves of sanctions without discriminating against legitimate customers.
They also show the tension between banks' sanctions and compliance teams, who urge the strictest possible interpretation of new rules to satisfy regulators, and frontline staff tasked with growing the business and serving clients.

HSBC is under particular pressure to show regulators that it can identify illegal transactions. It had to tighten up its money laundering controls globally after a string of past scandals and, in 2012, agreed to pay $1.9 billion to U.S. authorities for allowing itself to be used to launder drug money flowing out of Mexico.
HSBC is reviewing all existing private and retail banking customers with Russian connections globally to see if they have ties to sanctioned entities or individuals, the sources said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers at the company's JFK8 Staten Island warehouse started casting ballots on Friday on whether to form a union as labor organizers look to New York for the first-ever union victory in the retail giant's 28-year history. 
As the second-largest U.S. private employer, Amazon has long been a focus for labor advocates who hope that a single union victory will spark organizing efforts across the country.
Geebah Sando, a package sorter who has worked at JFK8 for more than two years, said he is voting in favor of the union. 
He hopes a unionized workplace would mean higher wages and more benefits, including longer breaks and more paid time off.
The push to organize is spearheaded by a group of workers known as the Amazon Labor Union (ALU). In-person voting at JFK8 will last until March 30, with votes set to be counted on March 31.
“We look forward to having our employees’ voices heard. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work,” said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel.
Keisha Renaud, 50, an associate from East Orange, New Jersey, said she would leave the facility if it unionizes.
“The energy they are taking to start a union, why didn’t they take that energy to start a team to talk to the managers. I think Amazon would listen,” she said, wearing a pink shirt that says ""Vote No.""
Distrust of unions is common among workers, fanned by Amazon itself, which has warned in meetings staff were obliged to attend that labor groups could mandate strikes or shrink pay, something organizers have disputed.
'NO EXPERIENCE'
Some workers said they are open to a unionized workplace but have concerns about ALU’s ability to advocate on their behalf.
“The union has no experience at all,” said Claudia Rodriguez, 58, who has worked at JFK8 for four years. Rodriguez, while walking up to the voting tent, said she was still on the fence about whether to back the union.
There was a long line to cast a vote, but Chris Smalls, president of ALU and a former employee at the Staten Island warehouse, said he was encouraged by the turnout. 
""Whichever way they vote, I’m happy to see it happen,"" Smalls said.
Workers at the company's other warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote in person on whether to unionize starting on April 25, according to a National Labor Relations Board election notice. 
A rerun of last year's failed union organizing campaign at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, is also scheduled to conclude on Friday. Votes will be counted starting on Monday for this second closely watched election. 

The NLRB found that Amazon improperly interfered in the original contest, when the company won by a two-to-one margin. 
The American labor movement has gained momentum over the past year, motivated by the high-profile Alabama campaign, ongoing pandemic concerns and strikes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. Senate Democrats is pressing large U.S. banks to scrap or significantly reduce overdraft and other fees they charge customers with insufficient funds.
In a letter sent to seven large firms Thursday, the group of five lawmakers -- including Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown -- called for a ""fairer and more transparent"" fee structure.
Democratic lawmakers and regulators are placing heightened scrutiny on bank fees. The group cited recent research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which found nearly 80% of such fees are charged to only 9% of accounts. The CFPB is currently soliciting public feedback on ways to potentially curtail overdraft and other ""junk fees,"" and a House Financial Services subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday on the fees.
Under political and regulatory pressure, several large banks, including some that received letters, have taken steps to curtail such fees.
In February,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) announced it would eliminate overdraft fees by this summer. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) have moved to give customers extra time to bring their account balances above zero. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it would reduce overdraft fees to $10 from $35 beginning in May and eliminate its ""nonsufficient fund"" fees.
JPMorgan had already taken other steps requested in the letter, such as eliminating nonsufficient fund fees, according to a spokeswoman.
But banking groups are resisting government efforts to eliminate overdraft fees, arguing they serve a useful purpose.
""A majority of consumers who use the product do so knowingly and count on it when unexpected expenses arise. As a result, contrary to what is stated in the letter, the Consumer Bankers Association believes taking action that would dramatically restrict overdraft could force many families out of the well-regulated, well-supervised banking and toward predatory payday lenders,"" said CBA spokesperson Lauren Bair Bianchi.

Copies of the letter were sent to chief executives at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC), US Bancorp and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp.
Spokespeople for the other banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.

The analyst, who increased the price target to $31 from $28, said he struggles to see an acquisition priced at above the $32 to $34 per share range.
However, if a deal falls through, he sees a potential 10% to 15% downside or more, with the risk/reward becoming less attractive.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Landmark EU rules targeting Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are likely to set a global benchmark and may even force changes in the tech giants' business models, lawyers and experts said.
Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager won backing on Thursday from European Union members and EU lawmakers for her proposal, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), to rein in the powers of the tech giants via legislation for the first time, rather than lengthy antitrust investigations.
The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts targeting each tech giant's core business practices.
The legislation, which is expected to go into force in October, could bring sweeping changes to the global tech industry, upsetting profits and the dominance of the companies who built up huge businesses operating like walled gardens.
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), would be barred from unfairly ranking its own services above rivals under the DMA. 
Apple, which warned about malware risks and cybercriminals hijacking its iPhone, may have to open up its App Store to allow customers install software from other apps or the internet. 
It may face a similar requirement in its home market after a U.S. Senate panel last month voted to advance a bill that would force companies to allow people to load apps on their phones without using official app stores.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would have to let WhatsApp users interact with others on rival messaging services, according to the DMA.
""DMA is here to stay and will be quickly mirrored in a number of countries. The flexibility that big tech had will be constrained, as the regulatory 'straitjacket' will get tighter globally,"" said Ioannis Kokkoris, competition law professor at Queen Mary University in London.
Vestager's switch to legislation came amid frustration over slow-moving antitrust investigations that deliver remedies criticised by rivals as inadequate. Google has often been cited as an example, with critics saying it has yet to show a significant change of approach despite being fined more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) after a decade-long investigation.
The new rules include hefty fines between 10% to 20% of a company's annual global turnover, which could push tech giants to rethink their strategy on long-term goals and swap their business models for others.
PRESSURE
""If it succeeds, the DMA will put pressure on monopoly rents of gatekeepers in tipped markets, thereby encouraging them to move towards more long term innovation targets,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence.
""I think the DMA indirectly places a premium on business models based on subscriptions or device level monetisation. We might see more (increased) prices, and vertical integration into hardware in the future,"" he said.
The DMA applies to gatekeepers with app stores, search engines, social networks, online ad services, cloud computing firms, web browsers and virtual assistants.
The big tech companies, with its army of lawyers, might also be able to find some wiggle room to dodge the full impact of the DMA, raising questions whether the Commission will have a big enough team to enforce the new rules.
""The Commission suggested upon proposing the DMA that it would be enforced by a team of 80 people,"" said Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels who has advised rivals in cases against Microsoft, Google and Apple. 
""This will not be enough to enable effective enforcement,"" he said.
Apple and Google have lobbied intensively against the DMA, saying it could create unnecessary privacy and security risks for their users and hold back innovation and lead to fewer consumer choices.
The DMA is just the first step towards making sure that tech giants play fair, said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert in Brussels.

""The DMA is not a perfectly formed panacea from the start, and without doubt gatekeepers will try to navigate around it. Rome was not built in a day, nor was the highway code perfect when first conceived,"" he said.

61,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 12:21PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The rouble extended recovery gains on Friday, hitting its strongest since early March against the dollar, while stocks fell in their second day of trading after a near month-long suspension, with losses led by flag carrier Aeroflot.
The Russian market is gradually reopening and returning to normal after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The rouble, which hit a record low in Moscow of 120 earlier in March, firmed to 92.04 to the greenback, a level last seen on March 1. It also climbed past the psychologically important threshold of 100 to the euro.
As of 1356 GMT, the rouble pared some gains and was 0.3% stronger at 96.52 to the dollar and added 1% to trade at 105.75 against the euro.
The response to events in Ukraine has ripped Russian financial markets from global networks and sent the rouble tumbling, although it was on course for five consecutive sessions of growth, heading for a weekly gain of up to 10%.
Foreign investors cut their exposure to Russia, with non-residents' share among holders of OFZ treasury bonds falling to its lowest since late 2012 as of March 1.
The rouble received a boost on Wednesday after Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles.
Fewer imports to Russia, the exodus of Western companies and Putin's switch to roubles for gas exports are all positive for the Russian currency, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note.
""A return to the old pre-war (rouble) strength is nonetheless unlikely,"" they said, pointing to the effect that lower demand and shrinking exports will have. 
In offshore markets, the rouble was trading at about 99 to the dollar, weaker than in Moscow, where cash purchases of foreign currency are restricted. 
STOCKS TURN SOUTH
Airline Aeroflot lost more than a quarter of its value over two days to plunge to its lowest since 2009 as securities slid lower across the board on Friday after many blue chips posted double-digit gains on Thursday.
Shares in Aeroflot dropped 18.2% to its weakest point since early 2009, adding to Thursday's 16% loss. 
The benchmark MOEX stock index closed 3.7% lower at 2,484.13 points. It had closed 4.4% higher on Thursday. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 2.7% to 829.6 points.
Prior to Thursday, stocks had not traded on Moscow's bourse since Feb. 25, the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine. 
The move prompted Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically, and Russian countermeasures.
On Friday more securities, including corporate bonds and Eurobonds, were being traded in another short session, and restrictions on trading by foreigners alongside a ban on short selling remained. 
State lenders Sberbank and VTB fell 3.5% and 7.9% respectively.
Oil major Rosneft and mining giant Nornickel were exceptions, gaining 1.4% and 0.4%. 
RUSSIAN RESPONSE
The central bank on Friday said restrictions imposed on capital flows were a tit-for-tat move after its reserves were frozen by Western countries.
""In response to the freezing of part of Russia's reserves, Russia also introduced restrictions on the movement of funds that could be transferred to unfriendly countries by a comparable amount,"" the central bank said.
Moscow is now looking to friendlier markets. Andrei Kostin, chief executive of VTB, whose activities have been hit by sanctions, said opportunities would arise elsewhere and that his lender was offering accounts to Russians in Chinese yuan. 

""We have already deposited the equivalent of 16 billion roubles in yuan, citizens are already depositing, and there are other currencies of neighbouring states,"" he told RBC TV. 
Dominant lender Sberbank said late on Thursday it expects trade turnover and settlements of the rouble-yuan pair on Moscow Exchange to increase.

62,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia is looking to China, India, Iran and Turkey to plug the gap created by an exodus of western retail companies, an industry body said on Friday, as Moscow grapples to find ways to combat its growing isolation in the face of sanctions. 
The Russian Council of Shopping Centres (RCSC), an organisation representing developers, shopping centre owners and retail chain operators, said it was negotiating with its corresponding representatives in the four countries about finding alternatives to western brands. 
""A list of foreign companies that have temporarily ceased operations in Russia was sent to them so that appropriate equivalents can be found,"" a statement on the RCSC website read. 
""Over time this will help supplement or completely replace goods of the defunct brands with ones of a similar quality and design."" 
Dozens of big brands have temporarily shuttered operations or exited the country since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special operation.
Sanctions have hampered supply chains and fuelled panic buying among some Russians, with medicine and sugar shortages reported, and accelerating inflation is set to send prices higher.
During an RCSC meeting of more than 100 market participants, the challenges facing Russian retailers were discussed. 
RCSC cited Igor Maltinsky, director of development at Melon Fashion Group, as saying that the main challenge facing domestic retail firms was the uncontrollable growth of production costs, due to huge increases in procurement and logistics costs, as well as many other related factors. 

Melon owns four, mainly women's, fashion brands - Zarina, Befree, Love Republic and Sela and had 846 stores across Russia and CIS at the end of 2021. It had been planning to hold an initial public offering (IPO) this year.
On Thursday, Swedish real estate firm Eastnine, a minority shareholder in Melon, said the planned IPO had been postponed. It said western sanctions had negatively affected the company, making valuing it very difficult.

LONDON (Reuters) - Finland's Wartsila, a leading ship engine maker, has suspended business with Russia including equipment training while German counterpart MAN Energy Solutions is reviewing contracts, adding further trade pressure on Moscow.
Russia's maritime sector is already grappling with the winding down of other services including ship certification by leading foreign providers - vital for accessing ports and securing insurance - shipping companies pulling out and Western sanctions being imposed on its leading ocean transporter Sovcomflot after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Wartsila, a top global marine and energy equipment maker, has suspended all deliveries and sales to Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine and would take action to ""follow the European Union sanctions framework as it evolves"", a company spokesperson said. 
""As part of this, training on using our engines/ship technology for Russian legal entities has been halted, regardless of the nationality of the individuals,"" the spokesperson said.
""Such training can be offered to Russian nationals working for non-Russian legal entities. Training cannot however be offered to individuals, regardless of their nationality, having their residence in Russia.""
Two shipping sources said MAN Energy Solutions had also suspended training for using its equipment in Russia. 
A company spokesperson said it was ""complying 100% with the imposed sanctions"".

MAN Energy Solutions said separately in a statement that all existing contracts and orders connected to Russia ""have to be reviewed on a case by case base"".
Shipping industry sources say given the complexities of the world's seaborne trade it was unclear how Russian companies would be able to operate with multiple services being withdrawn.

MILAN (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners and rival private equity investors are looking at a potential investment into the services arm of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) under a planned reorganisation of Italy's former phone monopoly, sources said on Friday.
In the meantime, Italy's government is readying new rules to force companies owning strategic assets to notify it of any preliminary discussions with potential suitors.
The new provisions, part of a broader plan to beef up Italy's existing anti-takeover rules or so-called golden powers, are primarily aimed at policing any changes to TIM's ownership structure, two separate government officials told Reuters. 
After CVC said it has been looking for some time at the reorganisation under way at TIM, a source familiar with the matter said the fund was set to formalise an expression of interest in TIM's service arm as early as on Friday. 
CVC was not immediately available to comment. TIM declined to comment.
TIM is already assessing a 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion)takeover approach from U.S. fund giant KKR.
Newly-appointed Chief Executive Pietro Labriola has unveiled plans to split TIM's service businesses from its domestic fixed network operations to unlock value and pursue M&A deals.
A newly-created services entity would include TIM's enterprise business, such as cloud, IoT and cybersecurity operations, for which broker Bestinver pegged a valuation of 10.5 billion euros. 
SHARES GAIN 
Other sources said other private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), are looking at a potential investment into TIM's service operations.
""At least three big funds are assessing TIM's situation with the view of a potential investment into its service arm,"" one of the people said.
Apollo declined to comment.
After tumbling to a record low earlier this month, TIM's shares jumped as much as 7.2% to hit a three-weeks highs around 0.35 euros on Friday, with traders and analysts citing speculative appeal linked to private equity interest.
The KKR approach was pitched at 0.505 euros. 
TIM, whose top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) criticised KKR's offer as too low, is seeking to revive a long-held project to merge its fixed line assets with those of Open Fiber.
Such a move is supported by TIM's second-largest investor, state lender CDP, which own a 60% stake in Open Fiber.
A source familiar with the matter said TIM, which left KKR waiting for nearly four months without an answer before engaging in formal talks earlier this month, is preparing another letter to request further clarifications from KKR. 

The same source said TIM board of directors will be updated on the KKR developments at a meeting next Tuesday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The Bundestag lower house on Friday approved legislation requiring Germany's privately-operated gas storage facilities to be full at the start of the next winter, to try to avert shortages in the event of a halt in Russian gas imports.
The law requires facilities to be 65% full by Aug. 1, 80% full by October, when the heating season and the gas season for utilities and traders starts, and 90% by November. 
Storage levels, currently at 25%, must be at least 40% in February 2023.
Germany's gas market trading hub, Trading Hub Europe (THE), which is overseen by the country's energy regulator, will be responsible for ensuring the thresholds are met by issuing tenders for traders.
The law allows THE to purchase gas via tenders using state funds in case of an emergency.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government has been acting to cut Germany's exposure to Russian energy imports after President Vladimir Putin began what he has called a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war.
The law aligns with coordination at European Union level for member states to build up stocks and buy more gas from third countries.
In the four weeks since the invasion, Germany reduced its gas imports from Russia to 40% from 55%, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Friday.
Energy prices in Europe hit records even before the invasion. European countries accused the Kremlin of deliberately reducing the volumes of gas delivered through pipelines to historically low levels. Russia denied this and said it had met contractual demands.
In Germany, a third of gas storage belongs to Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), whose facilities in Germany had lower levels of stored gas this winter than those operated by other companies.

If there is a risk of shortage, the law allows the national energy hub to use facilities that are empty or below the stipulated filling levels to store its own gas purchases.
Operators have criticised the plans, saying they interfere with the market and price signals.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge fund Starboard Value LP on Friday lost a fight to replace four directors at  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp but shares of the U.S. specialty chemicals company tumbled in early trading as investors learned about the result.
Starboard, which owns 8.8% of Huntsman, argued that the chemicals manufacturer needs a shake-up to improve its financial performance. The hedge fund also said the company's board was captive to CEO Peter Huntsman, whose father founded the company in 1982.
Huntsman countered by saying it had the right people and plans in place to produce strong returns and pointed to its shares being near all-time highs and outperforming peers, as well as to the additions of eight new directors to its board since 2018.
Huntsman, which is valued at $8.6 billion and makes chemical products for use in construction materials to plastics, said that based on preliminary results all 10 of its director nominees were reelected. 
""The outcome of today's shareholder vote is validation of our portfolio strategy and recognition that the Huntsman of today is vastly different than the Huntsman of five years ago,"" CEO Peter Huntsman said in a statement.
The company's share price fell nearly 12% in early trading.
Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith said in a statement that preliminary results appear to show that less than 50% of the shares outstanding backed the company's contested nominees. 
""We hope that the board recognizes that this clearly shows that shareholders not only expect management to fulfill its promises, but also expect the board to hold management accountable for these promises.""
The defeat marks Starboard's second loss of a shareholder vote in less than a year. In September, it failed in its board challenge against cloud services provider Box Inc.
Starboard's director candidates at Huntsman included former  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) CEO James Gallogly, Starboard's Smith, former industry executive Sandra Beach Lin and former banker Susan Schnabel. 
Starboard is one of the busiest activist investors and has long won more board seats than other activists, data show.
Last year, Huntsman promised to improve margins and return $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and pledged to run a sales process for its non-core Textile Effects unit and not to spend more than $500 million on a single acquisition. 

Starboard expressed concern that Huntsman had failed to make disclosures recommended by the Task Force on Climate-retlaed Financial Disclosures even though investors requested them two years ago.
Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis backed all of management's candidates while Institutional Shareholder Services, another proxy advisory firm, said change was warranted and recommended that investors elect two of Starboard's nominees.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Wednesday said it would allow  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot aimed at countering appmakers' concerns about high fees and allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing in some countries in the coming months.
The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play's billing system in their apps.
""This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,"" Google said in a blog post.
Under a new competition law in South Korea last year, Google also said it would allow developers to introduce a second payment system alongside its own there.
Spotify said its trial with Google was part of a ""multi-year agreement,"" without elaborating.
App developers such as Spotify that sell digital goods have complained for years about having to use the official payment systems of the Play store and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store. 
Google and Apple collect up to 30% of each payment as a fee, which developers say is too high. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said that they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

Google did not specify the fee that it would collect in the new pilot.
The company is ramping up enforcement of its Google Play Billing requirement, and it has said non-compliant apps could be blocked from publishing updates starting on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Distressed debt hedge fund Gramercy, which made a killing on Russian bonds after the 1998 crisis and has taken on Argentina and Venezuela over defaulted debt, says a bet on Russia now is too big a risk even with bonds trading at a tenth of face value.
Robert Koenigsberger, whose first trade as founder of Gramercy in 1998 was scooping up battered Russian bonds, said Moscow had shown a surprising willingness to service external debts despite sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine. 
But Russia's capacity to pay is running out of road as systems for settling and clearing trades and transferring bond ownership titles break down, Koenigsberger told Reuters. 
""If I go call my clients and say country A is in default and it's trading at 25 cents and I think it's worth 50 - great. I'll take a look at it. 
""Try telling the same story on Russia. Nine out of 10 would say no and the tenth would say 'hell, no',"" the chief investment officer of the $5.5 billion fund said in an interview.
Russia calls its Feb. 24 invasion a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine, while Kyiv and the West say it is an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Prices on some Russian bonds that had been languishing at around 10 cents on the dollar quadrupled in recent days after the country paid coupons and swerved a default. Russia's 2043 bond for instance briefly hit 45 cents, up from 12 cents on March 8.
Those payments were possible due to a temporary U.S. licence authorising U.S. persons to receive payments on securities from certain sanctioned Russian government entities.
That exemption runs out on May 25, leaving in the balance nearly $2 billion in sovereign bond payments due until end-2022. 
While that deadline could be flexible, Koenigsberger reckons Russia will find it increasingly difficult to pay. Sanctions have also immobilised much of Russia's reserves warchest.
""What percentage of their debt service capability is tied up in other people's hands? I can't remember a time in history where there's been a negotiation of reparations where the side that is wanting to get paid is holding the cash,"" he said.
Gramercy is one of the best known among a breed of investors which specialise in buying beaten-up bonds and betting prices will recover or that they can take governments to court and win lengthy recovery battles.
Koenigsberger did not rule out ever buying Russian bonds, noting that Russia was forced in 1996 to settle pre-Revolution debt from the early 1900s before it could issue its first post-Soviet-era international bond.
""Russia might disappear for a long period of time but I would never say that the asset is worthless. The claim cannot be wiped out. But right now you would be buying a perpetual call option, not necessarily a bond,"" Koenigsberger said.
Russia will be ejected from major bond and stock indexes as of March 31, meaning investors may write down the value of their holdings to zero or try to offload them to anyone who will buy.
""You're going to see lower prices [on Russian bonds],"" he said, predicting more forced selling.

Gramercy has instead been buying Ukrainian dollar bonds, paying prices in the low 20 cents on the dollar.
Koenigsberger said it would look to exit in the high 30s or low 40s ahead of a formal debt restructuring that he expected would see the bonds written down by 50%, in line with past such deals involving Western creditors in Eastern Europe.

""Ukraine will be massively supported by the West throughout and on the other side of this. That being said, I would expect that there will be a quid pro quo for that support,"" Koenigsberger added.
Ukraine's 2040 bond traded on Friday around 24 cents on the dollar, up from lows of 13 cents earlier this month.

Investing.com --  Honest Company  Inc (NASDAQ:HNST) shares plunged 28% Friday on the back of the company's quarterly report, which saw it miss earnings and revenue expectations.
The consumer goods company reported a loss per share of $0.10 on revenue of $80.38 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a loss per share of $0.07 on revenue of $84.65 million. Revenue rose 3% year-over-year.
While the company's diapers and wipes segment and skin and personal care segment saw a rise in revenue, 16%, and 26%, respectively, its household and wellness segment declined $9.7 million, or 68%, in the fourth quarter. The company put the decline down to reduced COVID-19 related consumer demand for sanitizing and disinfecting products and face masks.
In a further blow to shareholders, the company sees 2022 revenue as being approximately flat compared to 2021, with first-quarter revenue anticipated to decline about 15%.
Honest Company CEO Nick Vlahos said they ""expect inflation and supply chain headwinds to continue to challenge the industry."""

BNP PARIBAS EXANE
""14% EPS growth would not just beat the existing Generali plan, but would lead our entire sector. If you offer this to investors, you need to be prepared to back it up. We don’t feel we got that today. 
In particular, the 6-6.5% CAGR contribution from 'Business Enhancement' stretches credulity: example strategic opportunities in Health, SME and Asset Management are all-well-and-good, but strike us as incremental rather than game-changing.""
CITI:
""Significantly larger efficiency targets were presented, but poorly supported in our view, also with a tight delivery schedule and being revenue dependent. It was also unclear how higher IT spend would be expensed.
Overall we see this as a far more aggressive plan that would significantly change the investment case and risk profile in a challenging time for large scale, shareholder-friendly M&A.""
KBW
""We are pretty sure that Generali can do better. But we do not agree that the evidence is overwhelming that the current management team has failed, especially when we consider issues such as the Eurozone crisis and the need to recover financial flexibility that bedevilled the 2010s.""

EQUITA SIM
""Caltagirone said that in the insurance business Generali will have to look to growth in Europe and the East (China and India) and for growth in asset management in the U.S. These points had already been highlighted by Generali's current management in the business plan in December.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Friday it will idle for two weeks in April an assembly plant in Indiana that builds pickup trucks, over ongoing semiconductor chip shortages.
The Detroit automaker said it will halt production at its Fort Wayne assembly plant, which builds the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500, for two weeks starting April 4.
""There is still uncertainty and unpredictability in the semiconductor supply base, and we are actively working with our suppliers to mitigate potential issues moving forward,"" GM said Friday.
The automaker said this is its first semiconductor-related full-size truck production downtime since August. 
GM noted that overall it has ""seen better consistency in semiconductor supply through the first quarter compared to last year as a whole. This has translated into improvement in our production and deliveries during the first three months of the year."" 

GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra met with some lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week, including Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana. 
GM is backing a bill in Congress to provide $52 billion in government subsidies to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. GM said that legislation could help ""alleviate the ongoing shortage that continues to impact U.S. automotive manufacturing.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Rebel challengers to Generali (MI:GASI)'s current management pledged to increase earnings by a double-digit percentage and free more cash for takeovers, setting out their plans for Italy's largest insurer before a showdown next month.
Generali faces a power struggle over its board when shareholders vote on April 29, with investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone putting up his own candidates for the top jobs.
Caltagirone's camp set out their stall on Friday with a plan dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"", a reference to Generali's nickname ""The Lion of Trieste"", which features on its logo.
""Awakening the Lion"" is based on the observation of Generali's progressive and inexorable loss of competitiveness compared to its main European competitors,"" the plan said.
Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of the company, wants to replace Frenchman Philippe Donnet, who has been CEO since 2016, and install Generali veteran Luciano Cirina in his place.
Cirina served as the company's head of Austria and CEE countries until he was suspended this week.
Caltagirone has also proposed former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna as chairman.
The challengers aim to boost earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8%. The rebels also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Another target is to lift the cash available for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to 7 billion euros ($7.7 billion), aiming for fewer but bigger deals. Generali's plan aimed for 3 billion euros.
'AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE'
Appearing with Costamagna at a news conference in Milan on Friday, Cirina described the plans as ""ambitious but achievable"".
Generali hit back, saying that Donnet led the company to its best performance last year and that his latest plan, announced in December, had been received ""very positively"" by the financial market.
The outgoing board, backed by leading shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), has put forward Donnet for a third term as CEO and nominated Andrea Sironi, a leading international expert in governance and risk management, as new chairman. 
Caltagirone and fellow tycoon Leonardo Del Vecchio - Generali's second and third-largest investors respectively - are opposing the reappointment of Donnet as they challenge the influence of Mediobanca. 
About 35% of Generali's share capital is in the hands of institutional investors while small savers hold 23%, meaning their votes are likely to prove pivotal.
Generali said its slate of candidates would best serve investors.

""The board has presented a very solid list made of excellent and qualified individuals with international experience, who will work in the interest of all stakeholders and not to the benefit of specific shareholders,"" Generali said in a statement.

The Chinese electric vehicle company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.16 on revenue of $1.55 billion. Analysts expected a loss per share of $0.16 on revenue of $1.52 billion.
Deliveries came in at 25,034 vehicles.
Looking ahead, the company also guided for deliveries between 25,000 and 26,000 vehicles in the first quarter, representing an increase of approximately 24.6% to 29.6% from the same quarter of 2021.
However, the company's co-founder and CEO William Li warned that ""chip supply is a big challenge"" in its earnings call.
""The main challenge is in some common and cheap chips, which will affect our production this year,"" he added. 
The news has resulted in a more than 10% fall in NIO shares.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Friday after the U.S. and European Union agreed on a deal that will markedly increase shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe.
On the one hand, the deal will help Europe to reduce its purchases of Russian energy, increasing the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin's government. On the other, it appears to signal that both sides are now prepared for a long and attritional hybrid war against each other that threatens to act as a drag on global growth for the foreseeable future. Ukraine's government again repeated Friday that Russia's demands for it to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and the breakaway eastern Ukrainian statelets established in 2014 are unacceptable.
The deal appears to achieve a decisive breakthrough in the struggle for the European gas market that has been fought over by the U.S. and Russia ever since the shale revolution and the launch of the Nord Stream pipeline project. Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), the U.S.'s biggest pure-play LNG stock, rose 2.9% to another new all-time high. It's now up 46% so far this year.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 95 points, or 0.3%, at 34,803 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% but the Nasdaq Composite lagged with a gain of less than 0.1%.
The three main indices are on course for a second straight week of gains, having more than erased all their losses since Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago. However, the mood was clouded by fresh signs that the housing market is cooling under the impact of higher prices and rising mortgage rates. Pending home sales fell 4.1% in February, their fourth straight drop, to leave the pending home sales index at its lowest since July 2020. New home sales had also come in below expectations earlier in the week with a second straight monthly fall.
The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index also fell by more than expected to an 11-year low, overshadowed by record gasoline prices and the fading of last year's stimulus effects.
Among early movers, cannabis stocks stood out with sharp gains amid reports that the House of Representatives will again vote on a bill legalizing pot at the federal level. A previous attempt to pass similar legislation had failed due to opposition in the Senate. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock rose 14%, while Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) stock was up 5.2% and  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) stock was up 6.8%.
Elsewhere, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock rose 1.9% after Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder and activist investor Ryan Cohen said three new directors will join the retailer's board under a settlement hammered out between the two sides. The company will also look for alternatives for its buybuy Baby unit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was left unmoved by a Bloomberg report that it is looking at allowing people to buy iPhones and other hardware through subscription models.
Elsewhere, investors again used the bounce in Chinese ADRs to exit from positions that may soon be complicated by U.S. delisting requirements. Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs fell more than 10%, after the electric vehicle also reported deliveries below expectations in the latest quarter.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs were down 3.6% while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs fell 4.2%.",,,,,

(Reuters) - Mutual funds that invest in emerging market (EM) equities and bonds have faced huge outflows over the past month, as the intensifying Russia-Ukraine crisis spawns fears over higher inflation and slower economic growth in these markets.
According to Refinitiv Lipper, a cumulative $8.1 billion has flowed out of EM equity funds and $5.73 billion from bond funds in the past four weeks.
This is in contrast to last year's heavy inflows, when EM bond funds received $232 billion, while EM equity funds obtained $103.4 billion. 
Among EM equity funds, the Emerging Markets Custom ESG Equity Index Fund E and Invesco Developing Markets Fund R6 led the outflows, with net sales worth $1.09 billion and $756 million respectively.
Emerging market nations are facing higher input costs as commodity prices soar due to an escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The two countries are leading exporters of a variety of commodities such as crude oil, gas, wheat and nickel.
According to data from Oxford Economics, China, India and South Korea are the biggest importers of crude oil among emerging markets. 
TD Securities estimates that a 50% increase in the average oil price would result in Asia's oil trade deficit widening by $240 billion this year.
""The increase in energy prices, and rising risk aversion due to the crisis in Ukraine fuels risks of capital outflows from the region at a time when current account positions are worsening,"" the brokerage said.
Brent crude oil was trading at $116.3 per barrel on Friday, having gained over 51% so far this year. 
The higher import costs are likely to hit economies with larger current account deficits, prompting further outflows from their bonds and equities, analysts say.
Colombia, Chile and Egypt have the biggest current account deficits as a percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP), according to data from Oxford Economics, which makes them more likely to borrow the money to pay for their imports. 
China, Turkey, Poland and South Korea have the biggest trade exposure with Russia among EM countries, according to the data.
Inflation has risen in many emerging market countries due to a surge in commodity costs, which has prompted some central banks to raise interest rates this year.
The National Bank of Hungary raised its base rate by 100 basis points to 4.4% on Tuesday, the biggest hike in the rate since 2008, saying rising energy costs and the war in Ukraine had fuelled inflation risks.
""High inflation continues to impede activity and while we expect price pressures to ease in the months ahead, substantial interest rate hikes during the past year will increasingly weigh on growth,"" Keith Wade, strategist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said in a note this month. 
""An important factor will be investors' appetites for Emerging Markets. This asset class has always promised but hasn’t always delivered,"" said Jerry Orosco, a portfolio manager at Intercontinental Wealth Advisors, based in Florida. 
The MSCI EM index has risen just 7.7% in the last 10 years, compared with the 130.9% gain in the MSCI World index. 
""EM equity has underperformed year-to-date and over 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Investors growing impatient might favor the U.S. as a more stable market providing better long and short-term returns.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and billionaire investor Ryan Cohen said on Friday that the two sides had reached a settlement where three new directors will join the housewares retailer's board and the company will look for alternatives for its buybuy Baby unit.
The two sides reached the agreement three weeks after Cohen, co-founder of online pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and chairman of GameStop (NYSE:GME), said he wanted management and the board to consider other options, including a possible full sale of the company.
Marjorie Bowen, Shelly Lombard and Ben Rosenzweig will join the board immediately, expanding its size to 14 members before shrinking it back to 11 after the annual meeting, the company said in a news release. The three have expertise in the retail sector and strategic transactions. 
Cohen, who owns nearly 10% of Bed Bath through RC Ventures, became the latest activist to target the company when he said earlier this month that its strategy was too ambitious and that its management team was earning outsized paychecks for poor returns. In 2019, Bed Bath & Beyond settled with three activists and added four new directors to the board.
The company's stock price climbed nearly 6% in premarket trading on the news.
Two of the new board members added now will join a four-member committee focused on finding alternatives for the buybuy Baby unit, the company said. That committee began work earlier in the year, a source familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath Chief Executive Mark Tritton said the company had always been ready to explore ""all options to maximize long-term shareholder value,"" adding that buybuy Baby is a ""tremendous asset"" and that management is ""committed to unlocking its full value.""
Cohen called the settlement a positive outcome for all shareholders and gave high marks to the company for having quickly embraced his ideas.

Shares of New Jersey-based Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rose 5%, after the company added two of the directors would join a committee focused on exploring options for buybuy Baby, selling which Cohen believes would improve the company's focus.
The shares have surged ~37% since Cohen disclosed his nearly 10% stake in the company, taken through his investment firm RC Ventures LLC, and urged it to explore alternatives including separating buybuy Baby chain or a sale of the entire company.
The activist investor has criticized the retailer for an ""overly ambitious"" strategy, overpaying top executives and failing to reverse market share losses. 
In recent months, the company has buckled under pressure from supply chain issues and competition and seen its sales plunge in two of the three quarters reported last year. 
It is the second time the company has come under pressure from activist investors. In 2019, it reached a settlement with three activists and appointed four new directors, after the group criticized it for failing to reshape itself to meet consumers' growing preferences to shop online.
Cohen noted earlier that Bed Bath & Beyond Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton, who was hired soon after the 2019 settlement, was paid far more than what top bosses earned at far bigger retailers including Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).

Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multi-billion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Below are key investments by the three firms or their listed vehicles, based on company releases and Reuters reports. 
Arctic LNG 2
China's  CNOOC Ltd  and CNPC agreed in 2019 to buy a combined 20% stake in the $25.5 billion Arctic-2 liquefied natural gas project led by Russian gas producer Novatek. 
Novatek has a 60% stake in Arctic LNG 2, while TotalEnergies holds 10% and Japan Arctic LNG - Mitsui & Co and state-run JOGMEC - with the final 10% stake. 
The 19.8 million tonne-per-year (tpy) project, one of the world's largest, is expected to export its first LNG cargo next year under the first train, with the second and third starting by 2024 and 2026.
Japan and France have frozen new investment in the project, Japan's Nikkei newspaper said on Friday.
Yamal LNG
CNPC in 2014 bought a 20% stake in the $27 billion Yamal LNG, another Russian LNG export facility in the Arctic operated by Novatek.
Novatek holds 50.1% in the 16.5 million tpy project, which began operation in late 2017. TotalEnergies holds 20% and China's state-backed Silk Road Fund 9.9%. 
Amur Gas Chemical Complex
Sinopec owns 40%, investing around $250 million in the $10 billion project controlled by privately owned Sibur, Russia's top petrochemical firm, which owns the remaining 60%. 
Sibur said in December the Amur GCC had secured $9.1 billion loans, including $2.6 billion from international banks with coverage from export credit agencies SACE of Italy and Germany's Euler Hermes, and $6.5 billion from Chinese and Russian banks.
The Amur plant is set to start producing 2.3 million tonnes of polyethylene and 400,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year from 2024, targeting China as a key market.
Sibur
China's state-run Silk Road Fund bought 10% stake in Sibur in 2016 after Sinopec acquired 10% in late 2015, according to Chinese media Caixin. 
Sakhalin-3 Veninsky oil project
Russian oil giant Rosneft and Sinopec agreed to jointly explore the Sakhalin-3 Veninsky block during a visit by China's then-president, Hu Jintao, to Moscow in 2005. It became China’s first energy project in Russia.
Sinopec owned as of 2007 25.1% in the oil project, controlled by Rosneft. 
As of 2009, Sinopec owned 49% of Russia's Udmurneft oilfield, also controlled by Rosneft. It was then Sinopec's largest oil-producing asset outside China. 

Beijing Gas 
In June 2017, Beijing Gas Group Co, the dominant natural gas distributor for the Chinese capital Beijing, closed a deal to pay $1.1 billion for a 20% stake in Rosneft subsidiary Verkhnechyonskneftegaz, which produces oil and gas in East Siberia.

LONDON (Reuters) - Surging European steel prices are set to extend their gains as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted logistics, spurred sanctions and sent energy prices soaring.
Russia is the world's fifth biggest steel producer, while Ukraine comes in at 14th. The two combined account for a fifth of imports to the European Union.
European hot rolled coil (HRC) prices have shot up by nearly 40% over the past three weeks. Prices in North America and China have also gained, but by much less, around 7-8%.
""It's certainly looking like prices will continue to rise in the short term. We're forecasting that prices will jump again by the end of this month and into April,"" said analyst Kaye Ayub at consultancy MEPS International.
""The supply side has been massively disrupted in Europe, and that will take quite a while to resolve.""
Russia and Ukraine punch above their weight in the global steel market due to hefty exports, especially to Europe.
""In Europe, pricing power is clearly still with the steel mills... as the loss of about 20% of finished steel imports from Russia/Ukraine tightens the market,"" UBS analyst Andrew Jones said in a note.
Even though Western nations have not specifically targeted Russian steel companies with sanctions, logistics problems and the knock-on impact of sanctions have disrupted businesses and shipments.
In addition to fears of losing supply from Russia and Ukraine, Europe is also having to contend with a surge in energy prices due to the conflict. 
Its steel sector was already grappling with high energy costs when Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February spurred another spike in the price of oil and gas, driving electricity prices higher. 
Electric furnaces for steelmaking account for just over 40% of Europe's output, higher than in other regions.
After hostilities broke out, steelmakers in Spain such as ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) and stainless steel producer Acerinox cut production, while Germany's Lech-Stahlwerke stopped output in Bavaria.

The full impact of the conflict has not yet shown up in production data, but European steel output in January had already declined to the lowest level seasonally since 2009, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Michael Widmer. 
In February, crude steel output in the European Union fell 2.2% month-on-month and elsewhere in Europe dropped by 4.8%, data from the World Steel Association showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is recalling 947 vehicles in the United States because the rearview image may not immediately display when they begin to reverse, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.
The automaker told the NHTSA the recall covers some 2018-2019 Model S, Model X, and 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles equipped with Autopilot Computer 2.5 and operating certain firmware releases. The vehicles do not comply with a federal safety standard on rear visibility. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will perform an over-the-air software update to address the issue.
NHTSA said a delayed rearview camera image reduces the driver's rear view and increases the risk of a crash. This is the latest in a series of recalls Tesla has conducted for software issues in recent months.
Tesla on Dec. 19 https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2022/RCLRPT-22V169-2752.PDF began deploying firmware to a limited number of vehicles and its fleet monitoring tool soon ""identified an abnormal frequency of computer resets among Model 3 vehicles"" with that update, according to the recall notice dated March 18 but made public on Friday.
Tesla said ""over the following week, an engineering investigation into the condition identified a software error as a potential cause for further assessment."" 

Starting Feb. 9 after talks between Tesla and NHTSA to review consumer complaints that alleged delayed or unavailable rearview image displays, more than a dozen tests were conducted.
Tesla said that ""despite not finding a noncompliance in the tests that Tesla conducted, a recall determination was made out of an abundance of caution to recognize the potential presence of a noncompliance in affected vehicles.""

(Reuters) -London-listed Petropavlovsk will miss a loan payment due on Friday after Britain froze the assets of its main lender Gazprombank in its latest set of sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia-focused Petropavlovsk has agreements, including for loans and bullion sales with Gazprombank, which make it difficult for the miner to sell its gold and refinance loans now Britain has frozen assets the bank's assets.
The company is restricted from paying $560,000 in interest due on Friday on its $200 million term loan with Gazprombank, Petropavlovsk said.
Although Petropavlovsk itself has not been named in any of the Western sanctions to-date, it will be thrown out of FTSE indexes this month after many brokers refused to trade their shares in the miner and in others with Russian links.
Petropavlovsk shares sank more than 30% on Friday, adding to the over 85% loss in stock value since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. Moscow has called its actions in its neighbouring country a ""special military operation"". 
A Petropavlovsk spokesperson, who declined to comment beyond the company's statement, said the miner's debt portfolio consists of facilities with Gazprombank, a convertible bond and a eurobond, with no other bank loans at present. 
Western leaders have tightened sanctions on Russia as the attack on Ukraine entered its second month. That has had a knock on effect on companies with no apparent direct ties with sanctioned people or companies and hurt investor sentiment.
Petropavlovsk was founded by British businessman Peter Hambro and Russia's Pavel Maslovskiy in the 1990s. Its top investor is Russian businessman Sergey Sudarikov, who through his REGION brand of businesses disclosed a stake of just over 29% in the miner earlier this month, regulatory filings show. 

REGION is also a shareholder in the sanctioned Credit Bank of Moscow, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Peel Hunt analysts in a note said the Gazprombank asset freeze also complicated Petropavlovsk's ability to refinance its bonds due in November.

The company sold 83.58 million shares, or around 25% of its total equity capital, valuing the company at just under $1 billion. A 15% greenshoe option is also part of the offer.
Braving choppy markets after a failed IPO attempt in Milan in 2019, it had set an indicative price range of HK$21.82–HK$28.24 per share for the float. 
The stock market debut is scheduled for March 31. 
Ferretti, which counts British fashion designer Jimmy Choo and former football star David Beckham among its customers, is a market leader for yachts with price tags from 4 million euros to more than 20 million.
The group is controlled by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group and Pietro Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), son of the eponymous luxury sports car company's founder Enzo Ferrari, owns 11%. Ferretti produces under brands including Pershing and Riva and owns six shipyards in Italy.
Five Chinese cornerstone investors - Sunshine Insurance, Sanya Development, Hainan Free Trade Port Fund, Hainan Financial and Haifa Holding - have invested a total of $129.5 million. There is a six-month lock-up on the cornerstone investors.
The IPO was carried out while Hong Kong experiences major market volatility as a result of the Russian and Ukraine war, rising global interest rates and ongoing fallout from constant Chinese regulatory change. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is down 6.2% for the year and 3.4% for March, according to Refinitiv data.
Ferretti said it was confident the luxury boat industry would withstand any global economic downturn created by unfolding geopolitical events. 

It had said that it expected the value of the global yacht market to grow on average 7% a year, reaching 27 billion euros in 2025, with demand strengthening particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

However, the electric vehicle start-up said it could face production challenges in 2022 due to the continued shortage of chips.
""Chip supply is a big challenge [for us],"" William Li, co-founder and CEO said on Friday's earnings call. ""The main challenge is in some common and cheap chips, which will affect our production this year.""
According to Li, NIO uses around 1,000 different chips in each car, with approximately 10% of those chips facing supply shortages. Li said the supply of high-end semiconductors, such as Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Orin used to support the driver assistance system, was sufficient since NIO had already formed long-term partnerships with chip makers.
The shortage of chips has plagued the entire auto industry for quite a while now. It is no surprise that the car makers are setting guidance to accommodate. ""Based on this experience in 2021, we have already taken into consideration of the chip cost increase in terms of setting our target for the vehicle gross margin."" Li said during the call.
Apart from chip shortages, Li also said that rising prices of nickel and lithium could result in higher battery costs and affect its gross profit margin.

HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) - India's civil aviation minister urged Indian airlines on Friday to add more long-haul aircraft to their fleets and to increase flights abroad, as air travel rebounds from a two-year slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Domestic passenger numbers are expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels within one year, Jyotiraditya Scindia said during an air show in the Indian city of Hyderabad.
But foreign carriers dominate international routes to and from India, which industry experts say is partly because Indian carriers do not have enough widebody, long-haul planes.
""Along with our thrust on narrow body aircraft, we must also increase our fleet of wide body aircraft. It is not enough to connect all points in India, we need to connect the world to India,"" the minister said.
India's aviation market is dominated by narrowbody planes operated by low-cost carriers like IndiGo. In 2019, Indian airlines operated more than 550 narrowbody planes and less than 60 widebodies.
Only two Indian airlines fly to long-haul destinations - Air India, the former state-run carrier acquired by Tata Group, and Vistara, a venture between Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and Tata.
Middle Eastern, European and other carriers take the bulk of passengers from India leaving domestic airlines with a small share of the international market.
This is partly because Indian carriers do not have enough widebody planes to compete, Remi Maillard, president and managing director at Airbus for India and South Asia, said at the air show, making a pitch for the Airbus A350 long-haul jet. 
Maillard said he expected-long haul travel from India to grow ""massively"" in the next decade which would drive demand for bigger planes. 

The European planemaker projected India would need 2,210 new planes to meet growing air travel demand over the next two decades, with widebody planes accounting for 440 of them. 
Airbus' rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co now dominates the widebody market in India.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The president of China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom), on Friday warned it will be difficult for the lender to deliver satisfactory earnings this year.
""This year has been the most complex year in my nearly 30 years in this business,"" bank president Liu Jun told a news conference following BoCom's annual results.
Liu cited challenges including the resurgence of COVID in China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on supply issues, inflation and other domestic difficulties. 
COVID is currently spreading in a number of China's largest cities, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, leading to partial lockdowns of airports, districts and inter-province travel.
Other difficulties the country is facing include a crackdown on the property sector, which has led to near-defaults by a number of developers.
The bank reported a full-year profit rise of 11.9% on Friday, beating estimates.
China's sixth largest commercial bank by assets reported a full year net profit of 87.6 billion yuan, above an average estimate of 83.1 billion from 18 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The non-performing loan ratio at BoCom was 1.48% by the year-end, compared to 1.6% three months ago, while the net interest margin (NIM), a gauge of bank profitability, stood at 1.56%, compared to 1.55% by the end of September, the bank said in an exchange filing.
The bad loan ratio at large commercial banks fell to 1.37% by the end of December, the lowest since the third quarter in 2019, while NIM steadied at 2.04%, data from the banking and insurance regulator showed. 
The commercial banks made a total of 2.2 trillion yuan net profits in 2021, a 12.6% increase from 2020, according to the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. 

BoCom reported a fourth-quarter net profit of 23.2 billion yuan ($3.65 billion), a 9.2% drop from 25.6 billion a year earlier, Reuters calculations showed.

(Reuters) - After producing vaccines and treatments for acute COVID-19 in record time, researchers and drugmakers are turning to finding a cure for long COVID, a more elusive target marked by hundreds of different symptoms afflicting millions of people. Leading drugmakers, including those who have launched antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19, are having early discussions with researchers about how to target the disease, five scientists in the United States and UK told Reuters. Companies including GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) and Humanigen confirmed they had spoken to researchers on trials using their current treatments against long COVID. Others including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Roche said they are interested but would not elaborate on plans. Researchers, biotech companies and public health experts say major pharmaceutical companies are integral to getting a proven treatment for the disease, which currently afflicts more than 100 million people, according to the World Health Organization.
""When you look at the numbers for heart failure, for diabetes, etc, that is the ballpark we are talking about,"" said Amitava Banerjee, a leading researcher on a long COVID trial.
Long COVID, with some 200 reported afflictions that include fatigue, chest pain and brain fog, is defined by symptoms that last longer than 3 months. It sidelines people who have had both mild and severe COVID-19, including children. In the United States, it is estimated to have affected 1-in-7 working age adults. Sandi Zack, 53, a former elementary school teacher from the Atlanta area who can no longer work, described symptoms including extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain and heart palpitations since contracting COVID in December 2020. She has sought help from a range of specialists and tried a variety of drugs to ease her symptoms including steroids and the antidepressant fluvoxamine.
“We’re all still out here,” she said. ""Hoping, and waiting.” There are fewer than 20 clinical trials underway testing drugs, a handful of which have moved beyond early stages, according to interviews with more than a dozen independent and government-backed scientists and a Reuters review of a global clinical trials database.
Scientists hope their research will uncover the causes of long COVID, a major hurdle in finding targets for new drugs or identifying existing medicines that may work as treatments. “We are getting to the stage where we are getting traction, and for people suffering, we are getting treatments tested,” said David Strain, a University of Exeter Medical School lecturer whose research has informed which treatments will be tested in a major British trial. “Hopefully we will have things we can we offer them to get their lives back to normal in the near future.” Big pharmaceutical companies are looking for disease-specific biomarkers that would allow them to assess the value of tested medicines, experts say. “What they’re struggling with is a case definition for long COVID,” said Dr. Amy Proal, an expert in post-viral diseases at the PolyBio Research Foundation in Mercer Island, Washington. She said she has held confidential meetings with two venture capital groups and one major pharmaceutical company. Possible underlying causes researchers are studying include damage from the original infection, lingering reservoirs of virus in the body, an autoimmune response, in which the immune system attacks its own cells, and a dysregulated immune response causing excess inflammation that damages small blood vessels or nerves. It could be a combination of those or other factors, they say. 
SEARCHING FOR A CURE AND FUNDING
One major UK-funded trial led by University College, London, will test four drugs among 4,500 long COVID patients.
They include antihistamines loratadine and famotidine, the gout and heart inflammation treatment colchichine - all available as generics - and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s blood clot preventer Xarelto (rivaroxaban). 
All have data from preliminary studies in people suggesting they could work against some of the possible disease targets for long COVID, such as inflammation and blood clots.
Banerjee, lead researcher on that trial, said the drugs will target several potential underlying mechanisms of long COVID while seeking to understand more about them.
“It’s challenging, because we’re going for a hazy target,” he said in a phone interview. “People on the industry side are trying to figure it out too.”
U.S-based Axcella Therapeutics is working with the University of Oxford in the UK on a drug developed for nonalcoholic steathohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease marked by dysregulated metabolism, inflammation and scarring.
In long COVID, the hope is the drug will restore the normal function of mitochondria - the energy factories of cells. Poorly functioning mitochondria may explain the crushing long-term fatigue so many patients experience.
As lead researcher Dr. Betty Raman put it, if COVID damaged the battery, the drug aims to restore that battery, so cells can perform their normal functions without using up too much energy.
PureTech Health, another U.S. biotech, is running a midstage trial of an experimental pulmonary fibrosis treatment aimed at preventing long-term lung scarring linked with COVID.
In Seattle, researchers at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson COVID Clinical Research Center are testing Resolve Therapeutics' experimental treatment targeting fatigue in long COVID patients.
The drug works by dissolving certain RNA in the blood that has been linked with increased inflammation in patients with autoimmune diseases such as Lupus and Sjogren's syndrome, said Dr. James Andrews, a rheumatologist at the University of Washington who is leading the trial.
Scientists who believe the root cause of long COVID could be lingering virus are keen to test whether existing COVID-19 treatments or vaccines could have an impact.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is donating its vaccine for early trials in the UK testing whether it can help kickstart the immune system and ease long COVID symptoms, the company said in an emailed statement.
Funding has been a struggle for some companies.

Berlin Cures Holding AG, a German biotech, secured only enough money for the first stage of testing of its autoimmune drug - previously used for heart failure - that has shown promise in a handful of patients when used experimentally.
“People call us and they cry on the phone,"" Chief Operating Officer Peter Goettel told Reuters. ""Some people want to sell their house to give us donations, just to get a shot.”

(Reuters) -China has launched an investigation into the crash of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged rapidly from cruising altitude into a mountainside with 132 people on board.
The crash of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 is China's first deadly aviation accident since 2010 in a country that has had one of the world's strongest safety records over that period.
There are international standards governing some parts of air crash investigations, but the practical management of them differs by country.
China will lead the investigation because the crash occurred on its territory, and the United States has the right to participate because the plane was designed and manufactured there.
CHINA'S CHAIN OF COMMAND
China's State Council, the cabinet led by Premier Li Keqiang, has set up an investigation team led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the Ministry of Emergency Management. The search and rescue response also involves multiple other ministries.
The aviation safety office of CAAC, which has an accident investigation department, is leading the technical work.
The State Council oversees major industrial accidents and natural disasters, giving it a more direct political oversight element than crash investigations in places like the United States.
Zheng Lei, chair of the aviation department at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology, said the high-level involvement signified the government was taking the situation seriously and would also help improve cooperation throughout China's extensive bureaucracy.
CAAC only operates at the vice minister level, he said, so the State Council would allow for minister-level involvement.
HOW DOES CAAC COMPARE WITH FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS?
CAAC performs a dual role as the aviation regulator and crash investigator, whereas the United States splits those roles between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB).
U.S.-based aviation analyst Robert Mann said he was unconcerned by CAAC's dual role given it is common elsewhere. The United Arab Emirates and the Philippines, for example, do not split the roles.
Christopher Hart, a former NTSB head, said he believes it is important to have separate agencies because the factors behind accidents often include errors and omissions by the regulator that may be less likely to be included in a final report written by that regulator.
However, a State Council report into China's last deadly crash, involving a Henan Airlines Embraer regional jet in 2010, did point out deficiencies in CAAC oversight.
WHEN WILL CHINA RELEASE MORE INFORMATION PUBLICLY?
Under international standards, a preliminary report into an accident needs to be lodged with U.N. aviation agency ICAO within 30 days. 
Such initial reports tend to be factual and brief, laying out the information known to date from maintenance records, air traffic control recordings and the black boxes if found, rather than a cause of the crash. 
There is no requirement to make the preliminary report public, though Indonesia, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Iran have done so in more recent crashes. India did not publicly release a preliminary report into a deadly 2020 crash of an Air India Express plane.
Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said he hoped CAAC produced a public 30-day report given the global interest. 
Mao Yanfeng, a CAAC official, on Friday told reporters that the investigation team will follow international and Chinese rules in submitting the 30-day report to ICAO, but he did not say whether it would be made public.
A final report is due within a year, according to ICAO guidelines, though sometimes they can take longer.
China is the world's biggest operator of 737-800s with more than 1,200 in service, so it could release any broader safety information involving the model more quickly, analysts said.
WHAT STEPS DOES CHINA TAKE AFTER AIR CRASHES?
In most countries, an accident report makes safety recommendations to the airline, regulator and manufacturer as appropriate but does not assign blame or call for punishment.
Prosecutions can occur after a crash.
The State Council's final report into the 2010 Henan Airlines crash recommended demotions and demerits for many airline and regulatory officials and prosecution of the captain, who survived the crash that killed 44 of the 96 people on board.
Professor Zheng of Swinburne University said a punitive approach was common in China, where there was a desire to see the people responsible punished when accidents occurred.

""I think that's the convention, just to remind people about their accountability for the area they are looking after,"" he said.
Depending on the investigation results, China Eastern also risks consequences including fines, aircraft groundings and unfavourable treatment when applying for new routes and airport slots, Morningstar analyst Cheng Weng said.

(Reuters) - Howard Dahl stopped taking farm equipment orders from customers as a shortage of parts and labor and escalating inflation threatened profits for his North Dakota-based firm Amity Technology.
He did so even as high crop prices suggested strong demand for the sugar beet and silage machinery his company makes ahead of spring planting season. 
""Normally we begin selling equipment in early November,"" said Dahl. ""Largely because of the uncertainty of the supply chain, we limited what we were going to build.""
A shortage of raw materials saddled manufacturers with increased costs even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices sky-rocketing and darkened the global inflation outlook. Now, overall costs of materials for Dahl have jumped 21% year over year through March while the price of steel has doubled, putting him in a delicate situation to price equipment and control costs. 
Bigger equipment manufacturers are also fighting to protect margins after farmers flush with cash have helped them book record profits over the past year.
Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co said on a recent earnings call it would be pausing advance orders for equipment not already in stock, though it maintains a positive outlook for margin growth. 
""Our order books across all of our businesses are mostly full for the year, except in a few cases where we paused orders to allow for more dynamic pricing,"" said John May, Chief Executive Officer, on the call.
Rival CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) told Reuters it is following suit. 
""With high inflation, we're being careful how far out we go,"" Chief Executive Officer of CNH Industrial, Scott Wine, said in an interview. ""If [input] prices rise too much, we're not going to sell something and lose margin.""
Farmer income is expected to drop by $5.4 billion from 2021, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture, as federal aid payments given during the pandemic ease. But tractor sales remained solid in February as farmers eye high crop prices, increasing 9.2% from the same time a year ago, the Association of Equipment Manufacturer's latest report showed. 
Still, inflation has companies weighing to what extent they can pass costs on to consumers. As prices of raw materials continue to rise, companies may need to find other alternatives to cushion the impact on big price-tag equipment like tractors and keep margins intact, analysts say.
The global chip shortage had led automakers to bring production on key parts like electric vehicle batteries in house, while also moving to lock in the supply of key materials like lithium through longer-term contracts or even investments in mines. 

For Dahl, miscalculating inflation has proven to be costly. Now, all cards are on the table to preserve profits. 
""We did not raise our prices quickly enough, so we’ve had some profit erosion, said Dahl who has increased prices by 18% since last June. ""There's only a couple of components that we're single-sourced on so we're taking a hard look at all alternatives.""

DETROIT/BEIJING (Reuters) - A year ago Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dismissed the alternative path of electric car battery swapping as ""riddled with problems and not suitable for widescale use"". It seems Beijing disagrees.
In fact, China is pushing hard for swappable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) as a supplement to regular vehicle charging, with the government throwing its weight behind several companies advancing the technology. 
Four companies - automakers Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Geely, battery swap developer Aulton and state-owned oil producer Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) - say they plan to establish a total of 24,000 swap stations across the country by 2025, up from about 1,400 today.
Battery swapping allows drivers to replace depleted packs quickly with fully charged ones, rather than plugging the vehicle into a charging point. Swapping could help mitigate the growing strains placed on power grids as millions of drivers juice up, yet specialists caution it can only take off in a big way if batteries become standardized industry-wide.
If China is successful in making swapping successful on a large scale, though, the shift could undermine the business models of global brands like Tesla, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), whose EVs are designed for and powered by their own proprietary batteries and, in Tesla's case, its own charging network. 
Even slight changes of fortune in the country can have significant consequences for these carmakers, whose futures rely on achieving success in the world's largest car market. 
The Chinese swapping plans, announced piecemeal in recent weeks and months but not widely known outside the domestic auto sector, are part of Beijing's broader plan to make 25% of car sales fully electric by 2025, or more than 6 million passenger vehicles based on current forecasts. Estimates vary widely as to how many will have swappable batteries.
The Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT), a major supporter of battery swapping, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment about China's battery swapping strategy
Furthermore, big Chinese players are also looking overseas.
Ningde-based CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Ltd), the world's biggest battery maker, told Reuters it was developing swapping services not only for China, but ""to meet the demand of global markets"".
""We are accumulating experience in the Chinese market and at the same time communicating closely with overseas partners. You'll receive more concrete information soon,"" said CATL, which supplies about half of China's market and more than 30% of the battery cells used in EVs globally.
Nio, among China's top EV makers, plans to offer U.S. customers battery-swapping services by 2025, the company's North American head Ganesh Iyer said. It has more than 800 swap stations in China and has just set up its first in Europe.
'NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN'
Such plans clash with the views expressed by global EV pioneer and leader Tesla in March 2021 when it dismissed the viability of large-scale battery swapping in China. It trialed swapping in the United States years ago and abandoned it.
Industry executives are divided over whether China's push can overcome the reluctance of European and U.S. automakers to abandon their own battery designs and adopt standardized ones.
""You'll never ever get carmakers to agree to swappable batteries,"" said Andy Palmer, former CEO of Aston Martin and currently head of EV maker  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Mobility. 
John Holland, wireless EV charging company Momentum Dynamics' commercial director for Europe and the Middle East, said convergence on batteries created a quandary for automakers.
""Then how do you differentiate your product?"" 
Tesla, GM and Volkswagen say they are not exploring battery swapping right now.
A GM spokesperson told Reuters that swappable batteries ""are not part of our strategy at present.""
A VW spokesperson said the company originally considered battery swapping to avoid waiting times at charging stations, but that advances in fast charging and the lower costs of non-swappable batteries had led it to shift focus to the latter.
""Nevertheless, our strategists closely monitor and evaluate the competitive environment and all developments in this area,"" the German carmaker said.
A Tesla spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Swapping and regular grid-charging both have critics and cheerleaders in a rapidly evolving auto tech arena.
The ease of exchanging batteries in e-scooters has been demonstrated in Asia and Europe, but the challenge is adapting the technology to larger and more complex cars, trucks and vans. See accompanying short story:
Concerns about the length of swapping times have also faded, with Nio saying it has automated the process so it takes as little as 180 seconds.
Yet the more familiar grid-charging side has a huge head start, and is bolstered by the fact there's already billions of dollars' worth of charging infrastructure built globally.
Automakers are also rolling out EVs with improved batteries that boast longer ranges and shorter charge times, which could make swapping obsolete.
'BIGGEST GAME IN TOWN'
In China, MIIT released the global auto industry's first standards for swapping technology last year. They went into effect in November, specifying safety requirements, test methods and inspection rules for EVs with swappable batteries.
The ministry aims to have more than 100,000 battery-swappable vehicles and more than 1,000 swap stations, in total, in 11 cities by 2023; stations in the bigger cities will accommodate both passenger and commercial vehicles, while outlying provincial cities will focus on electric heavy-duty trucks.
Yet a key uncertainty for China's ambitions is whether enough carmakers adopt standardized batteries, an obstacle that scuttled attempts at battery swapping in the last decade - yet, if overcome, could propel the technology to a viable scale. Read a short history of swappable batteries: 
There's a long way to go. Even the swapping option offered to customers by Nio uses the company's own batteries, thus limiting the service to people driving Nio cars equipped with the company's proprietary batteries.
CATL, which helped Nio develop swappable batteries, has signed up China's FAW Motor as the first customer for its new Evogo battery swapping service and expects to extend the service to other Chinese automakers. 
CATL wants domestic firms to accept its standard battery design so its stations can service models from multiple brands, according to a person close to the company who declined to be named due to commercial sensitivities, adding that it expected more car brands to adopt its standardized designs.
The company is ""the biggest game in town"" for EV batteries, said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights. 
""They can offer a large footprint for swapping stations and a low cost to use those stations,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, among those Chinese companies building out swap station networks, Shanghai-based Aulton New Energy Automotive Technology has said it is working with automakers to develop standardized batteries, and with Sinopec to install stations at 30,000 Sinopec gas stations in China by 2030. 
Aulton didn't respond to a request for comment.
MAGIC IN AMERICA?
While international carmakers may resist swappable batteries, they are reliant on Chinese sales to fund their costly transition to electric and will have little choice but to adapt to the market there, according to many industry experts.
Furthermore, if Beijing ultimately mandates swappable batteries ""and starts saying, 'okay, the only car you're allowed to produce is one that meets the standard' . . . you would have to comply to stay in business"" in China, says John Helveston, assistant professor at George Washington University's School of Engineering.
Some advocates of swapping are looking beyond China.
Battery swapping ""is too convenient, too economical and too logical for this not to happen at scale in Europe and the United States,"" said Levi Tillemann, head of policy and international business at San Francisco-based battery swap startup Ample.
""It's a sort of magical thinking to imagine that this is a uniquely Chinese phenomenon,"" he added.
Ample, one of just a handful of battery swapping developers outside China, has raised $275 million from investors, including energy companies Shell (LON:RDSa), Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and Eneos, boosting its valuation to $1 billion.

It is running pilot programs with Uber (NYSE:UBER) and car rental startup Sally, and says it is collaborating with several unnamed automakers.
""With a relatively small number of vehicles that are heavily utilized, we can deploy and operate a battery swap system profitably,"" Tillemann said. ""So fleets are a prime target for us.""

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Recovery crews on Friday expanded the search area of the China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crash, as the second of the plane's two black boxes eluded search-and-rescue workers for a fourth day.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast on Monday when the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 plummeted from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent to its destination.
Human remains and personal belongings of the 132 people on board have been found but no survivors, and debris from the crash was scattered over a wide area of the heavily forested slopes in China's Guangxi region. 
It was the first major air disaster in China in a dozen years, and while the cause of the incident remains unknown, it has prompted the government to reinforce safety checks in aviation and other industries.
""The search area has now been expanded to 200,000 square meters,"" Lao Gaojin, a local government official, told a news conference, adding that 2,248 local residents had joined the search and rescue on Friday. 
The other black box - the cockpit voice recorder - was found on Wednesday, and has been sent to Beijing for examination by experts.
It could take 10 to 15 days to arrive at a preliminary analysis, and longer before a final conclusion can be presented in a report, according to Chinese state media. 
""Currently, we cannot determine the exact time needed for the data downloading and analysis of the black box already recovered,"" said Mao Yanfeng, an official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), adding that the exterior of the device had been damaged. 
The crash investigation is being led by China but the United States was invited to take part because the Boeing 737-800 was designed and manufactured there.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that Chinese authorities had invited the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in the investigation, adding that he was very encouraged by the invitation to be on the ground in China.
The NTSB, however, later said it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China in light of visa and quarantine requirements. 
It would be important for the NTSB to be able to participate in the downloading of the cockpit voice and data recorders, said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
""Just for the sake of openness, whenever you do a download, it's important to have other parties in the room,"" he said.
DISTRAUGHT
More than 200 distraught family members of the 132 people on board the doomed flight have since visited the crash site. 
""Rescue workers have so far found human remains, collected 18 samples of finger prints and 101 pieces of personal belongings of the passengers,"" said Lao. 
More than 230 experts have also been taking DNA samples from family members at the scene as well as from the crash site, he said. 
Debris from the jetliner including engine blades, horizontal tail stabilisers and other wing remnants was concentrated within 30 metres (90 feet) of the main impact point, which was 20 metres (60 feet) deep.
A 1.3 metre-long fragment suspected to be from the plane was found about 10 km (six miles) away, prompting a significant expansion of the search area. 

According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive, before plunging again.
Authorities said the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers during the rapid descent.

Telenor in May 2021 wrote down the value of its Myanmar business by 6.5 billion crowns ($751 million) and later said it would be sold for $105 million to Lebanese investment firm M1 and local firm Shwe Byain Phyu.
""Telenor has received $50 million at closing. The remaining $55 million shall be received in equal instalments over the coming 5 years,"" it said.
""Due to the uncertain situation in Myanmar, the deferred payment will not be recognised in the accounts at closing.""
The sale, prompted by last year's military coup in the Southeast Asian country, has been criticised by some Myanmar civil rights groups and Norwegian politicians who fear it puts the data of 18 million people within the junta's reach.
Telenor, which last week received approval for the sale from Myanmar's rulers, says the firm had to leave the country to adhere to its own values on human rights and responsible business, and because local laws conflict with European laws.
Telenor will book an accumulated loss of around 800 million crowns in its first-quarter accounts stemming from a reclassification of items it had previously accounted for.
It will also see a negative cash flow impact of 1.5 billion crowns resulting from the ""derecognising of the cash balance in Telenor Myanmar and the proceeds received at closing"", the company said.
Reuters reported in February that Shwe Byain Phyu, whose chairman has a history of business ties to the military, will own 80% of the Myanmar operation while M1 will own the rest.
Shwe Byain Phyu has denied ties to the Myanmar army and previously said it was ""selected by Telenor ... because it was the most unrelated to the military"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian full-service airline Vistara is in talks with lessors about getting long-haul planes to cover a gap left by delays in Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 deliveries, chief executive Vinod Kannan said.
Vistara, owned by Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and India's Tata Group, is waiting to receive four aircraft from Boeing's 787 production line, but deliveries have been frozen globally since May 2021 due to quality-control shortcomings.
To provide substitute capacity in the short term, Vistara is talking to lessors about renting 787s, Kannan said in an interview with Reuters.
""There is enough availability (of airliners) in the market because there are still parts of the world where flying has not come back,"" he said, adding that the company is yet to make a final decision on whether to rent aircraft.
Kannan said the market was too volatile to consider ordering new planes right now. But, in the longer run, Vistara could also consider buying Airbus A350s, he said. 
Vistara has about 50 aircraft, including two 787-9s received before the delivery suspension and a mix of Airbus and Boeing narrow-body airliners. It plans to take 20 more aircraft by the end of 2023, mostly A320s to be used domestically and for nearby international destinations.
Expanding its footprint globally is a priority for Vistara, which began operations in 2015 but has not yet made a profit. India's domestic market is dominated by low-cost carriers, such as IndiGo. International flying offers stronger pricing.
The airline's losses narrowed last fiscal year, and Kannan said he had seen a further improvement until February, when fuel prices spiked. While demand is growing and air fares are moving higher, it will be difficult to offset higher fuel costs and the burden of a depreciating rupee, he said.
FLYING INTERNATIONAL
Vistara's international operations - reaching about a dozen foreign cities, such as London, Paris and Frankfurt - comprise around 25% of its capacity. It wants to expand this to 35% over the next two years and is looking at direct flights to the United States, South Korea and Japan, Kannan said.
""A lot of the long haul depends on aircraft availability. This is the time to capitalise, especially with India opening up international travel,"" he said.
Tata this year acquired Vistara's direct competitor, Air India. Kannan said the two airlines are exploring how they can cooperate without violating competition rules.
Vistara began looking at international expansion before the pandemic but paused as air travel came to a near halt in 2020. Now high fuel prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine are forcing it to look again at its plans. 

The airline operated charter flights to such places as Hong Kong and Moscow during the pandemic. But Hong Kong is now closed to visitors and Moscow is ""out of the question"", Kannan said.
""With fuel price where they are, we have to think twice in terms of whether we need to bring on those additional aircraft,"" he said. ""But we know that not just the U.S., but all these long-haul points are important.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co earlier this week the planemaker may not gain certification of a lengthened version of the 737 MAX ahead of a key safety deadline set by Congress, a source told Reuters.
Ian Won, acting manager of the FAA aviation safety office that oversees Boeing, asked the U.S. planemaker in a letter dated March 21 to provide a ""mature certification schedule,"" according to a source familiar with the letter. Won also sought updates on progress for both the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9.
Both airliner designs are under development. Certification is needed before they can enter service.
""With regard to the current Boeing Model 737-10 program maturity, the FAA is concerned it will be significantly challenged to meet the directive"" of Congress in 2020, Won wrote, the source said.
Won's letter referred to the 2020 law known as the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act, which reformed how the FAA certifies new airplanes. The law sets a late-December 2022 deadline for imposing a new safety standard for cockpit alerts.
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the 737 MAX 10 before the end of the year.
Boeing has raised with some lawmakers the potential impact on jobs and production if the aircraft is not approved, Reuters reported last week.
The 737 MAX 10 is longer than earlier 737 MAX narrow-body airliners. The 777-9, a wide-body aircaft, is the initial version of an updated 777 design known as 777X.
In May 2021, the FAA told Boeing that, realistically, it would not certify the 777X until mid- to late 2023.
Boeing said Thursday it continues ""to work transparently with the FAA to provide the information they need and remain committed to meeting their expectations, including regarding 777-9 and 737-10 certification.""
The Seattle Times first reported https://www.union-bulletin.com/seattle_times/faa-tells-boeing-it-doubts-max-10-will-meet-safety-standard-deadline/article_a549d7f4-a780-5335-99f2-4d22125de908.html the existence of the letter.
The FAA letter also asked Boeing for an update on its expected dates for major milestones needed before the planes can win certification and enter commercial service.
Won warned existing certification schedules for the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9 ""are outdated and no longer reflect the program activities"" as understood by the FAA, the source said.

Asked if Boeing had an updated schedule, Boeing said it has ""no updates to share beyond our previous estimates. We are working to provide official documentation of specific milestones within the certification program in accordance with the FAA’s request.""
The FAA said Thursday it does not comment on ongoing certification projects.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Friday, ending the week on a cautious note as the Ukraine war rages on and energy prices remain elevated. 
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.3%.
The war in Ukraine, sparked by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, has already killed thousands of people and driven around 3.6 million abroad, according to data from the United Nations.
Western leaders denounced Moscow's invasion as barbaric after talks in Brussels on Thursday, with the U.S. warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin could resort to the use of biological or chemical weapons as his campaign struggles.
Weighing on the European markets Friday was weakness in Asia overnight, with tech stocks being particularly hard hit in Hong Kong on renewed fears that many will be forced to delist in the United States.
Back in Europe, British retail sales surprisingly dropped 0.3% on the month in February, registering annual growth of 7.0%, as the country’s important retail sector struggled to bounce back from the COVID-inspired restrictions of late last year.
Also of interest will be the release of the German Ifo business climate index for March, due later in the session, as a guide of the strength of the Eurozone’s largest economy.
Oil prices stabilized at high levels Friday, with traders keeping a wary eye on the discussions between European Union countries over a potential embargo on Russian oil as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.
So far, the EU has not blocked the importation of Russian crude into the bloc, unlike the U.S., but as the war drags on, there’s likely to be a growing willingness to use Russian energy supplies as a weapon.
Elsewhere, the United States and its allies were said to be discussing a possible further coordinated release of oil from storage.
By 3:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $112.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $119.16. Both contracts were still on course for their first weekly gains in three weeks, with Brent around 10% higher and WTI up 7%.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,955.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1027.",,,,,

Investing.com – China’s JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics Inc. (HK:2618) has priced new shares for its HK$8.53 billion ($1.1 billion) capital increase. However, the shares were priced at a discount of about 10% to Thursday’s closing price of HK$23, with each share pricing at HK$20.71, according to a Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX) filing.
JD Logistics’ Hong Kong shares tumbled 13.04% to HK$20 by 12:32 AM ET (4:32 AM GMT).
The issuance was the company’s first since its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May 2021. The funds will be used to fund potential acquisitions, as well as increase cash reserves, said the company. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were the deal’s joint book-runners.
The deal also consisted of a placement of about $700 million worth of shares to JD Logistics’ parent company, JD.com Inc. (HK:9618), and about $400 million in a primary share sale, according to Thursday’s filings. JD.com holds a 63.5% stake in  JD Logistics  .
Of stocks on offer, 80% went to the top 15 investors who bid during the bookbuild, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The deal was the also first follow-on share sale in Hong Kong since Feb. 21 and was also the biggest since  Sunac  China Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:1918) $580 million top-up placement in January 2022. It is also the third-largest follow-on deal in Asia and fifth globally in 2022 to date, according to Refinitiv data.
It also comes came amid continued volatility in Asia Pacific shares, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index down 6.5% in 2022 to date."

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) -Citigroup's retail unit in Mexico, known as Citibanamex, has said it hopes to define the terms of its sale in April, amid signs of intensifying interest in the bank, expected by analysts to fetch between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Citi country head Manuel Romo told reporters on Wednesday the unit would open its ""data room"" next month to those it thinks meet the necessary requirements to launch a bid for the bank, which Citi chief executive Jane Fraser announced for sale in January.
""We're doing this in a timely and appropriate manner,"" Romo said in a press conference ahead of the country's annual banking convention, which is taking place in Acapulco for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit.
Earlier this week, Mexican bank Banorte said that, if it decided to go forward with a bid, it would invite ""all Mexicans"" to take part in the purchase.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he wants to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the bank.
On Thursday, Lopez Obrador said he ""will not put up any obstacles"" to the sale but underscored that his preference would be for the bank to be in Mexican hands.
Lopez Obrador has mentioned several Mexican magnates, such as Ricardo Salinas, who controls Banco Azteca, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez of Banorte as potential buyers. 
In February, Romo said that Citibanamex could be sold directly or through an initial public offering, but that the bank wasn't open to selling it piecemeal.
He said the sale, which could take up to two years, had received interest from banks and non-banks, both local and foreign. 

Analysts have priced Citibanamex from $4 billion to $8 billion, though Citi, which acquired the bank for $12.5 billion in 2001, has yet to put a price tag on it.
Paco Ybarra, chief executive officer of the Institutional Clients Group at Citi, will steer the sale from New York, Romo said Wednesday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with investors continuing to calculate the resilience of the global economic recovery to risks from both a tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy and the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.01% by 10:20 PM ET (2:20 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day showing that the Tokyo consumer price index (CPI) for March 2022 grew 1.3%, and the Tokyo core CPI grew 0.8%, year-on-year. The CPI Tokyo excluding food and energy grew 0.2% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.40%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.06% and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.13%.
The impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, including elevated and volatile raw-material costs, continues. The U.S. also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could resort to dangerous methods, such as using biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, as his military campaign struggles and Western sanctions continue to bite.
The gap between the Fed’s recent hawkish stance and the Bank of Japan’s more dovish stance has sapped the yen, which is near a six-year low against the dollar. Yen weakness could also potentially spur yuan depreciation, according to Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA strategist Albert Edwards.
Global shares are set to record their first consecutive weekly gains in 2022, a sign of cautious optimism that economic growth will weather the conflict in Ukraine, high inflation, and the Fed’s monetary policy moves.
The Fed’s steps to contain inflation are “what ultimately will drive a more aggressive inversion of the curve, which we think is coming quite quickly,” Columbia Threadneedle Investments global head of fixed income Gene Tannuzzo told Bloomberg.
That doesn’t necessarily signal a recession, since “this is a very different cycle and the first one in over 30 years where the Fed is playing catch-up to inflation,” he added.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Thursday that he is “comfortable” with hiking interest rates in quarter-point increments and was “open” to a 50 basis-point move if needed.
Meanwhile, although the U.S. 10-year yield was still near levels last seen in 2019, key parts of the U.S. Treasury yield curve continue to flatten or are inverted. The moves are leading to debate as to whether the bond market is signaling a steep economic slowdown or even a recession ahead.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note is set for its biggest quarterly advance since 1984.
While the price action in Treasuries has been brutal, that does not mean a decades-long bull market in bonds is over, DeCarley Trading founder Carley Garner told Bloomberg.
“Inflation is the story now, but inflation has tended to be something that can change very quickly. It spikes and then it violently and quickly reverses the other way and generally triggers a recession while we’re at it,” she said."

It was also the third-largest follow-on deal in Asia and fifth globally this year, according to Refinitiv data.
The share sale came despite ongoing volatility in regional equities markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down 6.5% this year.
The top 15 investors who bid during the bookbuild were allocated 80% of the stock that was on offer, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to discuss the deal.

(Reuters) -Meta Platforms Inc will make it easier for brands to run three-dimensional ads on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram social media platforms through a new partnership with an ecommerce technology firm.
The integration with VNTANA will allow brands to upload the 3D models of their products to Facebook and Instagram and easily convert them into ads, VNTANA said on Thursday in a press release. 
The move is a stepping stone into advertising in the metaverse, said VNTANA Chief Executive Ashley Crowder, referring to the futuristic idea of a collection of virtual worlds that can be accessed through devices such as headsets.
Meta has staked its future on contributing to the building of the metaverse, which it has said could take up to a decade to be realized.
Meta previously partnered with augmented reality (AR) companies Modiface and PerfectCorp to help beauty and cosmetic brands more easily run 3D and AR advertising.
""The metaverse is basically the spatial internet,"" Crowder said. ""It is a whole world of possibility that starts with having the right 3D models of your products.""
Facebook and Instagram users who see a 3D ad while browsing on their desktop or phone can interact with an image of a handbag, for instance, and move it around to view the item from all angles.

""In a way, this offers a glimpse of what you might expect on future devices like AR glasses,"" said Chris Barbour, director of augmented reality partnerships at Meta's Reality Labs unit.
Before VNTANA's integration with Meta, advertisers would need to reformat 3D files to be compatible with Meta's ad systems. Now, brands can use VNTANA to easily upload and convert the files into ads without technical expertise in working with 3D images, Crowder said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes rallied more than 1% on Thursday, extending the market's recent rebound, as investors snapped up beaten-down shares of chipmakers and big growth names and as oil prices dropped.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's stock gained 9.8%, leading a rally across the chip sector and hitting its highest level since mid-January.  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) climbed 6.9%, and both stocks helped to boost the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

The three major indexes have rallied in six of the last eight sessions, with all three having rebounded after the S&P 500 and the Dow confirmed they are in correction and the Nasdaq established it is in a bear market.
""The bear market was the dip to buy,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about $50 million in assets under management. ""People finally said hey, this is a good entry point.""

124,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Thirty of the world's largest financial institutions are undermining their commitment to cutting carbon emissions by lobbying against climate regulation and by funding new fossil fuel projects, according to a report published on Friday.
The report, from London-based energy and climate think-tank InfluenceMap, found that all 30 institutions are members of industry associations ""that have consistently lobbied to weaken key sustainable finance policies"" in the European Union, Britain and the United States. 
These policies are designed to boost transparency around financing environmentally harmful activities including fossil fuels.
One well-known activist investor and climate campaigner said the behaviour amounted to ""greenwashing"". 
""Any bank making a Net Zero promise whilst actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation – such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers' emissions and climate action plans – is greenwashing,"" Chris Hohn, the billionaire founder of hedge fund TCI, said in a quote provided by InfluenceMap. 
""Shareholders should vote against the directors of banks who are hiding their exposure to climate risk.""
Many banks have committed to a 'Net Zero' 2050 target and several have promised to reduce their direct greenhouse gas emissions, as well as those of their clients, to keep the rise in global temperatures from pre-industrial levels below 1.5 degrees celsius.
Those that are members of the United Nations-convened Net Zero Banking Alliance, which includes global banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC, have also begun to announce specific targets for lowering their financed emissions in industries such as oil and gas by 2030. 
Some experts have called the targets a good start and argue that lenders will need to continue working with fossil fuel giants during the energy transition. Many activists say the pledges do not go anywhere near far enough.
InfluenceMap said that though many banks have committed to substantial decarbonisation targets, few have adopted ""meaningful fossil fuel exclusion policies"". 
It calculated that of the 30 financial firms it examined, their banking arms collectively facilitated at least $740 billion in primary financing to fossil fuel-related businesses in 2020 and 2021. This was mostly through corporate lending and bond underwriting. 

""These global financial institutions have significant economic and political influence, and they are delaying action that is essential to respond to the climate crisis,"" said Eden Coates, the report's author. 
""If they are serious about achieving their net zero targets, they should set concrete and actionable short-term targets across all aspects of their operations.""

Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers also faced tech issues on Monday due to domain name system (DNS) issues, according to Bloomberg News.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday told appellate judges that video game maker Epic Games had failed to show any legal error that would justify them overturning a lower-court ruling that found key App Store policies do not break U.S. antitrust law.
Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.
Following the ruling, Epic appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Apple in its reply on Thursday said Epic had failed to propose a reasonable alternative to the App Store policies.
""Epic asks the Judiciary to fundamentally change the App Store by forcing Apple to abandon the integrated distribution and digital-content delivery model that, among many other procompetitive benefits, helps safeguard user security and privacy,"" the court filing said.
Both Apple and Epic are scheduled to file a second round of arguments before the appeals panel calls a hearing, for possibly next year.
In support of Epic's appeal, attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia said in January that Apple is stifling competition through its mobile app store.
Outside arguments in support of Apple are due next Thursday.

Experts and critics of the lower-court decision have said it is striking that the judge found Apple had broken California's unfair competition law but not federal antitrust law.
Similarly, Apple in its cross-appeal on Thursday questioned how it could be held liable under state law if its practices were not found illegal under federal law.

(Reuters) - Workers at  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY)'s second largest U.S. manufacturing plant voted against unionizing, even as unionization efforts have gained momentum among low-paid workers at large U.S. corporations.
The Hershey plant, located at the foot of the Blue Ridge mountains in Stuarts Draft, Virginia, has around 1,400 employees and primarily makes products with peanuts, including Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and other candy bars like Almond Joy.
Hershey in the lead up to the vote, whose counting and preliminary result were live-streamed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday, created a website to state it did not want a union at the 40-year-old plant. 
The website highlighted Hershey's perceived risks associated with unionization, including compromising its ability to recruit workers. It also pointed to the plants being open when a few rivals had furloughed employees during the pandemic.
Two Hershey workers interviewed by Reuters, one of whom was recently fired after 14 years at the Virginia plant, said it was difficult to get time off work and they sometimes had to work seven days straight.
One of the workers, who requested anonymity due to potential retaliation, said forming a union was not about money and benefits but being treated with respect and dignity.
Hershey, whose two out of seven U.S. plants are unionized, also said most people who left the plant said they did so due to a lack of time-off rather than pay. It added its attendance policy ""needed some work"" and a team was looking at simplifying rules related to time-off and absences.

Hershey and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM) did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the result.
A few Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops, however, have unionized in the past few weeks, while workers at King Soopers and Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s cereal plant have gone on strikes in recent months to secure better contracts.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's surprise political deal with the smaller left-leaning New Democrats will lead to heftier deficits and threatens to upend the Liberal government's promise to rein in runaway inflation, economists said.
Trudeau on Tuesday announced a rare written ""supply-and-confidence"" agreement that will see the NDP prop up his minority government until 2025 in exchange for more social spending.
Top of the list is a dental-care program for low-income Canadians and a national prescription drug plan, both of which will likely be costly, permanent spending initiatives, economists said. Details of the two programs should emerge in the federal budget due to be presented next month.
With the Canadian economy already at capacity and price pressures mounting, incremental spending - even if merited - could complicate efforts to keep inflation expectations moored, said Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at Scotiabank. 
""The finance minister risks further undermining Ottawa's credibility in its commitment to tackling inflation,"" she said. 
Young expects the pact, which has been denounced by the main opposition Conservatives, will lead to an additional C$15 billion-C$20 billion ($12 billion-$16 billion) in government spending over the life of the three-year deal and potentially C$40 billion in total by fiscal 2026-2027.
The jump in tax revenue resulting from surging inflation will likely mask much of the new spending in the near term, she said, but the deal could add half a percentage point to structural deficits over the medium term.
Fitch Ratings stripped Canada of one of its coveted triple-A credit ratings in June 2020. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service still give Canadian debt their highest ratings.
The federal government's COVID-19 pandemic support programs have already pushed Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio to a projected peak of 48.0% in 2021/2022 from 30.9% in 2018/2019. It could decline more slowly from there due to the increased spending.
""It does look like it would open the pocket books at the federal level,"" said Pedro Antunes, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada.
Canada, like other countries globally, is grappling with red-hot inflation, which hit a three-decade high of 5.7% in February. At the same time, businesses are scrambling to hire enough workers to meet booming demand.
New federal dental and prescription drug programs would require more specialized workers, who may demand higher wages, which could then create another round of inflation, Antunes said. 
""We can start getting to that vicious spiral that we don't want to be in,"" Antunes said. 
DEFENSE SPENDING
The Liberals pledged C$78 billion in stimulus over three years during last year's election campaign. The NDP's platform had priced a national drug plan at C$38.5 billion over five years and C$11 billion for dental coverage.
Spending under the deal will likely look quite different. 
With Canada's economy firing on all cylinders, analysts say the center-left Liberals should be focused on balancing the budget rather than adding stimulus so businesses do not grow concerned about the possibility of higher taxes.
""The right path is to grow the economy to pay for new spending measures – not the other way around,"" said Robert Asselin, senior vice president of policy at the Business Council of Canada. 
Adding to swelling expenses is the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which may prompt Canada to boost defense spending.
""Our investments in our Canadian Armed Forces will continue to increase and we will have more to say about this at the appropriate time,"" said Trudeau, speaking at a summit in Brussels to address the Ukraine crisis. 

Trudeau said his deal with the NDP will not impact defense spending plans.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have to change their core business practices in Europe as EU countries and EU lawmakers on Thursday clinched a deal on landmark rules to curb their powers.
France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet that there was a provisional agreement after eight hours of talks. 
EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a tweet that the deal would ensure fair and open digital markets.
""What we want is simple: fair markets also in digital. Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefit of competitive digital markets,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the rules just over a year ago, said in a statement.
""This means that the time of long antitrust cases, during which the authorities were lagging behind the big tech companies, is over,"" said EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who had steered the debate in the European Parliament.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out rules for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access.
It will cover gatekeepers in online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, video-sharing services, web browsers and virtual assistants.
Under the DMA, the tech giants will have to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data. Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms. 
The rules prohibit the companies from favoring their own services over rivals' or preventing users from removing pre-installed software or apps.
The DMA will apply to companies with a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros, 7.5 billion euros in annual turnover and at least 45 million monthly users. 
Companies face hefty fines up to 10% of their annual global turnover for breaching the rules and as much as 20% for repeat offences.
Apple, which has lobbied intensively against the DMA, reiterated its worries.
""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in a statement.

Google, which also cranked up its lobbying in the last year, echoed the same sentiments.
""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans. We'll now take some time to study the final text, talk with the regulator and work out what we need to do to comply,"" it said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Battery swapping - replacing a depleted battery with a freshly charged one - is not new: The first experiments with exchanging batteries in electric cars date to America's Gilded Age in the late 1890s, according to industrial historian David A. Kirsch.
Here is a timeline of key events in the development of battery swapping:
1896: Auto pioneers consider the exchange of depleted batteries with fresh ones as a way to extend the operating range of early rudimentary electric vehicles, from streetcars to delivery trucks.
1912:  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co teams up with local partners in Connecticut to launch a ""battery service"" that enables electric vehicle owners to swap batteries for a modest monthly fee and a variable per-mile charge. Other similar services spring up in large cities. Semi-mechanized swaps take as little as three minutes at some stations. And by separating the battery from the vehicle, the service helps lower the initial cost by a third or more.
1924: General Electric's GeVeCo battery service is discontinued. Waning demand for electric vehicles and the lack of interest in industry-wide battery standardization stall further development of electric vehicle battery swapping for more than 80 years.
2007: Silicon Valley startup Better Place develops a ""battery switching"" process and signs up Renault-Nissan for pilot projects in several countries. 
2008: The Beijing Olympics showcase a fleet of 50 electric buses featuring swappable batteries. China's Wanxiang demonstrates an electric bus with swappable batteries at the Games.
2010: Better Place is invited to meet with officials of the state-owned China Grid to discuss battery swapping. China Grid ends the talks without a deal.
2013: The same issues that helped kill the decades-earlier GeVeCo serefvice, notably lack of interest by consumers and vehicle manufacturers, catch up to Better Place. After raising - and burning through - more than $600 million in investors' money in just six years, the company files for bankruptcy.

2013: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) offers a limited battery swap service for the new Model S, which was designed from the start to accommodate swappable batteries. The swapping process is arduous (""a pain in the ass,"" recalls a former Tesla executive) and the pilot program is quietly retired in 2015. Tesla CEO Elon Musk orders his team instead to turn its attention instead to building out a proprietary network of charging stations called ""superchargers.""
2014: Nio (NYSE:NIO) is established in China, with satellite operations in the United States and Europe. In 2017, it announces a plan to offer customers the option of swappable batteries, a service that it begins in 2018.

(Reuters) - While swappable batteries are slow-burners in the electric car market, they have been a quick hit for e-scooters and e-bikes, making it easier and cheaper for rental companies to keep the small vehicles available on city streets. 
But the fast-growing micromobility industry faces a bottleneck as companies, reluctant to relinquish their own tech secret sauce, resist widespread standardization of batteries, a development that could turbocharge efficiency.
When e-scooters first hit the streets in large numbers a few years ago, major providers like Dott and Tier had to shove their scooters into vans daily and haul them to suburban warehouses to charge overnight - adding to urban congestion and meaning those scooters were not out on the streets ready to rent. 
Most major providers have since adopted swappable batteries in a global micromobility market where revenue was under $3 billion in 2019 before the pandemic hit and could hit $10 billion in 2025, according to industry estimates.
""Swappable batteries have been a game changer for us,"" said Tinia Muehlfenzl, vice president of market development for Berlin-based Tier. ""We didn't have to collect the entire scooter anymore to charge them, we could do it right there on the street."" 
Micromobility providers now send out crews on electric cargo bikes or in electric vans to swap batteries during the day. That keeps the scooters or bikes in circulation and cuts down on congestion.
In London, Dott workers like Zhelyo Kolev, who travels around in an electric Maxus van, say they can check tires and brakes or undertake minor repairs while replacing batteries in seconds.
Swappable batteries are now such a feature of Europe's micromobility landscape that cities look favorably on them in tenders for operators to launch e-scooter and e-bike services because they reduce congestion and emissions.
TECH DILEMMA
But like major automakers, some e-scooter and e-bike providers have little desire to give up their own battery technology in the interest of standardization, which would enable large public swapping stations where consumers could swap out their own batteries. 
The process is easier for batteries that can weigh around 5 kg, a fraction of those in electric car batteries which can weigh 500 kg. 
Tier's Muehlfenzl said the company was in favor of standardization. But she acknowledged that for everyone, Tier included, giving up their own battery technology for a common industry standard is tough and will take time to agree on. 
""It would be very tricky because, where would you start and where would you end?"" she said. ""You'd need to apply your own infrastructure to standards you don't own and maybe don't know.""

Mina Nada, chief executive of Zoomo, an Australian provider of electric delivery bikes, said that increasing regulation and industry consolidation would likely lead to more standardized e-bike batteries - or at least standardized charging systems.
""It's going to be difficult to get to complete standardization,"" he added. ""But I also see a path toward consolidation and less variability than what we have today.""

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - A consortium comprising investors Todd Boehly, Hansjorg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein has been shortlisted in the auction for English Premier League club Chelsea, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Chelsea was put up for sale by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stating proceeds would go to charity. He was sanctioned by Britain this month, so the winning bidder for Chelsea would need to be greenlighted by the government.
The value of the offer made by the group led by Boehly -- a former Guggenheim Partners president whose investment firm Elridge now invests in several businesses -- could not be learned. 
Other bidders are expecting to hear back from U.S. bank Raine Group, which is overseeing the sale, on whether they had made a narrowed shortlist, sources said. Bid revisions have slowed the process.
The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the consortium led by private equity veterans Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own sport teams including the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, also made the shortlist. They would have to divest their 40% stake in Crystal Palace, another English football team, were their bid for Chelsea to succeed. 
Saudi Media have not made the shortlist, an advisor to the group told Reuters, while Sky News reported that other bidders including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, had also been eliminated.
Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns AC Milan, has joined the Nick Candy-led Blue Football consortium as a ""minor investor"" in their bid for Chelsea, sources close to the bid said.
Elliott has injected a ""multi-million pound sum"" into the bid, the sources told Reuters. 
British property developer Candy's bid was increased on Monday after being joined by ""another large Korean financial institution"", the parties said in a statement, with sources adding the consortium grew further on Thursday. 
Elliott bought AC Milan in 2018 and has since helped the Italian giants become much more competitive in Serie A. The team is topping the standings, chasing their first league title in 11 years.
Candy had initially been joined in his consortium by South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited before the new investors got on board.
SAUDI MEDIA MISS OUT
An advisor to Saudi Media Group told Reuters their bid for Chelsea had been rejected and they had been informed by Raine that they were not on the shortlist.
They added that the bid, which was headed by businessman Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is reported to be a season ticket holder at Chelsea, would be open to linking up with another consortium that does make the shortlist.
Sources close to the process said Chelsea do not want to deal with Saudi money due to potential complications and controversy which could add an extra hurdle to a fast-track sale.
Others who have made their offers public include Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family as well as the pairing of former Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton and World Athletics President Sebastian Coe.

London-based global investment firm Centricus also said they had offered to buy Chelsea, a move driven by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie, who are reported to be season-ticket holders.

NZME, which owns the New Zealand Herald, also said it was in discussions with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms over various digital projects for next year.
New Zealand's news publishers association had sought approval to collectively bargain with Meta Platforms and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit Google for fair payments, but NZME chose to engage with the tech giants directly. 
NZME will enter a 90-day period of negotiation with Google to finalise key terms of the proposed supply of its news content to Google's News Showcase and other news products, it said on Friday. 
The final deal was intended to be for a minimum of five years.
The company's portfolio includes several regional newspapers, as well as radio channels and online websites.

The House vote is symbolic, as the debate will show how much House GOP support there is for cannabis. Cannabis legislation is not about the House, it is all about the Senate. No matter what happens in the House next week, it cannot force the Senate to act.
According to Jaret Seiberg from Cowen, the Senate won't take up the MORE Act as there are not the votes there to legalize cannabis. He anticipates nearly every Democrat to back the MORE Act, while Republicans decision is unclear, as the MORE Act includes social justice provisions that some Republicans may oppose.
Around the sector, Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) gained 22%,  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) gained 11%, and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) gained 23%.
Seiberg said they are more interested in the debate than the actual vote, as it will show how many Republicans support legalization even if they object to the MORE Act, noting that there is a high probability that Republicans will control the House next year. Seiberg highlighted the possibility of the House going Republican but Democrats managing to keep control of the Senate, which would mean there would be a path for cannabis legislation next year.
Seiberg doesn't view this vote as impacting the future of the SAFE Act on cannabis banking, with House Democrats knowing the Senate wont legalize and viewing SAFE as the best opportunity to enact a cannabis bill. SAFE gets broader Senate GOP support as it is also framed as a public safety bill, which makes Seiberg believe SAFE remains likely to become law in this Congress. Regarding the question of it expanding to include capital markets access, Seiberg sees a window for such a deal though it may depend on macro threats like Russia and inflation to ease. Otherwise, Congress may be too distracted, which means a narrower SAFE Act is more probable.

The negotiators are scheduled to meet on Monday, said B.K. White, first vice president of USW Local 12-5, which represents about 500 workers at Chevron's Richmond, California, refinery, who went on strike on Monday.
""We look forward to joining USW Local 5 in discussions next week and at work again soon,"" Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich said.
Workers were removed from the refinery on Sunday by Chevron after Local 12-5 issued a strike notice to the company following the collapse of talks after union members twice rejected company contract proposals.
The strike began shortly after 12 a.m. PDT on Monday. The previous contract expired on Feb. 1, but was being extended on a rolling 24-hour basis.

The local sought an additional 5% pay increase on top of a 12% raise over four years negotiated by USW International officials and oil refinery owners in February. 
The additional 5% would mostly offset increases in healthcare costs for union members in the San Francisco Bay-area, which has a higher cost of living, union officials have said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Thursday as chip stocks led a broad-based rally in tech and the strongest jobless claims report in decades pointed to underlying strength in the economy.
S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 244 points, the Nasdaq rose 1.2%.
Chip stocks jumped more than 4%, led by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the latter's chief executive Jensen Huang said the company would be interesting in using Intel to source its chips.
Some on Wall Street are skeptical, pointing out that Nvidia is unlikely to risk its competitive edge by allowing a rival to produce its chips. 
“[W]e see little likelihood that NVDA would choose to fab prominent products at arguably its most significant competitor's facilities, a choice that would provide Intel with an early look at NVDA's future chip design,” Wedbush said in a note.
The broader tech sector was also helped by ongoing strength in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) after the social media giant confirmed plans to build a hyperscale data center in the north Kansas City area.
Sentiment on risk assets was also supported by data pointing to economic strength as jobless claims fell to its lowest level since 1989.
“It [the labor market] is extremely strong and this data is exactly the sort of evidence that has given the Fed confidence that they can raise rates more quickly to battle inflation,” Jefferies said in a note.
Durable goods orders, however, fell by a more than expected 2.2% last month, though economists were quick to downplay the weakness, estimating a rebound was likely ahead.
“It seems reasonable, given firms’ sky-high investment spending intentions, to think that March will see a clear rebound,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The backdrop of stronger economic data offset rising geopolitical tensions as the U.S. and its allies look to further isolate Russia as the latter’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine rolls into the fifth week.   
Biden said the U.S. would respond if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, and called on Russia to be booted out of the G20.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), meanwhile, surged 4% after the ride-sharing company said it struck a partnership to add New York taxis to its app.
On the meme stock front, GameStop (NYSE:GME) took a breather from its recent melt-up to remain on a course to snap a seven-day rally.
Cannabis stocks, meanwhile, were also in the ascendency, led by Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) after The U.S. House of Representatives confirmed reports it is set to vote on a bill to federally legalize marijuana next week. A version of the bill previously passed the House in December 2020, but failed to advance in a majority GOP Senate.  ",,,

Investing.com – Stocks finished higher on Thursday lifted by chip stocks as oil prices fell and President Joe Biden met with NATO allies on the situation in Ukraine.
Biden said the allies would respond to Russia if it used chemical weapons on Ukraine, which it invaded one month ago today. The president also called for Russia to be removed from the G-20 group of countries.
The allies, which met in Brussels, agreed to shore up their forces in Eastern Europe to hold Russia at bay. They are sending more aid to Ukraine and trying to raise the pressure on Russia with economic and other sanctions.
In the, U.S. new data showed last week’s claims for unemployment reached a low not seen since 1969, as the Federal Reserve starts out on a series of interest rate hikes to calm hotter than expected inflation.
Some Fed officials want more aggressive action on rates, raising them at half-point increments rather than the customary quarter-point hike such as the Fed did last week. But others on the policy committee cautioned against being too aggressive. 
Reuters reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seek payment in rubles for gas sold to ""unfriendly"" countries, comments that rocked energy markets, but Europeans like Italy’s president, said they would continue to pay in euros.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Biden in Europe
Biden told reporters at a press conference in Brussels that he was also working to ensure China doesn’t come to Russia’s aid, saying he has talked to President Xi Jinping and emphasized the severe consequences if China were to help. China’s economic interests, Biden said, were more focused on the West than Russia. 
On Friday, Biden travels to Poland, a NATO member that has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees.
2. Fed outlook
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Thursday that the central bank needs to raise rates this year and next to tame inflation before it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But he also said the Fed should be cautious.
""I just think that we want to be careful"" not to raise interest rates too abruptly, and instead take the time to assess whether supply chains are improving and how the war in Ukraine is affecting the economy, Reuters reported him saying.
3. Uber moves
 Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) will begin listing New York City taxis on its app, a change in direction for the ride-hailing giant, which for years has faced opposition from taxi groups. 
The change in course comes as part of a deal with Creative Mobile and Curb to offer more transportation options. It also helps to ease the company's struggles with driver availability.

(Reuters) -U.S. stocks rose following choppy trading abroad on Thursday, and oil prices pulled back, as investors watched Western leaders present a unified front against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Technology companies lifted U.S. stock indexes after a sharp fall in the previous session, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite up 269.24 points, or nearly 2%, to 14,191.84.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 349.44 points, or about 1%, to 34,707.94 and the S&P 500 gained 63.92 points, or 1.43%, to 4,520.16.
The pan-European STOXX Europe 600 index ticked down 0.2% and MSCI's main world stocks index, which no longer includes Russian companies, gained 0.71%.
Western leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday agreed to strengthen their forces in Eastern Europe, increase military aid to Ukraine and tighten their sanctions on Russia as Moscow's assault on its neighbour entered its second month.
As world leaders committed to additional economic pressures, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) chairman Larry Fink said in a letter Thursday to shareholders of his $10 trillion firm that near-global economic and political isolation of Russia by many governments and businesses ""has put an end to the globalization we have experienced over the last three decades"".
The dollar rose for the fourth time in the past five sessions, as economic data on the U.S. labor market helped firm expectations that the Fed will be more aggressive in taking steps to curb inflation. 
The dollar index rose 0.15%, with the euro down 0.05% to $1.099.
""The sharp hawkish repricing of Fed rate hike expectations has mainly benefited the U.S. dollar against low yielding currencies whose own domestic central banks are expected to lag well behind the Fed in tightening policy,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman wrote in a note to clients. 
HAWKISH
U.S. Treasuries resumed their sell-off Thursday, driving bond yields higher, also prodded by the fresh labor market data and pressure on the Fed to hike rates.
Top Federal Reserve policymakers have all week signalled they stood ready to take more aggressive action to bring down decades-high inflation, including a possible half-percentage-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in May. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari added on Thursday he has pencilled in seven quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, but warned against going too far.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was up 4.2 basis points to 2.363%; the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 1.3 basis points at 2.126%. 
Crude prices slid around 3% on Thursday after the European Union could not agree on a plan to boycott Russian oil and on reports that exports from Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal could partially resume.
After rising more than 5% on Wednesday, U.S. crude fell 3.13% to $111.33 per barrel and Brent was at $118.01, down nearly 3% on the day.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) market analysts estimated that it would take a sustained oil price increase to $200 per barrel to produce an income shock similar in magnitude to those that precipitated U.S. recessions in the 1970s.

""While we cannot rule out such an outcome, $200 is considerably above our commodity team’s upside-risk estimate of $165,"" they wrote in a note late on Wednesday. 
Gold rose to a more than one-week high on Thursday as concerns over soaring prices and uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine lifted bullion's appeal as a safe-haven and an inflation hedge. Spot gold added 0.9% to $1,961.43 an ounce.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) reached an $80 million settlement with Ohio to resolve environmental damage allegedly caused by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, made by the company's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) business, the state attorney general said on Thursday.
The funds from the German company, which did not admit liability, will be used for environmental cleanup, the attorney general said.
Monsanto, which Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) acquired for $63 billion in 2018, never manufactured PCBs in Ohio or discharged them into Ohio waterways, Bayer said in a statement.
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and were used in carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. They were outlawed by the U.S. government in 1979 after being linked to cancer. 
Bayer has been trying to resolve a number of lawsuits related to Monsanto's PCBs, which were used in commercial products from 1935 until 1977, when Monsanto voluntarily ceased production. 
In addition to reaching legal settlements with states, the company reached a $648 million proposed class action settlement with about 2,500 cities and other local governments eligible as members of the class. Last week the agreement received preliminary approval from a federal judge. 
Class members must decide whether to support the deal, object to the terms or opt out and pursue their own case, as the city of Los Angeles did earlier this month.
Bayer can withdraw from the settlement if more than 2% of the class members opt out.

Bayer also faces personal injury cases stemming from PCB exposure. 
Two separate juries last year awarded a combined $247 million in damages stemming from exposure in a school in Washington state. Bayer said the evidence showed the plaintiffs were not exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs and the company said it planned to appeal both verdicts. (This story corrects paragraphs 5 and 6 to show there are about 2,500 members eligible for the class action, not thousands of separate lawsuits)

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday fueled by a rally in chip stocks against the backdrop of a day of intense diplomacy in Brussels, where the U.S. is trying to cajole Europe into putting more economic pressure on Russia to stop its war in Ukraine.
By 4:18 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 349 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4% and NASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%. All of the three main cash indices had faltered on Wednesday after a week of solid gains; the market has digested the risk of faster monetary policy tightening and the prospect of a global economic slowdown due to the war in Ukraine.
President Joe Biden is attending summits of both NATO and the G7 and will also be at a meeting of EU leaders later in the day, which may or may not yield fresh sanctions on purchases of Russian energy exports. The meetings are taking place a month to the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, triggering sharp sell-offs in equity markets and an equally sharp squeeze in oil, metals, and agricultural commodities - all of which are heavily influenced by the availability (or otherwise) of Russian exports. Newsflow from the battlefield continues to show intense fighting, with Russia claiming to have captured Izyum, an important rail junction town near Kharkiv, and Ukrainian forces crippling at least one Russian landing ship that was supplying the troops besieging the port city of Mariupol.
The domestic news slate, by contrast, is relatively thin, although more Federal Reserve officials will weigh in with fresh comments on the need to tighten monetary policy further. Jobless claims for last week hit a low not seen since 1969.
Washington's focus remains on the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Crude oil futures turned lower, as the tough fighting and the prospect of extra Western help for Ukraine coming out of the day's summits increased the likelihood of the conflict dragging on. Any sign of further restrictions on European buying will force importers to chase barrels elsewhere on the global market. French major TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) said late on Wednesday that it, too, will stop buying Russian crude by the end of the year, after coming under intense pressure for not announcing that step at the same time as Shell (LON:RDSa), BP (NYSE:BP) and other European companies. The company still intends to buy Russian gas, however.

LONDON (Reuters) - Buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management said on Thursday it would liquidate every fund where Mikhail Fridman's investment group LetterOne had any interest as it seeks to sever ties with the sanctioned Russian tycoon. 
LetterOne is one of Pamplona's limited partners (LP) and was set up almost a decade ago by Fridman and Petr Aven.
The pair stepped down from LetterOne in early March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but Pamplona decided to part ways with the firm to safeguard its portfolio companies from the fallout of the war.
The buyout firm, which has offices in London and New York, said it would wind down three funds linked to LetterOne, adding the decision had been approved by its board and would be effective on March 25. 

""Such a process is irrevocable and will be conducted in accordance with all legal and regulatory mandates as required,"" Pamplona said in a statement.
It added that the wind down could be executed via the sale of LP interests to third parties as well as through the sale of direct investments.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Thursday as chip stocks and the strongest jobless claims report in decades triggered a sea of green on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.02%, or 349 points, the Nasdaq rose 1.93%.
Chip stocks (NASDAQ:SOXX) jumped more than 5%, led by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the latter's chief executive Jensen Huang said the company would be interesting in using Intel to source its chips.
Some on Wall Street are skeptical, pointing out that Nvidia is unlikely to risk its competitive edge by allowing a rival to produce its chips. 
“[W]e see little likelihood that NVDA would choose to fab prominent products at arguably its most significant competitor's facilities, a choice that would provide Intel with an early look at NVDA's future chip design,” Wedbush said in a note.
The broader tech sector was also helped by ongoing strength in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) after the social media giant confirmed plans to build a hyperscale data center in the north Kansas City area.
Sentiment on risk assets was also supported by data pointing to economic strength as jobless claims fell to their lowest level since 1969.
“It [the labor market] is extremely strong and this data is exactly the sort of evidence that has given the Fed confidence that they can raise rates more quickly to battle inflation,” Jefferies said in a note.
Fed officials have been backing Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks hinting at the prospect of the 50-basis-point rate hikes at meetings later this year.  
Durable goods orders, however, fell by a more than expected 2.2% last month, though economists were quick to downplay the weakness, estimating a rebound was likely ahead.
“It seems reasonable, given firms’ sky-high investment spending intentions, to think that March will see a clear rebound,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The backdrop of stronger economic data offset rising geopolitical tensions as the U.S. and its allies look to further isolate Russia as the latter’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine rolls into the fifth week.   
Biden said the U.S. would respond if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, and called on Russia to be booted out of the G20.

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is planning to pick  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) as the lead underwriter on the initial public offering of Arm Ltd that could value the British chip designing company at as much as $60 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The IPO preparations come after SoftBank's deal to sell Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp for $40 billion collapsed last month because of objections from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. SoftBank has said it will now likely list Arm on Nasdaq by March 2023.
SoftBank interviewed investment banks for Arm's IPO in the last few weeks and asked them to commit to providing a credit line as part of their commitments, the sources said. It could not be learned how much Goldman Sachs offered for a credit line.
Bloomberg News reported last month that SoftBank was asking banks for an $8 billion margin loan tied to Arm's IPO stock. 
The sources, who requested anonymity because the preparations are confidential, cautioned that SoftBank's plans were subject to market conditions and it may choose not to proceed with the deal. SoftBank, Arm and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
SoftBank took Arm, whose technology powers Apple's iPhone and nearly all other smartphones, private in 2016 for $32 billion.
Arm's net sales surged 40% to $2 billion in the nine months to December amid high demand for chips, SoftBank has said. While this bodes well for the IPO, it may still not make SoftBank whole for the lost Nvidia deal in the short term. This is because a rally in Nvidia shares had led to Arm being worth more than $80 billion at one point under their cash-and-stock merger agreement. 
""We will aim for the biggest IPO ever in semiconductor history,"" SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors last month about Arm's listing. While SoftBank is likely to list Arm in the U.S., it is yet to finalize the venue of the flotation, the sources cautioned.
SoftBank announced a deal to sell Arm to Nvidia in 2020, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block it late last year, arguing it would be detrimental to competition in nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips.
The transaction also faced scrutiny from regulators in Britain and the European Union and had yet to receive approval in China.

After the deal was canceled, Arm appointed Rene Haas to replace Simon Segars as chief executive. An industry veteran, Haas joined Arm in 2013 and previously worked for seven years at Nvidia.
Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd that design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers.

PARIS (Reuters) -Renault's Chief Executive Luca de Meo warned on Thursday that the automaker's retreat from Russia creates a ""very complex situation"" for the company, hitting profits and sales as it seeks to accelerate a multi-year turnaround effort.
In an internal video for employees, de Meo said  Renault  (PA:RENA) will make the security of employees a top priority as it weighs options for its Russian operations in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Renault late Wednesday said it would cut its forecast for operating profit and cash flow and is considering a 2.2 billion euro ($2.42 billion) non-cash writedown to reflect the potential costs of suspending operations in Russia.
Renault is in the early stages of a restructuring its operations to be competitive as it shifts to electric vehicles. In February, the company reported its first annual profit in three years and said it was aiming to improve operating profit margins for this year to 3% or better.
As the global carmaker with the greatest exposure to Russia, Renault has more to lose than many other Western companies. Investors have wiped 40% off its market capitalization over the past month.
Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Thursday talks were under way to decide the future of the carmaker's Moscow factory with a decision due by the end of next week, potentially offering one of the first examples of what the government intends to do with Western assets
French President Emmanuel Macron said he respected Renault's decision and said companies had the choice to stay in Russia if their sector had not been hit by sanctions. 
Speaking to reporters on Thursday after a G7 and NATO conference, Macron cited a ""reputational risk"" for companies that remain. The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault. Renault's decision followed sharp criticism from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 
Renault did not give details on how it would handle a retreat from its second-biggest market, one of more than 400 companies to withdraw.
Renault shares were down as much as 2.6%% in early afternoon trade, but recovered some ground to close down 0.8%. 
Renault's Russian partner Avtovaz, which is controlled by Renault and produces the Lada and Renault car brands, said on Thursday that it would manufacture new models without imported components and would work to rebuild its supply chains. It imports about 20% of its parts and raw materials.
A decade ago, major automakers saw Russia as a promising growth market with potential to be among the world's 10 largest vehicle-buying nations. 
The latest sanctions, and earlier measures imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, have ended that dream.
A significant part of Renault's turnaround strategy relied on merging its low-cost brand Dacia and Lada into a single business unit. Lada's vehicles were to be built using Dacia's vehicle platform.
Lada was also part of Renault's cost-cutting plan and its major push into small family cars. A source close to Renault said Dacia will remain profitable even without the economies of scale from Lada brand.
""We think this strategic move will shift the attention of investors into the core operations of Renault, which have been largely restructured over the past years,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note. 

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said that a Russian exit for Renault would be a better option than a ""wait and see"" approach, even if it comes at a cost for the company.

Investing.com --  Steelcase Inc  (NYSE:SCS), the furniture company, saw its shares slide 7% Thursday after the company reported earnings that missed analyst estimates. 
After the closing bell Wednesday, the company reported a loss per share of 2 cents on revenue of $753.1 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecasted flat earnings on revenue of $752.7 million. Revenue increased 11% compared to prior year.
The company added that ""significant"" inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions continued to impact its operating results during the fourth quarter.
Compared to the prior year, Steelcase orders grew 27 percent in the fourth quarter.
""Our order growth of 27 percent this quarter reflects the investments our customers are making in their workplaces as they increasingly invite their employees back to the office and seek improved engagement, collaboration, focus and connection,"" said Sara Armbruster, Steelcase president and CEO.
At the end of the fourth quarter, the company reported its backlog of customer orders at approximately $787 million. As a result, they expect first quarter fiscal 2023 revenue to be between $680 million to $705 million.
Furthermore, Steelcase expects to report a loss per share of between 15 cents to 20 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

""Russia’s ongoing unjustified war is a heartbreaking display of brutality and a violation of the fundamental principle of freedom that we share with Ukraine,"" the company said on its website.
It added that the move would not prevent all customers in Russia from using its products as some organisations run installed software that they may be able to maintain on their own.
The withdrawal marks a change in direction as Chief Executive Christian Klein last week in a newspaper interview defended SAP's decision to still provide services to some industries in Russia such as energy, healthcare and trade that have not been directly affected by sanctions.
The move follows an appeal by Ukraine earlier this month for cloud-computing and software giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP to cut off Russia to stop Moscow's invasion.
IDC analyst Philip Carter has said that Russian companies have been largely reluctant to rely completely on cloud services for their information technology, potentially limiting the blow from SAP's move.

SAP added on Thursday it was providing its technology to multi-national organizations for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. 
Separately, German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) it was closing its activities in Russia, which mainly amount to a software development centre in Saint Petersburg that is now winding down.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Edward C. ""Ned"" Johnson 3d, an American billionaire investor and philanthropist who as chairman of Fidelity Investments propelled the family business to a dominant place in finance for decades, died on Wednesday at age 91, the company said. 
Johnson ""died peacefully on March 23, 2022, surrounded by his loving family,"" Fidelity said in a press release. A representative added Johnson died of natural causes.
Johnson led the Boston-based company founded by his father for nearly 40 years before passing the chairman's title to his daughter Abigail Johnson in 2016.
On his watch Fidelity transformed personal investing through the use of new technologies like telephone services and by promoting famous fund managers like Peter Lynch, the former manager of Magellan Fund.
In a LinkedIN post Abigail Johnson wrote that Johnson died at home in Florida and cited her father's love for his family, the stock market and sailing. ""He could be counted on to have the contrarian view on just about anything,"" she wrote.
In later years, Fidelity's actively-managed funds lost ground to cheaper passive products from rivals like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). Fidelity still ran $4.5 trillion across all its managed investment products as of its latest shareholder letter for 2021, and remained one of Boston's most important companies.
Wary of public attention, Ned Johnson rarely gave speeches and shunned media appearances even as his company came to wield huge influence as a major shareholder in many top U.S. corporations.
""We're just a simple family business,"" he said at a luncheon in Boston in 2007, dismissing yet another interview request.
Yet, he gave away millions of dollars to charities both in his native Massachusetts and worldwide. Friends described Johnson as demanding of others and of himself.
Once, in New York, Johnson made a point of holding an umbrella over guests as he walked them in the pouring rain to a Fidelity reception, recalled Charles Dornbush, a Fidelity executive in the 1990s.
""Here is a guy who is one of the wealthiest people in the world, but there is nobody he looks down at,"" Dornbush said.
A tennis enthusiast and noted collector of antiques and art, Johnson filled Fidelity's stately Boston buildings with Asian prints and sculptures and preached internally the Japanese management philosophy of Kaizen, or continuous improvement.
Edward Crosby ""Ned"" Johnson 3d was born on June 29, 1930 and graduated from Harvard University in 1954. Three years later, he joined as a research analyst at Fidelity, created in 1946 by his father, trust lawyer Edward Johnson II.
The younger Johnson soon made his mark picking stocks and by 1965 was put in charge of Fidelity's then-flagship Magellan fund where his returns beat more famous managers who followed.
He took over Fidelity in 1972, coming up with the idea of letting investors write checks on money market accounts. 
Coupled with heavy investments in telephone call centers and online trading services, the strategy positioned Fidelity as the dominant money manager during the stock market booms of the 1980s and 1990s. 
Fidelity's widely-sold mutual funds like Contrafund and retirement products would later become some of the most popular vehicles for individual investors.
Johnson also had a whimsical side. Once he teased a group of employees after discovering them flying a toy blimp in a Fidelity corridor after hours. ""He was a very down to earth guy,"" said one of those caught, Jackson Loomis.
Despite its scale Johnson kept Fidelity operations under the radar, making hardly any public appearances and creating a board dominated by insiders plus two of his three children, Abigail and son Edward C. Johnson IV. 
Fidelity's private structure gave Johnson the freedom to replace top executives at will and to make unorthodox investments like in the low-margin payroll business, which helped Fidelity gain company retirement accounts. 
But the company also lost ground to rivals BlackRock and Vanguard Group Inc that found more success with low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds.
Johnson's tight grip also meant matters like a gifts scandal involving Fidelity traders in 2003 and 2004 raised questions for Fidelity's leadership. 
Under private ownership Fidelity emerged stronger than most rivals from the financial crisis that began in 2007. In the company's annual report at the start of 2009, Johnson unloaded on fellow financial executives whose conduct, he wrote, was ""laced with toxic investment waste and the casual use of other people's money.""
Fidelity's success gave it much influence in its hometown and at a banquet in Ned Johnson's honor by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce in 2012 speakers lined up to praise his work ethic and creative approach to business.
Lynch, the storied later manager of Magellan, put his boss on the same level as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) creator Steve Jobs. Johnson, Lynch said, ""Did everything possible to make Steve Jobs look like he's asleep.""

They found that by adding the company's Full-Self Driving option, the delivery time was cut dramatically, and they could remove the $12,000 option just before delivery. In the case of a Model Y, you could get your car seven months quicker than if you ordered without FSD Capability. Tesla has caught on to this loophole and slammed the door shut.
A new update to the Tesla site added a warning to customers attempting to utilize the loophole. When a customer tries to remove the FSD option, an alert lets the customer know that delivery will be delayed if the option is removed.
Many customers will likely be upset with the change. However, it seems reasonable that Tesla would take this route to close the loophole.

MILAN (Reuters) -KKR remains interested in taking over  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) and also wants to discuss the phone group's own plans to combine its fixed line assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber, two sources said on Thursday.
KKR submitted a non-binding 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) takeover proposal for TIM in November, having already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network last year.
Italy's largest telecoms company left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before TIM's board agreed earlier in March to engage in talks.
TIM shares rose as much as 12% on Thursday to trade at just under 0.34 euros, as KKR remained in the game and other private equity firms circle with a view to investing in parts of its business under a break-up scenario for the company.
However, the stock remains well short of the 0.505 price per share at which the KKR proposal was pitched.
In a letter responding to questions from TIM on its offer, KKR stuck to a request to carry out a due diligence analysis before deciding on whether to proceed but has narrowed the scope of the information sought, the sources added.
KKR wrote it had ""positive exchanges"" with Italian authorities on its proposal, the people said.
BROADBAND PLAN
While a merger of Open Fiber was not part of KKR's plans for TIM, the fund wants to discuss with the company the antitrust implications of a such a deal and how it can create value for the FiberCop business in which KKR is already an investor, the sources said.
Grappling with fierce competition in its domestic market, debt-laden TIM has been hit by multiple downgrades by major rating agencies this month after reporting a record annual loss and a weak outlook.
In a bid to revamp the beleaguered operator, newly-appointed Chief Executive Pietro Labriola has unveiled plans to split TIM's service operations from its domestic fixed network operations to unlock value.
TIM's largest shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has slammed the KKR approach as too low and the French media group said there was ""untapped value"" in TIM.
A break-up of TIM could help revive a long-held project to merge TIM's fixed line assets with those of Open Fiber, a move advocated by state lender CDP to avoid a duplication of heavy investment needed to upgrade the country's network.

An Open Fiber merger could provide a 1 euro boost to TIM's shares according to TIM's internal calculations, sources familiar with the matter have said.
CDP owns a stake of nearly 10% in Telecom Italia and 60% in Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9099 euros)

Mercedes-Benz AG, then Daimler AG (DE:MBGn), took over a 15% stake in Kamaz from Daimler Truck in September 2021 with a view to returning it to Daimler Truck after the world's largest truckmaker was spun off from the carmaker in December.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has complicated the process.
""We are certainly not in any talks with Russian government officials at the moment,"" Daimler Truck Chief Executive Martin Daum said when asked about the future of the relationship to the Russian truckmaker at a news conference on Thursday.
""These shares can't be moved because that needs government approval,"" he said.
Approval is also needed from Russian regulators and Kamaz's other shareholders, the largest of which is Russian state conglomerate Rostec.
Mercedes-Benz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it temporarily took on the stake.
A Daimler Truck spokesperson said that while government approval was needed for such transactions in most countries, Daimler Truck was waiting on additional approvals specific to Russia.
The spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had purposefully put talks on hold, and said it was too soon to say whether it would keep the stake in the long-term.
Both Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Truck froze production in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, including Daimler Truck's cooperation with Kamaz. 

Daimler Truck and Kamaz also have a joint venture, Daimler Kamaz, formed in 2009 producing trucks, buses, and Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, with the latter forming the largest part of its revenue, according to a Daimler Truck prospectus.
Daum said he did not know whether the factory owned by the joint venture was still running. ""This factory needs parts from our side and we don't deliver those parts. Most likely it's not producing at all,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service said on Thursday it placed an initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 next-generation delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp and will double its initial planned electric vehicle (EV) purchases.
U.S. Postmaster Louis DeJoy said that based on USPS's reform efforts and ""our improving outlook, we have determined that increasing our initial electric vehicle purchase from 5,000 to 10,019 makes good sense from an operational and financial perspective.""
House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney praised the increase in EV purchases but said ""it is still not enough."" USPS still plans to buy about 80% gasoline-powered models. Maloney said USPS ""must prioritize the acquisition of electric vehicles or it will be stuck with outdated technology that further pollutes our environment for decades.""
Previously, DeJoy committed to buying at least 10% EVs as part of a multibillion-dollar plan to retire 30-year-old delivery vehicles.
USPS in February rejected a bid by the White House and Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its plans to buy mostly gasoline-powered vehicles and hold a new hearing. 
USPS said it expects the vehicles will begin appearing on carrier routes in late 2023.
In February 2021, the USPS announced an initial $482 million contract for Oshkosh and said it could order up to 165,000 vehicles over 10 years in a deal that could be worth $6 billion or more.
The modern vehicles will replace many older USPS vehicles that lack air bags and other safety equipment as well as air conditioning.
USPS estimates its total costs for buying and operating 75,000 new delivery vehicles over 20 years including fueling and maintenance at $9.3 billion for gasoline-powered vehicles compared with $11.6 billion for electric models.
In 2019, USPS operated 217,000 vehicles that traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles and spent about $706.2 million in maintenance costs for it fleet of 140,000 older delivery vehicles.
Oshkosh said its ""contract allows the flexibility, when funding is provided, to increase the percentage of (electric vehicles) to be produced even after an order is placed.""

U.S. lawmakers have asked Oshkosh if it sought to avoid using union workers by deciding to build the vehicles in South Carolina and asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General to review USPS's vehicle purchase plan.
USPS said last week its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""

165,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 01:27PM ET</span>",,,,,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday said it will list New York City's iconic yellow cabs on its app, a move that marks the company's latest expansion into the taxi market and could help the ride-hailing giant overcome a driver shortage in its biggest U.S. market.
Uber during its recent investor day in February outlined taxis as a major growth opportunity, calling it a highly fragmented $120 billion industry with 20 million active vehicles - more than five times the number of Uber's own pre-pandemic vehicle base.
The company said it planned to include every taxi on its Uber app by 2025 and last year added 122,000 new taxis to its platform. That represented 3% of its total driver base at a time when it was struggling to retain its usual gig worker drivers amid the pandemic.
The New York City collaboration could add as many as some 13,600 cabs to Uber's app if all of the city's registered cab drivers participate.
Uber's shares rose 6% in early trading, but later pared gains and were up 1.7%.
The deal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, would see Uber work with taxi software companies Creative Mobile Technologies and Curb, which said its goal was to expand the collaboration U.S.-wide.
Passengers will pay roughly the same fare for taxi trips as for Uber X rides, but taxi drivers will be paid according to New York's ride-hail wage standards, which on average are higher than the metered rates, Curb said.
The city has for years been a battleground between Uber and yellow cab drivers, who have long opposed Uber for diminishing their earnings.

Uber said it has already integrated taxis in Spain, Germany, Austria, Turkey, South Korea, Hong Kong and Colombia. Thirty-five percent of users who come to Uber taking a taxi trip go on to use its other mobility products, the company said in February.
""When we look at the next five years, we just don't see a world in which taxis and Uber exist separately. There's too much to gain for both sides,"" Andrew Macdonald, Uber's senior vice president of mobility, said at the time.

(Reuters) - Global tech funds are back in demand and investment inflows are surging as rising inflationary pressures and a selloff in bonds drive investors into a sector perceived as both cheap and resilient.
According to Refinitiv data, tech funds have received inflows worth $2.55 billion since March 16, after outflows worth $6.86 billion in the first two months of this year.

""Going forward, we have first-quarter earnings season just weeks away ... One of the standouts is expected to be tech, which has been the earnings workhorse during the pandemic,"" she said.
The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF received $640.6 million in net buying in the week ended March 23, while iShares’ Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF and Semiconductor ETF obtained $372.3 million and $260.5 million, respectively, in inflows.

Chinese tech shares, which had lagged their global peers over the past year, also participated in this week's rally, on reports that Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms to prepare for more audit disclosures.
The move was perceived as demonstrating Beijing's willingness to make some concessions to resolve a long-running Sino-U.S. audit standoff in which hundreds of billions of U.S. investment dollars in Chinese companies are at stake. 
The Hang Seng SCHK China technology index has risen 23% since March 15, compared with the MSCI World technology index's gain of 7.1%.
Joseph Seeger, senior technology analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence, said the higher inflows into the tech funds came as investors divert their money from bond funds into equity funds. 
""Investors are broadly rotating into equities from bonds as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed higher in 10 of the past 13 trading sessions to 2.38%,"" he said. 
""Another catalyst includes generally oversold market conditions in technology, with multiples compressing on average of 40% from the peak.""
Analysts said the tech sector still has strong fundamentals and high cash levels, which would help to reward shareholders with dividends and share buybacks this year. 
According to Refinitiv data, the global tech sectors' cash flow per share stood at $1.26 in 2021, the highest among main sectors.

(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is working with an adviser to sell its gas-producing assets in the Anadarko Basin of North Texas and Western Oklahoma, according to two sources and documents seen by Reuters.
The planned sale, which includes both operated and non-operated leaseholds and royalty interests in the STACK and SCOOP formations of Oklahoma, comes as ConocoPhillips tries to raise cash by offloading non-core land after a buying spree made it the top producer by volume in the top U.S. oilfield.
The Anadarko assets operated by ConocoPhillips could fetch the company around $200 million, while the non-operated assets are likely to be valued at about $100 million, according to the sources.
Over the past 18 months, ConocoPhillips has spent about $23 billion buying properties in the Permian basin. Before spending $9.5 billion to acquire Shell (LON:RDSa)'s acreage in Texas, ConocoPhillips took over rival Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) for more than $13 billion.
To cover the outlay, ConocoPhillips in September raised its target for asset sales to between $4 billion and $5 billion by the end of next year. The recent sharp rise in energy prices, which boosted asset values, should be a tailwind for the company as it seeks to hit this target.
ConocoPhillips has begun marketing both the operated and non-operated land parcels, which it could sell to a single bidder or separate parties, said the sources, adding that the company could hold onto one or both packages if it does not receive attractive offers.

The sources requested anonymity as the sale talks are confidential. A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities.
The U.S. shale producer's operated Anadarko assets consist of 261,200 net acres producing around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while the non-operated package covers 17,700 net acres in Oklahoma and has production of 3,000 boepd, according to the marketing document seen by Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) has asked more than 30 financial services trade groups for information on what steps their members have taken to end business relationships in Russia as pressure escalates on companies to cut ties with Moscow. 
In a letter sent on Thursday to leading industry groups including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Waters requested data on which companies remain engaged in business activities in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and their reason for doing so.
She also asked the groups to detail their members' processes for complying with Western sanctions. She asked the groups to get the information to the committee within 20 days. 
U.S. Representative Waters, the California Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, did not indicate what the committee might do with this information.
Financial companies have taken varying approaches in response to Russia’s invasion and Waters' scrutiny is likely to increase pressure on those institutions which have yet to exit.

The regulator added that any agreement would only be a “first step” and that the PCAOB would then investigate to ensure that the deal is being followed.
""If an agreement is reached, we will then proceed with our inspection and investigation activities to determine if the agreement operates as intended... (but) an agreement without successful execution will not satisfy U.S. law,"" the audit watchdog said.
Chinese regulators have asked some of the country’s U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure domestic companies remain listed in New York, Reuters reported n Tuesday
The Financial Times and Bloomberg News also reported this month that China’s securities watchdog is weighing a proposal that would allow U.S. regulators to inspect auditors’ working papers for some companies as soon as this year.
China's regulators have also been considering a proposal to allow their U.S. counterparts to inspect audit working papers of some Chinese firms that do not gather sensitive data.

Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections under new SEC rules adopted last year aimed at advancing a process that could lead to more than 200 companies being kicked off U.S. exchanges and could make some Chinese companies less attractive to investors. 
U.S. lawmakers mandated in December 2020 that the watchdog take steps to ensure foreign companies listed in the United States, in particular Chinese companies, comply with U.S. auditing standards after decades of China's reluctance to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms due to national security concerns.

The company is short Li-Cycle as the battery recycling SPAC business is a near fatal combination of stock promotion, laughable governance, a broken business hemorrhaging cash, and highly questionable Enron-like accounting.
Among other things, the short seller said LICY has adopted an accounting approach that is vulnerable to abuse, which also allows the management to mark up the value of its receivables on unsold products and runs the gains through its revenue line.
As a result, Blue Orca estimates that around 45% of the company's sales are simply receivables on products that had not been sold and not actual revenues. This is why, according to the short seller, why LICY's CFO and auditor quit earlier this year.
Furthermore, the report goes on to say that Li-Cycle is a governance nightmare.
""Its founder is a serial penny stock promoter recently sanctioned by Canadian authorities and its management team diverted half a million in shareholder money to enrich their entourage with wasteful spending, including tens of thousands of dollars on leather goods purchased from the CEO's family.""
Li-Cycle went public through SPAC with  Peridot Acquisition Corp  last year.
Li-Cycle stock is down over 20% YTD.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Chinese investigators began examining the cockpit voice recorder from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged into mountainside with 132 people on board as recovery crews searched muddy fields on Thursday for a second black box.
The recording material from the first black box, found on Wednesday, appeared to have survived the impact of Monday's crash in relatively good shape, a Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) official said.
The cockpit voice recorder would provide investigators with details of communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 plane. 
The search continued for the flight data recorder.
Debris from the jetliner including engine blades, horizontal tail stabilisers and other wing remnants was concentrated within 30 metres of the main impact point, which was 20 metres deep. 
One 1.3 metre-long fragment suspected to be from the plane was found about 10 km away, prompting a significant expansion of the search area, officials told a news briefing.
No survivors have been found, and experts have said it was all but impossible that anyone could survive such an impact. 
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast when the plane suddenly plunged from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent to its destination.
The investigation is being led by China but the United States was invited to take part because the plane was designed and manufactured there.
However, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday it had not determined if investigators would travel to China given strict visa and quarantine requirements, and Chinese officials declined to say whether or when NTSB officials would be invited.
""Our work priority is still on search and rescue, and at the same time, carrying out evidence collection and fixation work in the early stage of accident investigation,"" said Zhu Tao, the CAAC's head of aviation safety.
""However, when we enter the accident investigation stage, we will invite relevant parties to participate in the accident investigation according to relevant regulations,"" he said.
SLOW SEARCH
According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive, before plunging again into a heavily forested slope in the mountainous Guangxi region.
Authorities said the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers during the rapid descent. 
It was too early to determine the cause of the crash, which experts say are usually the result of a combination of factors.
""The difficulty now is that we are eager to search for survivors as soon as possible, but our work requires us to search carefully and slowly,"" Huang Shangwu, deputy director of the Combat Training Office of the Guangxi Fire Rescue Corps said at the site.
Search teams used thermal imaging cameras and life detection devices as well as drones.
""The search area is really large, plus the two days of rain make the path very slippery,"" said Zhou, among the more than 1,600 people involved in search operations on Thursday. 
The flight's captain had 6,709 hours flying experience, while the first and second officers had 31,769 hours and 556 hours, respectively, a China Eastern official said on Wednesday. One co-pilot was an observer to build up experience, the airline said, without disclosing the names of the pilots.
Phoenix Weekly magazine cited an aviation expert who identified the captain as Yang Hongda, the son of a former China Eastern captain, and the first officer as Zhang Zhengping, a pilot with 40 years of experience who mentored other pilots.

The Southern Weekly newspaper reported Yang, 32, had a one-year-old daughter, while Zhang, 59, was a veteran pilot with an impeccable safety record and had been expected to retire this year. Another media outlet, Jimu News identified the less experienced second officer as Ni Gongtao, 27.
China Eastern did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the reports.

179,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 11:11AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Energy and metals firms led a jump in Russian stocks on Thursday as trading resumed after almost a month's suspension, reflecting soaring global prices for oil, gas and other commodities on fears the Ukraine crisis will threaten supply.
The market was also underpinned by a government commitment to support stocks, leading a senior U.S. official to dismiss the limited resumption of trading as a ""a charade: a Potemkin market opening"". 
Stocks had not traded on Moscow's bourse since Feb. 25, the day after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into neighbouring Ukraine, prompting Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically and then Russian countermeasures.
The reaction has cut off Russian financial markets from global networks and sent the rouble currency tumbling. Stocks had also plunged immediately after Moscow launched what it calls ""a special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour.
Restrictions on trade with foreigners and a ban on short selling remained in place on Thursday as the Moscow Exchange cautiously resumed equities trading. On Friday, more securities, including corporate bonds and Eurobonds will be traded, the central bank said.
""We will do everything possible to open all segments of the stock market soon,"" Boris Blokhin, head of Moscow Exchange's stock market department, said.
STELLAR GAINS
The short session saw energy firms make stellar gains, with gas producer Novatek, oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil and gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) up 12%-18.5%. 
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was trading near $120.6 per barrel on Thursday, having jumped more than 20% from a month ago as worries about supply disruptions from the Ukraine crisis drive up prices. [O/R] 
Shares in mining giant Nornickel also gained 10.2%. 
Novatek and Nornickel pared losses sustained since before Feb. 24 by the session's close. Fertiliser producer Phosagro closed at a record high. 
""Large bids to buy Russian shares have been seen since the market opening,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note, adding that a promise Russia's rainy-day fund will buy shares was also underpinning the market. 
""The overall sentiment is supported by the confidence that the finance ministry will buy stocks,"" BCS said. 
The government said on March 1 that it would use up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.4 billion) from the National Wealth Fund to buy battered Russian stocks, although it was not clear whether any purchases were being made on Thursday.
The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'POTEMKIN MARKET OPENING'
A senior U.S. official said Moscow's commitment to buy amounted to artificially propping up shares, and called the limited resumption ""a Potemkin market opening"".
""This is not a real market and not a sustainable model - which only underscores Russia's isolation from the global financial system,"" deputy White House national security adviser Daleep Singh said in a statement.
Trading in Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange remains suspended. Prices of some instruments had plunged to almost zero before the bourse halted trading of them in early March.
The Moscow Exchange said 567,000 private investors had accounted for 58.2% of Thursday's trading volume, with 121 professional participants conducting the remainder.
""Today the first step was made in our new reality,"" said Elbek Dalimov, head of equity trading at Aton brokerage, adding that trading orders were limited with non-residents, who hold more than half the free float on the market, sidelined.
""In the morning we saw a huge number of retail investors who on the one hand were closing short positions and on the other were ready to park their roubles in shares, so as to somehow save them from inflation,"" he said.
The benchmark MOEX stock index ended the short trading session 4.4% higher at 2,578.51 points, having earlier reached a day peak of 2,761.17.
The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 9% on the day to 852.64, pressured by the weaker rouble, according to MOEX data that was suspended in the Eikon terminal.
The negative impact of sanctions was clear in some sectors, with shares in Russia's second-largest lender VTB down 5.5%. And with most European airspace closed to Russian planes, flagship carrier Aeroflot sank 16.44%.
Trading apps of major brokerages with leading banks, including Sberbank, VTB and Alfa, reported temporary problems with processing clients' orders following the restart.
ROUBLE FIRMS
The rouble meanwhile extended its recovery, gaining 1.3% to trade at 96.50 against the dollar in Moscow trade by 1502 GMT. 
The currency had hit its strongest level in three weeks at 94.975 on Wednesday after Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles.
Against the euro, the rouble was 2.1% higher at 105.75, pulling further away from an all-time low of 132.4 it hit in Moscow trading earlier in March, but far from levels of around 90 seen before Feb. 24.
Russia resumed trading of OFZ treasury bonds on Monday with the central bank helping to stabilise the market with interventions, the amount of which it has not yet disclosed.

Yields of benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.68% after hitting an all-time high of 19.74% on Monday.

Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of U.S.-listed companies, but Beijing, citing national security concerns, bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms. 
The U.S Congress in 2020 passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which compels the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delist stocks of companies that do not comply. 
In December, the SEC identified 273 companies that were at risk under the HFCAA, without naming them.
Earlier this month, it named five companies, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) and biotech firm  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, that could face delisting. It added Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) to the list on Wednesday.
""The SEC will gradually move to identify the more systemically significant China based companies listed in the U.S."" said Shaswat K. Das, a lawyer at King & Spalding LLP who previously worked at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as its primary negotiator with the Chinese regulators on cross-border audit oversight from 2011 to 2015.
China's securities regulator said earlier this month it had made ""positive progress"" with U.S. counterparts on securities supervision, after U.S.-listed Chinese stocks tumbled as the first Chinese firms to be potentially de-listed were named. 
Das, however, cautioned it was too early to tell whether that's going to materialize into anything significant.

According to a Reuters report on Tuesday, citing sources, Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures. 
Separately, Yum China has said it may have to delist from the New York stock exchange by 2024 after U.S. authorities said it had failed to provide access to audit documents.

Several electric vehicle makers including legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) that have entered the segment aim to deliver their first EVs this year as demand heats up, but higher raw material prices and supply chain woes have clouded their timelines.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, shrugging off some mixed economic data and apparently reassured by the lack of immediate escalation of geopolitical risks as NATO and the G7 sat down to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%, resuming their upward trend after a minor correction on Wednesday.
The three indices may have opened more strongly, however, had it not been for a surprisingly soft set of durable goods data, which showed that core durable goods purchases, excluding volatile items such as defense and aerospace goods, fell by 0.3%, their first drop in a year. Headline goods purchases also fell for the first time in five months. The figures may reflect the fading of the pandemic surge in hardware purchases, which was driven by the widespread adoption of remote working. 
There was brighter news from the economy in the shape of weekly jobless claims, where initial claims fell to their lowest since 1969 at 187,000. That was well below forecasts for 212,000, and a continuing reminder of the tightness of the labor market, which is fostering ever-broader rises in wage settlements.
""We expect initial claims to remain low as employers struggling to hire and retain workers keep layoffs to a minimum,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Nancy Vanden Houten in a note to clients. 
The early news from a full day of summits held by NATO, the G7 and EU didn't point to any game-changing escalations, although leaders again warned Russia against using chemical and biological weapons. Ukrainian authorities and unverified footage suggest that the Russian air force used white phosphorus in attacks on Kyiv suburbs on Wednesday night. A White House official also briefed reporters that Ukraine's President Zelensky had not repeated his request for a no-fly zone in a virtual address to the NATO summit. He also stated that the U.S. will supply Ukraine with anti-ship missiles, on the same day that Ukrainian forces appeared to have crippled a large Russian landing ship at the port of Berdyansk.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers on Thursday backed lower price caps on wholesale roaming fees paid by telecoms operators to peers in another EU country, extending for a decade a policy that benefits consumers.
The European Parliament and EU countries had reached a political deal in December last year. The next step will be for the latter to give their formal agreement in the coming weeks for the price caps to come into force.
The European Commission scrapped retail roaming charges and introduced price caps on wholesale roaming charges in 2017, saying this would spare consumers from 'bill shock' when they return from their holidays abroad. 
Telecoms providers in southern European countries prefer to keep wholesale price caps as high as possible to benefit from tourists making calls home, while operators in northern Europe, whose citizens tend to holiday abroad, typically argue for lower caps. 
Under the political deal reached last year, the wholesale voice tariff will be capped at 0.022 euro per minute next year and go down to 0.019 euro in 2025 until 2032.
Wholesale rates for text messages will be limited to 0.004 euro per message next year, and at 0.003 in 2025 to 2032.
Data tariffs will be capped at 1.80 euros per gigabyte next year, 1.55 euros in 2024, gradually decreasing to 1 euro in 2027 to 2032.
""By significantly cutting the wholesale caps, we create more fairness and competition on the telecommunications market,"" EU lawmaker Angelika Winzig, who steered the issue through the assembly, said in a statement.

EU lawmakers had originally sought bigger cuts in the price caps than what the European Commission had proposed while EU countries, lobbied by telecoms providers, wanted smaller reductions.
The Parliament said the Commission would look into possibly cutting the costs of intra-EU calls, which are the surcharges for making calls from one EU country to another and now capped at 19 cents, following calls from lawmakers.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German workers and families will receive extra cash, cheaper petrol and cut-price public transport tickets to help them shoulder soaring power and heating costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany's ruling coalition said on Thursday.
The deal between Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), the ecological Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), struck after talks that ran deep into the night, should ease tensions over how to respond to ballooning energy costs that are squeezing households and companies.
Finance Minister Christian Lindner said the volume of the planned measures should be similar to a first package of tax relief agreed last month, which he most recently said was worth 16 billion euros ($17.6 billion).
""The coalition believes that we, the people and the economy, must protect ourselves in the short term and for a limited time in the face of these enormous price increases,"" Lindner said.
Under the agreement, workers who pay income tax will receive a one-off energy price allowance of 300 euros ($330) as a supplement to their salaries. In addition, families will receive a one-time bonus of 100 euros per child, which doubles for low-income families.
The price of public transport tickets will be slashed to 9 euros a month for three months. The tax on fuel will be reduced to the European minimum rate for three months, which Lindner said should cut prices at pumps by 30 euro cents for petrol and by 14 cents for diesel.
Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, said the package was a good start but would not be enough to absorb the economic impact of high prices as it does not include any measures to support companies.
""I'm afraid we won't be able to avoid this topic over the next few weeks,"" he said.

The package agreed by the coalition parties also includes measures to reduce Germany's dependence on Russian gas and to reduce energy consumption, for instance by boosting funding for the construction of energy-efficient buildings.
The costs of the package of measures will be covered in a supplementary budget for this year to be unveiled next month, which will also include funding for humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian refugees and upgrading the German armed forces.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England said on Thursday that it might not go ahead with plans announced in December to raise banks' capital requirements in the coming quarter, given Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The BoE said major British lenders' capital and liquidity position remained strong, but economic uncertainty meant it might not be appropriate to raise cyclical capital requirements that are linked to economic recovery.
""Global financial markets, particularly for commodities, have been volatile and uncertainty over the economic outlook has increased significantly,"" the BoE said in a quarterly report from its Financial Policy Committee.
Margin calls on commodity derivatives had risen to an all-time high, but served as a ""critical safeguard"" for financial stability, the BoE said.
The BoE had said in December that it intended to raise banks' counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) - its main tool to smooth lending over the course of the credit cycle - to 2% from 1% in the in the second quarter of 2022, with full effect a year later.
While domestic risks had not changed since then, the global environment had, the BoE said.
""Given this uncertainty, the Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to vary the UK CCyB rate in either direction,"" the FPC said.
The direct exposures of UK banks to Russia amount to 1% of their core capital at the end of 2021, the FPC said.
Deciding the CCyB rate would be easier once the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) published new economic forecasts in May, the FPC added.
The BoE also said it would delay an annual stress test of banks' financial health, which had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, until later in 2022.

Policymakers saw little risk to financial stability from a sharp rise in house prices, and expected borrowers to continue to be able to repay mortgages despite a sharp rise in the cost of living.
Poorer households were likely to struggle more, however.

It was the largest fine Ireland has ever handed down to a fund service provider. With just over 1.13 trillion euros in assets under administration, BNY Mellon Ireland is the second largest fund administrator in the country, which is a hub for the global funds industry.
Like other operators, BNY Mellon Fund Services (Ireland) provides fund administration or ""back office"" services on behalf of fund managers and investment funds in Ireland and around the world.
The regulator said the breaches arose due to BNY Mellon Ireland's failure to comply with its regulatory obligations and have an adequate governance framework in place for these outsourcing activities that are integral to its operating model.
This undermined its ability to effectively identify and manage the risks associated with its outsourcing arrangements and created unnecessary potential risks to its clients, investors and the financial markets, the central bank said.
""The investigation found systemic weakness across its entire outsourcing framework. Despite intervention by the Central Bank over a number of years, BNY DAC (BNY Mellon Ireland) repeatedly failed to address these deficiencies,"" Central Bank Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement
BNY Mellon Ireland, whose parent group is the world's largest custodian bank, admitted to the 16 breaches, the first of which was identified in 2014, and has taken the necessary steps to rectify the deficiencies, the central bank said.

Its fine was reduced from 15.4 million euros in accordance with a settlement discount.

Renault, the biggest player in the Russian auto market, said on Wednesday it stopped production at the plant and would assess its options on its majority stake in Avtovaz, Russia's No. 1 carmaker following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The government's comments about the future of the factory come after the Kremlin suggested it could nationalise assets of foreign firms that left the country. 
""The Ministry of Industry and Trade will discuss the prospects of developing the Renault Russia factory with the Moscow government. The joint solutions will be announced by the end of next week,"" the ministry said.
The factory in Moscow owned by Renault produces the Renault Duster, Kaptur, Arkana and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Terrano models. 
""The Ministry of Industry and Trade is in constant contact with Avtovaz and Renault Group management,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Renault was not immediately available for comment.
Avtovaz, which is controlled by Renault and produces the Lada and Renault car brands, partially halted output at its plants in Togliatti and Izhevsk this week due to shortages of electronic parts.
The Russian industry ministry said that everything necessary was being done to resume operations at Avtovaz's assembly lines, including the creation of components stocks.

More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, in what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"", leaving behind assets worth billions of dollars.

Speaking at an analysts call on 2021 results, Fincantieri CFO Giuseppe Dado said that the group's naval division was poised to grow in the short term thanks to the backlog of orders already secured.
In the long-term the naval business, which makes military vessels, could rise to up to 40% of its shipbuilding segment, from a current figure of 31%, Dado said. 
In 2021 the shipbuilding segment reported a 27% rise in sales to 5.9 billion euros, the group said late on Wednesday, adding that total revenue reached 6.7 billion euros.
Fincantieri did not give specific guidance on 2022 results citing the uncertainty stemming from both geo-political tensions and raw materials and energy prices inflation.
The group's executives however said that the core profit margin, which is an indicator of profitability, would remain high, after recovering to 7.4% last year. 
Last year Fincantieri made a non-binding offer to buy Leonardo's OTO Melara and Wass units, which make cannons and torpedoes.
At the same time, the shipbuilder has also considered buying Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG)'s submarine business in partnership with Germany's Rheinmetall, sources had told Reuters. 
""Everything is suspended in the current scenario,"" General Manager Fabio Gallia said, answering a question about the two potential deals.

On Wednesday, Fincantieri said it had swung to profit of 22 million euros last year after booking a 245 million euros loss in 2020.
Excluding uncertainties connected to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as health concerns, the group said in a statement it could return to a ""sustainable dividend distribution starting from 2022"".

BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler Truck expects high raw material prices to drive price increases this year but limited impact from events in Ukraine, the German truck and bus maker said on Thursday.
Unlike competitors, including Traton's MAN, it does not source wire harnesses from Ukraine, CEO Martin Daum said, while finance chief Jochen Goetz said Russia and Ukraine accounted for just 1% of the firm's sales.
Semiconductor supply will weigh on results particularly in the first quarter, Daum said, with the company sitting on high inventories of unfinished vehicles as it waits for semiconductors to arrive.
""When suppliers suddenly cut [their offer] by half nearly overnight, that is an unbearable situation,"" Daum said. ""We've had to fly in parts by helicopter, which in my entire long career in trucking was unheard of.""
Asked about its cooperation with Russian truckmaker Kamaz, which was frozen in late February, Daum said it was not supplying components to Kamaz but had not yet had any contact with Russian officials about the next steps.
Mercedes-Benz AG, which Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck split off from in December, holds a 15% stake in the Russian firm and two Daimler Truck executives sit on its board, though both stepped back until further notice in early March.
""We have to reassess,"" Daum said. ""We are certainly not in talks with any Russian government officials at the moment.""
The truckmaker said it expects at least a 14% increase in revenue this year and for its return on sales to rise to 7-9% from 6.1% last year.

Returns were strongest in North America in 2021 at 9.2% but the fourth quarter was weaker in part due to the impact of two recalls in December that cost the firm $1 million, Goetz said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Renault SA, the Western carmaker most exposed to the Russian market, said on Wednesday it would suspend operations at its plant in Moscow while it assesses options on its majority stake in Avtovaz, the country's No. 1 carmaker. 
The move came amid mounting pressure over the French company's continued presence in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for a global boycott of  Renault  (PA:RENA). 
""Renault Group reminds that it already implements the necessary measures to comply with international sanctions,"" the company said in Wednesday's statement, its first on the issue since the start of the war. The statement made no mention of the crisis in Ukraine. 
The French carmaker on Wednesday revised its operating group margin to around 3% from at or above 4% in 2022 and adjusted its automotive cash flow outlook to ""positive"" from a previous estimate of 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) or above. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier accused Renault of financing the war and said Renault, among other French companies, must stop ""financing the murder of children and women, of rape.""
Kuleba wrote in a tweet on Wednesday, ""I welcome @renaultgroup's statement on cessation of industrial activities in Russia. Responsible move against the backdrop of Russia’s ongoing barbaric aggression against Ukraine.""
Renault derives 8% of its core earnings from Russia, according to Citibank, mainly through its 69% stake in Avtovaz, which is behind the Lada car brand.
According to two sources close to the matter, Renault's board of directors considered different scenarios but decided for the time being to maintain a presence in Russia.
A decade ago, automakers saw Russia as a promising growth market with the potential to be among the ten largest vehicle-buying nations in the world. The latest sanctions, and earlier measures imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, have derailed those prospects.
The French government has said repeatedly it was up to French companies to decide on the future of their operations in Russia, as long as they comply with international sanctions.
After resuming Russian production earlier this month, the company announced a further partial shutdown at its Togliatti and Izhevsk sites this week, citing shortages of electronic components. 
Its Russian operations last year accounted for almost 20% of total group volume, but Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said on March 10, two weeks in to the war, that the crisis was unlikely to threaten the French carmaker's recovery.
Renault said on Wednesday it will quantify the value of assets affected by the decision on the Moscow plant when it releases half-year results. Last year those assets stood at 2.2 billion euros ($2.42 billion), the company said.
Other companies with operations in Russia have suspended or scaled back operations in the face of Western sanctions, but still maintained some ties to their business in the country. These companies are feeling pressure to further shut down. 
U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on March 1 it would suspend shipments of components and other support for a van-making venture 51% owned by Russian manufacturer Sollers. Ford has not said what it will do with its 49% stake in that operation.
French food group Danone said on Wednesday it would continue local production in Russia of essential dairy and infant nutrition products, but had cut other ties with the country over its war in Ukraine.
Swiss rival Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) said it would halt the sale of a wide range of brands in Russia, including several nonessential products such as KitKat snacks and Nesquik chocolate mix. It had already halted nonessential imports and exports to Russia.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Odeon Capital's veteran bank analyst Dick Bove highlighted that if the Fed moves ahead with aggressive rate hikes, interest payments by the United States could conceivably reach the annual level of $620 billion by year-end 2022 nearly double 2021 levels. It could further balloon to $900 million by 2024. The money for these payments would have to be borrowed in the open market. Additionally, the equity of the Federal Reserve, to the degree it exists, would be wiped out.
""The numbers are concerning,"" Bove commented. ""They imply that the Federal Reserve might not be able to pursue a course as rigorous as the one implied.""
As Germany asks itself how it could ever let itself get into its precarious position related to reliance on Russian oil, the Fed should be asking itself a similar question: how it could allow the nation to spin out of control monetarily.
Given the above risks, Bove said the Fed might not be able to institute a significant rate hike program. If that is the case, inflation will remain a severe problem.

Spotify stock price surged roughly 3.5% on the news.
In the past, two of the biggest mobile app stores including Google Play and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store did not allow developers to directly charge their customers for their services but rather were required to solicit customers credit cards through Googles system, which charges from 15% to 30% of total sales.
However, that may now change. Google said allowing Spotify to provide its own billing is a pilot but did not offer any details about when or in which countries the feature be available to other app makers. The tech giant said it will allow only a small number of developers to provide their own billing for now.
This pilot will allow a small number of participating developers to offer an additional billing option next to Google Plays billing system and is designed to help us explore ways to offer this choice to users, while maintaining our ability to invest in the ecosystem, Google wrote in a blog post.
Google will still charge Spotify a fee for processing the payments on its own, and said it plans to expand the policy it uses in South Korea where it charges an 11% fee on subscription purchases handled through a third-party billing system, demanded by the new South Korean legislation.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain sanctioned another wave of Russia's banks, critical industries and a host of members of its elite on Thursday, including Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, and a woman they said was the stepdaughter of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 
The sanctions on 59 Russian and six Belarusian entities and individuals included state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot, private military contractor Wagner Group and Alrosa, the world's largest diamond producer with an estimated market value of $6.61 billion.
Britain and other Western nations are using sanctions to cripple the Russian economy and punish President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine, seeking to press him to abandon what he calls a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine.
Kyiv and its allies call it a baseless pretext to invade a democratic nation of 44 million people.
Britain also targeted Polina Kovaleva, who it described as the stepdaughter of Russia's Lavrov. The government said she reportedly owns a 4 million pound property in London, with property records showing she lives in the Kensington district, famous for its parks, upmarket shops and museums. 
She purchased it in 2016 without a mortgage, the records show.
Another individual to be targeted is German Gref, the CEO of Russia's largest bank Sberbank. 
""Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. ""There will be no let-up"".
Gazprombank is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas. Alfa-Bank is one of Russia's top private lenders, controlled by Mikhail Fridman, who was sanctioned by Britain earlier in the month, and his partners.
They and four other banks were subject to asset freezes which lock them out of any resources held in Britain and prevent British firms from doing business with them.
The Sovcomflot designation could complicate its insurance cover, and will likely have a broader industry impact - its British arm facilitates the chartering of its crude oil tankers, product carriers, chemical tankers and liquefied gas carriers, SCF's website said.
The firm was among the Russian entities the U.S. Treasury restricted last month from raising capital in U.S. markets.
Most of the new sanctions were introduced under British laws recently rushed through parliament allowing Britain to mirror measures put in place by allies like the European Union and United States.
The sanctions also targeted Russian Railways and defence company Kronshtadt, the main producer of Russian drones.
Britain said the total asset value of the banks that have been sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine was 500 billion pounds ($658.65 billion) and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members was more than 150 billion pounds. 

Among the other individuals sanctioned were oil tycoon Evgeny Shvidler and founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A plan by UBS and China Life Insurance Group to set up an asset management joint venture in China faces uncertainty as talks have stalled due to a corruption investigation at the insurer and curbs set on the scope of the business, two sources said. 
China Life's asset management arm and the Swiss bank began negotiations in late 2020 to jointly form a so-called ""wealth management company"" to manage money for mainly retail investors, Reuters reported in December, citing sources.
The discussions have now stalled, though they have not been formally called off, said the sources, who had knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The stalling of the talks underscores challenges for western financial firms looking to expand and grab a bigger share of China's 100 trillion yuan ($15.70 trillion) asset management sector, which has opened up for bigger foreign participation. 
The talks have cooled as the then Chairman of China Life Insurance Group, Wang Bin, was put under investigation by the country's corruption watchdog in January.
The development has resulted in a review of planned deals initiated under Wang's watch, said the sources.
The joint venture talks faded also because the scope of business for such asset management ventures was overestimated, said the sources.
UBS had originally hoped that the planned venture would be able to sell wealth management products (WMPs) via China Life's army of insurance agents - an idea that was later proven to be misplaced under new rules for selling of such products published last year.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) published rules in 2021 that stipulate only banks and other deposit-taking financial institutions are allowed to distribute WMPs.
UBS declined to comment, while a spokesperson for China Life Insurance Co Ltd, the listed arm of China Life Insurance Group, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
""We are still pushing, but the progress is behind our expectations,"" one of the sources told Reuters, referring to the status of joint venture discussions.
UBS was looking to hold a majority stake in the venture, permitted by China in such partnerships since 2019.
China in 2018 allowed banks and other eligible financial institutions to set up so-called ""wealth management companies"" - in essence asset management firms - as part of a campaign to squeeze risky shadow banking.

An ensuing push by Beijing to lure foreign investors into the space led to a flurry of deals by global asset managers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Amundi,  Schroders  (LON:SDR), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to form majority-owned ventures with Chinese lenders.

LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyd's of London faces major claims this year related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but this will not lead to solvency issues, the commercial insurance market said on Thursday.
Lloyd's is asking its member syndicates to give details of their exposure to the conflict, Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters, adding it was too soon to estimate the size of the loss.
Lloyd's has around 100 members that underwrite complex risks such as planes, ships and oil rigs.
The aviation insurance market is seen as particularly exposed to the impact of what Russia has described as a ""special military operation"" and of the West's subsequent sanctions.
Global leasing companies face an imminent sanctions deadline for the repossession of more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines. Analysts say legal wrangling between airlines, lessors and insurers could last a decade.
Lloyd's said business underwritten in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus accounted for less than 1% of the market's total business.
""In terms of our direct exposures, they're quite low. So this is much more about second order impacts, of which aviation will clearly be one and will end up being significant,"" Carnegie-Brown said.
Some insurance policies kick in as a result of a war, while others do not cover war, making exposures hard to calculate, he said. Policyholders have notified insurers of likely claims, but have yet to file them, he added.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit Lloyd's hard in 2020, but the market recovered last year after it raised premium rates and excluded the virus from policies.
It posted a 2021 pre-tax profit of 2.3 billion pounds ($3.04 billion), following a 900 million-pound loss in 2020.

""The market’s underwriting discipline will enable sustainable profitability in the years to come, coupled with a balance sheet that can support our ambition to grow profitably,"" Chief Executive John Neal said in a statement.

HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) -Airbus expects Indian airlines to order 2,210 planes over the next 20 years, up from a previous forecast of 1,900, it said on Thursday, citing growth in the country's aviation sector.
With low-cost carriers making up the bulk of the Indian market, Airbus expects airlines will need 1,770 narrowbody planes to grow their fleets and replace old planes, with the remainder being widebody planes, Brent McBratney, head of airline marketing for India and South Asia, said at an air show. 
India's domestic and international air travel market is expected to grow 6.2% per year over the next 20 years, outpacing average global growth of about 3.9%, McBratney said.
While a proliferation of low-cost carriers has spurred demand for narrowbody planes in India, McBratney also expects growth in long-haul travel, which he said was a largely untapped market for Indian carriers.
Domestic air travel in India is recovering from the pandemic, helping airlines such as IndiGo, which is Airbus' biggest customer for its A320 narrowbody planes, and Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and Tata Sons, to boost capacity and utilisation levels. 

But as crude prices hit record highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the cost of jet fuel has risen, which could lead to higher ticket prices and temper demand. 
However, Airbus expects domestic air travel in India to reach pre-COVID levels by mid-2022, while international travel traffic is expected to recover by next year. Airbus said in November it expected a market total of 39,020 jetliner deliveries over the next 20 years, fractionally lower than the 39,213 it forecast two years earlier.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened mixed on Thursday ahead of a key day for diplomacy aimed at halting Russia's war in Ukraine.
Western leaders will attempt to raise the pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin to end the war at three different summits in Brussels: NATO leaders will meet first, then the G7, then the European Union. All three will be attended by U.S. President Joe Biden, who will be trying to convince Germany and others of the need to close the sanctions loopholes that still allow purchases of Russian oil and gas. Progress is likely to be tough, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his opposition to an immediate stop to Russian energy purchases only on Wednesday.
The summits come a day after Putin said Russia will demand that 'hostile' countries pay for their energy supplies in rubles, rather than dollars or euros, an announcement that drove the ruble to its highest against the dollar since Russian tanks crossed the border a month ago. The move would effectively force the West to transact with the Russian central bank, whose foreign currency reserves have already been frozen by U.S., EU, U.K., and Japanese authorities.
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.1%, while euro was down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.0989. The best performer among major markets was France's CAC 40 with a 0.2% gain, while Sweden's OMX 30 lagged with a drop of 0.4%.
Russian assets, by contrast, were more buoyant. The ruble traded at only 95 to the dollar, a 50% gain from its low point in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions. The ruble-based MOEX index rose 9.6%, amid reports that Russia's sovereign wealth fund was actively buying to support prices. The central bank has banned short-selling and not all Russian equities have resumed trading.
Further west, however, there was evidence of continued disruption to economic activity in what has become an important market for many European companies. French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) issued a profit warning and said it would suspend production of its own brand cars in Russia and would consider walking away from its controlling 68% stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest carmaker. Renault stock, which has already lost 25% in the month since the invasion, fell another 1.8%. By the same token, food and drink giant Nestle said it would stop selling its more discretionary products such as KitKat and Nespresso, but said it will continue to sell products such as baby food. Nestle stock fell 0.2%.
In the U.K., the FTSE 100 was largely flat, while sterling also edged down against the dollar, a day after the government announced cuts to income tax and fuel duty to support consumer purchasing power. Analysts observed that Treasury Chief Rishi Sunak had not gone as far as he might have done, given the unexpected improvement in U.K. public finances in recent months as the pandemic has receded.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp shareholders on Thursday voted down competing proposals - one presented by management and the other backed by activist shareholders, leaving the future direction of the embattled Japanese conglomerate uncertain.
Management's plan to spin off Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s devices unit and the separate call to seek buyout offers had both failed to gain the required 50% of the vote.
The untidy outcome ensures there will be no immediate end to a four-year scandal-filled battle between management and foreign activist hedge funds, while underscoring deep divisions among Toshiba shareholders.
Opposition to Toshiba's plans to break up the company had been widespread and included proxy advisory firms, and its failure comes as no surprise. But the outlook for Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners' proposal that Toshiba solicit private equity buyout offers or a minority investment had been less clear cut.
Although 3D and Toshiba's other top two shareholders had supported the quest for a buyout offer, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had advised against it, saying the proposal ""appears overly prescriptive and premature.""
Where Toshiba management goes from now is very much an open question though the company is expected to revise its restructuring plan and some analysts said they expect sales of some assets such as Toshiba Tec, which makes point-of-sale systems and copiers. 
Speaking at the end of the extraordinary general meeting, Toshiba's new CEO Taro Shimada, a former Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) executive, only said the company ""would consider various strategic options"".
Toshiba's shares ended down 0.5% after the results.
ACTIVISTS TO FIGHT ON
For some observers, the results represented a major setback for the activist hedge funds.
""It looks terrible for the activists primarily because they don't have a big enough stake to dictate the voting and are unwilling to commit further capital,"" said David Baran, co-founder of fund management firm Symphony Financial Partners.
""They're trapped. They thought they could get away with their U.S.-style tactics because it made sense to them. Well, how's that working out?"" he added.
But the push for a buyout, which has the potential to yield solid returns for hedge funds that bought into the crisis-ridden conglomerate, is far from over.
Activist shareholders plan to fight on to force the company to restart talks with private equity firms regardless of the vote outcome, sources familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Some shareholders have also said they expect one or two top investors to nominate their own representatives for the board at Toshiba's annual shareholders meeting in June to make the company solicit private equity buyout offers.
During the five-month strategic review conducted last year, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers.
It also walked away from advanced talks for a minority stake from Canada's Brookfield Asset Management, sources have said, adding that the private equity firms Toshiba held talks with included KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Bain Capital.
Toshiba has argued that the potential buyout offers were insufficiently compelling.
The make-up of Toshiba's board will also be a key focal point amid criticism that it conducted a flawed strategic review which led to the plans to break up the company.
Paul Brough, the chair of the five-member strategic review committee, has indicated he would reconsider his position if the breakup plan was voted down, ISS said in a report.

Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

Big Swiss banks must demonstrate how they would right themselves in the event of an emergency, or how they can be restructured or liquidated without obstacles while maintaining their systemically important functions in Switzerland.
""FINMA sees further progress in the global resolvability of the large Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS,"" the watchdog said in a statement. ""They significantly reduced obstacles to the implementation of the resolution strategy."" 
FINMA also approved the recovery plans of both large banks again. 
""FINMA also continues to view the Swiss emergency plans of Credit Suisse and UBS as effective,"" it said.
Resolvability means creating the conditions for successfully restructuring a systemically important bank in a crisis, or allowing it to exit the market by way of bankruptcy, without jeopardising financial stability.
This is part of Switzerland's so-called Too Big to Fail rules, aimed at reducing risks to the financial system and avoiding the need for taxpayer-funded bailouts.

FINMA said the emergency plans of the other domestically important banks - PostFinance, Raiffeisen and Zuercher Kantonbank were still not ready.
""None of the banks has reserved sufficient loss-absorbing funds for them to be recapitalised and their operations continued in a crisis,"" FINMA said.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global banks including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) face pressure to commit to remaining as custodian banks in Russia, as rivals and funds fret they may lose services critical to future investment in the country. 
Traders, bankers and executives from three other financial institutions told Reuters they were seeking or had sought reassurances on behalf of clients on each bank's long-term plans for these businesses, which clear, settle and safeguard billions of dollars of Russian holdings.
Custodian banks have departments that look after assets for clients in return for fees.
One London-based banking source, speaking anonymously to respect confidentiality of their large global fund client, said they were in weekly contact with senior executives at Citibank Moscow on the status of their custodian business.
The source said their client was waiting to trade Russian equities when the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) reopens, but they needed the reassurance of having a Western custodian in place.
According to the source, the Citigroup executives said they would serve clients for as long as sanctions permitted.
A source with knowledge of Citi said that major U.S. and international businesses in Moscow use that bank and cutting those customers off would damage client relations. Other bankers said it is crucial to the industry that Citi, a key player, keep operating in Moscow. 
Citigroup declined to comment. 
A second banker, based in New York, said he had sought assurances from SocGen that they would ""stay on the ground"" so that his bank could meet custody obligations to clients. Executives at SocGen provided assurances that they would, at least in the near term, the source said.
Citigroup and SocGen, the French parent of Rosbank, have already announced plans to dramatically pare operations in Moscow as part of a sweeping programme of Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Both banks have said they will aid their clients with the complex tasks of unwinding or reducing exposures to Russia, and said withdrawals will take time to execute. 
But neither has made a public statement on the long-term status of their custodian services, leaving some clients nervous for the future.
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for SocGen said the group was ""conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity, while supporting its historical clients.""
SocGen ""is rigorously complying with all applicable laws and regulations and is diligently implementing the necessary measures to strictly enforce international sanctions as soon as they are made public.""
The bank declined to comment specifically on its custody business in Russia.
JPMorgan Chase & Co also provides similar custody services from its Moscow outpost. The bank has received queries from clients seeking assurances that custody services will continue to be provided, according to a source familiar with the matter. It has previously said it will continue acting as a custodian to its clients.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp has also said it will continue to provide custodian services in Russia. 
SHUT OUT
If banks decide to mothball their custody services in Moscow, many Western investors already holding Russian stocks or bonds would have to look elsewhere for a bank to hold those assets, while others keen to exploit a financial market or economic rally when sanctions are lifted could find it harder to pursue those plans.
SocGen, France's third-largest bank, warned stakeholders on March 3 that it could be stripped of its property rights to its business in Russia in a ""potential extreme scenario.""
Citi, meanwhile, originally said it would operate its Russian business on a more ""limited basis"" in the wake of the war, which President Vladimir Putin has called ""a special military operation."" 
But by March 14, it said it would accelerate and expand the scope of that retreat by giving up its institutional and wealth management clients in Russia.
Besides transaction services, many of the Moscow-based custody teams are providing add-ons like language translation of central bank documents that are also highly valued by Western clients, the source said.
Russia's central bank said separately on Wednesday that some stock market trading would resume on Thursday, with 33 securities set to be traded on the Moscow Exchange for a limited period of time and with short selling banned. 
The challenge for banks in meeting obligations to clients in Russia is getting tougher, and might become even more daunting if sanctions are tightened, with the one-month anniversary of the invasion falling this week.
Russia laid down strict new rules for foreigners seeking permits to buy and sell Russian assets ranging from securities to real estate.
Another New York-based banker described the business of ensuring clients are in compliance with sanctions in relation to securities holdings as a ""logistical nightmare"" and said his firm had hired 20 new compliance staff in recent weeks.

Global companies, banks and investors have so far disclosed nearly $135 billion in exposure to Russia, company statements show.
U.S. asset managers including Vanguard and Capital Group Companies Inc, which manages the American Funds franchise popular among millions of mom and pop retirement savers, have also disclosed large exposures topping billions of dollars, according to the most recent portfolio information available.

Investing.com – Koomin Bank sold Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. Ltd. (KS:005930) shares that were worth around $1.1 billion earlier in the day, according to a term sheet that was seen by Reuters.
The term sheet showed that about 19.9 million shares priced at KRW68,800 won per share were put on the block. Kookmin, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acted as bookrunners for the sale.
Samsung Electronics' South Korean shares rose 0.85% to KRW69,900 ($57.44) by 1:17 AM ET (5:17 AM GMT), after falling 1% to KRW 69,800 won in early Asian trading. The company’s shares recorded a 0.9% fall in the wider market.
Samsung Electronics did not comment on the sale, but analysts said that the move had been widely expected.
The shares also match the amount that Ra-hee Hong, mother of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee agreed to keep in trust with Kookmin Bank in October 2021, a Samsung Electronics filing showed. The filing also showed that the trust agreement period was due to end by Apr. 25, 2022.
Hong is also the wife of deceased Samsung patriarch Kun-hee Lee. Since the elder Lee’s death in 2020, the family that owns Samsung has used its shares in affiliated companies to pay part of more than $10 billion in inheritance tax, people with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.
South Korea’s tax code allows payment of inheritance tax in installments, with an initial one-sixth of the total to be paid first. The remainder must be over five years with an annual interest rate. Even in installments, KRW 2 trillion, or $1.64 billion, will be due annually, according to analysts."

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics shares worth about $1.1 billion were sold in a block deal on Thursday, according to a document, which some analysts attributed to the Samsung (KS:005930) conglomerate's controlling family raising cash to meet a big tax bill.
About 19.9 million Samsung shares were sold by Kookmin Bank at 68,800 won per share, a discount of 2.4% to Wednesday's closing price of 70,500 won, a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters showed.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) did not have a comment on the sale.
But the shares on sale matched the amount that Hong Ra-hee, mother of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee and wife of deceased Samsung patriarch Lee Kun-hee, agreed to keep in trust with Kookmin Bank in October, according to a Samsung Electronics filing that month.

Since patriarch Lee died in 2020, Samsung's controlling family decided to use shares in affiliated companies to pay part of more than $10 billion in inheritance tax, people with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.
The tax code allows payment in instalments, with one-sixth of the total to be paid first, and the remainder over five years with an annual interest rate. Even in instalments, analysts expect over 2 trillion won ($1.64 billion) to be due annually.
""The owner family is likely to sell additional shares to secure funds for inheritance tax,"" said Choi Kwan-soon, an analyst at SK Securities. Samsung Electronics' share price was down 1% at 69,900 won in early afternoon trade, versus a 0.5% fall in the wider market.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Union workers at  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX)'s Los Angeles refinery in El Segundo, California, ratified the U.S. oil producer's last, best and final contract offer on Wednesday, a United Steelworkers (USW) local union official said. 
The ratification at the southern California refinery comes as USW members at the company's San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond remained on strike for a third day after twice rejecting a similar contract proposal.
David Campbell, secretary-treasurer of USW Local 12-675, which represents the El Segundo workers, declined to commment on the ratification vote. 
""We have negotiated in good faith for months to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with our employees who are represented by the USW Local 675,"" Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich said, adding the company was pleased by the ratification. 
In Richmond, there has been no progress towards renewing talks between Chevron and USW Local 12-5, which represents the workers at the Richmond refinery, said BK White, first vice president of the local. 
Kruzich said the company looks forward to returning to the bargaining table as it continues to operate the Richmond refinery and deliver products to customers.
White said the expiration of a lease on neutral meeting site did not explain why the two sides have not met at the bargaining table since the strike began.
""I don't believe logistics is the reason we're not meeting,"" he said. 
Wholesale prices for California gasoline were unchanged on Wednesday, while retail prices for regular gasoline in the San Francisco Bay area remained between $5.59 and $6.19 per gallon where they have stayed since Sunday.

The 245,271 barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond refinery has more than 500 union-represented employees while the 269,000-bpd El Segundo plant employs about 1,000 people. 
The two refineries supply about 20% of the gasoline in California and are major suppliers of fuel to Los Angeles and San Francisco-area airports.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -An inquiry has declared Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd unfit for a gambling licence in Western Australia state but stopped short of revoking it, adding to the company's regulatory headache without threatening a lifeline takeover bid.
The adverse finding was widely expected after probes in the two other states where Crown has casinos brought similar results and largely completes the company's regulatory walk of shame without disrupting a $6.3 billion buyout from private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc that the company has backed.
The Western Australian inquiry took issue with Crown's failure to run effective anti-money laundering systems, but rather than cancelling its licence, recommended letting the company operate under government supervision for two years.
""This is about remediation rather than revocation, protecting the jobs of thousands of employees at the casino,"" said Western Australia gaming minister Tony Buti at a news conference.
State governments on both coasts ordered inquiries into the company founded by billionaire James Packer after media reports in 2019 accused it of knowingly dealing with foreign tour operators with ties to organised crime and turning a blind eye to money laundering.
Crown initially took out full-page newspaper advertisements to refute the allegations but acknowledged during hearings that they were largely true.
Nonetheless, governments have weighed the economic impact of cancelling the company's licence. In Victoria, where Crown makes three quarters of its profit, the company is the state's biggest single-site employer. That state also opted to put Crown under supervision for two years, rather than stop it taking bets entirely.
After an inquiry in New South Wales state declared the company unsuitable for its licence, the regulator issued a suspension just weeks before the company had opened a A$2.2 billion ($1.65 billion) Sydney waterfront resort in December 2020. Crown's Sydney licence remains suspended.
Crown in a statement acknowledged the Western Australian inquiry's recommendations and said it would ""work cooperatively and constructively with the Western Australian government"" to satisfy them.
The company had already made ""significant progress"" rebuilding its governance with a focus on responsible gambling and stamping out financial crime, said Chief Executive Steve McCann, who started in the role in October.
In the past year, Crown has replaced most of its board and senior management as it seeks to show regulators and governments that it is serious about fixing its culture. Packer also pulled his representative after an inquiry found the 37% owner inappropriately dominated the board.
Under the new leadership it has recommended Blackstone's buyout which many stakeholders see as a way out of an investment that has been bogged down by regulatory problems for years.
The remaining challenge for the company, and its planned sale, is a civil lawsuit from the Australian financial crime regulator which may result in fines of up to A$1.2 billion.
A Blackstone representative declined to comment.

Crown shares were up 0.6%, against a flat overall market, a sign of investor relief that the company could keep operating in Western Australia.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning, as the recent global equities rally eased. Volatile commodity prices added concerns to a market already dealing with record inflation and the impact of an ongoing war in Ukraine. U.S. Treasuries’ recovery from a recent selloff was also under scrutiny.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.09% by 10:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan releasing the minutes from its last policy meeting earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.75% while in Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.08%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.77%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.62% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9%.
A recent rally in U.S. Treasuries was also on shaky ground, even as they clawed back some unprecedented losses. Buyers flooded the market, snapping up a sale of 20-year bonds, and the benchmark 10-year yield fell back to 2.3%.
The war in Ukraine, triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, shows no sign of ending, and concerns about the impact on the global economy led investors struggling to identify havens.
Russian President Vladimir Putin also advanced demands that dozens of countries use the Russian rouble to pay for natural gas purchases, causing European gas prices to swing sharply. The U.S. is also readying further sanctions on Russia that could be revealed as soon as Thursday.
The extreme volatility in commodity markets caused by the war in Ukraine, as well as the global response, is sapping liquidity, according to some of the world’s biggest trading houses.
However, the recent sharp rotation from bonds to equities could be losing momentum, and a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve to curb inflation also contributed to volatility.
“Markets are really latching onto these short-lived themes and that’s causing significant price movement,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Bloomberg.
“We think that for the near term we are probably going to be able to avoid a recession, but we are growing a little bit more concerned about 2023.” Some equity investors could see the Fed’s tougher stance on inflation as a positive, at least for now, she added.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said both a 50 basis-point interest-rate hike and a decision to begin asset tapering could be warranted at the next Fed policy meeting in May 2022. On her part, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she supported front-loading rate increases in 2022.
“The Fed needs to build up its ammunition. Overall global growth is going to be dampened and they need to be able to cut rates later on should this have a greater-than-expected recessionary effect,” Matthews Asia portfolio manager Teresa Kong told Bloomberg.
U.S. President Joe Biden plans to reinstate exemptions from tariffs on about two-thirds of Chinese products that were previously granted waivers under his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden will also attend a NATO emergency summit in Brussels later in the day."

(Reuters) -A Texas jury on Wednesday found a former chief technical pilot for Boeing (NYSE:BA) not guilty of deceiving federal regulators who approved the company's 737 MAX jet which later was involved in two crashes that killed 346 people.
Former Boeing pilot Mark Forkner was indicted in October on charges of misleading U.S. regulators about a key flight control system and defrauding Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers of tens of millions of dollars by withholding information when they made their purchase decisions. 
The government alleged Forkner deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during its evaluation of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane, which received FAA certification in 2017. 
Forkner, who had faced up to 20 years in prison on each of four counts, maintained his innocence and contended prosecutors were making him a scapegoat. The short trial began Friday in Texas.
A spokesman for the Justice Department, Joshua Stueve, said, ""While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury’s verdict. The Justice Department stands by the hard work of the prosecutors and our law enforcement partners in investigating and trying this case.""
David Gerger, a lawyer for Forkner, in a statement praised the ""independent, smart, fair judge and jury."" The FAA and Boeing declined to comment.
The two crashes cost Boeing more than $20 billion and led to the plane's 20-month grounding until November 2020. Boeing was charged in 2021 with fraud conspiracy over the issue and agreed to pay $2.5 billion in a deal to avoid prosecution. 
The government had alleged Forkner provided the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group with ""materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information"" about a new part of the flight controls for the jet called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
MCAS was tied to two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. But the government did not charge Forkner with causing those accidents. 
Prosecutors pointed to one message Forkner sent to a colleague in which he said he ""basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)"" about MCAS operations.

Families for the crash victims have objected to the Boeing settlement. In opposing their request that a judge overturn the deal, the Justice Department last month said its investigation did not produce definitive evidence on the cause of the crashes. 
Forkner is the only person criminally charged to date in connection with the MAX. The Justice Department in 2021 said the misconduct at Boeing was not facilitated by senior management.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's troubled Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp goes into a critical shareholder vote later on Thursday facing very long odds for winning support for its plan to spin-off its devices business.
Its top three shareholders - Effissimo Capital Management, 3D Investment Partners and Farallon Capital Management - all activist shareholders with which Toshiba management has had a contentious history - oppose the plan as do proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.
Also on the table is a proposal from Singapore-based 3D calling for Toshiba to solicit buyout offers from private equity - a motion that has the support of Effissimo, Farallon as well as Glass Lewis but, perhaps significantly, not ISS.
Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass.
Whatever the outcome, Thursday's vote represents another major battle in a four-year scandal-filled war being waged between the 146-year-old conglomerate and activist shareholders over the direction of the company. 
Toshiba management argues a spin-off is the best way to maximise shareholder value. Sources familiar with the matter have also said Toshiba hopes the plan would lift its share price to the point where activist shareholders would be enticed to leave.
Toshiba has rejected calls to seek a private equity buyout, arguing that potential offers suggested so far were insufficiently compelling and would raise concerns about the impact on its business and staff retention.
But opposition to Toshiba's plans has been widespread as well as vocal. Together, Effissimo, 3D and Farallon own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold about 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.
Prominent institutional investors which have disclosed they have voted against the spin-off include Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which owns 1.22%, the California Public Employees' Retirement System with 0.43% and the State Board of Administration of Florida with a 0.22% stake.
Large investors that have yet to reveal their votes include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) which owns more than 5%, Elliott Management which, according to sources, has nearly 5% and Vanguard which has 2.6% according to Refinitiv data.
None of Japan's major domestic asset managers have revealed their voting plans.
UNEVEN SUPPORT FOR 3D PROPOSAL
If the spin-off proposal fails, hedge fund investors are likely to emerge emboldened, gaining momentum in their push for a buyout. But even if management wins, some shareholders plan to fight on regardless, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Toshiba said it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.
""Large shareholders will stay unless share prices go up,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
""A private equity solution would be best for shareholders hoping for a quick exit with solid returns, but may not necessarily be best for Toshiba,"" he added.
Support for 3D's proposal is, however, somewhat less clear-cut than opposition to Toshiba's spin-off plan.
In addition to ISS advising against the proposal, CalPERS has voted against it. 
But Norway's sovereign wealth fund and Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management have voted in favour as has Toshiba external director Raymond Zage, a Farallon adviser who says he is a top 100 shareholder and has broken ranks with the public stance of the board.
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. 

Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

A stablecoin is a kind of digital asset that is devised to keep its value stable in relation to another asset, and are frequently used as a portal to other cryptocurrencies or to generate income in decentralised financial systems.
ANZ said it has delivered the Australian dollar stablecoin, which it calls A$DC, to a private wealth management firm for digital assets - Victor Smorgon Group - through digital asset investment platform Zerocap.

The company's move to mint digital assets linked to the Australian dollar comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said last year the growth of digital wallets could allow the exchange of tokens or digital forms of money that could be backed by the RBA, even as the central bank remains sceptical of the digital currency.
ANZ, the country's number three lender, said it has minted 30 million of A$DC using a smart contract and the coins were transferred between the parties and later redeemed back into Fiat currency.

GameStop and AMC were the top two most trending stocks on the retail investor-focused stocktwits.com on Wednesday.

The development comes months after Hertz announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla, primarily the EV maker's Model 3 vehicles. 
News of the massive deal had triggered a meteoric rally in Tesla's stock, helping it surpass $1 trillion in market value. However, Tesla boss Elon Musk later said the company had not signed a contract with Hertz.

Model Y was added to Hertz's fleet this week, news website Electrek reported on Wednesday. 
Last month, Florida-based Hertz named former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) finance chief Stephen Scherr as its top boss, replacing interim CEO Mark Fields.

SAN FRANCISCO/SEOUL (Reuters) -LG Energy Solution (LGES), a supplier for electric car makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid, said on Thursday in Korea it plans to invest 1.7 trillion Korean won ($1.4 billion) to build a battery factory in Arizona by 2024 to meet demand from ""prominent startups"" and other North American customers. 
This will be its first U.S. factory to make cylindrical cells, a type of battery that has been used in Tesla and Lucid vehicles, LGES said. Construction will begin in the second quarter of 2022, with mass production to start in 2024 with production capacity of 11 gigawatt hours, LGES said in a statement.
Earlier, Reuters reported that potential customers would include EV makers Tesla, Lucid and Proterra and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), maker of IQOS heated-tobacco sticks, among others. The report cited people familiar with the matter. 
LGES said in a statement that it plans to consider securing additional production capacity at its Arizona factory in the future.
""The Arizona factory could add further production capacity in the future as we are seeing growing demand for cylindrical batteries from various customers, including automakers and power tool makers,"" said an official at LGES. 
On Tuesday, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said battery production would be ""the limiting factor"" for vehicle production in two to three years. He has called on suppliers to raise production, while Tesla starts making cells itself. 
Tesla, Lucid and Proterra did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris declined to comment. 
Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, a Tesla supplier, along with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, is also looking to invest billions of dollars to build a factory to make a new type of electric vehicle (EV) battery for Tesla, public broadcaster NHK reported this month.
Panasonic is looking at building the factory in either Oklahoma or Kansas, not far from Tesla's new Texas vehicle plant, NHK reported.
Lucid Chief Financial Officer Sherry House told Reuters last month the company, which has a car factory in Arizona, had signed multi-year supply agreements with two battery suppliers, and the agreement ""does have some capacity coming from state-side cell lines.""
She did not identify the companies. Lucid sources batteries from LGES and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI. 

LGES, which raised more than $10 billion in its initial public offering in Korea in January, has announced a flurry of battery joint ventures with GM and Stellantis in the United States and Canada.
In August, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.

CHICAGO(Reuters) - Sky-high fertilizer prices have farmers worldwide scaling back its use and reducing the amount of land they're planting, fallout from the Ukraine-Russia conflict that has some agricultural industry veterans warning of food shortages.
Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertilizer is key to keeping corn, soy, rice and wheat yields high. Growers are scrambling to adjust.
The pivot can be seen in agricultural powerhouse Brazil, where some farmers are applying less fertilizer to their corn, and some federal legislators are pushing to open protected indigenous lands for the mining of potash. In Zimbabwe and Kenya, small farmers are reverting to using manure to nourish their crops. In Canada, one canola farmer has already stockpiled fertilizer for the 2023 season in anticipation of even higher prices ahead.
Farmers elsewhere are making similar moves. Reuters spoke with 34 people on six continents, including grain producers, agriculture analysts, traders and farm groups. All expressed concern about the cost and availability of fertilizer.
In the United States alone, fertilizer bills are expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% in 2021, according to American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.
Some growers are contemplating switching to crops that require fewer nutrients. Others plan to cultivate less acreage. Others say they'll simply use less fertilizer, a strategy crop experts predict will hurt yields. Production is most at risk in developing nations, whose farmers have fewer financial resources to weather the storm, said Tony Will, chief executive of Illinois-based CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), a leading producer of nitrogen fertilizer.
""My concern at the moment is actually one of a food crisis on a global basis,"" Will told Reuters.
On Saturday, Peru declared a state of emergency in its agriculture sector over fears of food insecurity.
The decree said the nation’s planted areas have fallen 0.2% since August due to rising fertilizer prices, and that the volume of grain Peru imports for animal feed has likewise declined over cost concerns. The government is now drafting a plan to increase the country's food supply. DOUBLE WHAMMY Global fertilizer prices were already high prior to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbor, as record natural gas and coal prices forced some fertilizer makers to cut output in that energy-hungry sector. Ukraine's cities have been besieged by missiles, tanks and troops in what Moscow has dubbed a ""special operation” to demilitarize the country. Russia denies targeting civilians in the conflict.
Western nations responded with tough economic sanctions on Russia, while the United States and the European Union imposed new sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has provided support for Russia's offensive.
Combined, Russia and Belarus accounted for more than 40% of global exports of potash last year, one of three critical nutrients used to boost crop yields, Dutch lender Rabobank said this month. Additionally, Russia accounted for about 22% of global exports of ammonia, 14% of the world's urea exports and about 14% of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) - all key kinds of fertilizers.
Sanctions have disrupted sales of fertilizer and crops from Russia. Many Western banks and traders are steering clear of Russian supplies for fear of running afoul of the rapidly changing rules, while shipping firms are avoiding the Black Sea region due to safety concerns.
It all amounts to a double whammy for the global food supply.
Russia and Ukraine are major grain producers. Together they account for about 30% of global wheat exports and 20% of corn exports. Grain shipments through the Black Sea have already been disrupted. Stalled deliveries from those two countries have helped spur galloping global food inflation. The World Bank said last week that a number of developing countries face near-term wheat supply shortages due to their high dependence on Ukrainian exports.
But the fertilizer crisis is in some respects more worrying because it could inhibit food production in the rest of the world that could help take up the slack, said Maximo Torero, chief economist for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
""If we don't resolve the problem of fertilizer, and trade of fertilizers doesn't continue, then we'll have a very serious problem of (food) supply next year,"" Torero told Reuters. BRAZIL AT RISK Brazil, the world's biggest soybean exporter, relies heavily on imported fertilizers such as potash, which accounted for 38% of the crop nutrients it used last year. Russia and Belarus were the source of half of those shipments.
Prior to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Brazilian farmers were already reducing corn plantings due to rising fertilizer prices. Soybean cultivation will likely be impacted as well, with growers expanding more slowly than in previous years, according to Agroconsult, a Brazilian agriculture consulting firm.
In the west-central state of Mato Grosso, farmer Cayron Giacomelli told Reuters he has already reduced fertilizer use on his current corn crop. He said he'll do the same when he plants soybeans later this year, a move he reckons might shrink his harvest by at least 8%.
Giacomelli said fertilizer is hard to get and that some dealers won't finalize sales until cargo ships dock in Brazil. He's still kicking himself for not closing a purchase he was negotiating just before Russia invaded Ukraine. ""I got distracted and now am paying more,"" Giacomelli said.
Lawmakers from Brazilian farm states, meanwhile, are pushing for legislation that would open indigenous lands in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to potash mining. That measure is opposed by members of the local Mura tribe, who say mining would despoil the natural habitat upon which they depend. The bill is still making its way through the nation's congress.
In Zimbabwe, scarce and pricy imports have forced corn growers such as Boniface Mutize to make their own fertilizer. ""We mix cow dung or chicken waste with zinc,"" he said.
It's the same in rural Kenya. Farmer Mary Kamau said she, too, has slashed purchases of commercial fertilizer and is using manure to nourish the coffee and avocados she grows on 12 acres in Murang'a County. She worries about the consequences for her family. ""If I don’t get a good harvest, I don't get good prices. And that will affect me for the next two years – it's not just this season,"" Kamau said.
FEWER ACRES, LESS FERTILIZER
In the United States, fifth-generation New Mexico farmer Mike Berry has similar worries. He recently paid $680 a ton for liquid nitrogen to fertilize his corn crop, an ""exorbitant"" price he said was 232% above last year's price.
Berry said he plans to cut his spring plantings of corn for livestock feed to about 300 acres from his usual 400 to 600 acres. Berry said he will also reduce applications of liquid nitrogen by about 30%, which could drop his yields by 25%.
Bottom line: ""We're going to produce less,"" he said.
That might seem short-sighted considering commodity prices have jumped sharply in recent weeks. But the cost of growing crops is outpacing potential revenue for many farmers.
""Planting decisions are increasingly being made not on market fundamentals but rather on the cost of production driven by the price and supply of fertilizer,"" dozens of U.S. lawmakers wrote in a March 17 letter to the U.S. International Trade Commission. They were seeking relief from duties on fertilizer imports from Morocco and Trinidad and Tobago.
U.S. farmer Don Batie described the stressful process of securing enough fertilizer for this year's planting.
""It's nuts,"" said Batie, who grows corn and soybeans on 1,500 acres in Lexington, Nebraska. ""By the time they get a price and they quote it to you, the price changes."" 
WHERE TO BUY?
Asia is struggling, too.
India, which imports fertilizer for its sprawling agriculture sector, is increasingly turning to Canada and Israel to replace its Russian supplies.
Thailand, meanwhile, is facing pressure on its signature rice crop. Russia and Belarus accounted for about 12% of its fertilizer imports last year, Thai government data show. But buying from elsewhere could prove tricky, in part because domestic price controls on fertilizer are squeezing Thai importers as global market prices explode, according to Plengsakdi Prakaspesat, president of the Thai Fertilizer and Agricultural Supplies Association.
""If you’re a merchant, and you're absolutely going to lose money, will you still import more stuff?"" Plengsakdi said.
China last year imposed fertilizer export curbs to protect its own farmers as global prices soared due to strong demand and high energy prices. Beijing was expected to ease those restrictions this year, potentially boosting world supply, said Gavin Ju, principal fertilizer analyst in the Shanghai office of commodities consultancy CRU. But he said that's less likely now with the global market in chaos.
Concerns over rising inflation and a protracted Ukraine war have some farmers planning well ahead.

In Manitoba, Canada, corn and canola farmer Bert Peeter recently agreed to spend more than $500,000 Canadian dollars buying 80% of the fertilizer he'll need - for 2023. Although prices are soaring, he figured things could still get worse. 
This ""might not be over after one year,"" Peeter said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and other carriers on Wednesday urged U.S. President Joe Biden to end a federal mask mandate on airplanes and international pre-departure testing requirements.
The airline executives, including the chairman of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue's CEO, said in a letter the restrictions ""are no longer aligned with the realities of the current epidemiological environment.""
The Biden administration this month opted to extend current COVID-19 mask requirements at airports, train stations, ride share vehicles and other transit modes through April 18. The order was set to expire on March 18.
""It makes no sense that people are still required to wear masks on airplanes, yet are allowed to congregate in 
crowded restaurants, schools and at sporting events without masks, despite none of these venues having the protective air filtration system that aircraft do,"" the airline letter said.
The White House declined to comment, but earlier this month said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was working to help develop ""a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor.""
Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a separate statement https://news.delta.com/delta-asks-biden-administration-end-covid-era-travel-restrictions said ""considering the improved public health metrics in the U.S. and medical advancements to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19, the federal mask mandate and pre-departure testing no longer fits with the current environment."" 
The letter also made reference to ""thousands of airline employees charged with enforcing"" the COVID rules.
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,942 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules
Last week, the U.S. Senate voted 57 to 40 to overturn the 13-month-old public health order requiring masks on airplanes and other forms of public transportation, a move that drew a quick veto threat from Biden.
The mask mandate has drawn significant opposition from Republicans who noted the CDC says 99.5% of Americans live in places where it is safe to ditch indoor masks.

The letter cited the CDC data arguing ""the science clearly supports lifting the mask mandate.""
The 2021 CDC order said the mask mandate could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in crowded transport settings.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Chinese emergency workers found on Wednesday one of two black boxes from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) plane that crashed with 132 people onboard, but U.S. efforts to join the investigation are on hold because of COVID-19 quarantine rules.
The black box device recovered is the plane's cockpit voice recorder, based on an early assessment, a Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) official told a media briefing, adding that the recording material appeared to have survived impact in relatively good shape.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast on Monday when the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet suddenly plunged from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent before landing.
The cause of the crash has yet to be determined. Most of the jet appears to have disintegrated upon impact, although some debris and human remains have been found. 
""An initial inspection showed that the exterior of the recorder has been severely damaged, but the storage units, while also damaged to some extent, are relatively complete,"" CAAC official Zhu Tao said.
The black box is being sent to an institute in Beijing for decoding, although how long that takes would depend on the extent of the damage, Zhu said.
Weather along the flight path on Monday did not pose any danger to the aircraft and air controllers had communication with it after take-off and prior to its rapid descent, said Mao Yanfeng, head of aircraft investigation at CAAC.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that Chinese authorities had invited the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in the investigation of the crash, adding that he was very encouraged by the invitation to be on the ground in China.
The NTSB, however, later said it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China in light of visa and quarantine requirements.
""We are working with the Department of State to address those issues with the Chinese government before any travel will be determined,"" the NTSB said.
China has very few COVID cases and strict requirements for at least two weeks of hotel quarantine on arrival for citizens and foreigners. A World Health Organization team that last year investigated the origins of the pandemic had to quarantine first.
The crash investigation is being led by China but the United States is invited to take part because the plane was manufactured there.
The Chinese authorities have said the plane, which did not respond to repeated calls during its descent, met airworthiness standards before take-off and all three pilots - one more than normally required on a 737 - were in good health.
The captain, hired in January 2018, had 6,709 hours flying experience, while the first and second officers had 31,769 hours and 556 hours, respectively, a China Eastern official said.
""From what we know, the performance of the three pilots had been good and their family life relatively harmonious,"" the official said.
One co-pilot was an observer to build up experience, the airline said.
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS
China Eastern tightened precautions after the crash, requiring two senior captains and a senior co-pilot on a three-person crew on some aircraft types, state-backed The Paper said.
Heavy rain in southern China on Wednesday hampered the search for victims and black boxes, with wet weather forecast to last the rest of the week. 
Grief-stricken relatives visited the site, among them a retiree surnamed Zhang from Shenzhen, whose eyes filled with tears as he told Reuters his nephew was onboard.
""I hope the country can thoroughly investigate this matter and find out whether it was the manufacturer's fault or it was a maintenance problem,"" Zhang said. 
CAAC has launched a two-week inspection of the sector, involving checks on all regional air traffic control centres, airline companies and flight training institutes to ensure ""absolute"" safety.
FlightRadar24 data showed the aircraft plunged rapidly at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
China has improved air safety over the past two decades, and Monday's disaster was the first major crash in a dozen years.

China Eastern and two subsidiaries have grounded their fleet of more than 200 Boeing 737-800 jets. An airline official said the move was more an emergency reaction to the crash rather than a response to any safety issue.
The disaster comes as Boeing is working to recover from several crises, notably safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes and the impact on travel from the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Chinese authorities said on Wednesday they had recovered one of the black boxes of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged into a mountainside on Monday with 132 people on board.
The device recovered is the plane's cockpit voice recorder, based on an early assessment, an official from China's aviation regulator said, adding that the recording material appeared to have survived impact in relatively good shape.
Both of the jet's black boxes were manufactured by Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), the regulator said, without naming the models.
This is how the black box readout process works.
WHAT ARE BLACK BOXES?
They are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They are mandatory.
The aim is not to establish legal liability but to identify causes and help prevent accidents.
HOW HAVE THEY EVOLVED?
The earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Modern ones use solid state memory.
The recordings are housed inside crash-survivable containers able to withstand 3,400 times the force of gravity on impact.
Both black box recordings were recovered from a Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash in March 2019 that, like the China Eastern plane, dove into the ground at a very high velocity.
HOW BIG ARE THEY?
They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and contain four main parts:
* a chassis or interface designed to secure the device and facilitate recording and playback
* an underwater locator beacon
* the core housing or ""Crash-Survivable Memory Unit"" made of stainless steel or titanium
* inside there, the recordings on chips or older formats.
There are two recorders: a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) for pilot voices and cockpit sounds, and a flight data recorder (FDR) that captures information on parameters including altitude, airspeed, heading and engine thrust.
HOW WILL THE RECORDERS BE HANDLED?
Technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean connections to make sure they do not accidentally erase data. The audio or data file must be downloaded and copied.
The data itself means nothing at first. It must be decoded from raw files before being turned into graphs.
Investigators sometimes use ""spectral analysis"" - a way of examining sounds that allows scientists to pick out barely audible alarms or the first fleeting crack of an explosion.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?
It will depend on the exact models of the Honeywell recorders, which has not been disclosed. 
An Air India Express 737-800 with two Honeywell black boxes that crashed in 2020 after overshooting a runway in heavy rain had a CVR capable of 120 minutes of digital audio, according to a final report into the crash.
That would be more than enough to cover the 66-minute China Eastern flight.
The FDR on the Air India Express plane recorded about 25 hours of flight data. 
WHERE WILL THE DATA BE READ?
The first black box discovered is being sent to an institute in Beijing for decoding, although how long that takes would depend on the extent of the damage, said Zhu Tao, an official at China's aviation regulator.
WHEN WILL RESULTS BE MADE PUBLIC?

Interim reports into a crash are published after a month but are often sparse. Deeper investigations take a year or more to complete.
Experts say air accidents are usually caused by a cocktail of factors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) said on Wednesday hundreds of its customers may have been affected by a security breach involving hacking group Lapsus$, amid criticism of the digital authentication firm's slow response to the intrusion that knocked its shares down about 11 percent.
The breach sparked concern because the cyber extortion gang had posted what appeared to be internal screenshots from within the organization's network roughly a day ago.
Okta's Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a series of blog posts that the ""maximum potential impact"" was to 366 customers whose data was accessed by an outside contractor.
The contractor, the Miami-based Sitel Group, employed an engineer whose laptop the hackers had hijacked, Bradbury said, adding that the 366 figure represented a ""worst case scenario"" and that the hackers had been constrained in their range of possible actions.
A representative for Sykes, a subsidiary of the Sitel Group, said in an emailed statement that the company was unable to comment on its relationship to its customers but it undertook an ""immediate and comprehensive"" investigation into the breach and had since determined there was no longer a security risk.
San Francisco-based Okta helps employees of more than 15,000 organizations securely access their networks and applications, so any breach there could have serious consequences.
Bradbury said the intruders would have been unable to perform actions such as downloading customer databases or accessing Okta's source code.
Okta, whose market capitalization is $26 billion, has been criticized for its reaction to the hack, which struck some experts as initially dismissive. The disquiet increased when it emerged that the company either had known - or could have known - that there was a problem much earlier.
Okta first got wind of a potential breach in January, Bradbury said, explaining that it warned the Sitel Group right away. But it was only on March 10 that Sitel received a forensic report about the incident, giving Okta a summary of the findings a week later.

Bradbury said he was ""greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report.""
The hack - and Okta's reaction to it - has made some investors nervous. The 10.74 percent fall in share price was the worst one-day percentage drop since 2018, and Raymond James Equity Research downgraded the stock from ""strong buy"" to ""market perform,"" in part citing Okta's handling of the incident.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Wednesday said it would allow  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot aimed at countering appmakers' concerns about high fees and allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing in some countries in the coming months.
The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play's billing system in their apps.
""This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,"" Google said in a blog post.
Under a new competition law in South Korea last year, Google also said it would allow developers to introduce a second payment system alongside its own there.
Spotify said its trial with Google was part of a ""multi-year agreement,"" without elaborating.
App developers such as Spotify that sell digital goods have complained for years about having to use the official payment systems of the Play store and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store. 
Google and Apple collect up to 30% of each payment as a fee, which developers say is too high. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said that they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

Google did not specify the fee that it would collect in the new pilot.
The company is ramping up enforcement of its Google Play Billing requirement, and it has said non-compliant apps could be blocked from publishing updates starting on Friday.

The request is contained in a letter that is expected to be sent to Telecom Italia (TIM) later on Wednesday, the person added.
KKR in November submitted a non-binding 10.8 billion euro takeover proposal for TIM after investing 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network. 
Telecom Italia left the New York-based fund waiting nearly four months without an answer. But its board this month agreed to engage in talks, and gave its top executives a mandate to determine the scope and length of KKR's possible due diligence analysis. KKR had asked in November for a four week due diligence period.
TIM has said that its board also told CEO Pietro Labriola and Chairman Salvatore Rossi to better understand the terms of KKR's offer, asking in particular what effect it would have on TIM's already high debt. 
Debt normally amounts to the bulk of the financing of buyout offers such as KKR's. But TIM's debt load, which amounts to 22 billion euros, will make it hard for KKR to load it up with more debt if it completes the deal - as buyout firms typically do, bankers have said.
KKR in its letter on Wednesday said that the financial structure of the company would not change substantially were its offer to go through, according to the source. 

In the latest sign of the group's financial fragility, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) on Wednesday cut its debt rating of TIM to 'BB' with a negative outlook.
The decision follows debt downgrades by Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service and Fitch Ratings after TIM unveiled a record 2021 loss and a weak outlook as the new CEO Labriola presented a plan to separate its network assets from its services arm.

Responding to Western sanctions that have hit Russia's economy hard, President Vladimir Putin said Moscow will seek payment in roubles for natural gas sales from ""unfriendly"" countries, while its forces bombed areas of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv a month into their assault.
Oil prices rallied 5% to over $121 a barrel and natural gas futures also jumped. [O/R] While higher oil prices benefit energy shares, they are a negative for consumers and many businesses. The S&P 500 energy sector rose 1.7% and utilities gained 0.2%, while all of the other major S&P 500 sectors were lower on the day.
""These geopolitical problems are sort of hanging over the market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""The resurgence of oil prices is giving people pause,"" he said, adding, ""There needs to be a resolution with Russia. That's going to hold the market back.""
The day's decline follows a recent string of gains as the market recovered from lows hit amid the conflict and increased worries about inflation and higher interest rates.
Among the day's biggest drags, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc's stock slid 9.3% after the Photoshop maker late Tuesday forecast downbeat second-quarter revenue and profit and sees an impact on fiscal 2022 revenue due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 448.96 points, or 1.29%, to 34,358.5, the S&P 500 lost 55.37 points, or 1.23%, to 4,456.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.21 points, or 1.32%, to 13,922.60.
Investors continued to assess the outlook for U.S. interest rates. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Wednesday she is open to raising rates by 50 basis points in May, joining other policymakers in saying so.
Last week, the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said it will pause all ads containing content that exploits, dismisses or condones the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Its stock fell 1.1%.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares jumped 14.5% after Chairman Ryan Cohen's investment company bought 100,000 shares of the videogame retailer.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.81-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 43 new highs and 60 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.69 billion shares, compared with the 14.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – Stocks fell on Wednesday on the prospect of more sanctions by the West on Russia and higher oil prices.
President Joe Biden headed to Brussels for a meeting with members of the G-7 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the situation in Ukraine as Russia continued its attack.
The White House and Allies are preparing to unveil additional sanctions, including on members of Russia’s parliament. Oil returned to near $120 a barrel, stoking concerns higher fuel prices would sap the economic recovery just as the Federal Reserve starts to rein in its stimulus programs.
Already food and other household items are more expensive, and some states have suspended their own tax on gasoline to ease prices at the pump for American drivers.
More Fed officials spoke this week about the need to raise interest rates more aggressively, fanning expectations the central bank will make two half-point hikes at its next two meetings. The Fed normally raises rates in quarter-point increments, as it did last week for the first time since it began its pandemic-era stimulus.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Meme stocks
The meme stock crowd appears to be coming to life lately. Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) jumped Wednesday after chairman Ryan Cohen increased his stake, buying another 100,000 shares.
The purchase takes Cohen's slice of the video game retailer to 11.9% as he tries to pivot the company in light of a changing market. The gain in GameStop stock adds to a nearly 30% rally during Tuesday's session.
Cohen, who co-founded pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), acquired the shares through his investment company RC Ventures and paid between $96.81 and $108.82 for the stake, according to a filing.
2. Home builders
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shares dropped 5.7% in extended trading, adding to the regular session's 4.6% loss after the company reported earnings that missed expectations.
The homebuilding company announced earnings per share of $1.47 on revenue of $1.4 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.54 on revenue of $1.5 billion. The company said supply chain issues intensified and an already-constrained construction labor force was further stressed, which extended build times and delayed completions and planned deliveries.
3. Oil prices
Oil is bouncing back above $120 a barrel after U.S. government data showed weekly consumption far beyond market estimates, while major producer Russia continued to cite outages on the Caspian pipeline that played on the nerves of traders.
U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, benchmark is up about 9% on the week.

(Reuters) -Wall Street pushed stocks and Treasury yields down on Wednesday after both had powered higher earlier in the week as investors took in the strength of the economy and hawkish comments from U.S. policymakers. 
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have risen sharply so far in March and were set for their biggest monthly jump since 2004. Investors have been relatively sanguine about the implications of higher yields on stock market valuations, with many choosing to buy back in after a bruising few months for equity prices. 
That narrative took a pause on Wednesday as major U.S. equities indexes declined more than 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 448.96 points, or 1.29%, to 34,358.5; the S&P 500 lost 55.41 points, or 1.23%, to 4,456.2; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.21 points, or 1.32%, to 13,922.60.
European stocks also fell about 1%, with a pan-European equity benchmark hitting a new one-month high in early London trading before falling back as traders took profits. MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks declined 0.9%.
Investors were still trying to make up their minds about interest rates and stocks. 
""Although there is widespread criticism, it's too early to take the view that the Fed won't be able to negotiate the fine line of reducing inflation without derailing growth,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer, UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""Given a higher degree of uncertainty, rather than make a directional play on stocks moving higher, we prefer selected overweight and underweight positions, yielding an overall neutral allocation to equities."" 
BOND SELL-OFF
The most eye-catching moves recently have been in the bond market, although there was some reversal on Wednesday. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 4.8 basis points at 2.107%. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 7.6 basis points to 2.301%.
The sharp rise in short-dated yields has flattened the gap between two- and 10-year U.S. yields to its lowest levels since the coronavirus pandemic hit global markets in March 2020. An inverted yield curve is widely seen as a predictor of future U.S. recessions. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) market strategists wrote in a recent note that markets have rebounded recently because investors are ""looking through the hawkish Fed and ominous signal"" from the rates curve flattening.
""We believe this is warranted given strong economic fundamentals, our expectation the (two-year and 10-year Treasury) curve will stay positive this year, and moderating risks of large energy supply disruptions,"" they wrote. 
The economics conversation came as Western leaders began gathering in Brussels to plan more measures to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt his month-old Ukraine campaign; Putin, in response, said Moscow planned to switch its gas sales to ""unfriendly"" countries to roubles.
Oil prices rose in volatile trading on Wednesday, supported by disruption of Russian and Kazakh crude exports. U.S. crude recently rose 4.71% to $114.42 per barrel and Brent was at $121.37, up 5.1% on the day.
Gold prices also gained on Wednesday as investors looked to shield against soaring inflation and uncertainty caused by events in Ukraine, with elevated U.S. bond yields capping gains in non-interest-bearing metal. Spot gold added 1.3% to $1,946.44 an ounce.
Currency market activity continued to be relatively subdued, confirming the lack of clear directional trends.

Against the U.S. dollar, the yen was up about 0.25% by 2000 GMT/4 pm ET, but held around 121 yen after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was premature to debate the exit from ultra-loose monetary policy.
The euro and sterling fell about 0.25% and 0.4% respectively against a broadly stronger dollar.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday as investors continued to digest the recent moves by the Federal Reserve ahead of President Joe Biden’s trip to Europe to discuss further sanctions on Russia. Falling bond yields hit bank shares.
At 4:16 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 448 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.3%.
The three main indexes on Wall Street closed higher Tuesday, with the Dow climbing over 250 points, or 0.7%, the S&P rising 1.1% and the Nasdaq gaining 2%.
The Federal Reserve raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at its meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018, and Chairman Jerome Powell pointed Monday to more aggressive moves in the future in order to combat soaring inflation.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, normally seen as leaning toward the dovish end of the spectrum, added her voice Tuesday to those calling for the Fed to raise interest rates quickly.
Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine and the associated sanctions have exacerbated already high energy and commodity prices, adding to the concerns the U.S. central bank has over domestic inflation. 
President Joe Biden traveled to Europe Wednesday to meet with allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union to discuss the West’s response to Russia, amid expectations that further measures to punish Moscow are likely.
The war in Ukraine continued to rage on Wednesday, with Russian troops continuing to bombard the capital Kyiv, Chernihiv, and the Black Sea port of Mariupol.
In the corporate sector, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock slipped premarket, the software giant beat its first quarter targets, but disappointed with its guidance, while BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) stock was still ticking up after it announced job cuts and the departure of top editors.
Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) posted an 8% rise in fourth quarter revenue, its slowest growth since going public in 2004.  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) also report results Wednesday. 
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, while European countries continue to debate sanctions on Russian energy exports.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, led by bank stocks as Treasury yields retreated after rising oil prices renewed worries about the inflation drag on global growth.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 448 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.3%.
Crude oil exports from Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal, which are shipped via the Russian port of Novorossiysk, were suspended following weather-related disruptions, triggering fresh fears of supply shortages.
The move higher in oil prices returned focus to the threat higher inflation poses to global growth just as investors mull the prospect of the Fed hiking rates more aggressively at its meetings in May and June.
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard reiterated on Wednesday the Fed needs to act ""faster"" on raising interest rates as inflation is ""way over"" the central bank's target. 
The market currently expects the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points at its May and June meetings.  
The bets on a hawkish Fed exacerbated worries the Fed may overshoot of rate hikes and slow the economy into recession, triggering a fresh flight to safe heavens such as bonds.
Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, fell and weighed on bank stocks.  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) led the move lower.
Tech, which tends to benefit from the falling rates, was mostly in the red, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bucked the trend, to close up nearly 1% higher. 
Apple’s iPhone 13 is seeing “stellar” demand globally, and likely “setting up for a monster growth cycle over the next 12 to 18 that is not baked into shares at current levels,” Wedbush said in a note.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell as much as 9% after its software guidance overshadowed quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, and stoked fears about peaking growth.  
“These results further support our thesis of peaking net new DM ARR, which we have believed would result in less forward upside to consensus estimates and drive decelerating revenue growth, which we anticipated will weigh on the stock’s performance,” Credit Suisse said in a note as it cut its price target on the stock to $525 from $625.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), meanwhile, gained more than 2% after raising its full-year outlook following better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
Meme stocks remained on the comeback trail. GameStop (NYSE:GME) added 14% to its 30% gain a day earlier after GameStop Chair Ryan Cohen on Tuesday bought an additional 100,000 shares, expanding his stake in the video game retailer to 11.9%.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was up 14%.

(Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will not help websites, apps and YouTube channels sell ads alongside content that it deems exploits, dismisses or condones the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. company said Wednesday.
Google, whose advertising software helps publishers generate revenue, bars ads from appearing next to content that incites violence and denies tragic events. It is broadly applying those policies to the war.
""We can confirm that we're taking additional steps to clarify, and in some instances expand our monetization guidelines as they relate to the war in Ukraine,"" Google spokesman Michael Aciman said.
In an email to publishers seen by Reuters, Google said ads would not run alongside, for example, ""claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens.""
Google also bars ads that capitalize on sensitive events and has applied that policy to the war.
Senior Russian officials say Western media has misreported the conflict in Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize the country.
Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday that Russia's communications regulator had blocked Google's aggregator service Google News, accusing it of allowing access to what Russia calls fake material about the military operation in Ukraine.

Many major Western advertising and social media services have announced new content and payment restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union. 
Earlier this month, Google said it had stopped selling all online ads in Russia.

266,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 03:22PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russian steel giant Severstal was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country's first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began, with international payment lines snarled by sanctions.
Severstal, whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union, has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment to its creditors.
A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.
""This will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold,"" Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.
""But people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated, rather than the company's fault,"" adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days, especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm, which itself is not sanctioned. 
With Wednesday's deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues, and that it was looking at an application for special ""licences"" that may be required to make the payment.
The legal terms of the bonds state an ""Event of Default"" can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date. 
The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.
Previously payments like Severstal's would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear, which confirm asset ownership, and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).
However both Euroclear, owned by a group of global exchanges and banks, and Clearstream, part of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU's sanctions.
Neither Clearstream, Euroclear nor  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) responded to requests for comment.
DELAYS POSSIBLE
A Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, but it may not be alone.
Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end, ITI Capital analysts estimate, while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.
Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts, most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States - under whose laws most international market bonds are issued. 
Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which made a payment without problems earlier this month, Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28, the same day as Russia's next international sovereign bond payment falls due.
It's not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal, Russia's top steelmaker NLMK, state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders, the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.
NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money, Russian holders hadn't.
""This is due to the fact that... Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia's NSD,"" NLMK said. ""We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents."" 
NSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear, but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.
""After curbs are lifted, payments will be processed...as usual,"" it said.
The daily Kommersant newspaper, citing a source at a large brokerage firm, said some Russian holders of Moscow's sovereign bonds also hadn't received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday. 
The Russian finance ministry, Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment. 

""Delays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories,"" NSD added in a statement to Reuters. 
""This could be linked to 'manual' processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators"".

LONDON (Reuters) -Nestle is to halt the sale of a wide range of brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik, amid Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's criticism of the world's biggest food company for its continued presence in the country.
The products affected, also including pet food and coffee, make up the ""vast majority of volume and sales"" in Russia, which totalled 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.82 billion) in 2021, a Nestle spokesperson said.
The Swiss company had already halted non-essential imports and exports to Russia and had also stopped all advertising and capital investment in the country and said it would donate profits from Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts.
Western companies with a presence in Russia have been trying to provide essential food and medicine while also facing pressure to cut all ties with Moscow.
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, leaving behind assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate. 
Zelenskiy said Nestle had not done enough to live up to its ""Good Food, Good Life"" slogan by continuing to operate in Russia. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Nestle, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), are continuing to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene in Russia, such as milk and diapers. 
French rival Danone on Wednesday said it would continue local production in Russia of essential dairy and infant nutrition products. 
Danone said it had ceased all other imports and exports - including Evian water - and halted all investments, including advertising, brand activations and consumer promotions in Russia. The company also said it was taking no cash, dividends or profits from its Russian business.
Zelenskiy on Wednesday told French lawmakers that French companies must leave the Russian market.
Nestle said it would continue to pay its roughly 7,000 employees in Russia, where it has six factories that make products including ready meals, beverages and pet food.
Nestle also said that it stands with the people of Ukraine and its 5,800 employees in the country. 
Nestle has in the past been criticised by activist groups and governments over issues including bottled-water manufacturing, a decision to stay in South Africa during apartheid, and baby formula marketing.
Before its move Wednesday, Nestle was denounced by Ukrainian politicians as well as hactivist group ""Anonymous"", which also urged a product boycott.
Jaideep Prabhu, a professor of marketing at the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School, told Reuters ""There's a history of protesting against Nestle."" 
""Nestle is much more front and centre than P&G and Unilever when it comes to people knowing that they make their products,"" he said. ""Nestle's logos are very prominent on its products.""

Nestle shares closed down 1.6%.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 stumbled Wednesday as rising oil prices resumed worries about the inflation drag on global growth at a time when Federal Reserve officials continue to talk up faster rate hikes.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.96%, or 335 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.74%.
Crude oil exports from Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal, which are shipped via the Russian port of novorossiysk, were suspended following weather-related disruptions, triggering fresh fears of supply shortages.

The move higher in oil prices returned focus to the threat higher inflation poses to global growth just as investors mull the prospect of the Fed hiking rates more aggressively at its meetings in May and June.
The market currently expects the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points at its May and June meetings.  
The bets on a hawkish Fed exacerbated worries the Fed may overshoot of rate hikes and slow the economy into recession, triggering a fresh flight to safe heavens such as bonds.
Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, fell and weighed on bank stocks.  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) led the move lower.
Tech, which tends to benefit from the falling rates, was mostly in the red, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bucked the trend up more than 1%.
Apple’s iPhone 13 is seeing “steller” demand globally, and likely “setting up for a monster growth cycle over the next 12 to 18 that is not baked into shares at current levels,” Wedbush said in a note.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell as much as 10% after its software guidance overshadowing quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, and stoked fears about peaking growth.  
“These results further support our thesis of peaking net new DM ARR, which we have believed would result in less forward upside to consensus estimates and drive decelerating revenue growth, which we anticipated will weigh on the stock’s performance,” Credit Suisse said in a note as it cut its price target on the stock to $525 from $625.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), meanwhile, gained more than 2% after raising its full-year outlook as following better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
Meme stocks remained on the comeback trail. GameStop (NYSE:GME) added 11% to its 30% gain a day earlier after GameStop Chair Ryan Cohen on Tuesday bought an additional 100,000 shares, expanding his stake in the video game retailer to 11.9%.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was up 19%.
In other news, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) fell nearly 9% after confirming that a hacking group known as Lapsus$ had carried out a cyber attack, though said "

While there's no specific fundamental reason that would explain today's move higher, Allego stock has been regularly cited on social media websites Twitter and Stocktwits in recent days. The stock was halted four times on volatility over the course of Wednesday trading, and has continued to push towards new highs throughout trading.
Twitter data traffic shows that Allego stock has seen a surge in volume, alongside  Society Pass  (NASDAQ:SOPA) and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS).
Today's move comes after meme stocks surged higher yesterday, led by GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC).

Cohen, who founded the pet-supply startup Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc., is a major investor and activist. His RC Ventures LLC purchased GameStop shares between $96.81 and $108.82 each, bringing his total to just over 9 million shares, according to a securities filing.
“I put my money where my mouth is,” Cohen said in a tweet late Tuesday. 
GameStop shares jumped 10% to $135.61 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. After a 31% increase on Tuesday, the gains so far this week amount to the most since March of last year.
Cohen joined the board of GameStop early last year and became chairman in June with a vision to revive growth at the Grapevine, Texas-based company, which has slowed as players shifted from buying gaming discs to digital downloads. GameStop has also suffered from a combination of supply chain issues and an opaque business strategy, and over the last several years it’s churned through a variety of business concepts with mixed reactions from investors and customers.
But Cohen hasn’t said much publicly since his arrival at GameStop. The market has been waiting to hear more about GameStop’s plans for its NFT marketplace initiative after reports of the project surfaced earlier this year. The company last month announced a partnership with Australian gaming startup Immutable X to establish a fund to provide grants to NFT content creators. In its most recent earnings announcement earlier this month, GameStop said it would provide Immutable with as much as $150 million in IMX tokens if it achieves certain milestones.
GameStop’s shares have swung wildly over the past year as the company became the poster child for the meme stock movement. It has been championed by retail investors who organize in online forums like Reddit and boosted the stock by more than 700% last year. The shares are down 17% so far this year. 
Other stocks that got caught up in the retail-trader rally last year were also climbing Wednesday, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. and Koss Corp.

DENVER (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator Tallgrass Energy is looking for growth from international markets and recently hired a business development professional to lead such efforts, the company said on Wednesday. 
Tallgrass hired Sally Sun in January as vice president of international business development to oversee its outreach to international customers ""on a range of opportunities,"" the company said in a statement and according to Sun's LinkedIn profile. 
Sun was previously Sempra LNG's vice president of marketing, origination and commercial development for Asia Pacific. She also worked as vice president of LNG marketing for Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc from 2016 to 2019, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Tallgrass operates both crude and natural gas pipelines around the United States, with a focus in the Rockies, upper Midwest and Appalachian regions. The company was acquired in 2020 for about $6.3 billion by a group led by private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc.
""We believe that international markets are a logical home for incremental U.S. energy production,"" a spokesperson for Tallgrass said in a statement, adding that the company's assets were a ""critical link in the chain between energy producers and those markets.""

""Better positioning ourselves by talking actively with international markets, and educating international customers about Tallgrass’ assets, is critical,"" the spokesperson added.
Rival Williams recently hired two veteran executives to help set up a LNG marketing arm.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India has frozen plans to allow local firms to list overseas as it seeks to bolster its own capital markets, government officials and industry sources said, in a blow to foreign funds and stock exchanges seeking to tap into the country's tech boom.
New Delhi's decision marks a sudden reversal in policy after officials said late last year that the new rules for overseas listings would be announced in February.
Three senior government officials with direct knowledge of the decision told Reuters the plan had been put on hold as India believes there is enough depth in local capital markets for firms to raise funds and get good valuations. They declined to be named as the move has not been made public.
India's finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Indian equity markets have boomed as enthusiastic retail investors and a pandemic-induced flood of easy money pushed prices to record highs, encouraging a slew of Indian tech founders to go local with their initial public offerings (IPOs).
More than 60 companies made their market debut in India in 2021 and raised a total of more than $13.7 billion, which was more than the previous three years combined. Like other global markets, Indian stocks have been rattled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the volatility has delayed IPO plans.
But the outlook for such listings dimmed after digital payments app Paytm, backed by China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Ant and Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), plunged on its debut in November, raising questions about valuations. Its shares have slumped 75% from its issue price. 
Even before Paytm's rout, U.S. venture capitalists such as Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital had lobbied Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow Indian firms to list abroad to achieve better valuations, Reuters has reported.
A second government official said the overseas listing rules were now in ""limbo"" and both the officials cited the stock market debut of food-delivery giant Zomato, which clocked a high valuation, as contributing to the change of view. 
When Zomato went public on Mumbai's exchange in July, its offer was 38 times oversubscribed and its stock jumped 66%. And Indian cosmetics-to-fashion platform Nykaa surged 96% on its debut, achieving a valuation of nearly $14 billion. 
Both have given up much of those gains in recent months.
Two industry sources briefed by government officials also said they had been told the plan was on hold, which also marks a setback for exchanges in New York and London, which had been vying for a slice of India's rapidly growing start-up economy. 
LOBBYING
Global investors have pushed for India to allow overseas listings, saying foreign markets would give Indian companies better access to liquidity and capital. But such a move, which has been under consideration since at least 2020, has deeply divided Indian policy makers. 
Nationalist group Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party, opposed the plan, saying such listings would mean less Indian oversight of domestic firms, while Indian investors would find it more difficult to trade in shares of companies listing abroad.
Despite intense lobbying against the change, India's Revenue Secretary said in August last year that overseas listing rules could be announced by February. 
A source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Wednesday that representatives of Swadeshi Jagran Manch lobbied India's Finance Minister in a closed-door meeting in January to not proceed with the policy announcement. 
Though the group is widely seen as having strong influence on India's policy making, it is not clear if that particular meeting contributed to the government's decision.

One senior industry executive who has lobbied New Delhi to allow foreign listings said its decision could result in pressure for other changes by Indian companies.
""Some (investor) funds may want Indian companies to register outside the country,"" the executive said, adding that such a move could allow them to list overseas more easily.

(Reuters) -Nvidia Corp is interested in exploring using  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) for manufacturing its chips, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said on a call with reporters on Wednesday.
""They're interested in us using their foundries. We're very interested in exploring it,"" Huang said. But he added that foundry discussions take a long time as it's about integrating supply chains. 
Early last year, Intel, which was making mostly chips it designed, decided to expand its business into making chips that others design as well, called the foundry business, and has announced several multibillion-dollar projects for new manufacturing centers in the United States and Europe. 
Intel's shares rose as much as 2.5% following Huang's comments. 
Investors have been watching for public commitments by chip design companies to use Intel's chip factories. Last year Intel said Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) would be customers for its foundry business.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters after a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday that his company is ""thrilled for their interest in using our foundry capabilities."" He said he had ""no particular timeline."" He confirmed that there were ongoing discussions with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
""I'm sure he's interested in having more options ... and it doesn't cost him anything to say that,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon about Huang's comments. ""But it doesn't tell you anything at all about what it's actually going to look like when they get there."" 
Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. builds the bulk of Nvidia chips and Huang said ""being a foundry at the caliber of a TSMC is not for the faint of heart,"" adding that it requires a change in culture to provide not just processes but service.

Asked about whether he would be concerned about working with a competitor like Intel, Huang said trusting and working with industry partners is key and Nvidia has been partnering with many companies including Intel for a long time. 
""Intel has known our secrets for years,"" he said.

280,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 01:26PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Energy firms said they do not want U.S. federal energy regulators to apply new greenhouse gas emission guidelines to currently pending gas pipeline applications.
On Feb. 17, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) modified its policies to determine whether to approve permits for new gas pipelines to include greenhouse gas emissions, a move analysts said would present hurdles for new energy projects.
The greenhouse gas policy requires any project that would result in 100,000 metric tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions must complete an environmental impact statement, which analysts said was an expensive and time-consuming process.
While the FERC rules have not been finalized, energy data and analytics firm Enverus said in a note on Tuesday that the interim greenhouse gas policy was in place.
The FERC, which has increased its focus on controlling greenhouse gas emissions since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, has said the changes would apply to all new and currently pending gas pipeline applications.
In response, U.S. energy companies  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Boardwalk Pipeline jointly submitted a letter on March 14 asking FERC to not apply the new review to currently pending projects.
Other energy firms have since supported Kinder/Boardwalk's motion asking FERC to reconsider the regulator's position.
""Retroactively applying new standards to currently pending applications violates basic tenets of fairness and due process - especially since the Interim Policy Statements are moving targets that almost certainly will change,"" Kinder and Boardwalk said in their filing.
Kinder and Boardwalk said FERC's policy would cause developers and investors to delay decisions on new projects at exactly the wrong moment ""as war rages in Europe and our allies seek energy security"" after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Energy companies were not the only ones upset about the new FERC guidelines.

Earlier in March, top U.S. senators from both parties grilled Democratic FERC commissioners for approving the new guidelines, which prompt regulators to consider more environmental, landowner and climate issues when considering new pipelines.
The two Republican Commissioners at FERC opposed the new guidelines.

The top Italian insurer is facing a power struggle over its board composition at a shareholder vote late next month. 
The outgoing board has put forward Donnet for a third term as CEO and nominated Andrea Sironi, a leading international expert in governance and risk management who has served as dean of Milan's Bocconi University, as new chairman.
Those nominees are backed by Generali's major shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY). 
Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio who are, respectively, Generali's second- and third-largest investors, are opposing Donnet's reappointment as they challenge the influence of Mediobanca. 
Caltagirone has submitted his own slate of nominees proposing Cirina as CEO, a role that Frenchman Donnet has held since 2016, and Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and former chairman of Italian state investor CDP, as chairman.
Cirina and Costamagna plan to hold a news conference on Friday in Milan. 

Generali told Cirina that all obligations of his contract remain in force, including those related to the protection of confidential company information and compliance with internal policies regarding relations with the media, financial analysts, rating agencies, investors and authorities, it said.
The head of German unit Giovanni Liverani will take over as interim Austria and Central and Eastern Europe (ACEE) regional officer with immediate effect.

MILAN (Reuters) -Saipem core investors Eni and CDP together with a pool of banks are ready to advance 1.5 billion euros of an overall 2 billion euro capital increase to rescue the troubled Italian energy service group, two sources said.
The two investors, tied by a shareholder pact, will stump up in advance most of their share of the planned cash call by injecting more than 600 million euros, one of the sources said.
At the same time Eni, which owns 30.4% of Saipem, will temporarily guarantee a bridge-to-cash call loan provided by a pool of eight banks worth 855 million euros ($941 million).
State-owned trade credit insurer SACE is then expected to step in, at a later date, to guarantee the bridge loan when it has had time to process complex paper work, two sources said.
On Wednesday CDP Chief Executive Dario Scannapieco said he was confident about finding a solution for Saipem.
Saipem shares, which have lost more than 40% since the start of the year, were up 7.4% in late trading.
Saipem stunned investors in January when it downgraded earnings by a billion euros due to a significant deterioration of margins on some contracts, sending its shares tumbling.
In February it said it would cut costs, sell assets and scale back green ambitions to focus more on its core oil and gas business after plunging into the red last year.
It is due to unveil its turnaround plan and rescue package on Friday.
BOARD MEETINGS
The sources said conditions were not right for the capital increase to be carried out at the moment due to market volatility after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding it could be launched after the summer.
The banks providing the bridge loan, that will be repaid when the cash call is launched, are also likely to comprise the consortium for the capital increase, one of the sources said.
Sources said the banks were concerned about taking on too much risk and were seeking guarantees.
The boards of Eni and CDP are due to meet later on Wednesday to clear the package which will then be discussed by the Saipem board on Thursday, the sources said.
Eni and Saipem declined to comment.
According to one of the sources, part of the 1.5 billion euros will be used to meet a 500 million euro bond that matures early April even though Saipem does have liquidity to cover it.
Saipem's remaining bond portfolio comprising four bonds for an overall 2 billion euros will not be refinanced but will be allowed to run to maturities between 2023-2028, the source said.

A revolving credit facility worth 1 billion euros, and due to expire at the end of 2023, could be extinguished early and replaced with an identical line with a three-year maturity, one of the sources said.
But the source added it was still under discussion.($1 = 0.9091 euros)

MILAN/OTTAWA (Reuters) -Stellantis took significant steps in its battery production plans in Europe and North America on Wednesday as carmakers race to meet rising demand for electric vehicles. 
The company said its Automotive Cells Company (ACC) joint venture with Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies would build a battery plant in Italy and boost its capacity in Europe.
Separately, South Korea's LG Energy Solution (LGES) said it would invest $1.48 billion to set up a joint venture with Stellantis to produce batteries in Canada. 
The total investment will be more than $4.1 billion, which Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Chamapagne said was the largest ever in the Canadian auto sector. Officials did not immediately say how much the federal and provincial governments were contributing.
The Canadian plant, to be built just across the border from Detroit, aims for an annual production capacity in excess of 45 gigawatt hours (GWh) and will create an estimated 2,500 new jobs in the Windsor area, the companies said. 
The moves are part of a plan by the world's fourth largest carmaker to have five battery plants, two in North America and three in Europe, where it has already announced so-called 'gigafactories' in France and Germany, also being built via ACC. 
They come as rivals also move forward with battery production plans and as the car industry struggles with chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday picked a site near Valencia for its planned battery cell plant in Spain, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday launched a factory in Germany, its first European hub.
ITALIAN, CANADIAN GIGAFACTORIES
ACC said on Wednesday it would convert an existing Stellantis engine plant in the southern Italian town of Termoli into a battery facility as agreed in a March 21 memorandum of understanding with Italian authorities.
The total investment for Termoli would amount to 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion), including 370 million euros in public funds, Italy's deputy industry minister said in a statement.
The plant in Canada comes as the country, rich in key materials for EV battery production, has been wooing battery makers to safeguard the future of its car manufacturing industry as the world seeks to cut emissions.
Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV have all announced plans to make electric vehicles at factories in Ontario.
""This is going to make Windsor the home of Canada's first EV battery manufacturing plant, a plant that will be manufacturing hundreds of thousands of batteries,"" Champagne said. ""It's great news for the entire auto sector in Canada.""
Separately, ACC said it would increase its industrial capacity to at least 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030, versus an initial target of 48 GWh, and scale up the development and production of next-generation high-performance battery cells and modules. 
The plan will involve an investment of more than 7 billion euros, ACC said, and will include bringing production capacity at its French and German plants to 40 GWh each, from the 24 GWh initially planned.
This suggests the Termoli battery plan would also have a capacity of 40 GWh. Tesla's Berlin plant is aiming for an eventual capacity of 50 GWh.

Presenting its first business plan earlier this month, Stellantis said it aimed to sell 5 million battery electric vehicles a year by 2030. It also increased its planned battery capacity by 140 GWh to approximately 400 GWh, through its five gigafactories and additional supply contracts.

Non-residents will have to wait, though - they will be barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
Trading in blue chips, including state lenders Sberbank and VTB, energy majors Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), will take place between 0650 and 1100 GMT, with short-selling banned, the central bank said on Wednesday.
Russian stocks last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25. The central bank then curbed trading as Western sanctions over events in Ukraine threw markets into turmoil.
Until April 1, foreign investors are allowed to conduct operations to lower their obligations including repo deals and deals with derivative instruments, but not to sell shares or OFZ rouble treasury bonds, the Moscow Exchange said. 
The central bank started to buy OFZ rouble treasury bonds to support the domestic debt market when it reopened on Monday, and the finance ministry said it plans to spend 1 trillion roubles to buy Russian companies' shares.
The limited re-opening by MOEX comes after the SPB Exchange, Russia's second-largest bourse, partially restarted trade in foreign shares on Monday, allowing trading of the 15 most liquid stocks including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
From midday on Wednesday, SPB Exchange allowed securities of another 1,639 foreign companies to be bought and sold by domestic market players, most of whom are Russian residents who use the platform to trade foreign stocks.
Trading and settlement is conducted in U.S. dollars but the funds will remain on the brokerage accounts and cannot be cashed out amid Western sanctions on Russia and capital controls that Moscow has introduced in retaliation, the exchange said.
FALLING INTO A LOSS 
Trading of OFZ government bonds restarted on Monday, with the central buying OFZ papers in an effort to limit volatility. 
Yields on some OFZs, including benchmark 10-year treasury bonds, spiked to almost 20%, or the level of the central bank's benchmark interest rate, on Monday, before settling between 14% and 17% in subsequent days.
Volatility has left some players exposed to losses, according to Univer Capital, a mid-sized Russian brokerage, and which on Monday faced a mandatory sale of OFZs it held on behalf of its clients by Russia's National Clearing Center (NCC).
Artyom Tuzov, executive director in the capital markets department at Univer Capital, said falling OFZ prices, which move inversely to yields, triggered margin calls and a liquidity shortage at the brokerage as a result. 
""NCC has blocked the company's trading limit and... is selling (our OFZ) assets as a result. The trading limit will be unblocked after (mandatory) sale is over,"" Tuzov told Reuters.
NCC was selling OFZs held by Univer Capital at yields of between 17% to 20% versus 15% on average on the market that day, according to an internal Univer Capital memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by Tuzov.
As a result, nearly a hundred of Univer's clients faced combined losses of 174 million roubles ($1.7 million), the memo said.
""All operations by NCC are aimed at limiting systematic risks so issues of a single brokerage do not spill over on the overall market,"" the Moscow Exchange, parent company for NCC, said in a statement.
Unlike banks which are supported by the central bank via repo auctions with trillions of roubles on offer, brokerages have no access to state funds to replenish liquidity, Alexei Timofeyev, head of Russian stock market lobby NAUFOR, said.
""Unfortunately, the repo mechanism for brokerages and which was developed (by the central bank) after 2008 did not come into force which puts brokerages who are not part of larger banking groups in a worse position compared with lenders,"" he said.
Aton and Finam, two other large Russian brokerages, both said they had enough liquidity, yet Finam added that a small number of its clients also faced margin calls after the OFZ market re-opened.
""Margin calls are unavoidable tomorrow (when stock market reopens), the market has drastically changed,"" Timofeyev from NAUFOR said, adding that brokerage firms have tried to prepare by closing down some of their positions. 
Trading on the derivatives market with contracts on Moscow Exchange and individual shares, included on the Moscow Exchange index, will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0700 to 1100 GMT) in the usual format, the central bank said on Wednesday.

It said the trading regime for subsequent days would be announced at a later date.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Revenue at Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent grew just 8% in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace since it went public in 2004, reflecting regulatory scrutiny that has hurt both its gaming business and advertising sales.
China has frozen game approvals since August last year and curtailed gaming time for under-18s, part of Beijing's move to strengthen control over its society and industries including technology, after years of unbridled growth. 
This has also led to a slowdown in advertising as businesses have cut spending.
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which gets much of its revenue from gaming and develops games such as 'Honour of Kings' and 'Call of Duty Mobile', said domestic gaming sales grew 1% in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
The restrictions on minors were effective as the total time spent by minors on its games sank 88%, Tencent said, adding that the impact of this factor on revenue growth would ease later in the year.
""As we move into the latter half of 2022 it should cease to impact the revenue growth rate,"" Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told reporters on a call on Wednesday, referring to the minor-protection measures.
Tencent President Martin Lau said regulators were still supportive of the gaming industry, adding that the company had a ready pipeline of games for when approvals resumed.
The company, which also posted its slowest ever annual revenue growth at 16%, said revenue in its online advertising business fell 13% in the fourth quarter. 
It expects its ad business to resume growth in late 2022 after companies adjust to regulatory requirements. 
Total revenue rose to 144.2 billion yuan ($22.63 billion) in the quarter, below an average of 147.6 billion yuan expected by 17 analysts, Refinitiv data showed. 
Beijing has also issued rules to regulate financial holding companies, directing Tencent peer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s affiliate Ant to turn itself into a financial holding company with capital restrictions.
Lau, who had previously said that creating a financial holding company would not impact its business, repeated his stance on Wednesday and said Tencent was proactively discussing whether it qualified for such a licence.
STAFF NUMBERS
""Going forward we feel that we'll continue to see new regulations coming in but the incremental ones will be less than the bulk of regulations that happened in the first couple of years,"" Lau said.
He said he expects growth in staff numbers this year to be much slower than in previous years as companies pay more attention to efficiency and costs.
Reuters has reported that Tencent CEO Pony Ma told employees at the end of 2021 that the company should prepare itself for a ""winter"", and that it and Alibaba were preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs combined in one of their biggest rounds of layoffs.
Tencent's stock has lost more than a third of its value in the past 12 months, while Alibaba's has more than halved. 
Still, their shares have rallied in recent days after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said last week that Beijing would roll out support for the economy and keep markets stable.

Tencent said on Wednesday its adjusted profit for the December quarter fell by a fourth to 24.9 billion yuan as costs rose.

The company said it had ended other imports and exports as well as all investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, in Russia, and that it would not take any cash, dividends or profits from its business there. 
Rival Nestle said on Wednesday it would halt sales of several non-essential products including KitKat snacks and Nesquik chocolate mix in Russia, as Western companies face government pressure to shun Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Danone said it had condemned the war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" from the start, without ambiguity. 
It said supporting the Russian people and its employees did not mean it supported Moscow's actions, and its first priority would always be the safety of its Ukrainian colleagues.
""We also have a duty of care to our 8,000 colleagues in Russia, to Russian citizens, ordinary people, who rely on us for infant nutrition, medical nutrition, dairy products – essential foods,"" Danone said. 
The firm said it did not expect to make a profit in Russia or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future, and added if it did make any profits there during the war, it would donate them to humanitarian relief organisations.
Danone said it earned about 5% of its revenues in Russia in 2021 and less than 1% in Ukraine, where it has close to 1,000 staff. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told French lawmakers on Wednesday that French firms, including retailer Auchan, should leave the Russian market.
Auchan, which employs 30,000 staff in Russia, declined to comment.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) -Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam, who transformed the airline into Africa's biggest carrier, said on Wednesday he had resigned to focus on his medical treatment.
In an internal memo to employees seen by Reuters he said he had had health issues for almost a year and had been working from the United States for the past five months and was not able to return to the head office any time soon.
""I am retiring early due to health issues,"" he told Reuters in a text message, echoing the language in the memo which said he would focus on his treatment. 
In his 11 years at the helm, Tewolde grew the carrier from just 33 planes into a fleet of 130 planes operating on local and international routes, and from 3 million passengers to 12 million passengers, pre-COVID, the airline said in a statement.
""Mr. Tewolde led the airline for over a decade with remarkable success reflected in its exceptional performance in all parameters including but not limited to exponential growth from 1 billion USD annual turn-over to $4.5 billion,"" the state-owned carrier said.
""Under his leadership, the airline group has grown by four fold in all measurements.""
The airline confirmed the board had accepted his request for early retirement and said a successor would be announced shortly.
Tewolde led the company through the coronavirus pandemic without bailouts by pivoting to cargo, keeping the company profitable and cash positive.
Tewolde also helped the airline recover from the crash three years ago of flight 302, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX bound for Kenya, killing all 157 passengers and crew.

Tewolde's career saw him win a number of accolades including ""African CEO of the Year"" and ""Best African Business Leader"", according to the Ethiopian Airlines website.
""Tewolde is one of the best performing CEOs of a multinational anywhere in the world. He has more than delivered on every performance matrix,"" said Zemedeneh Negatu, global chairman of Fairfax Africa Fund, a Washington-based investment and transaction advisory firm.

Investing.com -- Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ:VICR) shares tumbled 15% Wednesday after the stock was downgraded by CJS Securities to Market Perform from Outperform.
CJS' price target for the company is also under review with analyst Jonathan Tanwanteng expressing concerns regarding Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The analyst said Nvidia, which unveiled its next-generation datacenter AI processor, is Vicor's largest customer. 
However, the analyst said images of the new Hopper H100 processor do not show any Vicor parts. However, Tanwanteng acknowledged this could be due to capacity constraints. 
He added that given Nvidia is the company's largest customer, Vicor products could be at risk.
While it is possible Nvidia may be dual sourcing or Vicor may still be sold out due to strong demand, the analyst believes the uncertainty about whether Vicor has been shut out will be an overhang on its shares in the near term.",,,

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has picked a site near Valencia for a planned battery cell plant in Spain, which could include U.S. carmaker Ford as a customer or partner, but the project depends on receiving government funds, it said on Wednesday.
The German carmaker aims to begin series production at the 40 gigawatt-hour (GWh) plant by 2026, meaning construction would need to start this year.
Spain, Europe's largest carmaker after Germany, last week launched a bidding process for around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) - around half in grants - to promote electric vehicle (EV) production, with Volkswagen and its Spanish unit SEAT readying a bid. Winners will be chosen this year.
If it does not receive PERTE funds - as the programme, consisting mostly of European Union pandemic relief funds, is called - the plant ""wouldn't be competitive"" and Volkswagen would look at alternatives, SEAT's chairman Wayne Griffiths told Reuters. 
""The European funds allow us to do a lot of things in Spain that probably would not have been done as early ... it has pulled ahead the decision on electrification for instance by about 10 years,"" he said. 
Volkswagen said it would invest, with suppliers, over 7 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the plant and in starting EV production at two Spanish factories. 
Automakers are racing to build battery plants to power their growing electric fleets, with a focus among European carmakers on reducing dependence on Asia.
Volkswagen aims to build six large battery factories across Europe by 2030.
The first plant by Northvolt in Sweden, in which Volkswagen holds a 20% stake, will begin production in 2022. A second in Germany will be built by 2025 with China's Gotion High-Tech, in which Volkswagen owns 26%.
Partners for the Spanish plant have not been chosen, but the planned location of Sagunto is close to a Ford production site. 
Asked if Ford could be a customer or have a stake in the plant, SEAT's chairman said both were possibilities. 
A Ford spokesperson in Spain said it was evaluating its European production amid growing demand for EVs and had not decided whether to apply for PERTE aid. 

Ford does not currently make EVs in Valencia. It announced last week seven new electric models for Europe and a battery-assembly site in Germany, deepening an existing partnership with Volkswagen to produce a second EV for the European market based on the German firm's platform.

Severstal itself is not subject to any sanctions, and Mordashov is not subject to the sanctions in the United States.
However, Citibank did not process a payment Severstal sent last week to cover the coupon on its 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) and the grace period expired on Wednesday, Severstal said in a statement.

""We believe making TASS content available on Reuters Connect is not aligned with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Trust Principles,"" Matthew Keen, interim CEO of Reuters, wrote in an internal memo to staff on Wednesday. 
The Reuters Trust Principles https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html, created in 1941 amid World War Two, commits Reuters to act with integrity, independence and freedom from bias.
In response to a request for comment from Reuters, TASS shared a letter that its CEO Sergei Mikhailov sent to Keen on Wednesday in which he said he was ""extremely sorry to learn of Reuters' decision"" and that he understood it was ""influenced by the current world atmosphere.”
""TASS journalists conduct their work honestly and responsibly. Any unbiased analysis will confirm that the informational work of TASS, as a state news agency, is equitable, objective and sufficiently balanced, with no room for disinformation and propaganda fakes,"" he said.
The Russian news agency has been accused by some Western media and press freedom groups of spreading false claims and propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Since the invasion, tech giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and pay TV services have restricted access to Russia state-owned media RT and Sputnik over concerns about spreading misinformation. RT and Sputnik have called restrictions placed on them by distributors, which include app stores and other social media services, unjustified censorship.
Early in March, photo agency Getty Images cut ties with TASS, according to a Forbes report. 
A Getty spokesperson said by email: ""In order to ensure the integrity of the content we distribute, we require that partners and contributors comply with our Editorial Policy."" 
She added that ""Recent TASS content failed to meet those guidelines and ingestion of their content was suspended. We have notified them of a breach of our agreement and are terminating our relationship."" She declined to specify which content fell short of its guidelines.
The Forbes story said TASS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters Connect allowed users, mostly news organizations, to access and share TASS content for a fee. Reuters Connect also offers the content of Reuters News and about 90 third-party providers, including Variety, USA Today and CNBC. 
The Reuters newsroom operates independently of Reuters Connect. 
The TASS partnership with the Reuters Connect platform was struck in 2020. In a June 1 press release that year, Michael Friedenberg, then president of Reuters, said having TASS join Reuters Connect was “building upon our valued partnership.” Mikhailov called the agreement “truly a significant event.”
According to the press release, the TASS partnership with Reuters Connect offered customers ""access to breaking news and exclusive video; videos on the Kremlin and Russian President, Vladimir Putin, as well as feature videos and general news.""

Since the invasion, the partnership has sparked sharp criticism on social media. A Politico story https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/20/reuters-staff-partnership-russian-wire-service-00018779 published on March 20 cited unnamed Reuters journalists saying they were embarrassed by the company's partnership with TASS.

MILAN (Reuters) -Monte dei Paschi di Siena must submit an updated capital plan to the European Central Bank by end March, the Italian bank said in its 2021 annual report, highlighting that the Ukraine crisis could affect its cash needs.
The bank's annual report said the war could prompt a revision of its multi-year strategic plan which currently envisages a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) capital strengthening.
After Italy's Treasury in October failed to clinch a sale of Monte dei Paschi (MPS) to UniCredit, sources close to the matter had told Reuters the cash raising would likely exceed that amount. One source at the time had put it at 3.5 billion euros.
The bank, which in the meantime has hired restructuring expert Luigi Lovaglio as its new CEO, has said any speculation is premature.
Italy owns 64% of MPS following a 2017 bailout that cost taxpayers 5.4 billion euros, and was due to find a buyer for the bank by the end of 2021.
Lovaglio, who took up his job in February after the Treasury pushed for change at the helm, is conducting a review of MPS' accounts which is expected to play a role in determining its cash needs.
He is likely to unveil his strategy for MPS between June and July, a financial source said, adding that the capital plan the bank will send to the ECB by March 31 would be updated once the CEO has finalised his strategy.
European Union authorities must approve MPS' new strategy before clearing the new cash injection. Italy is also negotiating a new re-privatisation deadline which sources have said will extend beyond 2023.
MPS has fallen behind its restructuring goals agreed with the EU. Now the Ukraine war, which is pushing up energy and raw materials costs, further complicates matters.
Though its direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is low, MPS said it might suffer if the Italian economy weakened as a result of the war. Loan book quality has always been the bank's Achilles heel.
MPS said the ECB had also requested a three-year plan detailing its strategy for impaired loans by March 31.
The bank reported a fourth-quarter loss, hit by higher loan loss provisions, in contrast to rest of the sector, where loan-loss charges have been shrinking after the worst of the pandemic has passed.
In a challenge for the Treasury and the bank, the proposed share issue will also require private investors to contribute to avoid breaching EU state aid rules.
The European Commission, which is softening state aid rules to help companies cope with the Ukraine crisis, on Wednesday said supportive measures for banks linked to crisis would not trigger so-called burden sharing rules. Burden sharing imposes losses on private investors before taxpayer money can be tapped to help a failing bank.

But a source close to the matter told Reuters Rome did not want to try and use this as a loophole to reduce private participation in MPS' capital increase.

(Reuters) -  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) raised its full-year core sales and profit forecasts on Wednesday, encouraged by higher prices and strong demand for the Cheerios maker's cereals, snack bars and pet food, sending its shares up as much as 6%.
Consumers sticking to pandemic-driven habits of cooking more at home has boosted sales at packaged food makers, who are also benefiting from price hikes, with General Mills joining peers Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) in reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit.
Margins, however, remain pressured across the food industry as pandemic-induced supply chain shortfalls have led to soaring freight and labor expenses, adding on to spiraling costs of packaging material and ingredients.
General Mills had cautioned in February that supply issues in categories including refrigerated dough, pizza and hot snacks in North America would affect shipments in the third quarter, but measures such as securing alternate supply sources helped the company exceed its expectations for organic sales growth, up 4%. 
""Our actions drove a sharper rebound than we expected at the end of the third quarter, and we’re seeing that improvement continue into fourth quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said.
The company's forecast raise surprised analysts. ""It's not every day in this generally predictable industry that results come in ahead of a late-quarter (February) pre-announcement,"" J.P. Morgan's Ken Goldman said. 
The maker of Betty Crocker cake mixes expects organic net sales to rise by about 5% in fiscal 2022, compared with its prior estimate of a 4%-5% increase.

It forecast adjusted per-share profit between flat and an increase of 2%, compared with its earlier range of a 2% decline to a 1% rise.
General Mills' net sales fell short of estimates, but its adjusted profit of 84 cents per share for the quarter ended Feb. 27, topped market expectations of 78 cents.

Phase 2 Partners, which holds 7.7 million shares in the TP ICAP, urged the London-listed company to look for a new ownership structure through a potential sale or merger with another global trading platform.
""I currently see your shares as significantly undervalued, believe management's lack of stock ownership represents a significant governance failure... and believe the company needs to make decisive steps immediately to benefit long suffering shareholders,"" Justin Hughes, founder of Phase 2 Partners, said in a letter dated March 22.
A spokesman for TP ICAP in response said the company was maintaining an active dialogue with its investors and is ""focused on delivering value to shareholders"".
In the letter published on Wednesday and addressed to TP ICAP Chairman Richard Berliand, the hedge fund also urged the company's board members to take all compensation in the form of equities.
Shares of the company, which matches buyers and sellers of securities, lost 28% of its value in 2021 and are down more than 12% this year as of Tuesday's close.

The average payout for securities workers in New York in 2021 was $257,500, a figure boosted by the record levels of deal-making and trading activity big banks handled as the global stock markets surged to all-time highs.
""The numbers pop out ... and are higher than what had been projected,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said, calling it ""welcome news."" 
Wall Street contributed about 18% of all the taxes collected in New York for 2021, and it should help New York City beat its expectations for income tax revenue, the report found.
""We have an April 1 budget deadline for the state, and this is welcome news. It gives them a little bit more breathing room,"" DiNapoli said.
A number of factors, including inflation, the ongoing recovery and economic fallout from Russia's invasion in Ukraine, are expected to weigh on Wall Street bonuses this year. New York City and state estimates currently predict that incentive compensation packages for securities industry workers in 2022 will fall by 16% on average.
However, in 2021, the overall bonus pool increased by 21% to $45 billion during the traditional December-March bonus season, compared to $37.1 billion in 2020, according to the report.

The securities industry makes up one-fifth of private sector wages in New York City, despite comprising only 5% of private-sector employment, the report said.
The number of jobs at Wall Street firms held relatively flat at around 180,000 in 2021 from 2020, with a slight decrease of about 600 jobs, the report found.

(Reuters) -Cresco Labs Inc is buying rival Columbia Care (OTC:CCHWF) Inc in a $2-billion deal to become the top U.S. cannabis producer in one of the biggest deals in the industry.
Cresco executives said the combined entity has the potential to be a brand as big as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnnie Walker as the deal would help it dominate a market likely to reach $46 billion in sales by 2026.
Columbia Care investors will get 0.5579 shares of Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) for each unit held. Based on Cresco's Tuesday closing price, it represents a nearly 16% premium.
The deal, which was reported by Reuters on Tuesday, values Columbia Care's equity at C$1.36 billion ($1.07 billion). 
The companies together will operate in 18 states, but overlapping footprints in several regions, including in New York, could require significant divestitures before the deal gets regulatory approvals.
Besides New York, Cresco could divest assets in Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Florida, using proceeds from the sales to cut debt, Chief Financial Officer Dennis Olis said on a call with analysts.
""The success of this merger will depend largely upon Charlie's (Cresco CEO) ability to execute and integrate at scale while monetizing the redundant assets,"" said Todd Harrison, founder of cannabis investment firm CB1 Capital, which owns shares in Cresco.
Both Cresco and Columbia Care are listed in Canada as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and the two large U.S. stock exchanges do not allow companies that grow or sell the plant to list their shares.
Stoic Advisory Inc and Solidum Capital Advisors were the financial advisors to Cresco Labs. Bennett Jones LLP and Paul Hastings LLP were the legal advisors.

Canaccord Genuity served as financial advisor to Columbia Care. Stikeman Elliott LLP and Foley Hoag LLP were the legal advisors.

(Reuters) - Battered technology and growth shares have shrugged off rising bond yields to drive a rebound in world stocks as some investors view them as a hedge to inflation against the backdrop of supply-chain snarls and an intensifying war in Ukraine.
The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes the five core FAANG stocks - Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - posted their best six-day performance on Tuesday, rising 22% and far outpacing the S&P 500's 8% rise in the same period.
Growth stocks, which usually underperform as yields rise, surged despite the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting its highest since 2019 on fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening. 
Higher interest rates typically hurt tech and growth stocks as their valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down nearly 10% year-to-date, steeper than the 4% decline in the benchmark S&P 500.
""In the face of rising 10-year yield, (investors are) leaving bonds going toward equities, and they are going toward the growth areas that had been beaten up, but I question whether this is going to last,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
Some analysts said the technology stocks are proving to be inflation resistant as their profits are largely immune to rising commodities prices when compared to manufacturing and consumer companies.
""High operational gearing, sticky consumer and global footprint lends itself to some sympathy,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.
Tech giants listed in Hong Kong have surged 36% since last Tuesday's bottom, helped by Beijing's market-friendly concessions last week that buoyed hopes that the worst of the regulatory tightening was over.
Tech stocks in Japan rose for seven straight sessions, while those in Europe have also enjoyed gains. 

""The Chinese market has had a strong rebound,"" Emmanuel Cau, head of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said, adding that with the broader market gaining, many funds could reengage with a sector shunned by investors at the start of the year.
Analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said a revival in buying activity from retail investors following the Federal Reserve's rate hike last week aided the rebound in stocks.

The maker of Cheerio's and Betty Crocker announced earnings per share of $0.84 on revenue of $4.54 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.78 on revenue of $4.56 billion.
The company also raised its fiscal 2022 outlook, with recent price increases helping to ease cost pressures while demand remains robust.
The news sent General Mills shares more than 5% higher in early Wednesday trading.
Organic net sales for the company are now expected to increase approximately 5% for fiscal 2022, with adjusted earnings per share now expected to range between flat and up 2%, driven by the higher outlook on adjusted operating profit.
“Our solid execution in a highly volatile environment enabled us to close the third quarter with improved momentum,” said General Mills Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening. 
""We expect to drive strong growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by accelerating net price realization. With confidence in our plans and positive momentum on our business, we’re raising our guidance for fiscal 2022.”

TIM, Italy's largest telecoms group, has already received an approach from U.S. fund KKR about a 10.8 billion euro ($11.8 billion) potential offer.
Italian press reported earlier on Wednesday that private equity group CVC was interested in the services arm of TIM once a plan to split the phone group's network from the rest of the business was completed.
""CVC has been analysing for some time a possible scenario of industrial reorganisation at TIM to identify solutions to help the relaunch of the group... no decision has been taken,"" the spokesperson said.
A source confirmed that CVC had been looking at the services business in particular.
TIM said this month that it would start formal talks with KKR almost four months after receiving an initial approach.
In a letter sent last week, TIM sought clarification of KKR's plans for the debt-laden telecoms group and the structure of its offer, sources familiar with the matter said.
""We are expecting a reply from KKR any moment now,"" TIM Chairman Salvatore Rossi said at an event in Rome on Wednesday.

TIM shares traded 1.2% higher at just over 0.30 euros at 1325 GMT, well below the 0.505 euro price at which the KKR approach was pitched.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday, running into profit-taking after the strong gains of the last week as the prospects for a long and profound disruption to the world economy from Russia's invasion of Ukraine appeared to become more realistic. 
Overnight, Russia had unilaterally tightened the world oil market by claiming that an export terminal taking Kazakh oil to world markets via the Black Sea had to be closed for up to two months to allow repairs to storm damage. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium's link was due to ship some 1.5 million barrels a day of crude in April, according to Argus Media. 
Additionally, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia that the use of nuclear weapons, which has been mentioned in passing by various official and non-government figures in Russia as a possible course of action, would ""change the nature"" of the Ukraine war. Stoltenberg said Russia must understand it cannot win a nuclear war, and also called on China to stop spreading what he called Russian ""lies and disinformation"" about its actions in Ukraine.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 288 points, or 0.8%, at 34,519 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1%, giving up more than half of its Tuesday gains. 
Crude oil prices surged again on the latest round of back-and-forth, which included Polish preparations to expel 45 Russian diplomats for spying and demand from Vladimir Putin that Europe pay for its Russian oil and gas in rubles. U.S. crude futures rose 4.2% to $113.83 a barrel, while Brent futures topped $120 a barrel for the first time in two weeks. Oil and gas stocks rose in sympathy, with  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rising 1.3%,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rising 2.6% and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rising 3.6%. Occidental is the most highly leveraged of the three and typically reacts more to changes in crude prices as a result.
Stocks catching the eye in early trading included Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, which fell 8.0% after warning of war-related disruptions to its operations that affected its guidance for the coming quarter. Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) also fell 7.6% after the Chinese Internet giant recorded its slowest-ever quarterly sales growth, reviving fears that the regulatory crackdown in China has permanently changed the long-term outlook, despite promises of relief from vice-premier Liu He last week. 
Elsewhere,  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) stock rose 4.7% after the maker of Cheerios raised its forecasts for profit and revenue this year, a signal that it is comfortable with passing on higher input prices to consumers. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 12.1% after disclosures that chairman Ryan Cohen had bought another 100,000 shares. Cohen's involvement with the videogames retailer has been a central pillar of the narrative that has fired retail investors' imaginations over the last year.  
Sentiment was also hurt at the margins by signs that rising long-term interest rates are starting to cool the housing market. New home sales fell surprisingly for the second month in a row in February, while the Mortgage Brokers Association said that mortgage applications fell by over 8% last week, as the benchmark 30-year mortgage rate soared to 4.50%. It's now risen 150 basis points in the last seven months. "

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's EnBW will avoid any new energy supply deals with Russia for as long as Vladimir Putin is its president, the utility's chief executive said in response to Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
""There won't be any new supply contracts with Russia under this leadership,"" Frank Mastiaux told journalists at the group's annual press conference, four weeks after the war on Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", began.
EnBW, Germany's No.3 energy company by market value, has stepped up efforts to cut Russian coal and gas supplies but said it could not make up for a sudden halt to imports - chiming with larger rivals RWE and E.ON.
""As you know, completely replacing procurement in the short term in the event of a theoretical loss of Russian gas is not feasible for us, as it is for most market participants,"" Mastiaux said after presenting full-year results.
""Germany will continue to rely on gas imports for some time to come,"" Mastiaux said, adding he welcomed economy minister Robert Habeck's efforts to seek liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.
EnBW received 3.6 million tonnes, or 86%, of its hard coal supply from Russia, he said, adding it started to diversify procurement at the end of 2021, and existing stockpiles will ensure supply well into the current year.

Turning to gas, which includes the group's VNG division, EnBW said that 20% of the 495 terawatt hours (TWh) it procured last year came via direct agreements with Russian suppliers, adding those volumes would decrease from 2023 onwards.
EnBW finance chief Thomas Kusterer said VNG had two direct contracts with Russian suppliers, one of which - with a volume of 35 TWh - was due to expire at the end of 2022, while another 65 TWh contract runs until 2030.

The South Korean battery maker added that its board approved a guarantee of debt regarding its joint venture with Stellantis, which stands at $627 million. 
In October, LGES and Stellantis NV struck an electric vehicle (EV) battery production joint venture, targeting to start production by the first quarter of 2024 and aiming to have an annual production capacity of 40 gigawatt hours of batteries.
In a separate regulatory filing, LGES said it plans to acquire a stake worth $542 million in ES America to respond to demand from EV startups in the United States. 
LGES is considering building a factory in Arizona to meet demand in the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the plant is expected to primarily produce cylindrical battery cells. LGES has its own factory in Michigan and two battery joint ventures with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in Ohio and Tennessee.

311,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 09:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After almost two years of lagging behind the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is starting to behave more like one would expect from Wall Street’s favorite megacap stock.
The shares have rallied 21% since hitting a 20-month low on March 8, the day before the e-commerce giant announced a stock split and buyback plan that sparked the turnaround. Amazon is now on the verge of turning positive in a year in which the Nasdaq 100 Index is still down 10%, making it the best-performing of the four largest U.S. technology companies in 2022.
The recent rally is a welcome development for analysts, who have remained universally bullish as the shares labored. All 57 tracked by Bloomberg data have a buy or equivalent recommendation on the stock, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp touting it as a top pick.
Those predictions are now, perhaps, proving prescient: while Amazon is now down just 1.1% for the year, Alphabet has declined 3.4%, Apple has slumped almost 5% and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) is 9.6% lower.
To Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, Amazon’s recent gains have a lot to do with the stock split and buybacks -- which are clear signals the company is becoming more shareholder friendly.
“The stock split was huge,” Morgan said in an interview. “It looks like some money is swinging back into Amazon because of that perceived shift.”
The potential for returning more capital to shareholders was cited by Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC, which said last month it significantly boosted its stake in the company. Loeb told investors in February that Amazon was undervalued to the tune of about $1 trillion due to the combination of its different e-commerce and web services businesses, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Still Expensive
Amazon’s rally comes as investors start to embrace higher-valuation stocks again, after months of shunning them in favor of cheaper ones in anticipation of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes. Like the Nasdaq 100, the shares are still trading well off their high, down 12% from a July record.
While Amazon is much cheaper than it once was, the stock is still priced at 45 times profits projected over the next 12 months, making it by far the most expensive of the megacaps. The average for the Nasdaq 100, by contrast, is 25 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While the shares may be benefiting from the split and buybacks, Amazon’s businesses will need to continue performing well for the rally to last, according to Michael Casper, an equity strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Those things tend to be a short-term boost and fundamental trends will ultimately carry the day,” Casper said.
Tech Chart of the Day
U.S. technology stocks are flashing a bullish signal little more than a week after the sector entered a bear market. The Nasdaq 100 Index closed above its 50-day moving average on Tuesday for the first time since Jan. 4. The move comes after the tech-heavy gauge climbed for a fifth session in six, adding 12% since hitting a 10-month low on March 14. A break above the closely watched technical level has spurred multiple prolonged rallies, including late last year when the gauge hit a record high.

312,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 09:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). warrants are looking increasingly attractive as the share price climbs. 
As part of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc.’s $10 billion investment in the oil company in 2019, Buffett has the option to acquire 83.86 million shares at $59.62 each, a level that the stock has closed above the past two days. Exercising those warrants could give Berkshire a nearly 23.6% stake in the oil company, in addition to its preferred stock. Buffett’s firm is already Occidental’s biggest shareholder.
“He does have a very good track record of lending out money in times of duress for the recipient, for the borrower, and procuring these warrants,” said Darren Pollock, whose Cheviot Value Management LLC oversees investments including Berkshire shares. “Over time when those businesses do well, he does have this added kicker of so many additional warrants that are worth so much over time.”
Buffett declined to comment when asked if Berkshire would exercise the warrants.
Occidental stock was up 3.1% to $61.50 at 8:46 a.m. before the start of regular trading in New York.
Occidental is the top performer in the S&P 500 Index this year, gaining nearly 106% at the close of trading on March 22. Rising oil prices helped the Houston-based company pay down debt more rapidly than expected, raise its dividend and restart a share-buyback program. Sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine also boosted investor appetite for U.S. shale-focused oil stocks.
The revival brought an end to a tough three years for the company, which saddled itself with debt in the 2019 purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). for $37 billion, just months before Covid-19 caused oil prices to collapse.
Berkshire’s preferred-stock bet on Occidental provided part of the funding for the Anadarko deal. Buffett has also been plowing money into Occidental in recent weeks, accumulating a stake that now ranks among Berkshire’s top 10 common-stock holdings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Risk appetite has rebounded on Wall Street after a brutal start to the year, but some strategists warn the lull in volatility may be brief and urge investors to guard against more stock market gyrations.
The Cboe Volatility Index - an options-based measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks that some call Wall Street's fear gauge - fell to a five-week low of 22.81 on Tuesday, just two weeks after closing at a one-year high.
The move has coincided with a rally in the S&P 500 index, which has halved its year-to-date losses, fueled in part by the Fed's assurances that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand more aggressive monetary policy tightening as the central bank fights to tamp down surging inflation. The index is still down about 5% for the year after confirming a correction last month. 
Some options strategists say the recent gains could be fleeting and are advising clients to buy hedges against volatility, which have become cheaper in recent days as demand for portfolio protection has ebbed. 
Catalysts for future volatility eruptions range from worries that the Fed's hawkish tilt will drag the economy into recession – an idea that is roiling bond markets – to further geopolitical uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
""With no demand for buying protection, the VIX is going to have a tendency to soften ... but as we saw in mid-February, that can change in a heartbeat,"" said Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""If I see the VIX down another point or two, I am starting to think that's bottoming out."" 
That sentiment was echoed by strategists at BoFA Global Research, who believe worries about high inflation, slowing growth and a hawkish Fed are likely to fuel more stock market weakness.
""We see the risk-on price action and lower cost of protection not as a rallying cry, but rather an opportunity to reload on hedges,"" they wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
An S&P 500 put option that would guard against a 10% decline in the index through mid-June costs about 30% less now than a week ago, Refinitiv data showed.
Meanwhile, the one-month moving average of open put contracts against open calls on the SPX index, a measure of defensive positioning, is at its lowest since July 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
Intense volatility prompted some investors to lower exposure to stocks in recent weeks, one possible reason why demand for hedges has fallen.
A BofA Global Research survey for March showed fund manager's cash levels at their highest since April 2020, while a measure of equity positioning tracked by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) recently slipped to the lowest since September 2020.
""There is just less exposure to hedge,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital.
To be sure, analysts have also noted that sharp drops in the VIX have often preceded short-term upside in stocks: the S&P 500 has historically returned 2.5% and been up 77% of the time following a five-day drop in the VIX, wrote Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
Others, however, point out that the VIX has only closed below its media average of 18 three times this year and believe it is unlikely to settle down soon. 

The VIX curve remains quite flat all the way through November, suggesting traders expect markets to stay choppy throughout most of the year. 
""It points to volatility remaining around where it is now for a while,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.

315,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 08:48AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BofA analyst Vivek Arya could see the United States offering over $50 billion in subsidies to stimulate domestic semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.
His estimates come in the light of today's appearance of CEOs of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) in front of a US Senate Committee.
The hearing is expected to focus on the domestic semiconductor supply chain, R&D, competitiveness, etc.
Arya warns that government funding could help but it is not a silver bullet.
We are skeptical that enhanced subsidies could address these concerns anytime soon. Neither Intel nor Micron are technologically/strategically equipped to address these issues. Near-term shortages are in trailing edge chips for auto/industrial applications, not in PC/server processors (Intel) or memory (Micron). Building a credible alternative to Taiwan (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)) requires a dedicated foundry with tech/scale/experience/business strategy which we don't believe any US foundry is equipped for, the analyst said in a client note.
Along these lines, Arya lists stocks that could benefit the most from the direct subsidies. Intel is seen as the biggest beneficiary, but Arya says that some of this funding is already embedded in the company's outlook.
Instead, investors should focus on these semi stocks:
1) GlobalFoundries (GFS): focused US-headquartered foundry, any new US funding incremental to street FCF estimates, and a key part of addressing supply shortages in auto markets (we note recent relationships with Ford, BMW etc. to secure capacity);
2) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN): boosted capex for US-based trailing edge analog/embedded fabs, any subsidy could help boost FCF; and
3) Semicap equipment vendors (KLAC, AMAT, LRCX and others) who benefit from investments in new manufacturing capacity.
The analyst also says the US government might also need to speak to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) to reconsider its western manufacturing plans.

Below we share key insights from 6 Nvidia analysts who attended the event:
Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann (Buy, $400): We see Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at heightened risk (both on the GPU and CPU fronts) and supportive of AMD, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) roadmaps that incorporate a pace of innovation that should keep up with Nvidia (sans the software angle, which is Nvidias secret sauce).
BofA's Vivek Arya (Buy, $375): Maintain Buy and top sector pick following analyst day where management outlined a nearly $1Tn addressable opportunity across AI hardware, Gaming, Enterprise/Metaverse software, robotics and autos, including a 3x of core data center TAM to $300bn (vs prior analyst day).
Raymond James' Chris Caso (Strong Buy): While the stock is among the most highly valued at 40x, that multiple is justified by 50% annual revenue growth for the last two years (35% annually over the last 5), and such significant product cycles and new revenue streams going forward.
Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari (Neutral, $245): We came away from the event with a better appreciation of Nvidias long-term growth opportunity (note managements long-term TAM estimation of $1 trillion) as well as its robust competitive position We are Neutral-rated on the stock given potential risk/reward relative to others in our coverage universe; however, we would look to turn more constructive if/when presented with a better entry point or a normalization in Gaming segment revenue.
JPMorgan's Harlan Sur (Overweight, $350): With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, NVIDIA is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view. Bottom line: NVIDIA continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.
Barclays' Blayne Curtis (Overweight, $350): There was no update to guidance but trends do seem to remain strong with the company targeting the remainder of its $5B in buybacks into the end of the year. NVDA remains one of our favorite names with leverage to the Data Center, Auto finally inflecting in 2H, and the most additional drivers of any name in our universe.

317,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 08:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) -Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's Spanish construction firm FCC on Wednesday launched a tender offer for a 24% stake in real estate developer Metrovacesa, a FCC filing to the local stock market regulator showed.
Through the purchase, worth 284 million euros ($312.29 million), FCC would raise its stake in Metrovacesa which stands at 5.4% currently. The real estate firm is largely owned by Spanish banks Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA).
Slim, whose net worth has been estimated at $62 billion by Forbes magazine, has been betting on Spanish real estate and infrastructure after the financial crisis brought both industries to their knees. 
Through his holding company Inversora de Carso, the billionaire also controls real estate developer Realia. 
Metrovacesa shares jumped 16% on Wednesday morning to 7.51 euros, just below the 7.8 euros offered by FCC. 
The offer price represents a 20% premium over Tuesday's closing price, Spanish lender Bankinter said in a note to clients. Shares in Metrovacesa's rivals may also rise on Slim's move, Bankinter added. 
Santander and BBVA, which together own about 70% of Metrovacesa according to Refinitiv Eikon data, are unlikely to sell at 7.8 euros, JBCapital analyst David Gandoy said in a report.
""Consequently, we see this partial bid as a financial investment aimed at taking advantage of the current market conditions,"" he added. 
""As we always do, we will analyse the offer and decide what is best for our shareholders,"" a BBVA spokesperson said, adding the offer price was in line with the valuation on the bank's books.

Santander declined to comment.

Aegon had announced the 830 million euro sale of its Central and Eastern European insurance, pension, and asset management businesses to VIG in 2020, but the Hungarian government initially blocked the deal.
Late last year, however, the country's finance ministry said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with VIG that could enable it to take a 45% stake in the two companies' local unit, and the European Commission later ordered Hungary to withdraw its veto.
Right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly said Hungarian companies or the state must hold majority stakes in sectors including finance, energy, media and trade.
Aegon, which plans complete the sales of its Polish, Romanian and Turkish businesses this year, said in a statement the sale was an important step towards narrowing its strategic focus and bolstering its balance sheet.
The group said the cash boost would help it to lower its debt, and announced a 375 million euro repayment tender offer as well as a 300 million euro share buyback from April to December.

Following the debt tender offer, Aegon expects to have reduced its gross financial leverage to 5-5.5 billion euros.

Lanvin Group, which manages iconic brands such as Lanvin, Sergio Rossi, Wolford, St. John Knits, and Caruso, has agreed to combine with a U.S.-listed 'blank cheque company' affiliated to Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm founded by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Greater China Chairman Fred Hu. 
""We plan to accelerate the growth of our portfolio via both organic development and disciplined acquisitions,"" Joann Cheng, chair and CEO of Lanvin Group, said in a joint statement with Primavera Capital Acquisition Corporation (PCAC).
The announcement came less than two weeks after U.S. regulators named five New York-listed Chinese companies that face delisting risks, and shows that some Chinese companies are undeterred by the long-running auditing dispute between Beijing and Washington.
The planned transaction, which values Shanghai-based Lanvin Group at a combined equity value of up to $1.9 billion, may also face scrutiny by Chinese regulators, who are tightening supervision over offshore listings.
Cheng brushed aside such concerns during a video conference on Wednesday, saying Lanvin Group owns a global brand portfolio and a diverse investor base.
The group, which operates in over 80 countries with more than 300 retail stores, expects to open over 200 new stores by 2025, seeking to capture growth opportunities in North America and Asia, beyond its stronghold in Europe. 
SPAC 
SPACs are shell firms that raise money from institutional and retail investors via market listings, and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals have slowed in the past year but some Chinese companies still see it as a short cut to accessing U.S. capital markets. 
Ronald Shuang, chairman of boutique investment company Balloch Holding Group, said many Chinese companies remain keen to list in the U.S., despite geopolitical tensions.
""If you list on the Nasdaq, or the New York Stock Exchange, you have access to the world's most liquid market, and strong capital backing,"" said Shuang, whose firm has sponsored several U.S.-listed SPACs with a focus on China assets.
Lanvin Group was formerly known as Fosun Fashion Group before it adopted the name of the French luxury label. It said it aims to raise a total of $544 million through the proposed combination with the Primavera SPAC. 

That includes up to $414 million of cash in the trust account, and fully committed subscriptions and forward purchase agreements worth $130 million from investors including Fosun International, ITOCHU Corp and Stella International Ltd. 
Max Chen, Partner of Primavera, said: ""Lanvin Group and Primavera share the same vision of nurturing and reinvigorating world-class luxury brands.""

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) is seeking buyers for its shut-down Foinaven oilfield in the North Sea, hoping Britain's renewed focus on domestic production will attract buyers interested in extracting the field's remaining reserves, industry sources said.
BP halted production at the Foinaven field west of the Shetland islands last year after 25 years of activity and is preparing to dismantle its floating production vessel.
The field nevertheless still holds reserves of around 200 million barrels of oil which could be tapped in a relatively short time and with minimal investment, the three sources said.
The sale is part of a gradual retreat of BP and other big producers from the ageing basin in recent years, selling assets to smaller companies that specialize in extending late-life fields.
It is unclear how much money BP could get from the Foinaven field, if any, given the clean-up, or decommissioning, costs that would have to be negotiated, the sources said.

But following the recent sharp rally in oil and gas prices and Europe's efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, BP hopes the field could attract buyers, the sources said.[O/R]
A BP spokesperson declined to comment. The London-based company holds 100% interest in the field after acquiring a 28% stake from Viaro Energy last year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Cash-strapped Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd has joined a growing list of Chinese property developers unable to publish 2021 audited earnings by March 31 as required by listing rules, deepening market concern about the sector's financial health.
Kaisa late on Tuesday said a virus lockdown in Shenzhen left audit work incomplete so it cannot publish financial results on time. In a filing, it said trading of its shares in Hong Kong will therefore be suspended from April 1 as per bourse rules.
Its stock price dropped 2.7% in Wednesday morning trade versus a 1.7% rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
Bigger peer China Evergrande Group, the world's most-indebted property developer, also on Tuesday said it would not be able to publish results on time due to a large number of additional audit procedures resulting from ""drastic changes"" in operations since the second half of 2021.
Trading of shares in Evergrande and two Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries has been suspended since Monday.
Other major developers including Sunac China Holdings Ltd and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd also this week said they will delay reporting audited results due to disruption caused by COVID-19, but that they will produce unaudited results on March 31 to keep their shares trading.
However, some have delayed results due to changing auditors. Ronshine China Holdings Ltd on Monday said auditor PwC had quit due to insufficient time to complete auditing work.
Analysts said failure for companies to issue timely 2021 results will further weigh on sector sentiment, which has been hit in the past few months by liquidity concern.
""We think auditors' more stringent checks on project booking/debt might also have played a role,"" JP Morgan said in a report, referring to the delay.
The U.S. investment bank said it would not be surprised to see more delays because, even for companies that have announced board meeting dates, there is still the possibility of results delays if auditing processes cannot be completed by then.
Nomura said it typically raises red flags when companies change auditors ahead of earnings announcements, and that such a practice causes serious market concern about trustworthiness.
Kaisa, the second-largest U.S. dollar bond issuer among Chinese property developers after China Evergrande, is restructuring its $12 billion offshore debt after defaulting on some bonds last year.

In Tuesday's filing, Kaisa said it has been working with legal and financial advisors in recent months to formulate a solution ""for the benefit of all stakeholders"" and to ease liquidity issues.
Kaisa also said it has entered ""constructive dialogue"" with creditors. It has been in talks with bondholders over a debt restructuring deal since late last year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia can get up to 400,000 euros ($440,360) in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs under looser EU state aid rules, the European Commission said on Wednesday.
From airlines to carmakers to tourism businesses, thousands of companies across the 27-country bloc have reported severe disruption due to the sanctions.
Companies in the agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture sectors can get up to 35,000 euros while businesses facing a liquidity crunch can get state guarantees on loans, subsidised loans. 
The Commission did not specify which sectors would qualify for the larger support. 
Companies facing soaring energy costs can get state aid up to 30% of costs, capped at 2 million euros, the Commission said, confirming a Reuters story on Tuesday.
This measure will benefit manufacturers of aluminum and other metals, glass fibers, pulp, fertiliser, hydrogen and other basic chemicals.
""These sanctions also take a toll on the European economy and will continue to do so in the coming months. We need to mitigate the economic impact of this war and to support severely impacted companies and sectors,"" Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The looser rules will be effective until the end of the year. Sanctioned Russian-controlled entities are not eligible for such aid.

The EU executive, which also acts as the bloc's competition enforcer, relaxed its state aid rules two years ago, allowing governments to pump trillions of euros into companies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Banks in Asia are ""falling short"" when it comes to meeting global pledges to tackle climate change and aligning with the decarbonisation aims of their countries, according to a study published on Wednesday.
Nearly 200 countries signed a pact in Glasgow last year calling on banks and financial institutions across the world to mobilise more finance to help achieve global climate goals and to seek innovative ways to pay for climate adaptation.
But a review of 32 banks throughout East and Southeast Asia showed that none had made any clear commitments or adequate implementation plans to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, according to Asia Research & Engagement (ARE), a Singapore-based environment group.
""Asia's banks are falling short in aligning with national decarbonisation policies and are not yet taking the steps necessary to meet global climate goals,"" ARE said.
The banks have been quick to launch green financial products but they have lagged when it comes to cleaning up their existing products and carrying out policies required to divert capital away from carbon-intensive industries, it said.
""This raises concerns of greenwashing: that banks are seeking a marketing benefit for sustainable finance deals while providing higher levels of finance to dirty industries,"" the report said. 
Of the 32 banks in major economies like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, only nine had long-term net-zero commitments for the emissions they finance, while only 13 had policies prohibiting the financing of new coal-fired power.
The highest ranked Asian bank was DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) in Singapore, which has set a long-term net-zero target but has not yet made any clear short- and medium-term plans, and also had a number of gaps in its financing policies.
In an emailed statement, a DBS spokesman said the bank had become the first from Singapore to sign up to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which commits it to become net-zero by 2050. He said the bank's plans to achieve the goal were included in its sustainability report published this month. 
Five banks were given the lowest rating because they had ""barely started"" their journey towards climate readiness, including China's Bank of Ningbo, Ping An Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB).
SPDB said in an emailed statement that it will ""fully serve"" all elements of the carbon-neutral industrial chain and support sectors like green manufacturing and new energy vehicles, adding that green development was part of its ""corporate DNA"".
Ping An said it had already ""upgraded green finance to a strategic level"". The company's green credit balance reached almost 70 billion yuan ($10.99 billion) in 2021, tripling from a year earlier, it said in an email. 
The Bank of Ningbo declined to comment.

ARE said banks needed to establish clear climate policies that were aligned with national goals in order to avoid future regulatory risks and ensure their clients transition to cleaner and more competitive technologies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Swings in asset prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine could hit first-quarter profits at big U.S. banks depending on what happens before the end of the month and how markets react, analysts said. 
Trading losses, provisions for expected loan losses, writedowns of assets and charges for closing businesses could muddy what was expected to be an OK quarter as banks benefited from higher interest rates and more lending even as the flood of investment banking revenue subsided.
Big banks could take one-time hits totaling $5 billion, or twice that, or none at all, said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
""You really can't say because markets are moving in such a volatile fashion depending on what's going on with the geopolitical risks,"" he said.
The market volatility has been the bad kind for securities dealers, with prices jerking up and down rather than moving steadily as can happen when interest rates are expected to rise or fall, analysts say. 
""The next two weeks could make or break near-term results,"" analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote on Friday.
Large U.S. banks start reporting earnings on April 13.
Goldberg cited comments by the markets chief for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on March 8 that quarterly revenue had become unpredictable because of ""significant counterparty risk"" and ""a lot of clients"" being under extreme stress, particularly from commodities trades.
Those risks were cited on Friday by bond-rating firm Standard & Poor's in a report on the potential impact of the conflict. S&P also warned of new operational problems in complying with sanctions and increased cyber risk.
So far,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) stands out most as likely to report a significant hit. Apart from market exposures, its consumer bank in Russia could cause losses.
CITI BUYBACK PLANS UNDER THREAT
Citigroup said on March 2 that in ""a severe stress scenario"" it could be exposed to nearly $5 billion of losses from its Russian businesses.
The bank has enough excess capital to handle that without serious damage, analysts said. But a hit could slow its share buybacks - a key part of Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to lift the bank's valuation. 
Citigroup's shares trade for less than the company's net worth and re-purchasing them would add value.
The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", and subsequent sanctions, has intensified since the bank first guided on potential losses.
Whether events point to a $2 billion or $4 billion hit for Citigroup in the first quarter or a different sum spread over the year is impossible to determine, analysts said.
""The hard part for us with Citi right now - and it's probably difficult for them, too - is how big of a writedown is needed,"" said Cassidy. ""Writedowns are coming. We just don't know yet how severe.""
Analysts were expecting Citi to earn $13.7 billion this year, according to data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S, so Citigroup should still be profitable this year even with a $5 billion charge. 
Few analysts have updated their estimates for Citigroup since March 4. Many may hold back estimates for big banks until the quarter ends.
By then markets may have turned and more banks may have disclosed consequences of the war and sanctions.

Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp said on Thursday that pulling out of Russia would cost it $100 million in lost revenue in the first quarter. Depending on the final accounting, that could reduce its earnings by 10% from current estimates, according to Barclays' Goldberg.
Some analysts did not want to be quoted about changes they will make to their first-quarter estimates. ""We will have to plug in some number for what provisions will be,"" one said.

For the first quarter, Adobe reported an adjusted EPS of $3.37, up from $3.14 in the year-ago period and slightly above the consensus estimates of $3.34. Revenue came in at $4.26 billion in the quarter, up 9.1% YoY and compared to the analyst consensus of $4.24 billion.
Adobes Q1 results reflect the companys strong execution and resilience through unprecedented circumstances, said Dan Durn, CFO of Adobe.
Digital media revenue hit $3.11 billion, up 8.7% YoY, and in line with analyst expectations. Digital experience revenue came in at $1.06 billion, up 13% YoY and just above the consensus projection of $1.04 billion.
For the second fiscal quarter, Adobe expects adjusted EPS of about $3.30, below the consensus estimates of $3.35 per share. The company expects revenue of about $4.34 billion in FQ2, missing the analyst expectations of $4.4 billion.
Adobe expects Digital Media revenue to rise around 13% in the quarter and estimates Digital Experience segment revenue and Digital Experience subscription revenue to grow about 15% and 17%, respectively.
The company also said it has reduced its Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which practically represents Adobes ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. Additionally, Adobe reduced ARR by an additional $12 million for its Digital Media services in Ukraine while it will continue to operate in this country.
These actions result in a total ARR cut of $87 million and an expected revenue impact of $75 million for fiscal year 2022, the company added.
Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan lowered the price target on Adobe to $605.00 per share from $700.00. The analyst believes the company can still double its revenues in the long-term to potentially enter the top ranks of software companies to reach $40bn+ of revenues.
He shares four reasons why he remains positive on ADBE stock.
Stifel analyst Parker Lane has maintained a Buy rating and $600.00 target price on ADBE shares following a beat quarter.
We believe ADBE is well positioned for continued penetration of its TAM and can effectively navigate these near-term headwinds, Lane said in a client note.
Similarly, BMO analyst Keith Bachman sees Adobe stock as attractively valued, particularly relative to our expectations for mid-teens FY23 growth.

The world's highest-profile Chinese automaker, thanks to its investments in Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:MBGn), reported a 2021 profit of 4.85 billion yuan ($761.64 million), compared with 5.53 billion yuan in the previous year. Revenue rose 10% to 101.6 billion yuan. 
""The intensified competition in China, the rise in raw material prices, other pandemic-related disruptions and global shortages of chip supply have showed no signs of subsiding and should continue to put pressure on the sales performance and profitability of the Group in 2022,"" Geely Automobile said in a statement.
Geely Automobile is targeting to sell 24% more vehicles this year, at 1.65 million vehicles, saying it would look to further expand its export sales to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and western Europe. 
The company also recommended payment of a final dividend of HK$0.21 per ordinary share. 
China's auto sales grew last year, helped by surging sales of new energy vehicles, but industry executives have warned about the impact of a global shortage of semiconductors and rising raw material prices, which have been exacerbated by supply chain disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"".

In an earnings call on Wednesday, Geely Auto Group CEO Jerry Gan said the company's reliance on custom chips and globalised supply chains meant the semiconductor shortage had a ""quite large effect"" on production, an issue Geely would tackle via localisation and in-house chip development, among other measures.

LONDON (Reuters) -ING Groep NV will no longer finance new oil and gas projects, its energy chief said, becoming the biggest bank yet to commit to such a step in the fight against climate change.
The move by the Dutch financial services firm raises pressure on peers to heed a call by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for a halt to funding for new fossil fuel projects to help cap global warming at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Michiel de Haan told Reuters that ING would not finance projects approved after Dec. 31, 2021 but would still fund energy firms, although ING is already phasing down financing to the oil and gas industry and scaling up lending for renewables.
De Haan said the bank would target a 50% increase in lending for renewable energy by 2025, building on strong growth in 2021, when financing grew 26% to 7.3 billion euros ($8.05 billion).
ING's plan to reduce funding for existing oil and gas clients and projects is more gradual, with a target to cut it by 12% to about 3.5 billion euros by 2025.
""Decarbonisation of the energy system ... is of almost existential importance, but so is affordable energy and reliable supply of energy,"" de Haan said.
""We can make the decision to discontinue our involvement in new greenfields, but we (will) continue our existing involvement in oil and gas across the world because we need to meet those other two targets.""
Lucie Pinson, executive director at NGO Reclaim Finance, said ING was the biggest bank after Crédit Mutuel to introduce such a policy on project finance, but while it was a ""great signal"" to the market, it did not go far enough.
Specifically, banks needed to rein in all other finance to the sector more quickly and be prepared to drop companies planning to expand production, something so far only French public lender Banque Postale has committed to https://oilgaspolicytracker.org.
""ING's commitment to reduce its funding to the overall sector without committing to quickly exclude companies opening new oil and gas fields does not augur well for our climate,"" she said.
Investor pressure on banks to act faster on climate change has increased in the year since the IEA published its report on ending fossil fuel funding.
But many banks have only promised to stop lending in narrow circumstances, such as for drilling in the Arctic. The Ukraine crisis may further hamper the shift, as Europe seeks alternatives to Russian oil and gas.
""It's important to recognise that the IEA also indicates that in the future, oil and gas will be needed,"" de Haan said, adding that the bank was seeking to help customers decarbonise their businesses.
ShareAction, an organisation pushing for responsible investment, said in a February report that 25 of Europe's leading banks had provided $55 billion in funding in 2021 for energy companies planning to expand oil and gas production.

It said HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) were among the biggest funders of oil and gas projects in 2021.

The deal, sealed on Tuesday evening, comes as inflation in Germany hovers above 5% and after Deutsche paid its chief executive officer 20% more in 2021 to reward him for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.
Under the deal's terms, workers get a 3.1% pay increase from June 1 and a further increase of 2.1% from February 2023, the Verdi union and Deutsche Bank said. The deal also includes 750-euro ($826) payments in May and January.
The union had asked for a 6% wage increase and other benefits.
""Negotiations took place in an atmosphere of great uncertainty due to the environment of ultra-low interest rates, increasing inflation, and a dramatic geopolitical crisis in Europe,"" said Michael Ilgner, head of personnel at Deutsche Bank. 
Workers went on a strike on Friday, the latest volley in the pay negotiations ahead of Tuesday's third round of talks.
Attention now turns to wage talks for 60,000 workers at Germany's public-sector banks and 140,000 workers at private banks.
Those workers have been seeking a 4.5% pay increase, as well as other rights such as working outside the office. That wage dispute has been going since last year.
High inflation has strengthened the hand of union officials, but banks have faced stiff competition and low profits, which has resulted in efforts to cut costs and reduce headcount.

Germany has more banks per capita than most of its neighbours and other industrialised economies.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Employees of the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co staged walkouts and social media campaigns on Tuesday to protest the company's response to Florida legislation that would limit classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity. 
In a rare public demonstration of unrest, about 60 Disney employees gathered at a park outside of Los Angeles, where they wielded signs calling on Disney to ""protect LGBTQ kids"" and chanted ""Disney say gay. We won't go away."" 
""A lot of people enjoy working for Disney. And a lot of people are upset that the company they love is harming the subset of employees and their community in Florida,” said Taylor White, a technical director at Disney television.
Disney has encountered internal criticism about its public stance toward the legislation, which critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. 
On Tuesday, some employees walked in a demonstration around the perimeter of the nearby Disney studios lot. Other employees spoke out via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The turnout was modest for Disney, which employs some 16,000 people in Burbank and Glendale, though many are working from home because of the pandemic.
The protests culminated a week of abbreviated walk-outs during scheduled breaks, as part of a campaign dubbed the ""Disney Do Better Walkout."" 
The organizers called on Disney to cease campaign contributions to politicians supporting the Florida measure and to develop a plan to protect employees from such legislation. They also want Disney to halt construction in Florida, home of the company's flagship Walt Disney World theme park, until the state repeals the measure, which Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated he will sign it into law. If so, it goes into effect July 1.
Disney attempted to address employee concerns though a virtual town hall for employees on Monday. CEO Bob Chapek said the company made a mistake initially remaining publicly silent on the legislation and pledged to use the moment as a catalyst for change. 

“We know how important this issue is for our LGBTQ+ employees, their families and allies, we respect our colleagues’ right to express their views,"" a Disney spokesperson said. ""And we pledge our ongoing support of the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equal rights.”
Ahead of Tuesday's demonstrations, one unit within the company, Disney+, offered public support for LGBTQIA+ colleagues on Twitter, writing, ""we strongly denounce all legislation that infringes on the basic human rights of people in the LGBTQIA+ community.""

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, continuing  to rebound after recent losses caused by the Ukraine war and the associated inflation concerns. 
By 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded up 0.4%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5%.
European indices are following the global trend higher, with a positive close on Wall Street late Tuesday and Asian shares following suit overnight. Cash is returning to the beaten-up equity markets, largely from the bond markets as investors braced for central banks, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, to take aggressive approaches to taming inflation.
That said, these gains remain tentative as the war in Ukraine rages on, with Russian air strikes continuing to pound the besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country.
Investors are looking forward to the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden for talks with NATO and European leaders in Brussels, starting later in the session, amid expectations for more sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and moves to tighten existing measures.
Elsewhere, U.K. consumer prices rose 0.8% on the month in February, soaring 6.2% on the year, the fastest rate in 30 years. This will put further pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help his citizens suffering a cost of living crisis in his Spring Statement to Parliament.
In the corporate sector, automakers were among the top gainers, with Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), Mercedes Benz (DE:MBGn) and TotalEnergies (PA:TTEF), announcing plans to build a battery plant in Italy.
The battery plant would be the third in Europe for Stellantis, after ones already announced in France and Germany, which are also being built through ACC.
TotalEnergies stock rose 0.1% after the French energy company’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné said that its decision to quit Russian oil supply contracts does not put the overall future of the company at risk.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, increasing concerns about the tight nature of the global market.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session. 
By 4:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $110.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $116.75.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,923.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1016.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Moderna Inc is sponsoring sumo flags in its first such promotion in Japan, as the COVID-19 vaccine maker seeks to wrestle market share from compatriot  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
The U.S. firm's introduction to the broader Japanese public was set back after some of its doses last year were found to be contaminated, although it has clawed back market share since with the help of a government-endorsed programme.
Now, as the government plans a fourth-dose vaccination programme,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is looking to sumo to boost its public appeal as it seeks to expand beyond COVID-19 shots.
The sumo flags, known as kensho-hata, are held by banner bearers circling the sumo ring and have traditionally served as ads for everyday goods such as vitamins, teas, juices and rice.
Moderna debuted its banner on March 13 at the start of the national sport's two-week spring tournament - a simple white design with the company name in chunky, red, sumo-style script.
The promotion signals the company's growth aspirations in Japan, which has come to know Moderna through some 50 million doses of its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine imported last year by local partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.
Those doses made up less than 20% of shots in Japan's initial double-shot inoculation push, with the bulk made up of the shot Pfizer developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
During that time, 1.63 million Moderna doses were recalled in Japan after metal fragments were found in some vials - a problem traced to a partner factory in Spain.
When booster shots became available, residents rushed to book appointments for Pfizer supplies, leaving many Moderna slots vacant. That prompted the government to actively promote a vaccine mix-and-match strategy, emphasising speed over brand.
That helped the numbers even out, with Moderna accounting for about 42% of booster shots.
Last week, the government said vaccines for fourth doses will be split nearly even between the two suppliers. It plans to secure 75 million doses from Pfizer and 70 million from Moderna.
For the fourth shot, which is under development and will be a combination of vaccines designed for the Delta and Omicron variants of the novel coronavirus, Moderna directly holds the rights in Japan, Rami Suzuki, Moderna's recently appointed representative director in Japan, told Reuters.
Takeda said it is in discussion with Moderna about distribution.
Moderna, founded in 2010 and based in Cambridge in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, did not have an office in Japan until October, and Suzuki, who previously held roles at pharmaceutical firms Janssen and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd, joined in November.
Going forward, the company plans to combine COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in one shot, with possible market introduction in 2023, Suzuki said. Later, the combined shot could include a third vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), she said.
The Japan push comes as Moderna increases its Asia presence with a plan to produce mRNA vaccines in Australia and create four subsidiaries in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.

It also has a vaccine production deal with South Korean drugmaker Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics Co Ltd.
Based on trials showing Moderna's shot has the strongest antibody effect when combined with other vaccines, the firm ""still has opportunity to seize market share from Pfizer in terms of boosters,"" said healthcare analyst Xinyao Wang, who publishes on the SmartKarma platform.

Data this morning showing British inflation rose to a new 30-year high of 6.2% last month, is a reminder perhaps that tackling price pressures could require more not less monetary tightening.
While the Bank of England raised rates again last week to curb inflation, it softened its language on the need for more increases as households face a huge hit from soaring energy bills. 
For some analysts, under estimating inflation trends longer-term by the BoE means long-dated British government bonds or gilts stand to significantly underperform German and U.S. peers this year. 
Graphic: UK inflation surges again: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjblobve/UKINFLATION.PNG 
Market focus will stay with Britain, with Finance minister Rishi Sunak due to give a budget update in parliament at around 1230 GMT. He's expected to add to the support he gave households only last month to cope with energy bills.
No doubt central banks are in a bind. The Federal Reserve is adamant it will put battling inflation first with more U.S. policymakers overnight calling for bigger hikes. 
As a result, Fed funds futures suggest traders are anticipating more aggressive rate hikes ahead. Traders now see the federal funds rate rising to the 2.25%-2.5% range by year-end, higher than the 1.9% suggested by Fed forecasts last week.
Stock markets continue to take growing unease in bond markets over higher rates in their stride meanwhile. Asia equities have hit three-week highs, while European and U.S. stock market futures are higher. 
Note, two-year Treasury yields are up 73 bps so far in March, set for their biggest monthly jump since 2004.
Maybe the stabilisation in many financial markets is a reason to hope that investors are coming to terms with the prospect of higher rates. Time will tell. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Biden heads to Europe with more sanctions for Russia -
- Japan's 10-year bond yield rises to one-month high
- Flash euro zone consumer confidence
- NATO chief Stoltenberg press conference
- Russian central bank deputy governor Russian Central Bank Alexey Zabotkin speaks to Duma

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) -Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management has voted in favour of a shareholder proposal demanding Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp solicit buyout offers from private equity firms, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Oasis also voted against the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to break itself up, said the source, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
The upcoming vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday marks a pivotal moment in a long-running battle between Toshiba management and its growing number of foreign shareholders. Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass. 
Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's second-largest shareholder, submitted the proposal - a motion that also has the support of its top shareholder Effissimo Capital Management and No. 3 shareholder Farallon Capital Management. 
Together, the top three shareholders own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold about 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.

Oasis, which has not disclosed the size of its stake in Toshiba, declined to comment.
Toshiba said it would continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.

(Reuters) -China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) saw its shares soar as much as 60% in Hong Kong on Tuesday after the telecommunications equipment maker completed five years of probation in the United States, marking the end of a U.S. criminal case.
ZTE's probation - imposed in a 2017 guilty plea deal for illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran, and extended in 2018 - ended on schedule on March 22, despite a possible violation.
An alleged visa fraud had raised the possibility of additional penalties, sending ZTE's stock plummeting earlier this month, but a U.S. judge on Tuesday ruled against further action by the court.
ZTE is still subject to a 2018 settlement agreement with the U.S. Commerce Department.
ZTE suspended trading in its Shenzhen and Hong Kong-listed shares following the ruling and before markets opened Wednesday. Upon resuming trade at 0500 GMT, its Hong Kong stock registered its biggest daily percentage gain since its December 2004 debut.
Its Shenzhen stock rose 10% to its highest since March 10.
ZTE had been accused of violating probation over an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud. According to an indictment unsealed last March, a former ZTE research director and a Georgia Institute of Technology professor allegedly conspired to bring Chinese nationals to the U.S. to conduct research at ZTE from at least 2014 through 2018 while on J-1 visas sponsored by the university.
While ZTE has not been charged in the visa case, which is pending in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade held a hearing in Dallas last week on the fraud allegation as a possible violation of ZTE's probation. 
In his Tuesday ruling, the judge found ZTE was legally responsible for the actions of the former ZTE director.
But he decided to not take any further action against ZTE, which had already reached the maximum term of probation and, ZTE argued, had already been fined the maximum as well.
As part of its 2017 plea deal, ZTE paid the U.S. $892 million.
There was an ""open question about legal tools left for the court,"" the judge wrote.
Despite the favorable ruling, the judge encouraged the government to pursue any reasonable charges and criminal or civil penalties against the company, especially for export compliance matters.
PENALTIES
The visa issue was not the first problem that surfaced for ZTE since the plea deal. In 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department found ZTE made false statements about disciplining executives tied to the illegal shipments to Iran and, as a result, issued a total ban on the company buying U.S. components.
ZTE, which ceased major operations as a result of the ban, paid a $1 billion penalty and agreed to change its leadership and cooperate with a 10-year monitor appointed by the Commerce Department, as part of a settlement lifting the ban.
The judge took action in 2018 over the false statements, too, extending ZTE's probation and a court-appointed monitor from three to five years.
In his Tuesday ruling, the judge noted that ZTE argued the visa-fraud related events occurred more than three years ago, and that new leadership had brought an improved export compliance program.
""The Company has made strides,"" the judge said, adding that ZTE's export control and compliance programs were effectively ""nonexistent"" when it was originally sentenced.
He said he considered ZTE's compliance a mitigating factor, but that its record of compliance could be summarized in one word: ""sometimes.""
ZTE in a statement to Reuters said it was ""proud of the significant improvement in the company's compliance program and culture."" It said the improvement had been acknowledged over the years.
Evans Rice, a lawyer for ZTE, said in court last week that, in 2020, the court-appointed monitor had recognized ""a sea change"" in the company's commitment to compliance and cooperation.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The professor charged in the visa case, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the former ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. ZTE said he left the company in 2019.

The case against ZTE was the first of a series of U.S. government actions against major Chinese tech companies that caused tensions in U.S.-China relations. 
It was followed by a case, still pending, against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the hobbled Chinese telecommunications equipment giant, which was also placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 for activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, following the global trend higher as investors look to rebound after recent losses caused by the Ukraine war and the associated inflation concerns. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
The major indices closed higher on Wall Street late Tuesday, led by a 2% gain in the NASDAQ Composite, and Asian shares followed suit overnight, with Japan's Nikkei jumping 2.5% to touch a two-month high. 
European indices are set to continue the recovery as cash returns to the beaten-up equity markets, largely from the bond markets as investors braced for central banks, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, to take aggressive approaches to taming inflation.
That said, these gains remain tentative as the war in Ukraine rages on, with Russian air strikes continuing to pound the besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country.
Talks between Ukraine and Russia are confrontational but moving forward, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday, ahead of the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden for talks with NATO and European leaders in Brussels, starting later in the day.
Biden is expected to bring with him plans for more sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and moves to tighten existing measures.
Elsewhere, U.K. consumer prices rose 0.8% on the month in February, soaring 6.2% on the year, the fastest rate in 30 years. This will put further pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help his citizens suffering a cost of living crisis in his Spring Statement to Parliament.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, increasing concerns about the tight nature of the global market.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session. 
By 3:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $109.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $116.43.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,918.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1032."

(Reuters) - Hundreds of companies have said they are withdrawing or suspending operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, from energy producer Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc to carmaker Hyundai Motor Co to PwC, a global professional services firm.
The following is a look at how insurance and international arbitration might soften the blow to those companies, which stand to lose billions of dollars:
DOES STANDARD INSURANCE PROVIDE COVERAGE?
No, but companies can purchase political risk as an add-on to trade credit, property and aviation insurance. It covers government seizures of property and forced abandonment, cancellations of government licenses for operations such as mines and the inability to convert foreign currency. The insurance typically covers long-term energy or infrastructure projects, but can be purchased by other types of businesses. Policies are confidential, insurance experts said, and disputes are resolved in private arbitration.
Berne Union, a trade association representing political risk insurers, estimated that $1 billion in new political risk insurance was written in Russia in 2020, its most recent data. 
Much of the insurance is written by non-commercial agencies such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp of the United States and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, part of the World Bank.
WILL COMPANIES LEAVING RUSSIA HAVE CLAIMS?
Companies that leave and abandon their business without any action taken by the Russia government to seize control of their assets will have a tough time collecting insurance, according to legal experts. 
""You see companies saying 'we're leaving because we support Ukraine.' The question is then whether the policy covers a voluntary departure,"" said Micah Skidmore of the law firm Haynes and Boone. 
Insurers are most likely to pay claims for revenues earned in Russian roubles that are no longer convertible to foreign currency, said legal experts. 
WHAT MIGHT HELP COMPANIES RECOUP THEIR LOSSES? 
Russia could take actions that would support claims that assets are being seized. Last week, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure that allows the country to place planes leased from foreign companies on Russia's aircraft register.
Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp said earlier this month the Russian law demonstrates Moscow's intent to confiscate planes and the company expected the move to help the company collect on its insurance.
Sanctions give the aircraft leasing industry until March 28 to sever ties with Russian airlines. If more than 400 jets in Russia are not repossessed, the industry stands to lose almost $10 billion.
Russia's ruling United Russia party said in early March it is considering a proposal to nationalize foreign-owned firms that leave the country. If enacted, this measure could also support claims for insurance.
ARE THERE OTHER AVENUES FOR COMPENSATION?
A company can look to trade agreements signed by Russia which provide for arbitration when government actions damage foreign investment. 
The Steptoe & Johnson law firm said last week in a note to clients that classic international arbitration claims include failure to protect intellectual property rights, refusal to release aircraft and expropriation of assets. 
At least nine companies from Ukraine used trade agreements to seek billions through arbitration from Russia after Moscow annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. 
However, the international arbitration process can take years and Russia does not voluntarily pay awards, according to legal experts. 

Franz Sedelmayer, whose German security equipment business was expropriated by Russia in 1996, won a $2.3 million arbitration award in 1998 but spent more than a decade fighting in numerous courts trying to collect the money.
A company would not be able to collect on both insurance and arbitration.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tougher stance on inflation driving gains on Wall Street but deepening a Treasury selloff.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.94% by 11:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.61%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.46%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.9%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.49% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.67%.
U.S. contracts fluctuated, but the S&P 500 was up for the fifth session in six. However, U.S. Treasuries held its losses from Monday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that a half-point interest-rate hike could be possible at the central bank’s next meeting. Short-term U.S. government bonds fell toward their worst quarterly performance in almost four decades, while Australian and New Zealand debt also weakened.
Central banks are moving towards tightening their monetary policy in response to rising inflation, which has risen to 40-year highs as the war on Ukraine led to rising commodity prices.
Even the Fed’s more dovish policymakers agree with Powell’s statement that interest rates should be hiked at a quicker pace, with the economy strong enough to weather higher borrowing costs. Equity markets seem to be responding to that message, with some investors leaning into stocks as an inflation hedge.
“We are positive for equities for this year,” Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah told Bloomberg. While the market may be more challenged in 2023 and recession risks are rising, “we still think the U.S. economy is pretty good fundamentally,” she said.
“Faster hikes are clearly going to help inflation come down,” which may reduce the need for a longer tightening campaign, she added.
The Fed is expected to hike interest rates six more times within 2022, after raising it to 0.5% in its latest policy decision handed down during the previous week. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Tuesday that it was time to remove policy accommodation, while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester called for faster hikes.
Powell, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will also speak at the BIS innovation summit later in the day.
Concerns about economic growth are mounting, as the war in Ukraine shows little sign of resolution. U.S. President Joe Biden and allies will meet in Brussels, where they are expected to announce new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. They are also expected to introduce fresh measures designed to keep Russia from sidestepping existing economic penalties.
Investors will also monitor commodity markets, with the U.S. and U.K. reaching a deal to ease tariffs on British steel and aluminum that could ease some inflationary pressures.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will deliver his “spring statement” on the budget later in the day, with U.S. durable goods orders data due a day later."
353,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 11:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Share buybacks are emerging as the hottest trend among Chinese tech giants and industry leader Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. may be the next to jump on the bandwagon.
The online gaming giant climbed as much as 3.1% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, just before it’s expected to announce its slowest profit growth ever. Investors are betting that the company will follow in the footsteps of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp., which both announced massive buybacks after their earnings, with the moves fueling a rally in their shares. 
The improving sentiment in tech stocks reflects broader hopes that China’s crackdown on the sector is coming to an end after the government pledged greater support for the economy and capital markets. But, a recovery remains dependent on concrete action from the authorities, and Morgan Stanley’s equity strategists warn that it’s too early to be optimistic.
“Alibaba and Xiaomi have probably kick-started shareholders’ focus on buybacks after a horrendous performance in share prices in the last year,” said Kerry Goh, chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte. “Tougher restrictions on investing in other firms, coupled with a strong balance sheet and good cash flow should motivate Tencent to do a share buyback like the others.”
An 18% surge in Alibaba’s stock since Tuesday indicates that share buybacks have become a more rewarding strategy for Chinese tech giants, after valuations slumped to near record lows and regulatory fears eased. Still, the scale of repurchases is small compared to megacaps in the U.S., which have bought back more than $20 billion worth of stock in each of the recent quarters. 
“In consideration of cash usage, shareholder returns may now become a priority over something, say like the M&A back in the past,” said Vey-Sern Ling, senior analyst at Union Bancaire Privee.
Tencent boosted its dividend payout, including offering JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com Inc. shares, in order to lure investors. But, those moves have failed to reverse a downtrend in its stock. This year, Tencent overtook Alibaba to become the biggest loser in China’s tech rout after it shed about $450 billion in market value since last February. 
Tencent certainly has the financial resources for a buyback. The company held about $40 billion in cash and short-term instruments on its balance sheet at the end of September, a figure that may well have increased when it reports the December quarter results.
The company’s business is under pressure with revenue growth projected to fall to its slowest pace on record when it reports earnings later Wednesday. Tencent’s games business has been handicapped by Beijing’s freeze on new titles, while its online advertising business is expected to have contracted for the first time on record in the fourth quarter.
Still, many analysts see opportunity in a buyback after Tencent plunged during Beijing’s crackdown, at one point shedding more than $500 billion in market value. Even after their recent rally, the shares trade at about 16 times earnings compared with Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s 32 times and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).’s multiple of more than 100.

(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis producer Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) Inc is in advanced talks to buy rival Columbia Care (OTC:CCHWF) Inc for around $2 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
If a deal is finalised it would be one of the largest in the U.S. cannabis industry to date. The industry, still in its infancy, continues to operate in a regulatory environment defined by a patchwork of laws that vary from state to state.
A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, the sources said. Exact terms of the deal could not be learnt.
The people cautioned that talks could still fall apart and highlighted that the companies have overlapping footprints in multiple states, including in the key New York market, and could require significant divestitures - a possible hurdle in reaching an agreement.
The sources requested anonymity as the discussions were confidential.
Cresco Labs and Columbia Care did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Cannabis sales in the United States have been booming and are forecast to reach $46 billion by 2026, according to industry research firm BDSA, as states like New York and New Jersey open up.
Still, margins and profits remain thin and analysts and investors have called for consolidation to improve profitability by finding savings in scale.
The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis exchange-traded fund has lost 19% of its value so far this year.
Columbia Care stock has risen about 9% this year but it is down almost 70% since it started trading in 2019. Cresco Labs shares have slumped 63% from a 2021 peak.

Both companies are listed in Canada and trade over-the-counter in the United States as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, and the two large U.S. stock exchanges cannot allow companies that grow or sell the plant to list their shares.
Cresco is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter financials on Wednesday, while Columbia Care last week postponed its earnings to Thursday.

This comes as China's regulators are considering a proposal to allow their U.S. counterparts to inspect audit working papers of some Chinese firms that do not gather sensitive data, two of the sources said.
As part of that move, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and other regulatory agencies earlier this month summoned top internet companies, including search engine leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and e-commerce major JD.com Inc, four sources told Reuters.
Other internet firms summoned by the regulator included Alibaba Group and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp, two of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. E-retailer  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc and gaming firm NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc also attended the meeting, one of them added. 
They were asked to prepare audit documents for the 2021 financial year keeping in mind U.S. regulators' requests for more disclosure, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not allowed to discuss details of the meeting.
The companies should better seek Chinese regulators' advice if they are ""uncertain about anything"" during the whole process the first source said, which includes auditing and communications with U.S. regulators.
CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pinduoduo and NetEase also did not immediately provide comment.
The latest step by the Chinese regulators shows Beijing's willingness to make some concessions to resolve a long-running Sino-U.S. audit stand-off that has put hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in Chinese companies at stake. 
The U.S. authorities are moving towards kicking Chinese companies off American stock exchanges, if the companies' audit records are unavailable for their inspection for three years in a row.
DELISTING RISKS
In December, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) finalised rules to delist Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), and said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without naming them.
The SEC earlier this month named for the first time five of these firms, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) and biotech firm  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, that could face delisting.
Describing the SEC move as ""normal procedure"", CSRC said it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the dispute.
Chinese regulators' deliberations with the New York-listed domestic companies on more audit disclosure were ongoing, three of the sources said. 
Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing, citing national security concerns, bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms. 
A map on the website https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), an auditor oversight body tasked to help keep publicly traded companies in the United States in check, showed China as the only jurisdiction that denied the organisation ""necessary access to conduct oversight"". 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated on March 11 that U.S. institutional investors held around $200 billion of exposure to Chinese companies' American depositary receipts (ADRs).

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, fell nearly 60% over the past 12 months. 
In an attempt to calm investor fears, China's Vice Premier Liu He said last week talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators on companies listed in the United States have made progress and both sides are working on specific cooperation plans.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The top U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday urged a federal judge not to let Elon Musk escape an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored, which the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive considers part of a campaign of harassment.
In a filing in the federal court in Manhattan, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Musk had not met his ""high burden"" to set aside a 2018 consent decree requiring that Tesla lawyers approve tweets and other public statements that could be material to his electric car company. 
It's not enough that Musk found compliance ""less convenient than he had hoped,"" or wished the SEC would stop investigating Tesla's disclosure procedures.
""When it comes to civil settlements, a deal is a deal, absent far more compelling circumstances than are here presented,"" the SEC said.
The regulatory agency also urged U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversees the decree, to reject Musk's bid to quash a subpoena requesting records concerning his Twitter poll last November over whether to sell 10% of his Tesla stock.
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Legal experts have said Musk is unlikely to have the decree set aside.
Earlier on Tuesday, Musk danced and joked with fans as he oversaw the opening of Tesla's first European factory, located near Berlin, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in attendance.
Tesla also has a factory in Shanghai. The company has made Musk the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine.
The SEC dispute stems from the regulator's claim that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take his electric car company private at a premium, when in reality a buyout was not close.
Tesla and Musk settled by each paying a $20 million civil fine, with Musk stepping down as Tesla's chairman.
Musk has since accused the SEC of harassing him with ""roving and unbound"" investigations, in a bad-faith effort to punish him for criticizing the government and exercising his constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment.
But the SEC said it has broad authority and a ""legitimate purpose"" to investigate Musk and Tesla, and that Musk could oppose the subpoena only through a subpoena enforcement action.
""Musk complains about 'the sheer number of demands' by the SEC from 2018 to the present, which he characterizes as harassment,"" the SEC said.
""But Musk's own chronology of alleged demands is both underwhelming and reflects legitimate inquiries as to new potentially violative conduct by Tesla and Musk,"" it added.

The subpoena related to Musk's tweet that he would offload 10% of his Tesla stake if users approved.
A majority did, and the poll caused Tesla's share price to fall. Musk has since sold more than $16 billion of Tesla stock.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Rescuers in southern China searched for victims from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet on Tuesday after it crashed with 132 people on board and authorities said severe damage to the aircraft would make it difficult to establish the cause of the crash. 
Flight MU5735 was headed on Monday for the port city of Guangzhou from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, when it plunged from cruising altitude to crash in the mountains of Guangxi less than an hour before landing time.
A jet appeared to dive to the ground at an angle of about 35 degrees from the vertical in video images from a vehicle's dashboard camera, according to Chinese media. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
No survivors have been found, said Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), told reporters.
""The jet was seriously damaged during the crash, and investigations will face a very high level of difficulty,"" Zhu said at the first government briefing on the disaster.
""Given the information currently available, we still do not have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash,"" he said, adding that the aircraft did not respond to repeated calls from air controllers during its rapid descent. 
On Tuesday, rescuers combed heavily forested mountain slopes in southern China, using shovels and torches in their search for victims and flight recorders from the jet. 
About 600 soldiers, firefighters and police marched to the crash site, a patch of about 1 square kilometre (0.4 square mile) in a location hemmed in by mountains on three sides, after excavators cleared a path, state television said.
It added that the search for the recorders, or ""black boxes"", of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 involved in China's first crash of a commercial jetliner since 2010, would be carried out in grid-by-grid fashion, probably through the night. 
'BANG, BANG'
Si, 64, a villager near the crash site who declined to give his first name, told Reuters he heard a ""bang, bang"" at the time of the crash. 
""It was like thunder,"" he said. 
State television has shown images of plane debris strewn among trees charred by fire. Burnt remains of identity cards and wallets were also seen. 
Rain was forecast in the area this week. 
Police set up a checkpoint at Lu village, on the approach to the site, and barred journalists from entering. Several people gathered for a small Buddhist ceremony nearby to pray for the victims. 
The last commercial jetliner to crash in China was in 2010, when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines went down, killing 44 of the 96 aboard.
Highlighting the top-level concern, Vice Premier Liu He went to Guangxi on Monday night to oversee search and rescue operations. An official of the same rank was similarly sent to the site of the 2010 crash in northeast China. 
""That B737-800 jet met airworthiness standards before taking off and technical conditions were stable,"" Sun Shiying, a China Eastern official, said at the briefing.
""The crew members were in good health, and their flying experience was in line with regulatory requirements,"" he said.
PLANES GROUNDED
The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several crises, notably the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel and safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes.
""Accidents that start at cruise altitude are usually caused by weather, deliberate sabotage, or pilot error,"" Dan Elwell, a former head of U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration, told Reuters.
Elwell, who led the FAA during the 737-MAX crisis, said mechanical failures in modern commercial jets were rare at cruise altitude.
The 737-800 was delivered on June 22, 2015, and accumulated 18,239 hours of flight time after 8,986 flights, said Zhu.
Chinese investigators are leading the probe because the crash took place there, but U.S. authorities will provide aid because the plane was U.S.-made.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was in touch with CAAC's investigator-in-charge and would support the investigation with technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and engine manufacturer CFM in all ways necessary.

China has strict quarantine policies due to the pandemic. No decision has been made yet about whether U.S. authorities will travel there for the investigation, a NTSB spokesperson said.
On Monday, China Eastern and two subsidiaries grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors, including several who run environmentally focused funds, welcomed the U.S. government's proposed new rule on corporate disclosure of climate-related risks and emissions, saying it would standardize reports that now are voluntary and vary widely in quality and breadth.
The investors said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's draft regulation, if finalized, would make it easier for money managers to judge how different companies and industries are handling the challenges and opportunities of a warming planet. 
U.S. environmental, social and governance-focused funds (ESG) took in a record $71 billion last year, up from $51 billion in 2020, according to Morningstar, and experts noted shareholders have been seeking better data.[nL1N2SM2EH]
Their responses to the draft could shape the final version of the rule the SEC may eventually pass.
Lack of consistent corporate disclosures to date has made such analysis difficult for investors focused on ESG concerns. 
""Right now you have a lot of disparate information coming from different places. This should streamline how all investors, not just those focused on ESG investing, can look at the data,"" said Sarah Bratton Hughes, head of ESG and sustainable investing for American Century Investments in Kansas City.
Dan Abbasi, who runs a $200 million environmentally focused investment strategy for Douglass Winthrop Advisors in New York, said the proposed rules also could help fund managers select companies that stand to benefit from a transition to a lower-carbon economy.
""It's going to give us additional material to work with in terms of how management not only sees the risks of climate change, but how they are seizing the opportunity,"" he said.
The draft rule calls for companies to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and supplier and partner emissions, known as Scope 3 emissions, if material.
WIDE RANGE OF REPORTS
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said the commission wants to simplify reporting as investor interest in climate data surges. As of February 41 U.S. shareholder proposals called for some form of new climate disclosures, according to proxy solicitor Georgeson.
Gensler cited a report that found 65% of Russell 1000 companies published ""sustainability reports"" in 2019. But the report, by the Governance & Accountability Institute, found only around half of companies in some sectors like communications and finance published those reports, which companies organized using a range of frameworks.
""The reporting right now is all voluntary, so you have companies that don't do any reporting, or they're doing more communications or marketing reports than comparable, reliable investor-grade material,"" said Gary Levante, senior vice president of corporate responsibility at Berkshire Bank.
""A 'mixed bag' is the best way to describe it,"" he said.
CHALLENGES REMAIN
The proposed rule was advanced by a vote of 3-1, with the dissent coming from the commission's lone Republican Hester Peirce. The Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby, called the proposal too prescriptive.
On the other end of the spectrum, several climate-focused activist investors said they supported the new rules even though they would prefer the SEC mandate more Scope 3 disclosures.
""It's a reasonable rule. Scope 3 is very difficult to measure, but for some sectors, like the food sector, it's where their emissions lie,"" said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management.
The Investment Company Institute, which represents global investors, broadly welcomed the rule but said it will ""carefully study"" the Scope 3 requirements. 

Mark Gibbens, a Kansas City financial advisor and CEO of Erudite Capital, said the SEC struck a good balance. Whatever Scope 3 reporting burdens companies may face, he said, were unlikely to affect performance of energy-focused ETFs he holds such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. 
""I'm not worried,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, led by a 2% gain in the Nasdaq, as shares of technology and other big growth names rebounded from recent losses and  Nike  rose after it reported upbeat results.
Financial shares also were among the day's best performers as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.368%, with the S&P 500 bank index up 2.5%.
Every S&P 500 sector but energy ended higher on the day. The three major indexes have gained in five of the last six sessions. 
The Federal Reserve last week raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level, and Fed officials are doing little to downplay rising market expectations the U.S. central bank will raise rates by half a percentage point in May to tame inflation.
While higher borrowing costs are a negative for consumers and many businesses, they help to boost the profit outlook for banks.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gave the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 technology index rose 1.4% on the day, but remained down 10% for the quarter so far, among the sharpest declines of the major sectors.
With the recent lows, ""you sort of really did wash out the sellers,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""Now you're seeing even the old leadership bounce a little bit, giving people a little support that maybe the worst is over. 
""Underneath all of it is that economic and earnings data have remained fairly good.""
Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares rose 2.2% after the company beat quarterly profit and revenue expectations and said manufacturing issues pinching sales over the past six months were in the rear view mirror.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.47 points, or 0.74%, to 34,807.46, the S&P 500 gained 50.43 points, or 1.13%, to 4,511.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 270.36 points, or 1.95%, to 14,108.82.
Tesla Inc jumped 7.9% as the electric-car maker delivered its first German-made cars to customers at its Gruenheide gigafactory.
On Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates. When asked what would prevent the central bank from raising rates by half a percentage point at the May 3-4 policy meeting, he responded: ""Nothing."" Powell is slated to speak again on Wednesday.
Investors were still keeping a close eye on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, with Ukrainian officials saying the besieged port city of Mariupol is under continuous bombardment as Russian forces redouble their efforts to capture it. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 37 new lows.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in January he hopes to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the unit, still commonly known as Banamex, its name before Citi purchased it in 2001.
Lopez Obrador floated the names of several Mexican billionaires, such as Ricardo Salinas, who runs Banco Azteca, and Banorte's Carlos Hank Gonzalez as potential buyers.
""This is a historic opportunity to strengthen the national banking system, bringing together businessmen and the Mexican public,"" Gonzalez said in the statement. ""For Banorte, it would be a pride to champion this initiative, in case it is judged beneficial for our investors and banking users."" 
Banorte said after the sale was announced in January it would analyze a potential bid. Citi has yet to set a date to ""open the books"" and make terms of the sale transparent, a Banorte spokesperson told Reuters on Tuesday. 
In the statement, Banorte said it would invite its national network of entrepreneurs, as well as ""all Mexicans,"" to invest in the purchase without a minimum buy-in, if Banorte decides to place a bid.

Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser announced the sale in January, in line with the institution's recent strategy of exiting international markets.
Meanwhile, an executive of the Mexican unit said in February that its commitment to the country was ""more active than ever"" as the bank announced a $68 million expansion and remodel plan.

GRUENHEIDE, Germany (Reuters) -Elon Musk was cheered as he oversaw the handover of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s first German-made cars at its Gruenheide plant on Tuesday, marking the start of the U.S. automaker's inaugural European hub just two years after it was first announced.
Loud music played as 30 clients and their families got a first glimpse of their shining new vehicles through a glitzy, neon-lit Tesla branded tunnel, clapping and cheering as Tesla Chief Executive Musk danced and joked with fans.
""This is a great day for the factory,"" Musk said, describing it as ""another step in the direction of a sustainable future"".
Musk said that Tesla is likely to launch a test version of its new ""Full Self-Driving"" software in Europe, possibly next year depending on regulatory approval.
""It's quite difficult to do full self-driving in Europe,"" he told factory workers on Tuesday, saying much work needs to be done to handle tricky driving situations in Europe where roads vary a lot by country. 
Although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also attended the event, lauded the gigafactory as the future of the car industry, it has faced opposition and some environmental activists blocked the factory's entrance while displaying banners flagging its high water use.
Two protestors abseiled from a motorway sign near the factory, blocking traffic for hours after the event.
Musk had hoped to begin output from the factory eight months ago, but licensing delays and local concerns around the plant's environmental impact held up the process.
Tesla was forced to service European orders from Shanghai while it awaited its German licence, adding to rising logistics costs at a time when it was struggling with industry-wide chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
It got the final go-ahead from local authorities on March 4 to begin production in Germany, provided it met conditions ranging from its water use to air pollution controls.
The plant opening came on the same day as the top U.S. securities regulator urged a federal judge not to let Musk back out of an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored.
Tesla shares ended up 7.9% at their highest level in more than two months on Tuesday. 
RACE WITH VW 
The new owners received the Model Y Performance configuration, a vehicle costing 63,990 euros ($70,500) with a 514 km (320 miles) range, Tesla said, adding that new orders from the plant could be delivered from April.
Tesla said that around 3,500 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far.
At full capacity, the plant will produce 500,000 cars a year, more than the 450,000 battery-electric vehicles that German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) sold globally in 2021. 
It will also eventually generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, surpassing all other plants in Germany. Tesla is expected to initially import batteries from China for its German-made Model Ys before it starts local battery production.
Musk said on Tuesday that battery production will be a ""challenge"" next year and will be ""the limiting factor"" in the coming years, as Tesla aims to aggressively boost vehicle production. 
For now, Volkswagen still has the inside track in the race to electrify Europe's fleet, with a 25% market share to Tesla's 13%. Musk has said ramping up production would take longer than the two years it took to build the plant.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted Gruenheide would produce around 54,000 cars in 2022, increasing to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.
Volkswagen, which has received 95,000 EV orders in Europe this year, is planning a new 2 billion euro EV factory alongside its existing facility in Wolfsburg and six battery plants across Europe.

But its timeline lags Tesla's, with the EV factory due to open in 2026 and the first battery plant in 2023.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador postponed an unprecedented issue of a bitcoin-backed bond planned for last week, as the government decided to wait for favorable conditions in the financial market, Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said on Tuesday.
The Central American government had scheduled the launch of the $1 billion bond between 15-20 March, but the war between Russia and Ukraine and volatility of the cryptocurrency prompted authorities to change the date.
The launch could be postponed until September as bitcoin has swooned since hitting a record high above $67,500 in early November. It lost almost half its value by Jan. 22, and traded at $42,609 on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Now is not the time to issue the bond, according to Zelaya who said that the ideal date to go on the market is the first half of the year, during an interview with a local television channel.

""In May or June the market variants are a little different. At the latest in September. After September, if you go out to the international market, it is difficult (to raise capital),"" he added
El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender last year, generating criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which worries the measure could hurt the country's finances.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executives of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will make the case Wednesday for U.S. government subsidies to boost semiconductor manufacturing before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.
Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger will tell the committee ""there is an urgent need for the federal government to incentivize more private sector investment in the United States to enable a resilient and innovative semiconductor ecosystem,"" previously unreported testimony viewed by Reuters says. 
Micron Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra says in his written testimony that approving $52 billion for chips ""will kick start investment in workforce development, R&D, innovation, and expansion of manufacturing in the near term.""
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Both the Senate and House have passed versions of legislation approving $52 billion in chip subsidies in provisions known as the CHIPS Act but differ on other provisions aimed at boosting U.S. competitiveness with China.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo met with senators on Tuesday and urged quick action on chips.
""The situation now in America is urgent,"" Raimondo said. ""We have to decrease our dependence on other countries including Taiwan on chips and the way to do that is to make more chips in America.""
Mehrotra will also call on Congress to pass ""the refundable investment tax credit ... to create a long-term incentive that would invigorate domestic manufacturing in the semiconductor industry.""
Micron has announced plans to invest more than $150 billion globally over the next decade in leading-edge memory manufacturing and R&D and is considering building U.S. new fabs.
Building those new fabs in the United States ""require close coordination with federal and state policies to ensure the economic viability of our operations,"" Mehrotra's testimony says, adding ""we anticipate that a significant amount of federal funding will be required to make a mega-fab viable.""
Intel recently announced plans to invest $20 billion in Ohio to build two new mega fabs that could grow to eight mega fabs 
and $100 billion ""assuming support from the CHIPS Act,"" Gelsinger's testimony says.
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Chief Executive Officer Tim Archer, who heads the semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will tell lawmakers new U.S. fabs ""will depend on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials.""
Archer says a Commerce Department grant program should be able to ""provide incentives across the entire value chain"" and support an ""all-of-ecosystem approach.""

PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) Chief Executive Officer Preston Feight will tell the committee the trucking manufacturing industry has been forced at times to pay brokers ""20 to 30 times"" the contract costs to get chips.
Feight's testimony suggests ""companies requesting CHIPS Act funding be required to meet the needs of American critical businesses, including truck manufacturers, before they are approved to receive U.S. taxpayer dollars.""

365,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 06:07PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Debt obligations from Russian companies linked to sanctioned billionaires were keeping investors on tenterhooks on Tuesday, as coupon payments to foreign holders of the securities ran into hurdles due to Western sanctions triggered by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian steel producer Severstal, whose main shareholder, Alexey Mordashov, was sanctioned by the European Union on Feb. 28, was having trouble paying the holders of its debt, a source close to the company said. 
Evraz, the Russian steelmaker whose biggest shareholder is sanctioned Russian Roman Abramovich, said on Tuesday the coupon payment due March 21 was settled with the paying agent after it was temporarily blocked by a Western correspondent bank.
Fertiliser company EuroChem has also had problems making a coupon payment that was due on March 14 after being blocked by the paying agent, Bloomberg reported last week. The company announced on March 16 that Vladimir Rashevskiy has resigned as chief executive officer and from the board of directors effective March 15 after he had been sanctioned by the EU.
The hurdles faced by these firms show how punishing Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion are having broad impact, as banks turn cautious to avoid violating the rules. 
Russia, which calls its attack on Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" has also had its sovereign debt payments come under a microscope from international investors. 
So far, however, coupons due on dollar-denominated bonds appear to have been processed by intermediary banks under a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
Russia's coupon payment on a sovereign bond maturing in 2029 was received on Monday, a bondholder said, the second time in recent days that the country appears to have averted default.
Assets and companies linked to rich Russian businessmen perceived to be close to President Vladimir Putin face particularly heightened scrutiny, as a number of them have been targeted by Western sanctions.
Russian corporates have nearly $100 billion of hard currency bonds outstanding, more than twice the $40 billion the Russian sovereign owes on international bond markets, according to data from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
More than 50% of the outstanding corporate bonds were issued by quasi-sovereigns or state-run firms, with a heavy skew toward oil and gas companies.
TEST PAYMENT 
The source close to Severstal said a ""test"" payment the company sent last week for its coupon for 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) has yet to be processed by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), with the grace period set to expire on Wednesday.
Severstal said on March 16 that it would pursue alternative options to deliver the $12.6 million coupon payment in case the test - 1% of the coupon - is not processed. But it has not provided any further details so far.
Citi and Severstal declined to comment on the information given to Reuters by the source.

Evraz faced similar hurdles, with the company saying on Monday that a coupon payment of nearly $19 million was ""blocked for compliance"" by the correspondent bank. The company said it believed the issue was linked to sanctions.
On Tuesday, it said the paying agent had settled the relevant account.

(Reuters) -The deadly crash of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) 737-800 could set back Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s efforts to regain ground in the world's biggest aircraft market and deliver more than 140 737 MAX jets already constructed for Chinese customers.
The 737-800 that crashed on Monday does not have the equipment that led to 737 MAX crashes more than three years ago, but that may not make a difference to Chinese passengers and a national regulator known for scrupulous safety requirements.
China Eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Such accidents typically involve multiple factors, and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes, especially in light of the scarce information available.
China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia more than three years ago, and it is the only major market where the MAX has not resumed commercial flights. 
A 737 MAX built for China Eastern subsidiary Shanghai Airlines took off from Seattle bound for Boeing's completion plant in Zhoushan last week, industry sources said, in a sign the model's return to service in China was close.
The plane landed in Guam on March 15 as part of a multi-leg journey and has not moved in the week since, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.
The jet remains in Guam due to a ""minor technical issue"", according to a Boeing spokesperson who declined to provide further details. 
""Our team identified the issue and is working through the logistics to address it appropriately and resume the ferry flight when ready,"" the spokesperson added.
Robert Spingarn, a managing director at Melius Research who focuses on the aerospace sector, said the MAX's return in China could be delayed until authorities there had some answers on the cause of the China Eastern crash. China's aviation regulator is known for being very thorough on safety issues.
Chinese airlines do not need new MAX planes because demand is down following the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years, industry sources said. But the U.S. manufacturer has more than 140 MAX jets already built for Chinese customers waiting to be delivered once the jet returns to commercial service there, a person familiar with the matter said.
Boeing's shares closed 3.6% lower on Monday. Boeing declined to comment on whether the crash could delay a business recovery in China, while China's aviation regulator did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The 737-800 that crashed is an earlier model with a strong safety record and there are nearly 1,200 in service in China, making it the world's largest market for the plane, according to aviation consulting firm IBA. 
More than 4,200 737-800s are in service globally, data from aviation firm Cirium shows.
China Eastern and two of its subsidiaries on Monday grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.
Other Chinese carriers are continuing to fly the jets, according to data from Chinese aviation data provider Flight Master.
Jefferies analysts said China's aviation regulator was unlikely to ground the 737-800 fleet unless it specifically suspected a technical failure as the root cause because of the operational consequences of grounding more than 1,000 planes in the world's second-biggest domestic aviation market. 
However, there are concerns the Chinese public could look to avoid flying on 737-800s until the cause of the crash is determined, given the broader reputational issues with the 737 family caused by the MAX, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note.
""Hence, isolating the cause of the crash will be critical,"" he added, noting the leading causes of commercial air transport crashes tend to be maintenance issues, pilot error or sabotage, rather than manufacturing or design issues.

Boeing cancelled a meeting of its senior executives scheduled for this week in Miami to focus its attention on assisting the investigation and China Eastern, a second person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""We have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident, and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation,"" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) workers in a cafe in Seattle, the coffee chain's hometown, voted 9 to 0 in favor of joining a labor union, according to a tally of ballots on Tuesday.
The results mark the seventh Starbucks-owned cafe in the United States to join the union, following five in Buffalo, New York and one in Mesa, Arizona. 
It is the first location in the company's own backyard to join Workers United. Baristas at more than 150 U.S. locations have petitioned a federal labor board for union elections since August, when the union drive went public.
The company runs about 9,000 U.S. locations, with thousands of others operated under licensing agreements.
The ballooning union drive comes during a nationwide labor crunch.
Some investors have asked Starbucks to adopt a neutral stance toward the union, noting that the company spent years building a reputation as an employee-friendly workplace.
""For a company that depends on a strong brand and customer loyalty, where people have an option to go somewhere else very easily, reputation is critical,"" said Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Trillium Asset Management. 
Last week, Trillium and a group of other investors with $3.4 trillion under management asked Starbucks in a letter to stop sending anti-union communications to employees.

One unknown is what strategy the company will take when former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz steps in for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson.
Schultz ""has a long history of not wanting to see Starbucks unionized,"" Kron said. ""But it is worth at least giving him an opportunity to make a pivot or to do a reset.""

Investing.com – Stocks rose on Tuesday, as investors absorbed words from Federal Reserve officials that indicated a more aggressive tightening was in the works as the central bank looks to conquer inflation.
All three indexes were higher heading into the close, with tech stocks helping the rebound. They closed down on Monday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell surprised markets by saying a bigger half-point increase in rates was in the cards. The Fed normally raises rates in quarter-point increments, as it did last week for the first time since the pandemic erupted.
The Fed is trying to quash inflation as Russia’s war with Ukraine threatens to exacerbate high energy and commodity prices and rising prices of food and other household essentials. 
President Joe Biden was set to travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union to discuss the West’s response to Russia, which continues to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine.
More sanctions will likely be announced at the NATO summit, the White House said Tuesday.
It’s a fairly light week for data and earnings. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Nvidia outlook
On Tuesday, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) made numerous announcements surrounding its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle computer. 
It has started production of the Orin, while also showcasing new automakers adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. The company also announced its automotive pipeline has increased to over $11 billion over the next six years. Analysts will be watching to see how the chipmaker rebounds from a global shortage of chips that affected production in the auto industry.
2. Travel stocks in focus
Just when people thought it was safe to travel again, Europe and Asia are seeing another wave of Covid-19 infections and there are concerns it will spread to the U.S., where many locations have only recently ended most of their restrictions and mandates. This doesn’t bode well for travel stocks. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) already missed estimates for both earnings per share and revenue. The shares ended flat for the day, but investors will likely be watching the space closely.
3. Adobe earnings
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) beat analysts' forecasts with earnings per share of $3.37 on revenue of $4.26 billion, but the shares dropped and will likely continue to be a focus on Wednesday. Adobe's subscription revenue came in at $3.96 billion. However, product revenue was $145 million, down 6.5% compared to the previous year.
Looking ahead, the company is targeting revenue of $4.34 billion in the second quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.30.

At around 2000 GMT, or 4:00 p.m. ET, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.38%, having hit its highest level since 2019. The 2-year note also ticked up, to yield 2.16%, from 2.13%.
“The degree of difficulty for Jerome Powell’s Fed to stick a soft landing for the economy is about the same as Captain Sullenberger’s heroic emergency landing on the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River,"" said Aaron Clark, a portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management in Boston, referring to the 2009 landing of a US Airways plane after its engines failed. 
""The market remains in a tug of war between a policy error causing a recession and a resilient economy with a strong consumer and corporate sector,"" Clark wrote in an email.
Stocks also rose in Europe. The STOXX 600 gained 0.85%, having climbed in recent sessions to reach a one-month high. London's FTSE 100 gained nearly 0.5%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up approximately 1.1%.
Matthias Scheiber, global head of multiasset portfolio management at Allspring Global Investments in London, said the pickup in stocks could be a case of investors buying the dip, but that growth stocks would struggle if the U.S. 10-year yield moves closer to 2.5%.
""We saw the sharp rise in yields yesterday and we see that continuing today on the long end, so that’s likely to put pressure on equities. ... It will be hard for equities to have a positive performance.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) took a different view and said that 80% of its clients plan to increase equity exposure, which is a record high.
""With positioning light, sentiment weak and geopolitical risks likely to ease over time, we believe risks are skewed to the upside,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients.
""We believe investors should add risk in areas that overshot on the downside such as innovation, tech, biotech, EM/China, and small caps. These segments are pricing in a severe global recession, which will not materialize, in our view.""
The conflict in Ukraine continued to weigh on sentiment. Russia, the U.S. and Britain traded accusations at the United Nations on Tuesday over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, but none produced any evidence to back their concerns.
Oil prices pulled back less than 1% on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened and it looked unlikely that the European Union would pursue an embargo on Russian oil, a day after prices jumped 7% and also rose earlier in the session.
The dollar edged lower on Tuesday as the boost from Powell's comments faded and a rise in equities markets help boost risk-on sentiment.

Spot gold dropped 0.7% to $1,921.73 an ounce, pressured by rising interest rates.

Investing.com –  Stocks climbed Tuesday, as growth stocks sidestepped growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to turn more aggressive on rate hikes, while meme-stocks including GameStop returned to rally mode.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard stressed the need for the Fed to move faster and more aggressively on rate hikes to curb the pace of inflation.
The remarks arrived a day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would be prepared to hike by more than 25 basis points at upcoming meetings to “ensure a return to price stability.”
Wall Street was quick to price in steeper hikes following Powell’s comments, with Goldman Sachs now forecasting a 50 basis point hike at the Fed’s May and June meetings.
Regional banks paired some of their recent losses helping the broader financials sector rise more than 1% as rising rates boost the net interest margin of banks.

On the earnings front,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), a sizeable Dow Jones index component, rose more than 2% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. 
“Recent results and commentary from senior leadership of the company show clearly that NKE is managing well various external headwinds, including ongoing supply chain distributions and geopolitical tensions, across the globe,” Oppenheimer said in a note. “We are optimistic that money will soon flow back into NKE shares.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday, recovering after the previous session’s weakness sparked by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting the central bank could lift interest rates more quickly than expected.
At 4:15 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 254 points or 0.7%, the S&P 500 rose 1%, and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%.
The three main indexes on Wall Street closed lower Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 200 points, or 0.6%, breaking a five-day winning streak, the S&P 500 fell marginally and the NASDAQ Composite declined 0.4% after Fed chief Powell vowed Monday to take the “necessary steps” to curb inflation.
“If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Powell said.
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at its meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018.
Also helping the tone were strong numbers from  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), with the world’s biggest sportswear maker beating third-quarter revenue and profit expectations, helped by strong demand in North America. The retailer also stated that manufacturing issues that have hurt sales over the past six months were now behind it.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its new European production hub in Germany earlier Tuesday, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised its share buyback program by $9 billion to $25 billion, the Chinese e-commerce giant’s largest ever repurchase plan.
Cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) reported a loss of $1.89 billion for the fiscal first quarter. Software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will report after the closing bell.
Elsewhere, investors will keep a wary eye on developments in eastern Europe, with Russian troops continuing to bombard several Ukrainian cities, and the Black Sea port of Mariupol in particular.
Ukraine would hold a referendum on the terms of any peace agreement with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a televised interview late Monday.

Attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by Iranian-aligned Houthis over the weekend have also added jitters to the market.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said on Tuesday he had told staff in 2019 to disclose to the U.S. Department of Justice all information on an investigation the company carried out that year into suspect payments in Iraq.
The Swedish telecoms equipment maker has been under scrutiny over possible payments to Islamic State after Ericsson said this month that U.S. authorities had determined it failed to make sufficient disclosures about its activities in Iraq before entering a deferred prosecution agreement in 2019.
""It's correct that I instructed to disclose fully to the DOJ and then of course we have an internal process ... I will not go into those details,"" Ekholm said on a call with shareholders, ahead of its annual general meeting on March 29.
The Ericsson board, including Chairman Ronnie Leten, has been backing Ekholm, after proxy firms including Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders vote to remove him following the disclosure and a sharp fall in the company's share price.
Ericsson had only submitted parts of its 77-page investigation in 2019 and not the entire report to the Justice Department, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The 2019 deal between Ericsson and the Justice Department was to resolve a probe into years of alleged corruption in China, Vietnam and Djibouti. Ericsson paid more than $1 billion in penalties and other fees to reach a settlement.
Ericsson disclosed its issues in Iraq last month, triggering a share price fall that wiped more than a third off its market value. It said its 2019 internal probe had identified payments designed to circumvent Iraqi customs at a time when militant organizations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.
However, it did not disclose the findings of this probe to shareholders in 2019 and only released a statement in February after media enquiries, which led to questions over whether the Justice Department was aware of the investigation.
The Justice Department's notice earlier this month said that Ericsson did not properly disclose misconduct and compliance failures in Iraq.
The department was not immediately available for comment.
Since the Justice Department sent a notification of breach to Ericsson on March 2, the company has changed its Chief Legal Officer, replacing Xavier Dedullen with Scott Dresser. 
Dedullen did not respond to a request for comment.
Several shareholders raised concerns on Tuesday's call about whether any other probes were yet to be disclosed or any potential financial implication as a result of the Justice Department deal breach.

Ericsson executives said they are in talks with the department.
""We are going to do everything that we need to do to address any historical issues or that may come up in the review,"" said Dresser, who will oversee Ericsson's review over its conduct relating to Iraq and how it was addressed.

(Reuters) -Nike Inc said on Monday manufacturing issues pinching sales over the past six months were now behind it, positioning the company to take advantage of surging demand for sports shoes and apparel.
Shares of the world's biggest sportswear maker rose 5.9% to $137.90 in extended trading, as it also beat third-quarter revenue and profit estimates.
Pandemic-related factory closures last year in Vietnam, where about half of  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s footwear is made, and the slow return to normal production in the country led to a shortage of Nike, Jordan and Converse sneakers across most markets.
All Nike factories in Vietnam are now operational, with total footwear and apparel production in line with pre-closure volumes, the company's Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said.
However, shipping delays were still a cause for concern for Nike, especially in North America where transit times have worsened, Friend added.
The company's North America revenue rose 9% in the third quarter, helped by sustained pandemic demand for athletic wear, return of school sports and price increases.
""As people returned to some sort of new normal, that still has involved a lot of outdoor activities like trail running, golf and tennis,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
Revenue in Greater China fell 8% in the third quarter, as Nike was forced to prioritize sending its limited supplies to North America over the Chinese market.
The company said it was unclear what the impact of a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases in China would have on its fourth-quarter results.

Nike's revenue rose 5% to $10.87 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 28, while analysts had expected $10.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 87 cents per share, beating estimates of 71 cents per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Monday struck an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion, only weeks after the 91-year-old billionaire bemoaned a lack of good investment opportunities.
Alleghany, the owner of reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings Inc, would expand Berkshire's large portfolio of insurers, which includes auto insurer Geico, reinsurer General Re and a unit that insures against major catastrophes and unusual risks.
""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years,"" Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, said in a statement.
The acquisition, one of the five largest in Berkshire's history, would reunite Buffett with Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008 and became Alleghany's chief executive in December.
It would also end Buffett's six-year drought of large acquisitions and help him to deploy some of the $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents his conglomerate had at the end of last year.
In his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter, Buffett lamented that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and that little ""excites us"" in equity markets. He pledged to keep $30 billion cash on hand.
Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said the merger should offer no surprises, reflecting Buffett's familiarity with Alleghany and Brandon.
""Berkshire has been under pressure to do a deal, and this may be the path of least resistance, though Alleghany will be a positive addition,"" she said.
""In terms of its business model and culture, this is a very strong fit.""
Berkshire agreed to pay $848.02 in cash per Alleghany share, representing a 25% premium over Friday's closing price.
Alleghany would operate as an independent unit of Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska.
Shares of Alleghany closed up $167.85, or 24.8%, at $844.60 on Monday. Berkshire's Class A shares rose $12,009, or 2.3%, to $525,000, their highest-ever close.
'MINI-BERKSHIRE'
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals.
Alleghany has a 25-day ""go-shop"" period to find a better offer. No break-up fee would be owed if the merger fell through.
Berkshire is known for its refusal to engage in bidding wars for whole companies.
Insurance typically generates more than 20% of operating profit at Berkshire, which has dozens of businesses including BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Dairy Queen ice cream and restaurant chain. 
Berkshire also invests hundreds of billions of dollars in stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and has this year invested more than $6.4 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).
New York-based Alleghany was founded in 1929 by railroad entrepreneurs Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen and was transformed into an insurance and investment operating company under Fred Morgan Kirby (NYSE:KEX) II's leadership from 1967 to 1992.
CFRA Research's Seifert said Alleghany has long held itself out as a ""mini-Berkshire,"" being an insurance conglomerate that redeploys some of its excess capital in other businesses.
Buffett said the companies had ""many similarities,"" including what Brandon described in a letter to Alleghany's more than 13,000 employees as a ""shared philosophy of managing businesses for the long term.""
Alleghany's other units include RSUI Group Inc, an underwriter of wholesale specialty insurance, and CapSpecialty, which provides specialist cover for small and medium-sized businesses.

Its Alleghany Capital Corp owns several non-insurance businesses, including companies that focus on industrial parts, machine tools, hotels, toys and funeral services.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Alleghany on the transaction. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy is looking to install two floating storage and regasification units (FSRU) to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports as part of plans to cut reliance on Russian gas, Italy's energy transition minister said on Tuesday.
""Today we officially mandated (gas group) Snam to negotiate the acquisition of an FSRU and the leasing of a second,"" Roberto Cingolani said in a parliamentary hearing.
His comments confirmed sources who earlier told Reuters the two vessels, with a combined capacity of more than 10 billion cubic metres (bcm), would be located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and, probably, in the Adriatic Sea.
The vessels will be located in ports close to existing pipeline infrastructure, one of the sources said.
""The infrastructure... will be identified as strategic assets,"" Cingolani said.
Rome imports around 30 bcm of gas from Russia every year - some 40% of its total gas imports - and is looking to diversify its energy supplies in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Cingolani said earlier this month it would take at least three years to fully replace Russian imports but said 20 bcm could be replaced in the ""near to medium term"" through measures including using more LNG.
Italy is keen to increase LNG imports from markets like Qatar, the United States and Mozambique, but currently has just three LNG plants that account for around 20% of daily imports.
Talks are ongoing with FSRU providers though nothing has been concluded as yet, one of the sources said.
Snam, whose main shareholder is the state, runs Italy's gas transport network and most of the country's gas storage business. It also has LNG plant assets. 
Installing FSRUs is quicker than building fixed terminals but demand for vessels has risen sharply as governments across Europe scramble to find quick ways to secure more LNG cargoes.

Dutch network operator Gasunie is in talks with Germany to use FSRUs in the port town of Brunsbuettel, while the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey are said to be testing the market. 
""There are ambitions by governments to bring additional regasification capacities to Europe. We will see additional 6 FSRUs this winter,"" an industry source said.

WOERT, Germany (Reuters) - The shift to electric cars may pose an existential threat to suppliers of combustion engines but for auto parts firms such as  TE Connectivity  (NYSE:TEL) the challenge is keeping up with demand.
It makes the connectors that link miles of cables in cars to all things electrical, from sensors to fuel injection systems to infotainment - and if there's anything the cars of an electric era will need, it's larger and ever more complex connectors.
That's why TE spent $125 million to open a new building in 2020 dedicated to electric vehicle (EV) parts at a factory tucked away in a shallow valley in the small town of Woert in southern Germany. 
And that's why it's on the lookout for acquisitions or partnerships to keep expanding its auto business, Chief Executive Terrence Curtin told Reuters: ""We're going to continue to add capacity.""
As legacy auto parts suppliers figure out if and when to sell combustion engine businesses or buy EV parts makers, TE and rivals in the connectors or sensors businesses such as Sensata Technologies,  Amphenol Corp  (NYSE:APH) and Molex are looking to supply higher-value components and do more development work with carmakers going through a massive transition.
""All these automakers talking about moving their fleets to electric and making promises about range are incapable of doing that without suppliers like TE,"" says William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar who covers TE, Sensata and Amphenol.
Auto parts account for over 40% of TE's $15 billion in revenue, making it one the biggest car suppliers most people have never heard of. Its $43 billion market value is far bigger than Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) combined - and more than three times heavyweight supplier Continental.
TE has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, Amphenol and Sensata are in the 20s, while Continental trades at about 10.
EUROPEAN DEMAND EXPLOSION
TE's Curtin said car parts suppliers and automakers alike had been caught out by an explosion in demand for EVs in Europe over the past two years - and with everyone playing catch-up TE's new facility was running at double its planned production.
While a global shortage of semiconductors has hit overall car production, Curtin said automakers have been using the chips they do have to prioritise EVs over fossil fuel vehicles - putting ever more strain on suppliers such as TE.
The challenge TE faces is getting the timing and scale of its expansion right, given the EV transition and shift to self-driving cars could run into speed bumps, such as an end to subsidies or safety concerns, Curtin said.
Because for TE, electrification means going bigger.
The far greater power needed by EVs means TE must develop larger and more complex components to handle the extra current, without causing fires.
TE's conventional parts have up to five components but its newer EV parts have up to 50 components. The supplier also now buys tonnes of aluminium, which is lighter and cheaper than copper, to make up portions of those larger parts.
In the older part of the Woert factory, machines spit out 16 connectors for fossil fuel cars a second. In the new building, more complex and costly machines, some supplied by Germany's Manz, crank out larger copper connectors with welded alloy springs for EV charge ports at a far slower pace.
TE also makes a large connector here that sits atop an EV battery module - an EV has up to 12 modules - and serves as its brain, measuring each battery cell's performance while a tiny semiconductor measures their temperature.
The new facility in Woert can make 2 million such connectors a year but demand continues to soar.
""We're going to need more,"" said Matthias Lechner, TE's head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, adding that TE planned to manufacture more at a plant in Hungary and elsewhere. 
Graphic: On the rise: https://graphics.reuters.com/ELECTRIC-VEHICLES/SALES/jnpwebrzwpw/chart.png 
Lechner, who describes TE as ""humble and hidden"", says its connectors can reduce EV charging time by 10 minutes, an edge carmakers can sell to consumers.
CEO Curtin says EVs and self-driving cars will double the value of the parts TE supplies from about $70 now for the average fossil fuel car. That means the payoff could be huge.
EVs almost doubled their global share of vehicle sales to 6% in 2021, according to research group JATO Dynamics, and that share is only set to rise.
Europe's auto supplier market will grow to 330 billion euros ($359 billion) in 2030 from 216 billion now, driven by software, EVs and electronics, McKinsey estimates, as firms tackle chip bottlenecks and cost pressure while investing in growth.
""We're observing a double transformation,"" McKinsey partner Timo Moeller said.
TE's Woert site employs 2,200 people and is adding more engineers and technicians, as well as different machines to make connectors for data in self-driving cars - because unlike EV parts, tiny connections are better for moving data.
TE has three auto parts factories in Germany and another five across Europe. Worldwide, it has 29 factories dedicated to its automotive business.
Morningstar's Kerwin said TE faces the same risks as others in a cyclical business such as the auto industry.
But he said TE had a ""sticky"" relationship with customers and has embedded engineers with carmakers to develop products for vehicles in an electric age.

""The writing is on the wall that you have to play into electrification if you want to succeed,"" Kerwin said.

LONDON (Reuters) - France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) said on Tuesday it had suspended all services in Russia, joining a retreat by other international banks since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Credit Agricole, which had previously stopped new financing for Russian companies, said in a statement it had contacted international corporate clients to begin suspending services.
The bank had previously said its exposure to Russia and Ukraine was around 6.4 billion euros ($7.05 billion) in on and off balance sheet items, but told investors that its 2021 dividend would not be impacted.
Banks and investors have rushed to cut links to Russia in recent weeks, amid heavy Western sanctions against Moscow.
Credit Agricole added that its priority was helping to support its 2,400 employees in Ukraine, who were helping ensure essential banking activities continued despite being ""struck at full force by the war"". 
The move comes a day after French rival BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said it had informed its corporate clients in Russia that it would no longer process their transactions after the end of month, after previously stopping new financing in Russia.
Ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said earlier it had suspended services of all products to customers in Russia and Belarus who are subject to sanctions.

Meanwhile, two thirds of funds in Luxembourg with heavy Russian exposure have been suspended since the Ukraine invasion, which Moscow has said is a ""special military operation"", the Grand Duchy's securities regulator said.

(Reuters) -Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd will resume operations on Tuesday as it agreed to settle a labor dispute with the union representing its conductors and engineers through arbitration, averting more pain to firms battling supply-chain disruptions.
The railroad said the agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference ends the work stoppage that began early Sunday when it locked its workers out over a dispute on pensions, pay and benefits.
That sparked calls for quick negotiations over fears it could aggravate a shortage of commodities caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Canada is the world's biggest producer of potash, a key ingredient for producing nitrogen-containing fertilizers, followed by Russia and Belarus.
A binding arbitration typically involves an employer and a union presenting their demands before an independent arbitrator, whose decision on contract terms is final.
""While arbitration is not the preferred method, we were able to negotiate terms and conditions that were in the best interest of our members,"" union spokesperson Dave Fulton said.
Canada's Minister of Labour Seamus O'Regan Jr, who mediated the talks, said normal operations will continue at CP during the arbitration period. 
The agreement comes as global supply chain woes hamper the rail sector and industries that depend on it to transport everything from cars to coal.
""We are obviously relieved but even a strike of short duration has impacts and is costly,"" Chief Executive of the Mining Association of Canada Pierre Gratton said.
Canada depends heavily on rail to move commodities and manufactured goods to ports. CP's network runs across much of southern Canada and extends as far south as Kansas City in the United States.

The country's last major railway labour disruption was an eight-day Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co strike in 2019.
""Rail should be deemed an essential service under the Canada Labour Code and subjected to binding arbitration to resolve disputes in all cases,"" Western Grain Elevator Association, the organization that handles a bulk of Canada's bulk grain export, said.

Other cyclical sectors such as insurers and autos, preferred bets for a rising rates scenario, rose 2.0% and 1.6% respectively.
Powell said on Monday the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to battle red-hot inflation, just as markets digested last week's 25-basis-point rate hike. 
""Up until now, the Fed had been quite dovish... The fact that they are looking to do raise rates more quickly and more decisively has certainly bolstered the financial sector today,"" said Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. 
Money markets are now pricing an around 50 basis points of rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB) by the end of the year. [IRPR]
The ECB said earlier this month that it would not be in a hurry to raise rates but many conservative policymakers have argued that a rate hike, the first such move in over a decade, should remain on the table as inflation is not as temporary as the central bank once expected.

(Reuters) -Carnival Corp on Tuesday forecast a loss for the year as the U.S. cruise operator's efforts to gradually restart operations after a long pandemic-led hiatus face a setback from a surge in fuel prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
Analysts expect rising fuel costs to temper near-term operating results. Jefferies estimates fuel costs to be 8-10% higher than previously anticipated for the first half of 2022, and 10-11% higher for the second half.
""It's certainly not the first time we've seen a dramatic spike in fuel prices ... (we) are stepping up our efforts to further reduce consumption,"" Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said on a post-earnings call.
Carnival, which had expected to return to positive monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the second quarter, now expects adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in the summer. 
The company reiterated a net loss for the second quarter as higher fuel costs were having a ""material impact"" on its business, but forecast a return to profit in the third quarter as it resumes to full capacity and booking trends improve. 
Shares of Carnival fell about 1.5% to $18.67 after the company also posted lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue as Omicron dented bookings.
While Carnival did not provide a detailed full-year forecast,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the Q1 miss and higher fuel costs suggest ""forecasts will be coming down again."" 

Excluding items, the company posted a loss of $1.66 per share, compared with analysts' expectation of a loss of $1.26, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the wake of the Ukraine conflict, the company has already modified its trips to avoid stopping at Russian ports in the summer, and will also withdraw from any halts in the country for the remainder of the year, it added on Tuesday.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's embattled state-owned oil firm Petroperu will not submit its annual financial audit before the end of July, new Chief Executive Francisco de la Torre told Reuters on Tuesday, meaning it will miss a key May deadline to present the document. 
Petroperu was downgraded earlier this month to junk by credit agencies after accounting firm PwC declined to audit the company's financial statements in the middle of a corporate governance crisis.
Petroperu has yet to find a new auditor to look at its 2021 financial statements and it is seeking bids through April 5, said de la Torre. 
""The optimistic scenario (to complete the audit) is for late July, the conservative scenario is for late August and the pessimistic scenario is for late September,"" said de la Torre, who took on the CEO role on Tuesday on a temporary basis. 
Petroperu's bonds have fallen since the Feb. 28 news that PwC had declined to carry out the audit on the grounds that the auditor could face risks if it did so.
The bonds include covenants that Petroperu must file its audit by May, otherwise it could trigger a technical default. De la Torre said he has offered  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) a contract to win over Petroperu bondholders so they waive the audit requirement.
Petroperu has issued bonds for $3 billion, including a recent $1 billion issuance to finish the construction of a new refinery in northern Peru. It also has an outstanding $1.3 billion loan with Spanish Export Credit Agency (CESCE). 
Under the left-wing administration of President Pedro Castillo, Petroperu has resumed oil production for the first time in decades, although at minimal levels.
Castillo is under pressure to lower fuel prices, which have spiked since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Peru imports the majority of the fuel that it consumes.
Petroperu's previous CEO Hugo Chavez resigned on Sunday amid allegations that he had improperly hired a company to provide him with personal security. He was replaced by de la Torre, who was serving as chief financial officer.
De la Torre said his next priority at the company would be to recover its investment grade, which was lost this month over the tensions with PwC. The firm has also been criticized for significant executive turnover.
""What had been going around financial circles is that people were saying that audit firms did not feel comfortable enough to audit Petroperu while Chavez was in charge,"" de la Torre said.
""Since that has now changed ... we hope that sentiment has changed too.""

Prosus runs Avito as part of its OLX business, which is one of the world's biggest online marketplaces.
""Our Avito classifieds site in Russia hosts around 90 million active adverts and moderates around 5 million new listings every day,"" Prosus said in a statement. 
""We were made aware of a small number of job adverts for military vacancies that had been posted on Avito, and this has now been addressed.""
It did not give details of the jobs.
A Prosus spokesperson said the job adverts had been put up by the Russian military.
Prosus drew criticism on social media for the job adverts from some Ukrainians angry that the Dutch company was allowing the Russian military to recruit on Avito.
Prosus has said it was ""appalled"" by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow says is a ""special military operation"". However, the Dutch company decided to continue Avito's operations, which employ 4,000 people in Russia.
""For us to rush out and leave those people without their livelihoods in the short term feels like the absolute wrong thing to do,"" CEO Bob van Dijk told investors on March 7.
Before the war Avito was valued at around $6 billion. The company said it could not provide forecasts, but Avito's profitability and valuation will be affected by the conflict, given the plunge in value of the Russian rouble.

Prosus is part of a cross-holding entity with Naspers of South Africa, with the two companies sharing a single board.

Investing.com -- BuzzFeed Inc (NASDAQ:BZFD) shares are trading higher Tuesday after revenue beat consensus expectations.
The company announced earnings per share of $0.01 on revenue of $145.7 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.04 on revenue of $133.94 million.
However, it was revealed soon after that three of the company's top editors, including editor-in-chief Mark Schoofs will be stepping down due to an internal announcement about impending job cuts. 
According to the New York Times, BuzzFeed will cut around 1.7% of its workforce.
Reports stated that the company's CEO Jonah Peretti announced cuts across the BuzzFeed video and editorial teams alongside reductions in the business and administrative teams.
“I’m emailing early to share that we are also completing the integration of Complex Networks today, which sadly means that we will part with some colleagues in the Admin and Business organizations,” the NYT quoted Peretti as saying in his note to employees.
Adding: “Although this is always a difficult thing to do, it is essential to unify the business organizations and admin teams from BuzzFeed and Complex Networks in order to realize the opportunities that merging our strong brands offers.”"

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Activist investor Enkraft is demanding a shareholder vote to force RWE to prepare a spin-off of its brown coal unit at the utility's annual general meeting (AGM) next month, according to a filing made public on Tuesday.
Enkraft, which owns a stake in RWE that is large enough to request items be put on the AGM's agenda, has for months lobbied for such a move, and while there is general consensus about the necessity to phase out coal, both sides differ over strategy.
RWE said it has added Enkraft's motion to the AGM's agenda.
""On several occasions Enkraft has tried to persuade the company's Executive Board to immediately leverage this potential,"" Enkraft said in the motion that was made public on RWE's website.
""The persistent inactivity of the board is no longer justifiable and is unacceptable.""
RWE said it would soon publish its response to Enkraft's request.
According to the filing, Enkraft is asking management to ""prepare draft agreements or plans corresponding reports for the lawful spin-off"" of RWE's subsidiary RWE Power AG, which includes the utility's brown coal activities.
RWE's next AGM is scheduled for April 28.
If approved, the documents should then be submitted at the latest by the next ordinary AGM - which would take place in 2023 - for ""adoption of a resolution,"" the filing said.
Enkraft reckons that spinning off lignite generation would remove a discount on RWE shares that puts it behind pure play renewables firms, adding such a move could add more than 16 billion euros ($17.6 billion) to the firm's market value.

RWE has said that phasing out coal cannot be done via brute force, adding the impact on jobs and regional economies had to be taken into account and proposing a smoother and less abrupt exit.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -Embattled China Evergrande Group will unveil a debt restructuring proposal for its creditors by the end of July, it said on Tuesday, after concerns about its financial health were renewed by a delay in publishing its annual results.
Evergrande, whose $22.7 billion worth of offshore debt is deemed to be in default, is seeking to ""further enhance communications"" with creditors to reach the end-July target, its executive director Siu Shawn told investors on a call.
Earlier on Tuesday, Evergrande said in a stock exchange filing it would not meet a March 31 deadline to file its financial results for 2021 because audit work had not been completed.
The world's most indebted property developer, Evergrande told investors in January it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. 
A wave of defaults in China's property sector has rattled investors and while state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money.
Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, defaulted on some overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes.
The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring.
""With the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors ... we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,"" Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors.
As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin.
Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd have been suspended since Monday.
Liang said on the investor call the developer was trying to rope in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle and property services units to restore value - a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success.
Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week.
Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management.
""They mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended. There was no new information and the situation remained the same,"" said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
A MODEL TO FOLLOW? 
Earlier on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Evergrande planned to return land used as collateral for a trust loan to the Guangzhou government, providing a model for local authority involvement that could be replicated for other indebted Chinese property firms.
The deal centres around a 3.25 billion yuan ($510.73 million) trust loan that CITIC Trust issued to Evergrande using funds raised from investors, according to the sources and a document reviewed by Reuters partially outlining the plan.
Under the plans, CITIC will return the land used as collateral to Evergrande, which will then pass it on to the Guangzhou city government to put up for sale, the sources said.
State-owned Guangzhou City Construction Investment group will act as a guarantor of the loan and CITIC will repay the principal amount to its investors within two years using funds from the Guangzhou city government, the sources said. 
The plan is still pending approval from the investors of the trust loan, one of the people said.
If successfully implemented, this model of local government and creditors working together to resolve Evergrande's debt repayment issue could be replicated for other trust loans, analysts said, and more state-owned city investment companies may become involved in the firm's debt restructuring process.
Evergrande, CITIC and Guangzhou City Construction Investment did not respond to requests for comment.
Trust companies, which pool money from wealthy investors, are an important source of funding for Evergrande and other property developers in China. 
In a separate filing on Tuesday, Evergrande said its Property Services Group had launched an investigation into how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan in deposits that had been pledged as security for third party guarantees.

The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande, which said it would hire King & Wood Mallesons as an additional legal adviser.

ROME (Reuters) -EU companies affected by sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine can get up to 400,000 euros ($441,320) in state aid, according to a European Commission document seen by Reuters.
Companies in the agricultural, fishery and aquaculture sectors can get up to 35,000 euros in direct grants, tax and payment advantages and guarantees, the document said.
The move to loosen for now state aid rules to help thousands of companies facing disruptions to their supply chains due to the sanctions followed a precedent set two years ago when the EU executive relaxed rules to aid COVID-hit businesses.
Companies hit by high gas, electricity prices can get aid not exceeding 30% of eligible costs up to a maximum of 2 million euros, the document said.
Companies facing a cash crunch can request a public guarantee for their loans, for up to 15% of their average total annual turnover over the last three closed accounting periods or 50% of energy costs over a year.

(Reuters) -The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Antibodies in kids after COVID last 6 months or more
Most children and adolescents with COVID-19 antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection usually still have the antibodies in their blood more than half a year later, new data shows.
Starting in October 2020, researchers in Texas recruited 218 subjects between the ages of 5 and 19. Each provided three blood samples, at three-month intervals. More than 90% were unvaccinated when they enrolled in the study. The first blood test showed infection-related antibodies indicating recovery from COVID-19 in one-third of the children, the researchers reported online Friday in Pediatrics https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2021-055505/185412/Durability-of-SARS-CoV-2-Antibodies-From-Natural. Six months later, 96% of those with the antibodies still had them. The study was designed to detect the presence of antibodies, which are only one component of the immune system's defenses, not the amount of antibodies. The level of protection even in those with antibodies is unclear. Researchers found no differences based on whether a child was asymptomatic, severity of symptoms, when they had the virus or due to weight or gender.
""It was the same for everyone,"" Sarah Messiah of UTHealth School of Public Health Dallas, said in a statement. ""Some parents... think just because their child has had COVID-19, they are now protected and don't need to get the vaccine,"" Messiah said. ""We have a great tool available to give children additional protection by getting their vaccine.""
A small study published earlier this month in JAMA Network Open https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789845 suggested that most children infected with the coronavirus do not have antibodies in their blood afterward. Only 37% of children appeared to develop antibodies, compared to 76% of adults, even though viral loads were similar in the two groups, those researchers found. 
Experimental SK vaccine shows promise against Omicron
A booster shot of an experimental vaccine being developed by SK Bioscience Co has shown ""durable protection"" against the Omicron variant in Rhesus macaques, according to new data.
The monkeys had received two initial doses of the vaccine plus a booster 6 or 12 months later. Blood samples from the boosted primates showed ""remarkably high"" levels of antibodies that could neutralize both the original strain of the virus and the Omicron variant that caused infections to soar, the researchers reported on Sunday on bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484950v1 ahead of peer review. The animals' second-line immune defenses were also ""substantial and persistent,"" they said. The vaccine, called GBP510, triggers responses from the immune system by delivering copies of a key part of the spike protein from the surface of the coronavirus. The protein ""subunits"" are studded onto nanoparticles to resemble the virus itself. These components are supplemented with an adjuvant from GSK that boosts the immune system's responses, explained Bali Pulendran of Stanford University in California.
""Vaccination with two doses... followed a year later by a booster shot... plus adjuvant, led to highly durable antibody responses and protection against Omicron infection, even six months later,"" Pulendran said. Large late-stage trials of GBP510 in humans are underway. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) drug less protective vs Omicron in transplant patients
The AstraZeneca antibody shots given to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk children and adults with weakened immune systems do not adequately protect organ transplant recipients from the Omicron variant, researchers found.
The drug, Evusheld, did protect against the Delta variant in kidney transplant recipients, and lab test results released on Monday show Evusheld can neutralize Omicron in mice, including the highly contagious BA.2 version. But among 416 kidney recipients treated with Evusheld after Omicron became the predominant variant, 9.4% developed symptomatic breakthrough infections, with one-in-three of those patients requiring hospitalization, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.19.22272575v1 ahead of peer review. Two patients died of COVID-19. In lab experiments, the researchers exposed the BA.1 version of Omicron that caused the massive winter surge to blood samples from 15 Evusheld-treated patients. None of the samples could neutralize the virus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently advised https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-authorizes-revisions-evusheld-dosing that higher doses of Evusheld are likely needed to prevent Omicron infections, and that patients who received the originally approved shots should receive booster doses. The researchers said kidney transplant recipients ""should be advised to maintain sanitary protection measures and undergo vaccine boosters.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Tech giant SAP and Boston Consulting Group said on Tuesday they would team up to help some of the world's biggest companies overhaul their business strategy and accelerate their efforts to cut carbon emissions. 
While thousands of companies https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign have pledged to cut their planet-warming emissions by the middle of the century, emissions across the economy continue to rise, leaving the world on course to suffer the catastrophic impacts caused by climate change.
Despite policymakers pushing companies to get a better grip on the environmental impact of their supply chains, including in Europe through the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1145 directive, most companies are some way from being able to do so.
In a recent study https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/press/13october2021-only-nine-percent-of-organizations-measure-emissions-comprehensively, just 9% of executives from 1,290 companies surveyed by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said they were able to fully measure their emissions.
To help fix the problem, SAP, which counts 85 of the world's 100 biggest companies as customers, and BCG said they would combine their carbon tracking and measurement technology and services to help inform clients' decision making.
""Being sustainable requires coordination across the value chain, and this is where SAP’s partnership with BCG plays a key role,"" SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein said in a statement.
""Bringing together BCG’s expertise, tools, and services with SAP’s technology gives companies the transparency, actionable data, and strategic guidance they need to successfully tackle end-to-end sustainability and create value for all its stakeholders.”

Companies acting first could achieve up to 15 years of competitive advantage and a share price premium of 10%, added BCG Chief Executive Christoph Schweizer, citing analysis by the company.

WiLAN's parent company Quarterhill (OTC:QTRHF) Inc said the agreement settles all court cases between WiLAN, its subsidiary Polaris (NYSE:PII), and Apple in the United States, Canada and Germany. 
Specific terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Apple sued WiLAN in 2014, seeking a ruling that it did not infringe patents related to allocating bandwidth in a wireless network. WiLAN claimed that iPhone 5 and 6 models infringed by using the LTE wireless standard.
Apple convinced a U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., in February to reject the $85 million jury verdict against the iPhone maker because of problems with WiLAN's expert testimony. 

The decision was the second time the court had overturned a multi-million dollar verdict for WiLAN in the dispute, after it rejected a $145 million jury win in 2018.
WiLAN's primary business is buying patents in fields including wireless communications, computer chips and the automotive industry and licensing the technology to companies.

(Reuters) - Sandbox AQ, which has long-term goals to help clients use quantum computing, announced on Tuesday that it has spun off from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, raised ""nine figures"" of funding and signed several clients for its cybersecurity services.
With the large funding and former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt as its chairman, Sandbox AQ is one of the highest-profile startups pursuing software that would operate at least partially on quantum computers.
Though unreliable and costly now, quantum computers could within a decade boost the power of artificial intelligence and other tools by crunching data millions of times faster than supercomputers. 
Sandbox AQ's initial sales are coming from software that runs on classical computers but tries to block quantum machines from someday unlocking standard encryption and exposing sensitive communications. Customers include New York's Mount Sinai Health System and telecoms providers Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Business and SoftBank Mobile.
Mount Sinai President David Reich told Reuters that Sandbox would over the next year assess the encryption in the health system's messaging tools and propose potential algorithm upgrades.
Schmidt said in an interview that converting large organizations to quantum-secure communications would be ""a pretty big business.""
In addition, Sandbox is nearing deals to sell quantum simulation software to potentially accelerate development of drugs and materials, CEO Jack Hidary said. Projects that could be commercialized over the next three years include using AI to analyze data from quantum-based sensors to improve medical imaging and also enable navigation by tracking magnetic fields instead of GPS satellites, he added.
Some of the team and inspiration for Sandbox originated at Alphabet in 2016. But the Google parent will not be a shareholder. Hidary said he wanted outside investors to help speed growth. The company will use cloud computing from Google Cloud and others.
Alphabet said it was ""pleased to help Jack to transition to an independent company.""
Investors include Schmidt, Breyer Capital, T. Rowe Price funds and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) founder Marc Benioff's TIME Ventures. Hidary declined to specify the amount of funding, saying he wanted attention instead to be on the technology.

The Palo Alto, California-based company has 55 employees and will spend the new funding on hiring.
Hidary said the company had prioritized increasing racial, gender and other diversity and was working to bring in residents from University of California Merced, not commonly known as a tech powerhouse, as one way to reach its goal.

We fear that weakening delinquency trends combined with macro-and geopolitical risks could lead to waning appetite from Upstart's credit buyers and the securitization market. The biggest risk to Upstart, in our view, is its reliance on third-party funding, and this risk tends to become exacerbated during recessions and market turmoil, the beginnings of which could be in process of unfolding, the analyst added.

Speaking at a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results, management said JBS will benefit from strong U.S. domestic demand for food products and steady meat trade flows to Asian markets, especially China.
JBS shares rose 2.5% in early trading after it said it earned $1.31 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts expectations.
In Brazil, where the company is headquartered, cost pressure will continue to weigh on the Seara division as meat processors scramble to buy corn used as feed. 
The scarcity during the inter-harvest period for corn, which will last through the middle of the year, is compounded by the war in Ukraine, which has caused grain prices to spike globally, affecting operations across all geographies.
Seara, which processes pork and poultry, has been unable to pass on higher costs onto consumers in Brazil, management said citing the weakness of Brazil's economy. In the United States on the other hand, consumers have the purchasing power to continue buying, executives said. 
Citing USDA data for 2022, JBS managers said beef and pork production will fall from the previous year in the United States, while poultry output will likely rise. 
In the United States, where the company derives most of its revenue, the outlook for prices and margins remains positive. In Australia, herds are still recovering but the outlook is improving.

On Monday, JBS reported record sales last year on the back of the strength of its U.S. business, which is also buoyed by strong trade ties with China.
Regarding acquisitions JBS made in 2021, the company said companies acquired are performing better than expected.

Investing.com -- Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) reported earnings Tuesday before the open, missing analyst estimates for both earnings per share and revenue.
The cruise line stock initially fell in the aftermath of the report, however, it is now up 1.3% on the day after regaining those early losses, which saw it open the session at $18.64.
Carnival announced earnings per share of -$1.66 on revenue of $1.62 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of -$1.22 on revenue of $2.3 billion.
In the company's cruise segments, revenue per passenger cruise day for the quarter increased around 7.5% compared to 2019. Carnival said this was due to ""exceptionally strong"" onboard and other revenue.
As of March 22, Carnival said 75% of its capacity had resumed guest cruise operations, with each of its brand's full fleet back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season, when it believes monthly adjusted EBITDA will then turn positive.
""Since the middle of January, the company has seen an improving trend in weekly booking volumes for future sailings. Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations,"" stated Carnival.
Carnival Corporation President and CEO Arnold Donald stated: ""Given the recent strengthening in booking volumes coupled with the closer-in booking patterns, we expect an extended wave season. In fact, we gained occupancy even in the month of March with fleetwide occupancy nearing 70 percent and several sailings already exceeding 100 percent.""
""Since the middle of January, the company has seen an improving trend in weekly booking volumes for future sailings. Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations.""
Looking ahead, Carnival said the ongoing resumption of its guest cruise operations and the increased uncertainty given the current invasion of Ukraine, including its effect on the price of fuel, are having a material impact on its business.
Therefore, they see a net loss for the second quarter. However, the company expects a profit for Q3, but a full year 2022 net loss."

The slashed price target on COIN shares reflects conservative out-year margins and a higher discount rate.
Margins are pressured by the companys plans to ramp investments in 2023, which will directly hit EBITDA margins. On the other hand, the acceleration in spending is likely to offer an additional tailwind to MTU growth.
We agree with the move and see increased tech/product development spending translating to new features and functions (i.e. anticipated NFT platform) that will help drive further differentiation vs. less capitalized exchange peers. While recent crypto volatility has likely hampered transaction activity YTD, we assume strong Subscription and Services growth, primarily in Blockchain Rewards (staking), improving the revenue mix in 2023, Christiansen said in a client note.
The analyst also took note of declining crypto trading volumes, down roughly 20% in January and February compared to December. On a more positive note, COINs share of total volume has likely improved ~50bps to ~10%. 
Coinbases web traffic has declined in line with overall volume trends, although Coinbase app usage has only modestly contracted over the same period. Despite a successful post-Super Bowl pop, Coinbase downloads declined from 2.7mn in January to 1.6mn in February. Illustrated within, the mix of Coinbase Pro traffic declined modestly (Total Web Traffic ~20% to ~19%, Web Unique Traffic 10% to 9%, App MAUs flattish near 5-6%), which we think should bode well for a sequential improvement in combined spreads for 1Q21 results, the analyst added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, with bank stocks, in particular, responding well to hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that pointed to a faster pace of monetary tightening in the next couple of months.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 213 points, or 0.6%, at 34,766 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%. All three indices finished lower on Monday, reversing earlier gains after Powell warned that inflation was ""much too high"" and that the Fed “may well reach the conclusion that we need to move more quickly.”
Goldman Sachs analysts told clients in a morning note that they now expect 50 basis point hikes at each of the Fed's next two policy meetings in May and June, followed by quarter-point hikes in each of the Fed meetings in the second half of the year. Bond yields, which shot higher in response to the news on Monday, continued to rise on Tuesday, gaining around 5 basis points all along the curve.
That movement supported bank stocks, in particular, for whom higher bond yields generally presage wider lending margins. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 3.8% in early dealings, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2.9%.
The news also supported companies with relatively low levels of leverage and high cash balances. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) stock, already in vogue after Monday's agreement to buy insurance-heavy conglomerate Alleghany (NYSE:Y), rose another 1.1%.
Another stock to stand out in early trade was  Nike  (NYSE:NKE). The world's biggest sportswear maker rose 5.8% to its highest in three weeks after reporting earnings that suggested it had overcome the worst of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, even though the report bore out fears that it's suffering from a backlash against its products in China.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 10.8% to their highest in five weeks after the Chinese e-commerce giant raised its share buyback program by $9 billion to $25 billion. The ADRs have lost nearly two-thirds of their value in the last five months, one of the biggest paper losses of all time, but have started to attract more favorable comments from an analyst community that increasingly thinks that the regulatory risks facing the company are now adequately priced in.
Rival Chinese e-commerce company  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) saw its ADRs also rise by 10.8%, thanks mainly to better-than-expected operating results in the latest quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 1.4% as the company started deliveries from its new factory in Germany, eight months after its original start date. The start of production comes at an opportune time, when its Shanghai factory, which has been used to export to the European market, is facing ongoing interruptions to its business from mass COVID-19 testing both on-site and in important logistics centers around the factory."

Initially planned for November last year, the launch of the new model had been delayed due to a global chip shortage.
Maserati, the luxury brand of Stellantis, said the Grecale would be available in the second half of this year in three versions, two 300- and 330-horse-powered four-cylinder mild hybrids, as well as a high performance 530-horse powered petrol V6 capable of a top speed of 285 kilometres per hour.
Chief Executive Davide Grasso has said deliveries would start in the summer for the EMEA region and will follow right after in the United States.
With a length of 4.859 meters and a starting selling price ranging from around 74,000 to 111,000 euros ($81,000-$122,000), the Grecale will compete with models including Porsche's Cayenne and Macan, Mercedes' GLE, BMW's X5 and Land Rover's Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA).
A full-electric version of the car will be available next year, widening the pool of potential competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Taking its name from a wind, like its elder sister Maserati Levante, the Grecale will be produced in Stellantis' Cassino plant, in central Italy.
Maserati aims to offer a so-called 'Folgore' full-electric version of each model - including the over 200,000 euro super sport car MC20 - by 2025 and to be entirely full-electric by 2030.

Its first battery electric vehicle (BEV) will be the new GranTurismo, due to debut before the Grecale in 2023.

""In 2021 we experienced a very complex situation,"" Xiaomi president Wang Xiang said in an earnings call.
""Supply is in a very severe or tight position, and there is a geopolitical impact. However, Xiaomi's performance has shown we are a resilient company.""
Revenue rose to 85.58 billion yuan ($13.45 billion) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 70.46 billion yuan in the year earlier period and analyst expectations for 81.80 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.
Smartphone shipments rose 4.4% to 44.1 million units in the quarter, Xiaomi said in a statement.
Net income rose 39.6% to 4.47 billion yuan, also above analyst expectations. 
In an earnings call, Wang said that ensuring a steady supply of chips was still challenging in the first quarter of 2022, but expected the situation to improve by June.
The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue from selling mobile handsets, said smartphone revenue rose 18.4% to 50.5 billion yuan ($7.94 billion) in the quarter ended Dec. 31. 
Last year, Xiaomi grabbed market share in its home market China away from Huawei, which lost its smartphone momentum after the United States placed export restrictions on its suppliers. But Huawei spinoff Honor came back strong in the second half of 2021, finishing the fourth quarter with a 16% market share in China - the same as Xiaomi - according to data from Canalys.
Xiaomi's fourth-quarter smartphone shipments in China rose 10%, according to research firm Canalys. Globally, its shipments rose 5%.
Slowing handset demand in China, the company's largest market, has prompted Xiaomi to look for new opportunities.
The company is slated to invest $10 billion over the next ten years into making electric cars, which it hopes to bring to market by 2024. 
The company has also ramped up investments in chips, relasing its first device with a self-developed image signal processor. 
Wang said that investments in chips would go into areas ""directly related to user experience,"" such as fast charging.
Xiaomi has also expanded its brick-and-mortar retail footprint, in hopes of attracting more customers.

Xiaomi reported a 33.5% rise in 2021 revenue, which hit 328.3 billion yuan ($51.59 billion), versus an average analyst estimate of 325.862 billion yuan.

Sunak is likely to announce a “relatively modest” increase in defense spending, in line with inflation, after security became a priority for British voters following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, analysts Charles Armitage and Samuel Burgess wrote in a note Tuesday.
“The public desire for the government to take some sort of action will register very clearly,” the analysts said. “With the Labour Party also calling for a rise in defense spending, the government is unlikely to want to look weak on this issue.”
However, with the Chancellor attempting to manage an escalating cost-of-living crisis, significant changes will likely not be announced until the Autumn budget, Citi said. “Sunak may feel that, irrespective of the political capital defense increases may generate for the government, it will soon be eroded if inflation gets out of control.”
Among companies, QinetiQ Group Plc and BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Plc would likely be the biggest beneficiaries of a U.K. defense spending uplift, while Italy’s Leonardo SpA (LON:0ONG) and France’s  Thales  (PA:TCFP) also have exposure, Citi said. Defense shares have outperformed the broader market this year, with the MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gaining 0.7% versus a more than 6% decline for the Stoxx Europe 600.

(Reuters) -  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) on Tuesday launched a new debit card that would allow spare change investing as it looks to expand beyond trading and into more consumer finance verticals, heating up competition with fintech giants Chime and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).
With the new cash card, users could choose to round up their change to the nearest dollar and invest it in assets of their choice, Robinhood said. 
The company, known as a pioneer of commission-free trading, would also reward users of this feature with a weekly bonus, it said. The card is being offered by Robinhood Money, a new subsidiary of the online brokerage.
Other consumer finance apps like Chime and Acorns Grow Inc also allow spare change investing, a feature that lets users invest small amounts of money and is particularly appealing to younger consumers.
""The younger generation is debit card-primary, so that is a primary focus,"" said Robinhood's Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada, adding that the company was trying to capitalize on the consumer shift towards debit cards and digital spending.
The cash card will let customers keep separate accounts for investing and spending, Robinhood said. It will replace the company's existing cash management product, where investing and spending cash were all in their brokerage account. 

The Menlo Park, California-based company will also give customers the option to receive paychecks up to two days in advance, via direct deposit, a feature also offered by digital payments giant PayPal Holdings Ltd.

UBS analyst Brian Meredith) has reflected positively on what the Alleghany deal will bring to Berkshire.
We view the transaction as a positive for Berkshire as it is a good use of excess cash, accretive to earnings, around $14bb of insurance ""float"" for the company, and adds a high quality specialty insurer (25% of Y's net premiums written) and reinsurer (75% of net premiums written) to BRK's Re/Insurance business. Further, Berkshire's quota share with Transatlantic (Alleghany's reinsurance company) already gave Berkshire good insight in to the business, and increases BRK's broker market distribution (General Re is largely direct distribution). We continue to like the pricing, growth and margin improvement fundamentals in the E&S and Specialty lines space, Meredith (NYSE:MDP) said in a client note.
The analyst adds that the acquisition is an example of good use of excess capital with BRK reporting $144 billion of cash holdings as of Q4 2021. The analyst doesnt believe that Berkshires share repurchase activity will slow down as a result of this deal.
We also view the purchase price as attractive for BRK. While other reinsurers are trading at around 1.1x book value, specialty commercial insurers trade at more than 2.0x book value, the analyst concluded.

Both Cuscaden Peak and Keppel Corp are linked to state investor Temasek, and the deal had sparked a rare bidding war between the two groups, with the former offering S$2.40 per share, or S$3.9 billion ($2.87 billion), and the latter offering S$2.351 per share or S$3.74 billion for SPH's real estate business.

Canadian carriers are seeing a bounce in spring travel as COVID-19 shows signs of ebbing, but surging oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis are casting a shadow ahead of the busy summer vacation season. 
Canada's largest carrier said the extra-long-range version of A321neo that will replace the company's older aircraft is expected to be more fuel efficient. The new version will have a range of about 8,700 kilometers (5405.93 miles) and can fly up to 11 hours. 
The Canadian carrier said it would lease 15 aircraft from Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp and five from Dublin-based AerCap Holdings. 
Six aircraft would be acquired from Airbus S.A.S. under an agreement that includes purchase rights to buy an additional 14 planes between 2027 and 2030.
The deliveries would begin in the first quarter of 2024 with the final aircraft to arrive in the first quarter of 2027, Air Canada said. The carrier is in the process of selecting an engine manufacturer for the extra-large version of A321neo.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to supply chain problems for global automakers -- which were already struggling with semiconductor shortages that have cut production -- with a break in deliveries of wire harnesses from the war-torn country. 
While Skoda, the Czech Republic's biggest exporter, said it expects the supply of semiconductors to improve in the second half of 2022, it said the war in Ukraine and supply bottlenecks will put a significant burden on its operating business.
Skoda's 2021 deliveries fell 12.6% year-on-year and earlier this month it stopped production of the ENYAQ because of harness shortages, saying that two other models were at risk because of the lack of availability of the component.
""Our partner...in Ukraine decided to restart production of wire harnesses this week, with full service and full security for workers there,"" Karsten Schnake, Skoda's board member for purchasing, said during its online 2021 earnings presentation.
Wire harnesses form a key part of a car's electrical system, which group and guide cables inside the vehicle.
""We decided to double the production in case something is going wrong, and this production will be ramped up in an alternative factory,"" Schnake said, adding that work there would start in three or four weeks. 
""Hopefully we can restart production of ENYAQ one or two weeks later when we have wire harnesses,"" Schnake said.
Skoda delivered 878,200 cars worldwide in 2021, the first time that this had fallen below the 1 million mark since 2013.
Nevertheless, the VW group brand's sales revenue rose 3.9% to 17.7 billion euros ($19.5 billion) in 2021 and operating profit rose 43.2% to 1.1 billion euros as it took cost measures.
Skoda did not give a financial or production outlook, saying there were still considerable uncertainties as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and the impact on its Russian operations.

Skoda, like VW, has suspended production and other business activities in Russia, which was its second-largest market last year, with 90,400 vehicles delivered.

We think ADI looks particularly interesting given the upcoming analyst day at which we expect the company to set higher growth targets with expectations for better synergy from the recently closed Maxim acquisition, as well as resilience during a downturn due to their hybrid manufacturing model, which the company believes will result in 70% trough GMs, Caso wrote.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) faces deepening losses and closer regulatory scrutiny following the crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet on Monday with 132 people on board.
Rescuers on Tuesday scoured heavily forested slopes for survivors and data recorders from flight MU5735, which crashed a day earlier in the mountains of the southern region of Guangxi.
The plane crash, China's first in 12 years, comes as its airline sector is struggling to find its footing amid the coronavirus pandemic, with air passenger traffic far below 2019 levels due to repeated outbreaks and a steep fall in international travel due to China's strict quarantine rules.
China Eastern has been among the biggest casualties: The state carrier forecast in January a 2021 loss of 11-13.5 billion yuan ($1.7-$2.1 billion), after a 11.8 billion yuan loss in 2020.
Its losses are set to deepen after the group, including two subsidiaries, grounded its fleet of 737-800s following Monday's crash. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.
The airline cancelled about 89% of its flights on Tuesday, according to Chinese aviation data provider Flight Master. 
""My guess is that in the short term this is going to cause some issues for China Eastern as their maintenance records are reviewed, and there will likely be a short term pullback from Chinese consumers,"" said Ben Cavender, managing director at China Market Research Group in Shanghai.
Cheng Wang, associate equity analyst at Morningstar, said one of the big risks for China Eastern was if the investigation implies maintenance or other process shortfalls.
""We think most of the impact will be in the near term. The indemnity alone will not have a material impact on our fair value estimates. The potential regulatory actions including fines, additional security requirements, or even grounding of aircraft could make a bigger difference.""
""This crash might also have mid- to long-term implications for China Eastern as the airline could be in an unfavorable position when applying for routes and slots over the next few years if it is found to be at fault.""
China Eastern, which said on Monday it was cooperating with the investigation into the crash, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Its onshore-listed shares slumped more than 6.5% on Tuesday, while those trading in Hong Kong fell nearly 6%.
FEAR OF FLYING
The tragedy has shocked a country which has one of the best airline safety records in the world and whose aviation industry was over the past decade, prior to COVID, one of the world's fastest growing markets by passenger traffic.
Several social media users posted about how it had stoked their fears of flying and some wrote about changing their travel plans, especially after photos of the plane's wreckage and videos apparently showing its descent were shared widely online. 
One Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) user, PLILY-L, said she had planned to travel on a later flight on the same route taken by flight MU5735 from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, to the port city of Guangzhou before she heard about the incident.
""I was really scared, I immediately cancelled my flight ticket and switched to taking the high-speed rail,"" she wrote. 
Local media reported long queues at the counter of China Eastern at Guangzhou Baiyun airport, saying some travellers were seeking ticket refunds after the incident.
Across the industry, around 78.4% of all flights scheduled for Tuesday were cancelled, according to Flight Master, which attributed that to COVID-19, as China deals with its largest outbreak in two years. 
Some of the fears expressed online about flying were directed towards Boeing, whose brand had already been affected in China by two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft more than three years ago.
Boeing declined to comment and referred Reuters to the statement it released on Monday, when it said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators about the crash.
Elaine Shen, a Shanghai-based insurance professional who describes herself as a big fan of China Eastern, said she would stick with the airline but would now only fly on planes made by Boeing's rival Airbus.

Rising input costs have also contributed to lower estimates and slashed price targets on General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
While we continue to expect auto volumes to improve in 2H22 and further in 2023, we believe there is a wide range of potential outcomes stemming from the war in Ukraine and its impact on the supply chain. We continue to believe that stocks of companies that can navigate the current operating environment and capitalize on key growth opportunities like EVs, autonomy, and datacenter will outperform, Delaney said in a client note.
A new price target on Ford is $20.00 per share, down from the prior $22.00. Similarly, the analyst cut GM PT to $65.00 per share from the prior $72.00.
We reduce our EPS estimates for F and GM in 2022 (Ford by 9% and GM by 2%, with GM's exit from Europe reducing the impact vs. Ford), but we assume that higher costs and a slightly more difficult supply dynamic is mostly offset by better pricing given low vehicle inventory (both companies have done well this cycle to mitigate cost pressures with pricing).
On the other hand, the analyst raised EPS estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to reflect raised EV prices and a slightly higher volume, with the latter a result of the companys ability to navigate the supply chain, recent government approval for the new Berlin factory, and potentially higher demand for EVs following the rise in oil prices.

A security breach at Okta could result in significant consequences given that the company is used by thousands of businesses, universities, and government agencies that rely on Oktas authentication solutions.
The company has more than 15,000 customers worldwide, including numerous well-known companies such as Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), T-Mobile, the FCC, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO), and others.

However, Okta spokesman Chris Hollis said the company is yet to find evidence of the alleged breach.
In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's troubled Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is going into Thursday's critical shareholder vote on its plan to spin-off its devices business with very long odds.
Its top three shareholders - Effissimo Capital Management, 3D Investment Partners and Farallon Capital Management - all activist shareholders with which Toshiba management has had a contentious history - oppose the plan as do proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.
Also on the table is a proposal from Singapore-based 3D calling for management to solicit buyout offers from private equity - a motion that has the support of Effissimo, Farallon as well as Glass Lewis but, perhaps significantly, not ISS.
Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass.
Whatever the outcome, Thursday's vote represents another major battle in a four-year scandal-filled war being waged between the 146-year-old conglomerate and activist shareholders over the direction of the company. 
Toshiba management argues a spin-off is the best way to maximise shareholder value. Sources familiar with the matter have also said Toshiba hopes the plan would lift its share price to the point where activist shareholders would be enticed to leave.
Toshiba has rejected calls to seek a private equity buyout, arguing that potential offers suggested so far were insufficiently compelling and would raise concerns about the impact on its business and staff retention.
But opposition to Toshiba's plans was widespread as well as vocal, and at present, activist shareholders appear to have a lot of momentum on their side.
Together, Effissimo, 3D and Farallon own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.
Prominent institutional investors which have already disclosed they have voted against the spin-off include Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which owns 1.22%, the California Public Employees' Retirement System with 0.43% and the State Board of Administration of Florida with a 0.22% stake.
Large investors that have yet to reveal their votes include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) which owns more than 5%, Elliott Management which, according to sources, has nearly 5% and Vanguard which has 2.6% according to Refinitiv data.
None of Japan's major domestic asset managers have revealed their voting plans.
UNEVEN SUPPORT FOR 3D PROPOSAL
If the spin-off proposal fails, hedge fund investors are likely to emerge emboldened, gaining momentum in their push for a buyout. But even if management wins, some shareholders plan to fight on regardless, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Toshiba said it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.
""Large shareholders will stay unless share prices go up,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
""A private equity solution would be best for shareholders hoping for a quick exit with solid returns, but may not necessarily be best for Toshiba,"" he added.
Support for 3D's proposal is, however, somewhat less clear-cut than opposition to Toshiba's spin-off plan.
In addition to ISS advising against the proposal, CalPERS has voted against it. 
But Norway's sovereign wealth fund has voted in favour as has Toshiba external director Raymond Zage, a Farallon adviser who says he is a top 100 shareholder and has broken ranks with the public stance of the board.
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. 
Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

438,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost 19 years after its founding, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has a car factory network that spans the globe.
The leading electric-vehicle maker officially opens its assembly plant outside Berlin on Tuesday, Tesla’s first carmaking plant in Europe. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are both set to attend the official start of production at the 5 billion-euro ($5.5 billion) facility.
The factory -- first announced more than two years ago -- will boost Tesla’s capacity to make Model Y sport utility vehicles as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drives up fuel costs and adds momentum to already fast-growing EV demand. The question for Musk, 50, is how quickly the company can ramp up output in the midst of industrywide supply chain challenges, including shortages of semiconductors and raw materials for batteries.
“The start of production is nice, but volume production is the hard part,” Musk said during a visit to the plant construction site in October. He said then that Tesla would target making 5,000 to 10,000 vehicles a week by the end of this year.
Tesla’s facility in Gruenheide is essential to Musk’s objectives to boost global production and capture more of Europe’s expanding EV market. He tweeted last week that he was working on a new “master plan” for the carmaker and wrote Monday that “scaling to extreme size” would be among the main subjects.
The factory opening is the culmination of a surprise announcement Musk made in November 2019 while accepting a car award at a glitzy event in Berlin, with the heads of BMW AG, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Audi in the audience. Vehicles will now roll off the production line in Germany’s automotive heartland, where Tesla now employs more than 3,000 workers.
Although Tesla moved quickly to construct the facility, it was beset by months-long permitting delays that at times exasperated the world’s richest person.
Concerns at the site centered around its environmental impact, with activists opposing tree-clearing and the effects the facility would have on wildlife and water supply. The latter issue could linger and factor into Musk’s expansion plans, with the local water authority warning last week that further development won’t be possible without additional extraction permits.

The deliveries mark the launch of the companys first European production hub and the first vehicles handed over from the Gigafactory in nearly nine months.
The Berlin-Brandenburg factory, located in GrÃ¼nheide near Berlin, was originally scheduled to open on July 1, 2021 but permitting issues and protests by local environmentalists postponed its grand opening.

442,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 07:21AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Alibaba raised its share buyback programme to $25 billion on Tuesday, the largest ever repurchase plan by the e-commerce giant, to prop up its battered shares as it fights off regulatory scrutiny and concerns about slowing growth.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares, which have more than halved in the past year, surged on the news and closed up 11%. Its U.S. listed stock rose 9% in premarket trading. 
The plan comes amid a tech stock rally in the past few days after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that Beijing will roll out more measures to boost the economy as well as favourable policy steps for capital markets.
This is the second time Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has expanded its buyback programme in a year. It had hiked the programme from $10 billion to $15 billion last August. 
""The upsized share buyback underscores our confidence in Alibaba's long-term, sustainable growth potential and value creation,"" Deputy Chief Financial Officer Toby Xu said. 
""Alibaba's stock price does not fairly reflect the company's value given our robust financial health and expansion plans."" 
Alibaba's buyback decision makes sense given how Beijing's measures against monopolistic behaviour and the ""disorderly expansion of capital"" will limit its opportunities for new investments, said Rukim Kuang, founder of Beijing-based Lens Company Research.
""Internet giants will start to re-focus on their main business in the future. As a result, it's not necessary for companies like Alibaba to keep such large amounts of cash on their books,"" he added.
Alibaba said it had $75 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short term investments as of end-December.
The company has been under pressure since late 2020 when its billionaire founder, Jack Ma, publicly criticised China's regulatory system. 
Authorities subsequently halted the planned blockbuster IPO of its financial arm Ant Group and slapped Alibaba with a record $2.8 billion fine for anti-competitive behaviour, triggering a long slide in its shares.
Growing competition from rivals, slowing consumption, and a maturing e-commerce market have also hit its performance.
In its last earnings release, Alibaba posted a 10% year-on-year revenue growth, its slowest quarter since going public in 2014 and the first time growth fell below 20%.
The company is currently preparing to layoff tens of thousands of staffers, Reuters reported in March.
Alibaba said it had re-purchased about $9.2 billion of its U.S.-listed shares as of March 18 under its previously announced programme, which was slated to last until the end of this year.

The current $25 billion programme will be effective for a two-year period through March 2024.

No bodies or survivors have been found yet, according to the Chinese state media.
The aircraft was flying at an altitude of 29,100 feet before it started diving sharply, falling over 25,000 feet in just two minutes. The aircraft involved in the accident was flying in China since June 2015.
The crash was unprecedented, said independent aviation analyst Alex Macheras, citing the aircrafts exceptional safety record.
Air travel is the safest form of transport. But when we do suffer incidents or accidents, we dont see anything like what we have seen in China over the last 24 hours, Macheras said.
This nosedive was simply unprecedented, especially from cruising altitude. Were talking about the safest phase of the flight. Thats why those answers are going to be needed as soon as possible to determine, he added.
Heres what top Boeing analysts have to say about yesterdays events.
Morgan Stanleys Kristine Liwag (Overweight, $288): ""The three things that provided investors some comfort regarding Boeings stock are 1) the 737 NG is one of the safest aircraft in service. The 737 NG is one of the workhorses of the global aircraft fleet. There have been ~6,765 deliveries of the aircraft over its lifetime, 2) the crash did not involve the beleaguered MAX (the 737 NG does not have the MCAS software of the MAX), and 3) there are currently no regulatory groundings of the aircraft. Although the stock may be muted in the short-term, we continue to like the setup in the medium to long-term given the information we know today.""
UBS Myles Walton (Buy, $290): ""There is no reason to assume a linkage in cause between prior MAX crashes and the current NG crash but given the opacity of the MAX return to service in China there will be at least a perception of incremental delay for the MAX return to commercial schedules. As of this morning, China Eastern has chosen to ground the remainder of its 100+ 737-800 aircraft pending the crash investigation (~20% of China Eastern's fleet of all aircraft and about 2% of the world's ~6,800 737NG aircraft) but we would not expect others to follow.""
Cowens Cai von Rumohr (Outperform, $230): ""Under normal circumstances, authorities would not ground all 737's after a crash unless there were reason to suspect a common problem. Given BA's problems with the 737 MAX, there is some chance that consumers may not want to fly on a 737 until the cause of the China Eastern crash is determined not to be a design or manufacturing issue.""
Boeing stock price closed 3.59% in the red yesterday.

The bank is now expecting the Fed to move in a more aggressive manner following Chair Powells speech yesterday.
There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability, Powell said yesterday. 
""We'll be looking at the data as they come in. We'll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation...if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we'll do so, he added.
For Hatzius, the fact that Powell moved from steadily in January to expeditiously today shows that the Fed is preparing to deliver a 50bp rate hike in May. The market-implied pricing suggests around a 70% chance of a 50bp rate hike in May.
We now forecast 50bp hikes at both the May and June meetings, followed by 25bp hikes at the four remaining meetings in the back half of 2022 and three quarterly hikes in 2023Q1-Q3. We have left our forecast of the terminal rate unchanged at 3-3.25%. We continue to expect the FOMC to announce the start of balance sheet reduction at the May meeting, but after todays comments we do not think this is necessarily an obstacle to also delivering a 50bp hike in May, Hatzius explained.
The economist sees the conflict in Ukraine as a downside risk to his new forecast, although neither looks like an obstacle at this point.
UBS economist Jonathan Pingle is still calling for a 25bp rate increase at the May meeting.
We feel pretty comfortable after hearing the totality of Bostic and Powell today, and with so little news since the SEP last week, that the median participant's base case is still a 25 bp rate increase at the May meeting, and a decision to initiate QT. However, this depends on the data, including the employment report and upcoming CPI. Plus, market pricing is data too. If Treasury bond markets price in the vast majority of a 50 bp rate increase with little negative spillover to other markets, we believe that would factor importantly into the Committee's decision over whether to raise rates by 25 or 50 at the May meeting, Pingle commented in his report.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China Ltd, known as Chalco, said on Tuesday its net income surged 564.6% in 2021 to log its best performance in 14 years, thanks to rising alumina and aluminium prices and higher production.
Average global alumina prices rose 22% last year, Chalco said, while Shanghai aluminium futures jumped more than 30% and LME three-month aluminium was up 42%.
That helped the Chinese aluminium giant earn net profit of 5.08 billion yuan ($798.65 million) last year, it said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the highest since 2007, while revenue rose 45% year-on-year to 269.7 billion yuan. 
The world's top producer of aluminium raw material alumina said its output of the feedstock rose 11.7% year-on-year in 2021 to 16.23 million tonnes. 
Its aluminium production rose 4.6% to 3.86 million tonnes, gaining for the first time in three years. 
That sent aluminium output at parent company Chinalco - which also controls Yunnan Aluminium - to around 6.16 million tonnes from 6.1 million tonnes in 2020. 
China's nonferrous industry had weathered headwinds from the country's efforts to cut carbon emissions, with aluminium makers suffering a power crunch and forced to cut production. 
Yunnan Aluminium said on Monday that the power restrictions had led the company to fail to meet its annual aluminium production targets, with output declining 4.4% to 2.3 million tonnes.
Chalco logged a net loss of 227.9 million yuan in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with net income of 2.2 billion yuan in the third quarter. 
The company said it had managed to ensure supply and adjust production to minimize impact from the power curbs and from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A jump in alumina prices since the second half of 2021, as well as higher aluminium prices due to global tight supply, had shored up the company's performance, it said. 

In a separate filing on the Shanghai bourse, Chalco said it aims to issue debt financing tools worth up to 50 billion yuan in 2022, and to invest two billion yuan to set up an electrode material unit.

Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will attend the opening of one of the largest German car plants in recent history. The launch comes as Musk releases the third part of Teslas Master Plan, which will see the carmaker scale to extreme size. 
Tesla plans to hire 12,000 employees at its new plant, which will make it the largest employer in the German state of Brandenburg. The Berlin Gigafactory will have a capacity to produce 500,000 EVs annually at full capacity as well as produce 50-gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, more than any other electric car plant in Germany. 
Reaching full capacity at the new plant will take more than two years, said Elon Musk. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates that the Berlin Gigafactory could produce roughly 54,000 vehicles in 2022, which will then increase to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees the Berlin Gigafactory launch as a major strategic step forward.
We view the opening of Giga Berlin as one of the biggest strategic endeavors for Tesla over the last decade and should further vault its market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path. With German authorities finally giving approval to officially begin production in Giga Berlin, this removes a major overhang on the stock over the past few months, Ives said in a client note.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Flaring by the energy sector in Mexico hit record levels last year while the number of sites where gas is burnt off also rose despite government pledges to reduce such activity, research by a leading team of scientists showed.
The practice releases carbon dioxide, black carbon and other pollutants as well as methane, a potent greenhouse gas scientists have linked to global warming. It also wastes usable resources associated with many oil deposits.
Mexico flared 6.5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of gas in 2021, up from 5.8 bcm a year earlier, said Tamara Sparks, a researcher at the Earth Observation Group of the Colorado School of Mines, who analyzed NASA satellite images of flare sites for Reuters.
""Flaring peaked in early 2021 but remained high enough throughout the year to beat 2020, which was already a record high,"" Sparks said.
The data from the Earth Observation Group also showed a rise in the number of individual flare sites across Mexico last year to 181 from 170 in 2020, Sparks said. Records in their current form began in 2012.
The numbers have not previously been reported.
Increased flaring emits millions of additional tons of greenhouse gases, the researchers at the Earth Observation Group estimated. 
But flaring is cheaper in the short term than investing in expensive infrastructure to capture, process and transport it for other uses.
Officials at the state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and the Energy Ministry have said current budget priorities are focused on exploration and raising oil production, as well as two new refineries. 
Neither Pemex nor the energy ministry responded to a request for comment for this story.
Pemex, the world's most indebted state oil company, has been under pressure to meet ambitious oil production targets under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an energy nationalist, with little or no private investment 
When Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018, Mexico had flared 3.9 bcm that year, the data showed. Since then, the practice has soared even as oil production in Mexico has fallen.
The 2021 data suggests that in spite of pledges to reduce flaring, and greenhouse gas emissions, Mexico remains behind in a global push to transition to cleaner energy. 
Researchers and scientists around the world, including at the World Bank, which leads a global push to end routine flaring by 2030, have warned the practice contributes to climate change and environmental pollution.
Pemex stated in recent quarterly filings that it is flaring too much. Infrastructure to deal with gas associated with oil production is inefficient, outdated or nonexistent, it has said.
Lopez Obrador has argued it will take time to turn Pemex around and accused his predecessors of decades of mismanagement and plundering.

Emily Medina, a fellow at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said Pemex has a social and environmental obligation to reduce flaring, and that it would also make economic sense.
""Gas is a valuable commodity particularly under the current high price environment,"" Medina said. ""It could help strengthen Mexico's energy security.""

European equities have been weighed over the last month by expectations the Ukraine war, and the associated spike in energy prices, would lead to slower growth in the region.
However, while the conflict will dent Eurozone growth, the block is still set to expand, even if the conflict escalates, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday.
""So, we can so far dismiss the possibility of stagflation because even in the weakest scenario we are looking at growth of around 2% in 2022,"" he told a conference, referring to a phenomenon of high inflation coupled with stagnating growth.
Meanwhile, Russian troops have continued their bombardment of several cities in Ukraine, with the southern port of Mariupol having become a focal point while attacks were also reported to have intensified on the second city of Kharkiv.
Elsewhere, investors are also digesting Monday’s hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the wake of last week’s interest rate hike of 25 basis points, the likely start of a sustained tightening cycle.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian food-delivery giant Zomato Ltd is facing a backlash on social media for its plans to roll out a 10-minute food service that critics say raises road-safety risks for delivery riders.
CEO Deepinder Goyal said in a post late on Monday the service ""Zomato Instant"" would rely on a densely located network of so-called food ""finishing stations"", which will house bestseller items from restaurants and use a sophisticated demand prediction algorithm.
""Nobody in the world has so far delivered hot and fresh food in under 10 minutes at scale,"" Goyal wrote on LinkedIn and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We were eager to be the first.""
Within hours, Zomato's announcement sparked a flurry of responses. A lawmaker questioned the business model while executives raised concerns about rider safety on Indian roads.
Zomato, which counts China's Ant Group as an investor, did not respond to requests for comment.
Many on social media urged a rethink, saying food can wait as even ambulances in India take longer to reach patients. Some on LinkedIn questioned the need for such a model.
""I don't want to eat food that someone has brought to me while keeping his life at risk,"" wrote Gunjan Rastogi, a researcher at India's RSB Insights & Analytics. 
Karti P. Chidambaram, an Indian lawmaker, tweeted: ""This is absurd! It's going to put undue pressure on the delivery personnel.""
The Zomato CEO's Monday announcement started by saying: ""We will start with a clarification ... we do not put any pressure on delivery partners.""
After it failed to convince many, Goyal issued another tweet on Tuesday stressing that delivery will be ""safe"" for riders who will face no penalties, urging people to understand the model ""before the outrage"".
""Quick commerce"" grocery startups in India have been a rage with SoftBank-backed Blinkit and rival Zepto expanding rapidly. Reuters reported in January delivery bikers said they faced pressure to meet deadlines, which often led to speeding, for fear of being rebuked by store managers.
Critics say risks are too high on Indian roads. Even in cities, most roads are riddled with potholes and motorists violate basic rules. The World Bank says India has a death every four minutes on its roads and crashes kill around 150,000 people each year.

Nevertheless, many customers have been hooked to quick commerce grocery services to meet their instant shopping needs.
""I would be happy to get my food in 10 minutes,"" said one LinkedIn user, Sonu Sekharan.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was flat after posting its biggest weekly percentage gain since November 2020 on Friday.
Investors were closely tracking the war in Ukraine, with European Union governments mulling an oil embargo on Russia as they gather this week with U.S. President Joe Biden for a series of summits aimed at hardening their stance against Moscow. 
The news sparked a rally in oil prices. Brent crude futures rose more than $3 to trade above $111 a barrel, lifting the European oil & gas sector by 3.0%. [O/R]
""European crude embargo is expected to be put on the table once more, with the possibility that more than a million barrels of Russian oil a day will be snubbed,"" said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).

Meanwhile, France's blue-chip index and Germany's DAX fell 0.6% each. 
Adding to investor concerns, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to bring too-high inflation to heel, adding that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed to do so.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned earlier in the day to expect the Fed and ECB to move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine has vastly different effects on their economies.
""For the ECB to say you could expect some policy divergence seems a bit strange at this moment unless there's going to be some future policy announcement from the ECB that they're going to take more notice of the growth deteriorating prospects caused by the fighting in Ukraine,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.

""By continuing to operate the passenger car tyre factory in Russia we want to make sure that the factory is operated and controlled by Nokian Tyres also in the future,"" it said.
The company also said this would also help ensure its products were not used for military purposes.
Before the Ukraine war, Nokian produced about 80% of the 20 million tyres it makes a year in Russia. It makes passenger car tyres in Russia, while tyres for heavier vehicles are made in Finland or elsewhere.
Shares in Nokian fell as much as 13% on Monday, after Helsingin Sanomat daily and other Finnish media reported that the company had seemed to tell analysts in a call last week that it would seek to win market share from rivals that are exiting Russia, such as  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Continental and Bridgestone, or those curtailing activities there, such as Pirelli.
Nokian denied this on Tuesday. ""On Sunday Nokian Tyres was in the spotlight in the media regarding an analyst call,"" it said, saying it was now making a ""correction to the media"".
Nokian Chief Executive Jukka Moisio told Helsingin Sanomat in an interview published on Monday that the company did not want its Russian factory to end up ""in wrong hands"" to avoid its Russian factories being used to make tyres for the military.
""In our opinion it is better that the factory is in our control than in someone else's,"" Moisio told the paper.
Russia's ruling party said this month a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country.

Nokian said it would seek to boost capacity more swiftly at its factories in Finland and in the United States and would look for additional capacity elsewhere.
It said all tyres sold in the Nordic countries in future would be made in Finland and tyres sold in North America would be made in the United States or Finland. It added that it aimed to make its manufacturing more geographically diversified.

A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) survey shows a record high 86% of its clients planned to raise equity exposure. It is unclear if those plans will have come unstuck after the latest spurt in oil and commodity, and galloping inflation expectations. 
The bank itself is warning central banks face a stark choice --to ""live with energy-driven inflation or kill off economic growth"".
The rise in five-year Treasury ""breakevens"" to 3.5% is alarming, coming as it does on the heels of the Federal Reserve's interest rate liftoff and money markets pricing nearly 200 basis points of increases this year alone.
So breakevens, essentially bond markets' view of where inflation may be in five years time, have responded to policy tightening signals by moving even higher. While five-year inflation swaps, possibly a more reliable gauge, are at 2.3%, that's still above the Fed's target.
Fed boss Jerome Powell came out swinging on Monday, with a pledge of 50 bps moves if needed. Money markets also now see a roughly 3% Fed funds rate by Sept. 2023, compared to a 2.1% pricing at the start of March.
In short, chances are the Fed -- and other central banks -- will act aggressively to stamp out inflation which they now see as racing away from them. 
Emerging market central banks know that feeling of losing control of inflation -- Hungary should on Tuesday raise rates by 100 bps, while Brazil has raised rates by almost 10 percentage points this cycle and is still signalling more. 
So Wall Street futures are flat after Monday's slide while Europe is lower. Brent crude is almost at $120 a barrel. And listen out for raft of Fed and ECB speakers later in the day.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-Alibaba raises buyback programme to $25 billion
-BOJ's Kuroda renews powerful easing pledge
-ECB speakers: board member Fabio Panetta, Vice President Luis de Guindos, Chief Economist Philip Lane
-Fed speakers: New York President John Williams, Cleveland President Loretta Mester, San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly
-Philadelphia issues Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey

-Hungary to deliver 100 bps rate rise

The e-commerce giant’s shares are trading about 60% below last year’s peak even after the company deployed more than $9 billion to repurchase its stock, according to Bloomberg’s calculation. The Hangzhou-based firm unveiled a plan on Tuesday to boost its buyback plan to $25 billion -- the third increase since Beijing’s tech crackdown started in late 2020.
The stock’s lackluster performance reflects lingering worries about the impact of China’s crackdown, which has left virtually no corner of Alibaba’s core business untouched. It also mirrors the broader weakness in Chinese equities, where a fresh virus outbreak and slowing economic growth have hurt sentiment.
To be sure, Alibaba’s shares jumped as much as 9.8% to HK$108.80 in Hong Kong on Tuesday after the buyback was announced. But, that’s still a distance from the peak of HK$267 reached in February last year. The stock’s losses of $450 billion are the world’s biggest after those of its peer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Russian troops have continued their bombardment of several cities in Ukraine, with the southern port of Mariupol having become a focal point while attacks were also reported to have intensified on the second city of Kharkiv.
Diplomacy efforts have so far failed to bear fruit, while U.S. President Joe Biden issued a strong warning that Russia is considering using chemical weapons, adding that President Vladimir Putin's ""back was against the wall.""
Biden is set to arrive in Brussels on Thursday for summits with members of NATO as well as the European Union governments, to discuss their response to Russia’s aggression.
Elsewhere, investors will also digest Monday’s hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the wake of last week’s interest rate hike of 25 basis points, the likely start of a sustained tightening cycle.
Powell said the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep inflation from getting entrenched. Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at both its May and June meetings.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the world's two top central banks will move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine will have very different effects on their economies.
There is little in the way of major economic data releases due Tuesday, while in corporate news Finland's  Nokian Renkaat  (HE:TYRES) said it has decided to continue production in Russia to ensure it retains control of its local factory.

(Reuters) - Disney CEO Bob Chapek on Monday told employees the company made a mistake remaining silent on Florida legislation that would limit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, pledging to use the moment as a catalyst for change.
The comments at a virtual town hall for employees came amid a period of internal strife at Disney, as the company shifted its public statements about the legislation, which critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.
A group of employees staged a week of walk-outs to call on Disney to protect its LGBTQ+ staff, their families and communities. A day-long walkout is planned for Tuesday.
""We know the moment requires urgency - and words are not enough,"" said Chapek, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by Reuters. ""So we are taking some actions right now.""
Paul Richardson, Disney's chief human resources officer, said the company canceled a leadership meeting in Orlando, and a planned diversity event scheduled for April 13, so executives could spend their time listening employees, according to three executives who listened to his presentation at the town hall.
Chapek and his senior leaders will conduct a global listening tour and meet with employees in the United States and internationally, Disney said separately.
Disney also said it has established an LGBTQ+ task force to be led by Paul Roeder, senior vice president of communications for the Studios, and Lisa Becket, senior vice president of global marketing for Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.
The company said the task force will enlist the help of experts to develop a concrete plan to ensure Disney is ""a force for good"" for LGBTQ+ communities, especially children and family.
The company reiterated its commitment to pause political contributions in Florida, and said it would support the Human Rights Campaign's fight against a Texas Governor Greg Abbott's executive order mandating that the state's child welfare agency treat gender-affirming medical treatments as ""child abuse.""
Benjamin Siemon, a Disney TV animation writer who is gay, welcomed the apology from executives on their handling of the legislation.
""That means a lot. That was the right thing to do,"" Siemon said in a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
But he added that employees were worried that Disney would resume their political donations to politicians who supported the legislation, and asked the company to make the pause permanent.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has accused Disney of being ""woke"" because the company publicly opposed the legislation after the employee backlash.

""You're going to be called woke no matter what you do, Disney,"" animation writer Siemon said.
""You put Minnie Mouse in a pantsuit for one month in Paris and now you are being called woke. Be woke by owning it, doing the right thing for your employees.""

Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. also announced delays as both blamed the latest Covid-19 wave in China. Sunac’s dollar bonds fell, with the two firms among leading decliners on a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of developer shares. Hong Kong-listed property firms face a March 31 deadline to file annual results.
Evergrande’s shares remain suspended. The debt-saddled developer and its financial advisers will hold an investor call Tuesday. The builder told creditors in January it aimed to issue a preliminary restructuring plan in the subsequent six months.
 
Key Developments:
 
China Evergrande Said to Hold Investor Call Amid Trading Halt (10:26 a.m. HK)
China Evergrande Group and its financial advisers will hold an investor call Tuesday after it announced a likely delay in audited 2021 results and had trading halted in its shares and onshore bonds.
The call is to start at 9 p.m. Hong Kong time, according to two investors who received the invitation and asked not to be named in discussing the private information. The firm didn’t immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg. 
Sunac Bonds, Shares Slide as Audited Results to Be Delayed (10:03 a.m. HK)
Sunac dollar and onshore bonds fell sharply Tuesday morning after it said it likely won’t release audited 2021 results this month, while a yuan note halted trading.
The firm’s 6.8% yuan bond due 2023 halted trading after it fell 21.9%.
Evergrande Joins China Developers Set to Miss Earnings Deadline (9:18 a.m. HK)
Evergrande and its two Hong Kong-listed units expect to delay publishing the results by March 31 because audit work hasn’t been completed, a stock exchange filing showed Tuesday. Sunac and Shimao issued similar statements Monday night.
Evergrande said “drastic changes” in the operating environment added to audit procedures. Shimao and Sunac plan to release unaudited 2021 results on March 31. Evergrande said it will publish audited results “as soon as practicable” after audit procedures are completed. 
Chinese property firms listed in Hong Kong face a March 31 deadline to file annual results, their first audited financial statements since the industry’s liquidity crisis spread. Transparency and governance concerns have cropped up alongside worries about developers’ ability to repay debt following a record number of defaults last year. 
Evergrande Services to Probe 13.4b Yuan Pledge Guarantees (8:45 a.m. HK)
Evergrande Property Services Group has found that deposits of about 13.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) as security for third-party pledge guarantees had been enforced by the relevant banks, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. 
The company will establish an independent investigation committee and arrange for experts to be appointed to investigate the pledge guarantees, it said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with U.S. and European equity futures falling. Bonds were under pressure as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell adopted a more hawkish tone on monetary policy.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.63% by 10:17 PM ET (2:17 AM GMT), with the market reopening after a holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.66% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.18%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.64%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.15% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.81%.
U.S. Treasuries extended losses on Monday, which included one of the biggest daily climbs in short-dated yields in the past decade. The gap between five-year and 30-year U.S. yields is near its smallest since 2007. Australian and New Zealand debt were also on a downward trend.
A weaker Japanese yen could bolster exporters’ outlooks in Australia, South Korea, and Japan, where stocks were up.
Powell said the Fed is prepared to hike interest rates by a half percentage point at its next policy meeting if needed. The central bank hiked its interest rate to 0.5% as it handed down its latest policy decision during the previous week.
Movements in the bond market remained a focal point for some investors, who worried about an economic downturn.
“If Powell is reinforcing that they are going to address inflation, that they’ve made mistakes, that their expectations of inflation were incorrect, just admitting that and saying that we’re ready to do everything it takes, is definitely reassuring for equity investors,” Main Street Asset Management chief investment officer Erin Gibbs told Bloomberg.
Derivative traders on Monday priced in about seven and a half rate hikes at the remaining six Fed meetings for 2022.
“For the long term, 2.3% on the 10-year is not such a high figure at all. What spooks the market is when you have very quick moves, such as what we’re having now,” Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Inc. senior equity strategist Linda Duessel told Bloomberg.
While Fed tightening might cause disruptions throughout the yield curve, the gap between the three-month and 10-year tenors is still steeply upward sloping, supporting the view that the U.S. economy remains strong, she added.
In contrast to the Fed, expectations are growing that the People’s Bank of China will loosen monetary policy to support the economy as the country continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
China’s State Council pledged stronger monetary policy support but cautioned against flooding the market with liquidity on Monday, according to local media. The government also vowed to avoid measures that can hurt market sentiment.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the BIS innovation summit later in the day, with Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey following a day later.
Meanwhile, U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will release his “spring statement” on the budget on Wednesday. U.S. President Joe Biden will attend a NATO emergency summit in Brussels a day later."

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) -A China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in mountains in southern China on Monday after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude at about the time when it would normally start to descend ahead of its landing. 
Media said there were no signs of survivors on the domestic flight.
The airline said it deeply mourned the passengers and crew, without specifying how many people had been killed on the jet, an earlier model to the 737 MAX with a strong safety record.
Boeing said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators over the incident.
Chinese media carried brief highway video footage from a vehicle's dashcam apparently showing a jet diving to the ground behind trees at an angle of about 35 degrees off vertical. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, when it crashed. 
China Eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Such accidents typically involve multiple factors and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes, especially in light of the scarce information available.
Investigators will be scouring the wreckage and flight recorders for factors that could have caused the plane to plummet vertically and slam into the mountains at high speed.
The airline said it had sent a working group to the site. There were no foreigners on the flight, Chinese state television reported, citing China Eastern.
Relatives, friends and colleagues of passengers gathered late on Monday in a cordoned off area at the jet's destination, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. 
One man surnamed Yan said that a colleague had been on the plane, and that he had notified the 29-year-old's mother.
""When she picked up the phone, she choked up,"" said Yan, adding that he had a ""heavy heart"" when he heard the news.
China Eastern staff were making arrangements for relatives who wished to travel to the crash site on Tuesday, Yan said. Reuters was not able to independently verify Yan's identity.
The aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew on board, lost contact over the city of Wuzhou, China's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the airline said.
The flight left Kunming at 1:11 p.m. (0511 GMT), FlightRadar24 data showed, and had been due to land in Guangzhou at 3:05 p.m. (0705 GMT).
The plane, which the flight tracking service said was six years old, had been cruising at 29,100 feet at 0620 GMT. The same flight number a day earlier began a normal gradual descent from the same altitude, also at 0620 GMT, and landed safely in Guangzhou, according to Flightradar24.
The flight that crashed instead began a rapid descent to 7,425 feet before recovering briefly to 8,600 feet and then descended rapidly again, FlightRadar24 data showed. The last tracked altitude was 3,225 feet above sea level.
Media cited a rescue official as saying the plane had disintegrated and caused a fire destroying bamboo trees. The People's Daily quoted a provincial firefighting department official as saying there was no sign of life among the debris.
State media showed a piece of the plane on a scarred, earthen hillside. There was no sign of a fire or personal belongings.
DESCENT STAGE
Crashes during the cruise phase of flights are relatively rare, even though this period accounts for the majority of flight time. Crashes during the descent stage when the plane first leaves cruising altitude are even more uncommon.
Boeing said last year 13% of fatal commercial accidents globally between 2011 and 2020 occurred during the cruise phase, whereas 3% occurred on descent, none on initial approach, 28% on final approach and 26% on landing.
Online weather data showed partly cloudy conditions with good visibility in Wuzhou at the time of the crash.
President Xi Jinping called for investigators to determine the cause of the crash as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. 
Boeing said in a statement that its thoughts were with the passengers and crew. 
""Boeing is in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by (CAAC),"" the company said.
The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several overlapping crises including the coronavirus pandemic and crashes involving its 737 MAX model. Shares of the planemaker closed 3.6% lower.
China Eastern has grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes, state media reported. It has 109 of the aircraft, according to FlightRadar24.
Shares of China Eastern Airlines in Hong Kong closed down 6.5% after news of the crash emerged, while its U.S.-listed shares closed 6.3% lower. 
'GOOD RECORD'
Aviation data provider OAG said this month that state-owned China Eastern Airlines was the world's sixth-largest carrier by scheduled weekly seat capacity.
The 737-800 has a good safety record and is the predecessor to the 737 MAX model that has been grounded in China for more than three years after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The crash has again thrust the U.S. manufacturer's most sold aircraft family into the spotlight and comes as it works to emerge from the 737 MAX safety crisis and global pandemic, which decimated air travel demand and strained its finances.
​ Investigators will search for the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - to shed light on the crash.
The U.S. NTSB said it had appointed a senior air safety investigator as an accredited U.S. representative to China's probe.

Air crash investigations are typically led by the country of the accident and include participation by the plane's country of origin, so U.S. investigators would be expected to join the probe of the U.S.-made Boeing jet.
China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade, although it is less transparent than in countries like the U.S. and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents, according to Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal.

(Reuters) -Canada on Monday called for a quick negotiated end to a work stoppage at the country's second-largest railroad,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, that is set to aggravate a shortage of commodities sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Fearful of an enduring strike, which began on Sunday, industry groups are calling on the Canadian government to propose back-to-work legislation to swiftly end the dispute.
Canada, the largest country by area after Russia, depends heavily on rail to move commodities like grain and manufactured goods to port, in addition to 75% of all fertilizer in the country, according to an industry group. 
The agricultural sector is already facing shortages and higher prices due to Western economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, two major fertilizer producers.
""The world needs Canada's grain now more than ever,"" said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents companies. 
He said railways have struggled to meet half of the grain industry's weekly demands despite this year's crop being 35% smaller than average, and warned the CP strike could take the situation from ""terrible to catastrophic.""
Federal mediators are involved in the negotiations between CP and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference which represents the unionized locomotive engineers, among others. 
""We have faith in their ability to reach an agreement. Canadians expect them to do that ASAP,"" Canada's Labor minister, Seamus O'Regan, said.
The work stoppage in Canada could be felt south of the border as CP's rail network runs as far south as Kansas City, Missouri, in the United States.
Mike Steenhoek, the Iowa-based executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, said his concern is that the railroad cannot make fertilizer shipments from Canada into the United States.
""The current war in Ukraine is placing additional pressure on delivering U.S. agricultural production and inputs, particularly fertilizer,"" Steenhoek wrote in an emailed newsletter. 
""A shut down in operations at Canadian Pacific will certainly compound that stress."" 
Corey Rosenbusch, the Fertilizer Institute president and CEO, said the United States imports 86% of its potash from Canada, much of it by rail.
Fertilizer Canada's president and CEO, Karen Proud, said timing is key since ""we are 4-6 weeks away from seeding in Canada and even sooner in the U.S."" 
 Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, could weather a CP shutdown lasting a few days, since it has moved potash from its Canadian mines to U.S. stores ahead of spring planting, interim Chief Executive Ken Seitz told Reuters. But a longer shutdown would force Nutrien to consider slowing potash production, Seitz said.
The CP strike is the latest blow to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that suspended access to the country's biggest port.
An eight-day strike at Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co in 2019 cost the fertilizer industry between C$200 million and C$300 million ($159 million-$238 million), the industry group estimates.

The Mining Association of Canada said the work stoppages such as CP's bring extra operational costs to businesses and ""reduce confidence in Canada"" as a destination for investment for supply-chain reliant businesses.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Indian lenders are set to initiate debt recovery proceedings against Future Retail this week to safeguard their interests after rival Reliance unexpectedly took over some of the retailer's stores, two bankers told Reuters.
Future, hit by the pandemic, has been struggling to pay off its debt and is fighting a bitter legal battle with U.S retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That battle has successfully blocked a $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to India's largest retailer Reliance, citing violation of certain contracts. 
Future denies any wrongdoing. But Reliance Industries suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores late last month, citing non-payment of rent, after assuming many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future.
State-owned lender Bank of Baroda will be the first to take Future to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and is expected to file the paperwork this week, the two bankers said.
""We are taking this step as a measure of last resort because we want to protect ourselves in this legal fiasco,"" said one of the bankers directly involved in the matter. ""Going to DRT will ensure that Reliance can't pull another sudden move."" 
Other lenders are likely to follow suit, the second banker with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Future Retail and BoB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt and lenders have already started classifying the loans as non-performing assets (NPA) this quarter.
Lenders are also likely to subsequently file a case in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that handles corporate insolvency cases, both bankers told Reuters. Future and Amazon are fighting it out at multiple levels, including at India's Supreme Court.
Given the legal complexities in this case, approaching the DRT first is likely to help banks attach, seize and sell Future's assets promptly, instead of going after the entire company at NCLT, Ketan Mukhija, a partner at Link Legal said.

""It is a very strategic, tactical call (by the banks),"" he said.

471,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 07:25PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Weeks after Moscow forced the 11th-hour cancellation of a rocket launch for British satellite venture OneWeb from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the company said on Monday it has contracted with Elon Musk's SpaceX to send its satellites into orbit.
Terms of the deal with California-based SpaceX, a direct competitor of OneWeb in the burgeoning broadband satellite industry, were not disclosed.
Earlier this month, OneWeb called off the scheduled March 4 launch of 36 satellites from Baikonur and suspended ties with Russia's space agency Roscosmos because of last-minute demands imposed on the company by Moscow, including a guarantee that OneWeb's technology would not be used for military purposes.
The OneWeb launch scrub came amid heightened tensions between Russia and NATO governments, including Britain, over economic sanctions imposed against Moscow by the West in response to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The British government, which holds a stake in OneWeb, also said it was reviewing its participation in further projects with Russia in light of the Ukraine crisis.
The British satellite firm expects its first launch with SpaceX later this year to add to its constellation of 428 satellites already in low-Earth orbit.
""With these launch plans in place, we’re on track to finish building out our full fleet of satellites,"" OneWeb Chief Executive Officer Neil Masterson said.

OneWeb, which plans to offer universal broadband through a network that will ultimately consist of 650 satellites, was rescued from bankruptcy by the British government and Indian telecoms giant Bharti Global in 2020. Eutelsat Communications (OTC:EUTLF) and SoftBank Group Corp are among other investors in the firm.
SpaceX's Starlink, one of several ventures in the fast-growing satellite broadband business, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Project Kuiper, has put some 1,500 satellites in operation, providing internet access to regions underserved or hard to reach for other services.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Monday, with stocks extending their slide after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than previously anticipated, adding to uncertainties regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended well off session lows, they snapped four-session winning streaks on the heels of their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020.
The central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to combat inflation, Powell told the National Association for Business Economics conference, adding that bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes could be deployed if needed.
""Much of the news today was telegraphed last week in (Powell's) comments,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""The difference is there was some question regarding whether a 50 basis-point rate hike might be a course of action sooner rather than later."" 
Fed funds futures now imply a 60.7% chance of a 50 basis-point hike in key interest rates at the Fed's next meeting in May, up from 52% before the text of Powell's speech was released. 
""Some Fed governors have been vocal about front-end loading some of those hikes, putting them on the books sooner rather than later,"" Keator added. ""But I don't think the markets should anticipate a series of 50 basis-point rate hikes between now and the end of the year.""
Fighting raged on in Ukraine as efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict appeared to be making little progress.
Crude prices continued to surge as the European Union weighed joining the United States in banning Russian oil [O/R], which raised supply concerns and helped put energy shares out front.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.94 points, or 0.58%, to 34,552.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.94 points, or 0.04%, to 4,461.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.38 points, or 0.4%, to 13,838.46.
Six the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with communication services suffering the biggest percentage loss. Energy was the clear winner, gaining 3.8% on the day.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co slid 3.6% after one of its 737-800 aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crashed in southern China with no apparent survivors.
The rising geopolitical temperature helped defense stocks. Despite Boeing's decline, the S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index rose 1.5%, with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) advancing between 2.5% and 4.6%.

(Reuters) -Rhode Island's attorney general on Monday announced settlements he valued at $107 million against the drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit to resolve claims over their roles in fueling an opioid epidemic in the state.
Attorney General Peter Neronha said the settlements include $28.5 million in cash, plus the delivery to Rhode Island of anti-overdose treatments - 1 million Naloxone sprays and 67,000 bottles of Suboxone pills - over 10 years.
""While no amount of money will ever be enough to undo the harm suffered by Rhode Islanders throughout the ongoing opioid epidemic, these additional recoveries will further support public health efforts to respond to the challenges,"" Neronha said.
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drug company, called its settlement ""a critical step forward in getting life-saving treatments to the people who need them."" 
It said it was still ""actively"" negotiating a national settlement. Teva Chief Executive Kåre Schultz told Reuters last month the company will likely end up paying $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion in cash and drugs to settle all U.S. state and local government claims. 
AbbVie, which acquired Allergan in 2020, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement was reached just as Rhode Island was prepared to take Teva to trial. Jury selection began last week, and opening arguments were set to begin on Monday. 
The Rhode Island lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addiction risks of opioid pain medications.
More than 500,000 people have died due to opioid overdoses in the past two decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Rhode Island valued Teva's contributed medicines at $78.5 million. The company reached a similar $225 million settlement recently with Texas which included $75 million in contributed drugs. 
Concerns about the value of those drugs have been a sticking point in Teva's attempt to reach nationwide settlement agreement. Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer who represents opioid plaintiffs in other cases, called the use of the list price a ""smoke and mirrors"" technique that artificially inflates the settlement's value.

Vincent Greene, an attorney who represented Rhode Island in the Teva case, said the inclusion of treatment drugs will ""save lives immediately and in the years to come."" Rhode Island has reached all-cash settlements from other defendants, giving the state more flexibility to accept non-cash contributions from Teva, Greene added. 
Other defendants in the Rhode Island case settled long before the trial, including the largest U.S. drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH). Those three companies joined a nationwide $21 billion settlement.

477,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A Moscow court said on Monday that Meta was guilty of ""extremist activity"", but the ruling will not affect its WhatsApp messenger service, focusing on the U.S. firm's already-banned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram social networks.
Meta did not respond to requests for comment after Moscow's Tverskoi District Court said in a press statement that it had upheld a lawsuit filed by state prosecutors on banning the company's activities on Russian territory.
Meta's lawyer Victoria Shakina had earlier told the court that the company was not carrying out extremist activities and was against Russophobia, the Interfax news agency reported.
It was not clear whether Meta would appeal the outlawing of the activities of Facebook and Instagram in Russia ""on the grounds of realising extremist activity"", a ban TASS cited judge Olga Solopova as saying would be enforced immediately.
Late on Monday, communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it will exclude Meta from the list of foreign entities operating on the Internet in Russia, and Instagram and Facebook from the register of social networks, according to news agencies.
Roskomnadzor also said that Russian media must label Meta and its social networks as prohibited when distributing information and are forbidden to display their logos.
Russia has in the past designated groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State as ""extremist"" but later expanded this to the Jehovah's Witnesses and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.
Facebook last year had 7.5 million users in Russia and WhatsApp had 67 million, researcher Insider Intelligence estimates, while Instagram has said its ban will affect 80 million users in Russia.
UKRAINE TENSIONS
The implications of the ruling remain unclear as Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia and the court said WhatsApp would be unaffected by its ruling. 
""The decision does not apply to the activities of Meta's messenger WhatsApp, due to its lack of functionality for the public dissemination of information,"" the court said. 
Russia initially banned Facebook for restricting access to Russian media while Instagram was blocked earlier this month after Meta said it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages urging violence against Russian President Vladimir Putin and troops Moscow sent into Ukraine.
Russia calls the conflict a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from people it describes as dangerous nationalists. 
Meta has since narrowed its guidance to prohibit calls for the death of a head of state and said its guidance should never be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general.
But the perceived threat to its citizens angered Russian authorities and led to the criminal case against Meta.
WHATSAPP'S FATE
It was not immediately clear how the WhatsApp messaging service would be able to continue operating, since the court has put a stop to Meta's commercial activities. 
Analysis of mobile internet traffic on Monday showed that Telegram, popular in Russia for a long time, has overtaken WhatsApp to become the country's most used messaging tool in recent weeks.
The prosecution sought to allay fears that people who find ways around bans on Meta's services may face criminal charges.
""Individuals will not be prosecuted simply for using Meta's services,"" TASS cited the prosecutor as saying in court.
But human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov said neither the court nor the prosecutor could guarantee the safety of Facebook or Instagram users, warning that any public displays of Meta symbols - on websites, shop entrances, on business cards - could be grounds for administrative charges and up to 15 days in jail.
""Buying adverts on both social networks or trading Meta's shares may qualify as financing extremism activity - this is a criminal offence,"" he wrote on Telegram. 
WhatsApp may have been left alone due to the extent of its everyday use among Russians and by government agencies and state companies for customer support, Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department at digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, said.
Another reason is likely to be to avoid any backlash.
""The government is trying not to close everything at once, but gradually, so that people slowly get used to it,"" he told Reuters, pointing to the ""unpopular"" closure of Instagram.
""We assume that services like WhatsApp could come under blocks at any moment,"" Darbinyan added.
WAY BACK FOR META?
Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.
Access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has also been restricted and on Friday Roskomnadzor demanded that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on YouTube.
Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications who has criticised foreign firms, while championing domestic alternatives, said the Russian market could be opened to Meta again, but only on Moscow's terms. 

""These are an immediate end to blocking Russian media, a return to the policy of neutrality, and strict moderation of fakes and anti-Russian comments,"" Gorelkin said on Telegram. 
Another condition, Gorelkin said, was that Meta comply with a law requiring foreign firms with more than 500,000 daily users to open representative offices in Russia.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) must face a Silicon Valley company's claims it illegally monopolized the U.S. market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said AliveCor Inc, whose SmartRhythm app alerts users to irregular heartbeats, could try to prove that Apple violated federal antitrust law based on its alleged ""complete control"" over the market for such apps.
""AliveCor alleges that Apple made changes to the heart rate algorithm that made it effectively impossible for third parties to inform a user when to take an ECG,"" or electrocardiogram, White wrote. ""Plaintiff's allegations plausibly establish that Apple's conduct was anticompetitive.""
White also dismissed AliveCor's separate claim that Apple maintained an illegal monopoly over ECG-capable smart watches.
The Oakland, California-based judge said this was because AliveCor's KardiaBand wristband, which can record ECGs, ""complements but does not compete"" in that market.
Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adam Wolfson, a lawyer for AliveCor, declined to comment.
In its May 2021 lawsuit, privately held AliveCor accused Apple of changing the heart rate algorithm for the Apple Watch to gain an ""unfair competitive edge"" over rivals, and ""put countless AliveCor users' lives in danger.""

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, countered that it was an ""uncontroversial proposition that product improvement by itself"" did not violate the federal Sherman antitrust law.

Investing.com – Stocks eased off their lows on Monday but still closed down after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could move faster to raise interest rates and tame inflation.
Powell said the Fed could raise rates at a half-point step instead of the usual quarter of a point. Inflation is running at 40-year highs and the central bank is anxious to get it tamed so it won’t hit the economic recovery.
Oil continued to gain, however, something that has exacerbated inflation, especially since the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Reuters reported that Russia's foreign ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan to tell him that remarks by President Joe Biden about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had pushed bilateral ties to the brink of collapse.
Biden is set to travel to Europe later this week to meet with members of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss the West’s response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. EU members are reportedly mulling a ban on Russian oil imports, though the region is more dependent on the source of energy than the U.S., which has already banned it.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb) is to acquire Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in a deal worth approximately $11.6 billion, putting an end to a long lull in big deals by the conglomerate, which has $140 billion of cash waiting to be put to use.
Berkshire will pay $848.02 per share in cash for the owner of reinsurer TransRe. People will likely speculate on what else Buffett has in his deal pipeline.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could lift interest rates more quickly and in larger steps to tame inflation.
Stocks ended last week with outsized gains despite investors keeping a wary eye on the developments in Ukraine and a series of Fed speakers a few days after the central bank started its tightening cycle.
At 4:57 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, and NASDAQ Composite fell 1.1%.
Wall Street's three main indexes notched up last week their largest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020 with the Dow climbing 5.5%, the S&P adding 6.2% and the Nasdaq rising 8.2%.
This followed the Federal Reserve delivering on Wednesday its first rate hike since 2018 along with an encouraging assessment of the U.S. economy. This is widely expected to be the first of a series of hikes, with the central bank pointing to increases at its remaining six meetings this year.
Powell, speaking at the National Association of Business Economists conference, said the Fed could life rates in half-point stages, rather than the customary quarter-point move, setting traders abuzz with the notion that a more aggressive approach to inflation was in the works.
Investors will be looking for the thoughts of Fed officials -- more are also speaking today and this week -- given the concerns over stubbornly high inflation, sky-high commodity prices and few signs of an end to the conflict in eastern Europe.
A Kremlin spokesman said Monday that peace talks have not progressed enough for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to take place. This comes after Ukraine rejected a Russian demand that its forces lay down their arms and leave the besieged southern port of Mariupol. 
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, but the week as a whole will feature reports on durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, both new and pending home sales, as well as services and manufacturing PMI data.
In corporate news, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) announced earlier Monday it plans to purchase Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in an all-cash deal valued at $11.6 billion.
A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 airliner, but not one its MAX planes, operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crashed earlier, killing 132 people. Boeing shares fell 4% and helped weigh on the Dow.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is scheduled to release quarterly results after the close Monday, and the sportswear giant’s sales could suffer from the powerful cocktail of rising Covid-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues.
Oil prices jumped Monday as the EU meets to consider whether to join the United States in imposing an oil embargo on Russia as the sanctions already levied on Moscow for its invasion have yet to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the fighting.
This would be an economically tough choice, as the EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany the most dependent of the bloc's large economies.

Investing.com - Tencent Music Entertainment reported Monday mixed fourth quarter results as earnings beat but revenue fell short of the expectations as increased competition and the weaker macro environment dented growth. 
Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) was down more than 2% in after-hours trade.
The online music and audio entertainment platform reported adjusted EPS of RMB0.50, down from RMB0.80 a year earlier, as revenue fell 8.7%, to RMB7.607 billion. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of RMB 0.08 on revenue of $7.609 billion.
Online music mobile monthly active users, or MAUs, fell 1% year-over-year, driven by churn in casual users served amid increased competition. But paying online music paying users reached a record-high 76.2 million, benefitting from expanded sales channels and paying user loyalty, the company said.  
""Amid increasing competition and changing macro environment, social entertainment services MAUs and paying users were lower year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter,"" it added.

Nearly a dozen Apple services were down for thousands of users.
The company's system status page had showed 11 outages including podcasts, music and arcade. It said Apple was investigating the issue and services may be slow or unavailable. 
According to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, more than 4,000 users reported issues with accessing Apple Music, while nearly 4,000 reported problems with iCloud.
Users also flagged issues with ""find my iPhone"", Apple store, maps and support.
Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users. 
The company was responding to affected users on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) but it was unclear what caused the outages.
Bloomberg News reported that Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers were also facing issues. The outage delayed product repairs, pickups and limited workers' access to internal websites, the report said.

According to the report, Apple told staff that the outage stemmed from domain name system, or DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server.
In a number of incidents last year, DNS issues caused widespread outages on social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram, and brought down websites of airlines and banks for several hours.

BOSTON (Reuters) -U.S. stocks declined broadly while oil prices and Treasury yields pushed higher on Monday as investors refocused on risks from conflict in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's actions on inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.94 points, or 0.58%, to 34,552.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.94 points, or 0.04%, to 4,461.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.38 points, or 0.4%, to 13,838.46.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell by 3.6% after one of its 737 jets crashed in China.
Global stock markets rallied last week in anticipation of an eventual peace deal on Ukraine. But on Monday, Ukraine defied a Russian ultimatum that its forces lay down arms in Mariupol, while the European Union considered a possible energy embargo against Russia.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.24%.
""The market is digesting the impact of tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices and continued geopolitical uncertainty against a backdrop of growth, at least in the U.S.,"" Erin Browne, a portfolio manager for multi-asset strategies at PIMCO in Newport Beach, California, said in an email. 
She added, though, that the U.S. market will continue to benefit from outflows from the rest of the world given its relative insulation from oil and geopolitical tensions.
BofA's global fund manager survey last week had a bearish bias with cash levels the highest since April 2020 and global growth expectations the lowest since the financial crisis of 2008. Long oil and commodities were the most crowded trade, and vulnerable to a pullback.
EYES ON THE FED
The U.S. central bank must move quickly to bring too-high inflation to heel, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday, adding that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed to do so.
""The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,"" Powell told a National Association for Business Economics conference. ""There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability.""
Fed policymakers last week raised interest rates for the first time in three years, and most see the short-term policy rate - pinned for two years near zero - at 1.9% by the end of this year, a pace that could be achieved with quarter-percentage-point increases at each of their next six policy meetings. 
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic also said on Monday he had penciled in a total of eight interest rate hikes for this year and the next, fewer than most of his colleagues as he worries about the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the U.S. economy. 
Following Powell's comments, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.307%, while the yield on two-year notes increased to 2.132%. It was the first time since May 2019 that the two-year note, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, topped 2% - the Fed's target rate for inflation.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rate strategists are calling for the closely watched 2-year/10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve to invert in the second quarter. ""While this doesn't guarantee a recession, the signal on growth is clearly negative,"" they wrote in a note.
The dollar also strengthened against a basket of major currencies on Monday in the wake of Powell's comments. The dollar index steadied at 98.49, off its recent peak hit earlier in March at 99.415. The euro fell about 0.3% to $1.105, after jumping 1.3% last week.

In energy markets, crude oil surged after news the EU was considering joining the United States in a Russian oil embargo, while a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities also caused jitters. [O/R]. U.S. crude rose 7.41% to $112.46 per barrel and Brent was at $116.42, up 7.87% on the day.

Investing.com --  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares gained 4.9% Monday after the close after it reported earnings that beat analyst expectations for earnings per share and revenue. 
The company announced earnings per share of 87 cents on revenue of $10.9 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 71 cents on revenue of $10.63 billion.
Nike said its revenue increase was led by NIKE Direct growth of 17%. Furthermore, the NIKE Brand Digital business increased 22%, driven by double-digit growth in North America, APLA, and EMEA. However, this was partially offset by declines in Greater China. 
Revenue for Greater China was $2.16 billion, falling just over 5% year over year.
“Our third quarter results demonstrate NIKE’s ability to navigate through volatility, while continuing to serve consumers directly and digitally, at scale,” said Matt Friend, the company's chief financial officer.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has settled with six current and former employees who had alleged the company unfairly stifled worker organizing in a case stemming from potential sales of its cloud technology to U.S. immigration authorities -- an abrupt ending to a trial that had been paused for several months.
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board had pursued the case on behalf of the workers and brought Google before an administrative law judge last year. Weeks of hearings were then stopped pending resolution of a dispute over whether the NLRB could force Google legal chief Kent Walker to testify.
Laurie Burgess, an attorney representing the workers, said they had grown emotionally exhausted from fighting Google. They had to weigh that against wanting to reveal additional ""juicy"" evidence about Project Vivian, Google's effort to quell worker activism, she said.
""We exposed enough, and it’s time for my clients to be able to move on with their lives,"" Burgess said.
The workers independently settled with Google last Wednesday, the NLRB did not object and the judge in San Francisco dismissed the case last Friday, legal filings show. The settlement was first reported on Monday by Vice.
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A parallel lawsuit in California state court also was dismissed.
The case had concerned Google's actions against workers who were among a larger group protesting the company's cloud technology relationship with U.S. immigration authorities in 2019.
Google interrogated workers and fired some of them, aiming to dissuade people from engaging in legally protected concerted activities, the government said. 
The company denied wrongdoing, arguing that the employees it fired or suspended were accessing files they should not have and had no right to dictate with whom the company does business.
Google said on Monday it was pleased everyone avoided years of legal proceedings. 

""We've always supported our employees' right to speak about working conditions, and we stand by our policies that protect the security of our systems and safeguard user, customer and employee data,"" Google said.
Worker activism across Silicon Valley has been on the rise for years. Hundreds of Google workers last year formed a small labor organization in hopes of better protecting their rights in future protests.

496,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Just in case financial markets didn’t get Jerome Powell’s hawkish message last week, they got it Monday when he made it abundantly clear that the Federal Reserve is coming hard for inflation, even if it means slowing the economy.
The reaction on Wall Street was swift. Stocks gave up gains and slid more than 1%, while Treasuries extended losses that took the two-year Treasury yield past 2.1%. But just like last Wednesday, an initial freakout turned into a more benign decline, with the S&P 500 down just 0.3% as of 2:50 p.m. in New York.
Here’s what traders and money managers were saying about the market’s relative resilience in the face of a hawkish central bank.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA:
“I think it’s pretty consistent. He’s always been sort of a data person. He is letting us know that he’s not influenced by politics. Really, the direction is from the data. Hearing him say that sentence would not have been a surprise to me. So, I’m sort of surprised that the market is surprised. The Fed has already told us that it’s going to likely raise rates by seven times this year and then a terminal rate of 2.75%. We already know that. I sort of feel as if the market’s response has more to do with digesting the gains from last week because we had four consecutive days.”
Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners:
“Powell is waking everyone up after investors got comfortable with a narrative that the Fed’s got your back. Last week, investors gravitated to a theme of a soft landing, with the Fed as the wizard behind the curtain. But this week, Powell is back saying hold on, the Fed’s main focus is jobs and inflation, and risky assets are secondary. Perhaps Powell is trying to steer investor sentiment away from a ‘buy anything’ mentality, which started to catch fire last week.”
Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index:
“Fed Chair Powell is clearly on a mission to bring down inflation this year, and is prepared to take aggressive action if deemed necessary. With robust economic growth and a strong labor market Powell has good reason to think that the economy can handle a steep path to policy normalization. The USD has barely reacted to the comments, mainly because he reiterated the message from last week. The Fed could well try and front load the rate hikes, because the longer the Ukraine war continues, the greater the uncertainty and the bigger the risk to global economic growth.”
Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments:
“He is reiterating the shift in primary policy imperatives that he laid out last week, essentially shifting from a ‘jobs at any cost’ monetary policy stance to a ‘kill inflation at any cost’ stance. I think it is as short-sighted as labeling inflation ‘transitory’ nine months ago, but that is the tack they are clearly taking, so doesn’t really matter whether anyone thinks it is right or wrong. Global economy is already slowing and supply chains are already easing, but they are hell-bent on making it clear to the market that their only job right now is to bring down current readings of CPI. If they have to reverse course and deal with a mild recession in 6-12 months, they’ll just have to do that.”
John Roque, head of technical strategy at 22V Research:
“My only comment is that I’m sure Jay Powell got tired of reading comments saying that the market was not taking him and the Fed seriously on their desire to attack inflation.”
Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners: 
“I am not alarmed at what Powell said. He is reiterating the Fed’s dependence on data to inform their moves. I think he talked about the 50 basis-point increases as an example of what they might have to do – not what they are going to do. He ran through the risks that the markets are facing and it was reasonable. Finally, although the Fed’s rates certainly drove asset prices higher in the past two years, they are not really the drivers of the increasing prices of goods and services.”

Last week the bank said it was cooperating with the country's largest lender, PKO BP (NYSE:BP), to allow refugees who have fled Ukraine for Poland to convert hryvnia. 

Many refugees are struggling to buy even basic necessities because their savings in hryvnia are non-convertible across most of Europe, meaning they have no way to exchange them at reasonable rates.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Raine Group, the U.S. bank overseeing the sale of Premier League club Chelsea, plans to narrow down the shortlist of bidders to three on Monday or Tuesday, sources told Reuters, with one consortium lead by Nick Candy increasing their offer.
Chelsea were initially put up for sale by owner Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and before sanctions were imposed on the oligarch by the British government, effectively giving it control of the club.
Raine set a deadline of 2100 GMT last Friday for bids to be put forward, with several being made public, while sources close to the deal said many more had been submitted privately.
To move things forward, Reuters has been told that Raine, in consultation with the club, will narrow down the shortlist, with the process slowed by revised bids still coming in.
One of the three bidders who made their offers public on Friday, Candy's Blue Football consortium, revised their bid on Monday, they told Reuters in a statement, after being joined by ""another large Korean financial institution.""
British property developer Candy submitted a bid of over two billion pounds ($2.63 billion) to Raine on Friday, but has since increased his offer ""significantly"", without disclosing by how much or the name of the new investor.
He had already been joined in his consortium by South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited before the new investors got on board. 
""The Blue Football Consortium has access to immediate capital with funds readily available for deployment from day one,"" Brian Gordon, partner of Squire Patton Boggs, the law firm working with the Blue Football Consortium, said. 
""The bid is sourced from credible co-venturers whose attitude towards governance is top rated.""
PREFERRED BUYERS
Over the next few weeks, a preferred buyer or buyers will be submitted to the government who must issue a special licence for any sale and who require evidence that Abramovich will not make any financial gain.
From there it will be up to the prospective buyer to pass the Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test before completing a takeover.
The test outlines factors that would prohibit an individual from becoming an owner or director of a club.
These include criminal convictions for a wide range of offences, a ban by a sporting or professional body and breaches of certain key football regulations, such as match-fixing.
Along with Candy's bid, the two other consortiums who made their offers public last week were the Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, and the pairing of former Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton and World Athletics President Sebastian Coe.
Some bids are only being made public now, with London-based global investment firm Centricus confirming on Monday that they had offered to buy Chelsea, a move driven by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie, who are said to be season-ticket holders.
British media reports have named several other bidders, including Saudi Media, headed by businessman Mohamed Alkhereiji.

Candy's bid, while not assured of being on the shortlist, said on Monday that they had held initial discussions with tech platform PrimaryBid, with a view to potentially considering a community enfranchisement model for Chelsea, should the bid be successful, focused on improving fan involvement and engagement.

In a court filing, the Justice Department asked for Google to be sanctioned for creating a ""Communicate with Care"" program that trains workers to include an attorney and a request for advice when writing about sensitive business matters. 
""Often, knowing the game, the in-house counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not respond at all,"" the department said, adding that many of the emails had to do with revenue share agreements that Google had struck with other companies.
A Google spokesperson said that the company had given the government more than 4 million documents. ""Our teams have conscientiously worked for years to respond to inquiries and litigation, and suggestions to the contrary are flatly wrong,"" the spokesperson said.

The Justice Department asked for the documents to be produced if the in-house counsel did not reply. It asked U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to hold a hearing to discuss the matter.
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit against Google in 2020, with trial expected in September 2023.

BESSEMER, Al. (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) seeking to organize a warehouse in Alabama after a bruising defeat last year have been invigorated by a resurgent labor movement, bringing energy to the campaign despite the long odds they face.
The vote by Bessemer warehouse employees concludes this month after the U.S. National Labor Relations Board found Amazon improperly interfered in the previous union election.
Given the retail giant's two-to-one margin of victory in the original contest, the workers trying to bring the first-ever union to a U.S. Amazon warehouse face a tall order.
Yet since the last vote, the American labor movement has gained momentum, motivated by the high-profile Alabama campaign, ongoing pandemic concerns and strikes.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed to implement policies to make it easier for workers to organize. Approval for unions is the highest since 1965, a Gallup poll showed last year.
Amazon employee Braxton Wright, 39, said that while he was hopeful for a win, even a near miss for the union in Bessemer would help others see that organizing is possible.
Simply by casting ballots, ""You give more people the courage to stand up and say, 'Hey, we want to form a union,'"" Wright said.
Labor activity is already escalating at Amazon facilities beyond Bessemer. Led by former Amazon worker Christian Smalls, staff at two New York warehouses have received authorization from the NLRB to hold union votes, including one this month.
That enthusiasm has spread to other union-resistant brands, including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). In the last seven months, workers from more than 140 Starbucks stores have asked for union elections.
AMAZON'S MESSAGE
The Bessemer warehouse's union backers say organizing under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) will help them counter productivity targets that are hard to meet and advocate for better working conditions at Amazon, which data shows had injury rates above average for U.S. warehouses in 2020.
For Amazon, unions threaten to alter how the online retailer manages its vast operation and drive up labor costs beyond what the company said was $4 billion in extra expenses related to a worker shortage last quarter.
With those stakes and businesses across America competing for workers, Amazon increased spending on digital ads touting its jobs, pay and benefits seven-fold through mid-February from the same period in 2021, to $2.8 million, according to marketing intelligence firm Pathmatics. The data excludes ads, if any, on video streaming services. Near the Bessemer warehouse, the company used a billboard to urge workers to vote.
""I see their ads every single day,"" said Roger Wyatt, a 34-year-old worker at the facility who is voting for the union. Amazon last year advertised to workers as well, unrelated to conduct the NLRB deemed improper.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel has said workers' safety is a top priority and that the company is investing heavily to help staff. Regarding the union contests in Alabama and New York, she said, ""We look forward to having our employees' voices heard in these elections, and our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work.""
'THERE'S A HUNGER'
Employee Eli Morrison needs no persuading. He disapproved of a union at a prior job and has already mailed in his vote against bringing one to the Bessemer warehouse.
""I love the work – I don't even feel like I work,"" he said.
Such distrust of unions is still common among workers, fanned by Amazon itself, which has warned in meetings staff were obliged to attend that labor groups could mandate strikes or shrink pay, something the RWDSU has disputed.
Wright, a miner who took a job at Amazon last year while on strike at Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC), is among the activists trying to change that. 
Showing up for work in union gear, he has been outspoken on the warehouse floor. Union supporters on the whole have been more vocal this time around, pushing back against Amazon's talking points in meetings, said worker Darryl Richardson, 52. 
Across the country, more Amazon workers are putting pressure on their employer. In New York, employees have raised money on GoFundMe and collected signatures to persuade Amazon to drop charges against organizers. Workers from several sites likewise petitioned the company after a tornado tore through an Illinois warehouse in December, killing six workers. In Bessemer, staff in the shipping dock department circulated a petition calling for better working conditions, which the RWDSU said collected more than 100 signatures.
""There's a hunger for innovative approaches,"" said Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB chair during the Obama administration. ""All this activism is going to continue for a while.""

Richardson said he senses the tide is turning for workers.
""Everybody around the world is standing up,"" he said.

BOEING 737-800
The Boeing 737-800 is part of the 737 family, the world's most-flown commercial aircraft series. It was developed in the 1960s to serve short- or medium-length routes.
The 737-800 is part of the 737 NG or Next-Generation family - with more than 7,000 delivered since 1993 - and it has a strong safety record after nearly three decades of flights. The 162- to 189-seat 737-800 was launched on Sept. 5, 1994. The NG is the predecessor to the 737 MAX.
The MAX was grounded worldwide for 20 months after two fatal crashes killed 346. It remains grounded in China.
The jet involved in the China Eastern accident, en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, was six years old, according to Flightradar24.
In the United States, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has the most 737-800s in operation with 265 followed by Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) with 205 and United Airlines with 136, according to Cirium data.
The last fatal 737-800 crash occurred in August 2020 when an Air India Express plane overshot the table-top runway and crashed while landing at Calicut International Airport in the southern state of Kerala in heavy rain, killing 21. A government report cited pilot error as the probable cause.
CHINA 
China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade but is less transparent than in countries like the United States and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents.
According to Aviation Safety Network, China's last fatal jet accident was in 2010, when 44 of 96 people on board were killed when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines crashed on approach to Yichun airport.
In 1994, a China Northwest Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 crashed en route from Xian to Guangzhou, killing all 160 on board in China's worst-ever air disaster, according to Aviation Safety Network.
Monday's disaster was the first fatal crash for China Eastern since 2004, when a plane crashed shortly after it took off from an airport in north China, killing 55, according to ASN.
Shanghai-based China Eastern was created in 1988 and is one of the largest three airlines in China, with one of the youngest fleet of planes.
It is part of the SkyTeam Alliance and U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) holds a 2% stake. China Eastern has ranked in recent years among the ten largest carriers in total passengers carried. Delta has ""a strategic joint marketing and commercial cooperation arrangement covering traffic flows between China and the U.S."" 

Passenger traffic between China and the United States has declined dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic.

508,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 01:22PM ET</span>",,,,,"(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Monday vehicle production and orders in Europe have been hit by the global semiconductor shortage as well as the conflict in Ukraine.
The U.S. automaker said it will idle its German plants in Saarlouis and Cologne, mostly due to the global chip shortage. That also led it to stop taking new orders for the S-Max and Galaxy vehicles built in Valencia, Spain. Ford said it has orders for both products that take it beyond September and that existing orders will be fulfilled.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine also has caused parts shortages at a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plant in Poland that builds Ford's Tourneo Connect vehicle, leading to a temporary halt of production, Ford said.

""We continue to monitor the situation on a daily basis in conjunction with our partners at VW and will have more to say on this at a later date,"" Ford said in a statement. 
The Ukraine conflict has also led to supply issues that have forced Ford to offer consumers the Focus car with a smaller, 8-inch dashboard screen, instead of the 13.2-inch SYNC4 screen that was part of the updated vehicle's introduction, the company said, without providing details. Supply of the larger screen is being moved to a new location in Europe, but until then only the smaller screen will be available.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is ready to fund as much as 40% of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s total investment to build a chip packaging and assembly plant in the country, worth an initial $5 billion but which is expected to rise over time, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The plan by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government shows the willingness of some European member states to offer competitive terms to woo Intel and other chipmakers to invest in a region where labour and production costs are higher than in Asia.
Draghi's office and the innovation ministry both declined to comment.
Intel last week outlined the first details of an $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on Asian chip imports and ease a supply crunch that has curbed output in the region's strategic car sector.
The plan, with an initial expenditure of 33 billion euros ($36.4 billion), is centred on a huge new chipmaking complex in Germany, and includes an advanced packaging and assembly site in Italy with a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros.
The Italian facility, which is expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027, would create about 1,500 direct jobs and an additional 3,500 jobs among suppliers and partners.
Offering 40% of Intel's total capex in Italy would make it competitive with similar investments the chipmaker has made in other regions such as Asia, the two sources said, declining to be identified due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The government is in talks with the European Union, which will have to give its green light on state aid offered by member states to Intel, one of the sources said.
""It will be for Brussels to eventually decide how much, but I think Italy will contribute 30-40% of the total investment, probably something closer to 40%,"" the source added.
Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the deal, but reiterated that it, along with Italy, aims to make its planned facility a first of its kind in the EU.
LEVELLING THE FIELD
It is not yet clear how Italy plans to provide the funding. Rome has so far set aside 4.15 billion euros until 2030 to attract chipmakers and invest in new industrial applications of innovative technologies.
To clinch a deal with Intel, it is relying on new funding rules for innovative semiconductor facilities announced last month by the European Commission under the so-called Chips Act.
Brussels has made available 15 billion euros in additional public and private investment by 2030, on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger last week said the European Union could help level the cost playing field with Asia, but declined to give more detail.
Gelsinger said Intel wanted to spend the remaining money from its planned 80 billion euro investment over the next 10 years to build out the complete German site and further develop facilities in other countries including Italy.
""The government aims to convince Intel to even double its investment in Italy over time, from the initial 4.5 billion euros,"" the source said.
The source added that Rome had identified five potential sites in Italy where Intel could build its new advanced packaging and assembly facility, in the Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, Apulia and Sicily regions.

""The aim is to have a shortlist with two potential alternatives within a month,"" the source said. ""Then it will be (for) Intel to decide where to build it"".

510,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 01:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- While U.S. stocks were flip-flopping in morning trading Monday, there are signs that investors are getting more bullish and snapping up beaten-down stocks.
The S&P 500 Index is coming off its best week since November 2020, having posted four consecutive days of more than 1% gains for just the fifth time in history, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). Historically, that has been encouraging for the stock market, as each time it’s happened the S&P has climbed more than 20% over the ensuing year, with an average return of 28%.
The key is its breadth also looks strong. Clusters of “breadth thrusts,” which occur when an extreme number of stocks advance rather than decline in a short period of time, have appeared. Technical analysts say these moves tend to happen around the beginning of new uptrends for equities.
That said, investors still appear to be defensive in their buying. Market strength has been led by sectors usually perceived as havens, like energy, health care, utilities and real estate. In fact,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said last week’s rebound offers a good opportunity to sell and position more defensively. 
Read: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says This Is a Bear Market Rally to Sell
Here’s a look at what market breadth is telling investors about the trajectory of the U.S. stock market: 
Breadth Thrusts Pop Up
Nearly 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 10-day moving averages on Friday. Since 1982, the broad index has been higher over the next year in 35 out of the 36 times when more than 90% of its stocks trade above their 10-day moving averages, according to Ned Davis Research. The firm’s version of the Zweig Thrust Indicator, which occurs when the barometer rises from below 40% to above 61.5% in a 10-day period, hit that level on Friday for common stocks only.
Taking Stock of Volume
While stocks have started to advance, market technicians want to see the moves supported by volume rather than just a handful of companies pushing major indexes higher. The Arms Index, also called the Short-Term Trading Index, or TRIN, is an indicator that compares the number of advancing and declining stocks to advancing and declining volume. 
Read: Waiting on Capitulation? Technicians Urge Patience: Taking Stock
Readings below 0.5 in the Arms Index suggest there is more demand for stocks, while readings above 2.0 are a sign that investors are dumping equities, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of technical strategy at Strategas. On March 2, it fell to 0.55, but on Friday it sat at 1.28, meaning another bout of selling may be on tap before the market has its final washout. 
Momentum Signals
Less than a third of S&P 500 stocks are trading at 20-day highs, and that figure would need to expand beyond 50% for traders to believe momentum is improving, Sohn said. Strategists are also looking for the percentage of stocks trading above their 20-day moving average, which stood at 84% Friday, to climb above 90%.

The latter model, called ID.Buzz, is a centerpiece of the plan. It will be imported initially from VW's Hanover plant in Germany, but ultimately could be assembled in the United States or Mexico, according to Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America.
U.S. demand for the ID.Buzz is ""through the roof,"" Keogh said at a media briefing on Monday. The upshot is that ""there could be an opportunity"" to build the vehicle in North America, he said.
VW's North American investment plan is part of a broader five-year global spending plan, announced in December, that earmarks $98 billion for ""e-mobility, hybridization and digitalization,"" including construction of battery plants and partnerships with battery material suppliers.
The North American figure does not include a provision of $1.8 billion or more for additional local battery production to supplement battery cells that VW is buying from SK Innovation's Georgia plants, Keogh said. VW aims to establish dedicated cell production to support its ambitious electric vehicle rollout in the region, he said.
The German automaker expects at least 50% of its U.S. vehicle sales to be fully electric by 2030, Keogh said. That compares with a 70% target for electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.
VW will begin to phase out its gasoline-powered models in North America, with the aim of exiting sales of combustion-engine vehicles early in the next decade.

VW has begun pilot production of the ID.4 electric crossover at its Chattanooga plant in Tennessee, in preparation for a fall launch, and is upgrading its Mexican plants in Puebla and Silao to starting building electric vehicles, motors and related components by mid-decade.
Keogh said VW expects to add as many as four electric SUVs to its U.S. portfolio, starting in 2026, that would cover the same segments now served by gasoline-powered models, including Taos, Tiguan and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO).

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian luxury sports car brand Lamborghini can easily make up for lost sales from its decision to suspend business in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Chief Executive Stephan Winkelmann said on Monday.
Winkelmann said Lamborghini, part of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group through Audi, sold a record of around 200 cars in Russia last year, out of a record of 8,405 globally. 
""The cars we have planned to produce for Russia this year can be easily absorbed by other markets,"" he said in a web press conference.
""We're waiting to see how the situation evolves in Ukraine, but if it does not change we'll have no problem to absorb that demand, thanks to our strong order book and waiting lists.""
Lamborghini plans to start offering hybrid vehicles from next year and make its entire lineup - the Huracan and Aventador sports cars and the Urus sport utility vehicle (SUV) - plug-in hybrid between the end of 2024 and 2025. 
Its first full-electric vehicle will follow in the second half of the decade. Its production is expected to take place at the brand's historic headquarters near Bologna, northern Italy, Winkelmann said.
""There is room here to increase production,"" he said, without providing a target on Lamborghini future car output.

The carmaker will present during this year two new versions of the Huracan and a 'face lift' of Urus, Winkelmann said.
Lamborghini posted a margin on its operating profit of 20.2% last year versus a target of between 22%-25% for the coming years, the CEO said.

The London-listed company said there were no reasons for it to default, adding that the issuer had sufficient liquidity to complete the coupon payments. 
It said the paying agent for the coupon, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), had told Evraz it had not received the funds, which remained ""blocked for compliance"" at Evraz's correspondent bank, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) New York.
SocGen in NY did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The coupon is on Evraz's dollar bond maturing in March 2023. The issue last traded on Monday at 64 cents in the dollar
Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea soccer club, on March 10, freezing his assets and preventing him from travelling to Britain. 
Evraz reiterated its position that Abramovich, who owns a 28.64% stake, does not have effective control of the company, and it believes that it is neither designated nor sanctioned.

Evraz said it had sought clarity and confirmation from Britain's Treasury and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office about the matter.
Britain's Index provider FTSE Russell said last week it would eject Evraz, after many brokers refused to trade its shares, which remain suspended.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its antibody-based cocktail to prevent and treat COVID-19 was shown to retain neutralising activity against Omicron coronavirus variants, including the highly contagious BA.2 sub-variant, in an independent lab study.
Data from the study by the Washington University showed the therapy reduced the amount of virus detected in samples of all tested Omicron subvariants in mice lungs, the London-listed drugmaker said on Monday. The study has yet to be peer reviewed. 
The therapy, Evusheld, was tested against the BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 subvariants of Omicron and it was also shown to limit inflammation in the lungs.
""The findings further support Evusheld as a potential important option to help protect vulnerable patients such as the immunocompromised who could face poor outcomes if they were to become infected with COVID-19,"" senior AstraZeneca executive John Perez said. 
The World Health Organization said last week figures showing a global rise in COVID-19 cases could herald a much bigger problem, as the Omicron and BA.2 variants spread amid the easing of restrictions and testing.

Vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, but Evusheld contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
The results come after Britain last week approved the therapy for preventing infections in adults with poor immune response. Evusheld is currently under a European review and has been authorised in the United States.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) President Mark Reuss said Monday the automaker is confident in its 2022 outlook and its plans to accelerate the launch of a new Cadillac electric vehicle, despite intensifying global supply chain risks.
The geopolitical risks posed to automotive supply chains by the war in Ukraine are real, Reuss said during a conference call. But GM is managing the pressure, and is pushing ahead with its plans to speed up launches of new electric vehicles such as the Cadillac Lyriq, he said.
""We are not new to this game,"" Reuss said. GM has long-term contracts for materials, and multiple sources of supply, he said. ""We never have one answer.""
Reuss said GM has not changed its 2022 financial outlook, which called for operating profit this year of $13 billion to $15 billion, following a record $14.3 billion in operating profit for 2021.
Some rival automakers have hiked prices on their electric vehicles, or warned that 2022 financial projections are at risk because of higher oil prices and surges in prices for materials such as aluminum, neon and nickel hit by Western sanctions on Russia.
GM on Monday formally launched production of its Cadillac Lyriq electric utility vehicle at its complex in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The Lyriq, a compact utility vehicle, will compete with the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y, the best-selling vehicle in Tesla Inc's EV market leading lineup.
Reuss and other GM officials said consumer interest in the Lyriq is stronger than expected, with more than 240,000 people expressing interest. 
Cadillac will allow customers to place firm orders for the 2023 Lyriq starting May 19.
""We are looking to accelerate production,"" GM Vice President for Cadillac Rory Harvey said on Monday's call.
Reuss said the Spring Hill plant will have the parts and materials needed to ramp up Lyriq output, and could build as many as 200,000 Lyriqs a year. But he said the plant also needs to keep making combustion engine SUVs and save room for additional EV models.

Over the past year, consumer demand for EVs and aggressive moves by rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have pushed GM to accelerate its plans to build electric vehicles in high volume. 
GM said earlier this year it now plans to build 400,000 electric vehicles this year and next.

Investing.com --  Neurosense Therapeutics  Ltd (NASDAQ:NRSN), a company developing treatments for severe neurodegenerative diseases, rocketed over 290% higher Monday after announcing it has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to initiate a pharmacokinetic study of PrimeC.
PrimeC is a drug designed to target key components of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and potentially inhibit the progression. PrimeC is comprised of two FDA-approved drugs: ciprofloxacin and celecoxib.
The drug was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.
NeuroSense completed a Phase 2a clinical study that met safety and efficacy endpoints, including reducing functional and respiratory deterioration.
The company now plans to initiate a Phase 2b multinational study in the second quarter.

The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, committed last year to power 12.5% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, although Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has since said he is not sure Ryanair will reach the ""very ambitious target.""
Sustainable jet fuel generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels, offering airlines a way to become greener while continuing to fly, before less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen aeroplane options become available from the late 2030s.
The budget carrier said on Monday that its order of 210 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets, which use around 16% less fuel than the current generation of 737s while squeezing in 4% more passengers, will help it meet 32% of its decarbonisation target.
Critics say the low-cost business model encourages people to fly more frequently and drives growth in the total number of people flying. 
Ryanair plans to grow from flying around 150 million passengers per year before the COVID-19 pandemic to 225 million by 2026, although it predicts that total short-haul capacity in Europe is likely to be lower after the pandemic.

Offsetting measures, which Ryanair said will include carbon capture offset projects and supporting government policies and reforms, will contribute a further 24%.
One such reform, an overhaul of the European Union's air traffic management agreed by member states last year, will take care of the final 10% of Ryanair's decarbonisation target, the airline estimated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday unveiled a landmark proposal requiring public companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change-related risks in their periodic filings, such as annual reports.
Here are the highlights of the proposal, which is subject to public comment and will likely be finalized later in the year. 
CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS
Overall, the rule requires U.S.-listed companies to disclose climate-related risks and their ""actual or likely material impacts"" on the company's business, strategy and outlook. 
That could include the physical risks posed by climate change, such as flooding or wildfires, but also risks that may result from government policies aimed at mitigating climate risks, such as a carbon tax or other new regulations. 
CLIMATE RISK GOVERNANCE 
Companies will also have to disclose their governance processes and framework for managing climate-related risks. 
That would include, for example, the risk-management controls and processes they have in place; what the board is doing to oversee those processes; and the company's ""processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.""
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Companies will have to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions they generate both directly and indirectly from purchased electricity and other forms of energy, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, respectively. 
Companies will also have to disclose the indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in their value chains, known as Scope 3 emissions, ""if material"" or if they have a greenhouse gas emissions target that includes Scope 3 emissions. Smaller companies will be exempt from this requirement. 
CLIMATE TARGETS, TRANSITION PLANS
Companies that have publicly declared climate-related targets or goals must provide details, including ""the scope of activities and emissions included in the target,"" the deadline, any interim targets, and how they plan to meet their goals. 
If the company has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk management strategy, it must disclose ""a description of the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks."" 

CLIMATE FINANCIAL REPORTING
The disclosures would be included in companies' registration statements and annual reports, as well as in a note appended to consolidated financial statements.

Investing.com -- Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE:NLSN) shares fell around 18% Monday after it decided to reject a proposal from a private equity Consortium that valued the company at $25.40 per share.
Reports last week revealed Elliott Management was part of a private-equity group in advanced discussions to acquire Nielsen for around $15 billion, including debt.
Nielsen said it made the decision to reject the proposal after a comprehensive review and discussions with The WindAcre Partnership, which has around a 10% stake in the company.
WindAcre spoke with the Consortium about the possibility of joining. However, following the discussions, it decided not to join, adding that it would oppose the transaction as it ""views Nielsen's intrinsic value to be significantly higher than values proposed by the Consortium.""
WindAcre was prepared to work to prevent shareholder approval of the transaction.
""Nielsen's Board unanimously determined that the Consortium's offer significantly undervalues the Company and does not adequately compensate shareholders for Nielsen's growth prospects,"" Nielsen said in a statement.
In addition, Nielsen said it plans to start share repurchases under its previously approved $1 billion share repurchase program. The company intends to begin share repurchases when its trading window opens, which is expected after the first quarter of 2022 earnings planned for April 21."

MADRID (Reuters) - Apollo Infrastructure, a unit of investment firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, has agreed to buy a stake in Spanish road freight operator Primafrio, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters Apollo was taking a 49% stake in a transaction that valued the family-owned company at around 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion). 
The founding Conesa Alcaraz family said in the statement it would retain a majority holding and continue to lead the business, which exports fruit and vegetables from Spain and Portugal to other European countries. 
The company is branching out to higher-margin sectors including retail and pharmaceuticals as high energy prices squeeze profitability for transport and logistics services.
Fuel costs swelled to equal 17% of Primafrio's revenue in 2020, even before an energy price spike prompted by economic recovery from COVID-19 shutdowns was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Primafrio had originally planned an initial public offering it hoped would have valued the firm at $2 billion, but scrapped this last June blaming negative market conditions.
Apollo's co-head of Global Infrastructure Dylan Foo said the deal had been clinched by ""navigating the current market volatility"", adding his firm was ""attracted to the scale, resiliency, and operational excellence of Primafrio"".
The company made a margin on core earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of nearly 18% in 2020, according to the prospectus for that deal. 
Primafrio was advised by Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) International and Linklaters. Ashurst LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP advised Apollo Infrastructure.

Controlled by the family of Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, MFE sees building a continental TV champion as the answer to challenges posed to traditional broadcasters by streaming giants and online advertising platforms.
Previously known as Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), it announced last week that it already had a voting stake of more than 25% in ProSiebenSat.1. after its first investment in 2019
Were it to surpass a 30% stake, MFE would have to make a mandatory offer to the remaining ProSieben shareholders according to German law. 
""Currently, we have no such plans. What will be in a year's time, we will see then,"" Giordani was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt on Monday.
MFE has repeatedly called for closer cooperation with the Munich-based group as well as asking it to engage in talks over strategy, focusing on its core TV business.
The German TV group has been pursuing a standalone strategy, while investing in tech business, such as e-commerce operations and dating online platform ParshipMeet, whose planned IPO was frozen due to the current market environment and war in Ukraine.
""It is not easy for us to understand how to create long-term value in a conglomerate consisting of TV, e-commerce and dating portals,"" Giordani said.
TOP-LEVEL TALKS
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters Giordani will meet on Thursday with ProSieben management as part of a regular roadshow with investors, and will request clarification on synergies and advertising business performance. 
In December, ProSieben said it was extending CEO Rainer Beaujean's contract until 2027, and the supervisory board intended to propose Andreas Wiele, a former Axel Springer executive board member, as its new chairman. 
MFE was not given advance notice of such plan and it was not involved in the decision to propose former RTL boss Bert Habets and Rolf Nonnenmacher for the two seats that are to be reallocated at the annual general meeting in May.

Giordani said he would hope for a candidate that will be fully supported by MFE, which has not any representatives at the supervisory board, suggesting a compromise is still possible. Otherwise MFE could present rival candidates. 
""In any case, these would not be MFE representatives but independent managers with the right qualification,"" the executive said.

The plane crashed after a sudden descent from cruising altitude. Media reported that rescue workers had found no sign of survivors. The cause of the crash was not yet known. Boeing said it was working to gather more information.
FlightRadar 24 said the jet involved in the accident is six years old. Following the crash, Chinese state media said the airline has grounded its 737-800 fleet, which according to the flight tracking website had 109 such planes. 
The popular variant is a predecessor to the Boeing's 737 MAX, which awaits regulatory approval in China, the world's largest domestic aviation market.
The 737-800 has a maximum seating capacity of 189 and is equipped with a CFM-56 engine, according to Boeing's website. 
It was not clear immediately if the aircraft involved in the accident had the same engine as airlines are free to choose engines from other suppliers.
The CFM engines are made by a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA. GE shares were down about 1%, while France-listed Safran fell 3%.

CFRA Research analyst Colin Scarola said the crash should not technically impact the MAX's recertification in China where it has been grounded for three years following the two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
But he did not rule out the country using the accident as an excuse to delay an approval. ""China likely would not admit this is what they are doing. But we certainly think it could happen,"" Scarola said.

529,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 10:16AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Russia is due to make another dollar-denominated payment to bondholders on Monday after last week defying fears it might not be able or willing to do so, following Western countries' unprecedented sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.
Paying external holders last week means Russia swerved its first default, for now, since a 1998 financial crisis and its first on international bonds since the 1917 revolution, when the Bolsheviks repudiated obligations of the Tsarist government. 
But with Russia due to repay another $66 million on Monday and a total of $4.7 billion between now and year end, there are further tests to come. 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia. 
Last week's drama centred on two bonds the government issued in 2013, for which coupon, or interest, payments with a combined value of just over $117 million were due on Wednesday.
Like many international bonds there was a 30-day grace period, meaning Moscow effectively had until April 15 to pay.
Initially, Russia seemed to balk at the prospect of sending scarce hard currency overseas, but on March 14 the finance ministry said https://minfin.gov.ru/ru/press-center/?id_4=37805-utverzhden_vremennyi_poryadok_ispolneniya_gosudarstvennykh_dolgovykh_obyazatelstv_rossiiskoi_federatsii_v_inostrannoi_valyute it had approved a temporary procedure to make the payments. 
Under a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Russia's correspondent bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), was able to process the cash before crediting it to another U.S. bank,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), the paying agent.
Citi checked the details and distributed it to bondholders, who market sources said on Thursday and Friday had received the money.
THE NEXT TEST
Further tests come thick and fast. On Monday, Russia is due to make a $66 million payment although technically, under the terms of the issue it could make this payment - as well as a $102 million one on March 28 - in alternatives currencies, including roubles. 
Gramercy, an emerging markets fund manager, noted on Friday that making use of the bond's ""alternative payment currency event"" required a 15-day notice, which it said Russia's finance ministry had not published.
After last week's payment showed Russia had the ability and willingness to pay in dollars,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said there was no reason for Russia to be able to invoke the alternative rouble payment clause, but that ""doesn't guarantee that Russia won't try"".
On March 31 there is a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars, while its biggest payment of the year -- and its first full repayment of ""principal"", of $2 billion -- is due on April 4.
Foreign investors also owned about $38 billion-worth of rouble-denominated sovereign bonds known as OFZs before this crisis, JPMorgan estimates -- nearly 20% of that market. Some of the payments due on those have not yet been made.
CAN RUSSIA KEEP PAYING?
Even if Russia remains willing to pay, there may be complications, especially for bonds that must be serviced in dollars.
Western sanctions ban transactions with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund, although the temporary general license 9A https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_gl9a.pdf issued by OFAC on March 2 makes an exception for the purposes of ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity"".
That license expires on May 25, however, after which Russia will still have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.
Morgan Stanley analysts say that after Monday's test, the next crucial date is May 27, when the first payments come due after the licence has expired.
That could force Russia into making payments for a dollar 2026 bond and a euro 2036 bond in roubles to onshore accounts, which the finance ministry has said would be its fallback option.
That would trigger a default on the dollar bond, as only the euro bond allows for payment in roubles. 
Morgan Stanley analysts say that the GL9A licence could be extended, ""yet for this to happen it would need a significant move towards de-escalation"".
Some analysts suggest money frozen abroad under the sanctions may have been used for last week's payments, although Russia has generally paid debt out of budget funds in the past.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT DOESN'T PAY?
If Russia fails to make any of its bond payments within their defined grace periods, or pays in roubles where dollars or euros are specified, it will be a historic default.
Such an event would have been unthinkable before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", and subsequent Western sanctions.
Russia has nearly $650 billion of central bank reserves, one of the lowest debt-to-GDP levels in the world and has been raking in money from soaring oil and gas prices.

A default would lock it out of the international borrowing markets until the sanctions were lifted and it repaid creditors for any losses they had suffered.
It would also depress its credit ratings for some time, pushing up the interest rates the government and big Russian companies can borrow at.

Airlines, which are reeling from soaring fuel prices and airspace closures due to the war in Ukraine, had to cancel hundreds of flights to and from German airports amid security worker strikes last Monday and Tuesday.
Verdi called the strike for this Tuesday at Frankfurt, Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg, Hanover, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Cologne/Bonn airports.
Frankfurt is Germany's busiest airport, handling around 2.1 million passengers last month.
""We did make progress in aligning regional wages,"" Verdi negotiator Wolfgang Pieper said in a statement on Monday. 
""But when it came to wage increases, the employers' offers fell far short of what the employees demanded."" 
The union is demanding that employers raise the wages of the around 25,000 airport security employees in Germany by at least 1 euro an hour for the next 12 months and that staff in different parts of the country earn the same.

BDLS, the association of aviation safety companies, has said that all of Verdi's demands combined amounted to pay increases of up to 40% and were ""utopian.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has decided to replace  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) unit State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) as manager of the HK$111 billion ($14.2 billion) Tracker Fund of Hong Kong (TraHK), two sources told Reuters.
The decision on managing the fund, which tracks the benchmark Hang Seng index and is Hong Kong's top exchange traded fund (ETF), is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
HKMA and SSGA declined to comment on any change in the TraHK mandate, which was first reported by media outlet Caixin.
The HKMA's move follows a review by the de-facto central bank and comes a year after a U-turn by SSGA, over an investment decision linked to U.S. sanctions on Chinese firms.
SSGA said in January 2021 that it would stop buying shares in China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), two large constituents of the Hang Seng index, citing a decision to no longer invest in securities of U.S. sanctioned entities.
But three days later SSGA said it would resume investing in stocks denied to U.S. investors under an executive order by then U.S. President Donald Trump.
The initial TraHK decision to stop investing in the banned securities sparked anger from some investors, who called for SSGA to be replaced by a manager that could buy the stocks.
TraHK, which is popular among Hong Kong retail investors and pension funds, was set up in 1998 by Hong Kong's government to offload shares it had bought during the Asian financial crisis.
Two local asset managers have emerged as possible contenders to replace SSGA, including Hang Seng Investment Managers, an investment arm of Hang Seng Bank, which is a unit of HSBC, said the sources, who requested anonymity.
CSOP Asset Management, a joint venture between one of China's largest fund house China Southern and Hong Kong hedge fund OP investment, is the other candidate up for the top ETF job in Hong Kong, the sources said. 

Hang Seng Investment Managers and CSOP Asset Management also declined to comment.
SSGA has been paid a 0.05% annual management fee from TraHK since its listing in 1999, which was about HK$60 million income in 2020 and 2019 combined, the fund's annual report shows.

Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb) is to acquire Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in a deal worth approximately $11.6 billion. 
Berkshire will pay $848.02 per share in cash for the owner of reinsurer TransRe. The price represents a 29% premium to Alleghany’s average stock price over the last 30 days and a 16% premium to Alleghany’s 52-week high closing price.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, with Alleghany continuing to operate as an independent subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) after the completion.
""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years. Throughout 85 years the Kirby family has created a business that has many similarities to Berkshire Hathaway. I am particularly delighted that I will once again work together with my long-time friend, Joe Brandon,"" said Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway’s Chairman and CEO. 
The acquisition news resulted in Alleghany shares jumping over 25% at the open.
Alleghany has a 25-day ""go shop"" period where it may actively solicit and consider other acquisition proposals. However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields said in a research note that the company's relative complexity makes other bids unlikely."
535,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 10:00AM ET</span>","BofA analyst Geoff Meacham raised the price target on  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock to $180.00 per share from the prior $170.00.
The analyst has reflected on the MRNA stock ahead of phase 2 H2H study readout for Modernas seasonal flu program, mRNA- 1010, likely due in the next few weeks.
While the lackluster tolerability profile was a headwind, the phase 2 H2H trial is testing lower doses, which could improve adverse events, but it will be a delicate balance of efficacy vs. tolerability. However, even with lower doses, our experts agree that mRNA-1010 is likely to show non-inferiority to the active comparator, our base case being HAI GM titers 9-11x higher for H1N1 and 7-9x higher for H3N2 vs. baseline. That said, other attributes (manufacturing speed) could support mRNA-1010 being superior, Meachem said in a client note.
The raised price target reflects an increase in the LoS for the flu program to 35% (from 25%) given BofAs updated outlook.
The analyst also noted that Modernas product is likely to be first to market, although  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) is catching up fast. Meachem sees Modernas advantage as less than a year due to the speed of development for mRNA vaccines.
Our experts noted that price could be a limitation for uptake, as traditional flu vaccines are cheap, so in order to see broad adoption, mRNA flu vaccines would have to be either priced in-line with traditional vaccines or show superior efficacy.
Brookline Capital Markets analyst Leah Rush Cann took note of Moderna submitting an amendment to EUA for an additional booster dose of mRNA-1273.
We believe that the benefit of second booster doses of mRNA-1273, regardless of the vaccine used for the primary series has been demonstrated post marketing, in the real world setting, to prolong immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. We believe the authorization for a second booster of mRNA-1273 could come at a crucial time in the pandemic management, when variants are continuing to emerge and immunity conferred from initial boosters is starting to wane in those who were among the earliest vaccinated. These individuals are generally also among those most at risk, being 65 and older or having underlying health or occupational risk putting them at higher risk of COVID-19 disease, the analyst wrote in a memo to clients.
Rush Cann projects that Moderna will sell and deliver, globally, an estimated 1.177 billion doses of mRNA-1273 in 2022, with 234 million sold in the US. The analyst estimates 2030 sales of $51.4 billion for Moderna.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off more hawkish talk from the Federal Reserve as well as rhetoric from Europe that seemed to point to a further intensification of the military and economic struggle there.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22 points, or less than 0.1%, at 34,734 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 0.3%, however, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.  All three indices had had their best week in several months last week amid rising hopes for a quick end to the war in Ukraine.
The Dow underperformed in part due to its heavy weighting of Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock, which fell 5.9% after one of its 737-800 NG aircraft, operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), crashed during a domestic flight with the loss of 132 lives. 
The 737-800 NG has had an excellent safety record over the last two decades, which may allay concerns that the flaws of the 737 MAX have somehow reappeared in a different guise. 
Another stock heading lower was  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP), which fell 14% after a raft of broker downgrades on Friday followed its underwhelming quarterly results and guidance earlier in the week. Shopify stock, like many growth names that performed well in the early stages of the pandemic, has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since November, as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have belatedly moved to tighten monetary policy.
Earlier, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic had appeared to temper his previous hawkishness, with a nod to the economic uncertainty created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has sent energy prices spiraling higher across the world. Bostic said in a speech that: ""The elevated levels of uncertainty are front forward in my mind and have tempered my confidence that an extremely aggressive rate path is appropriate today.”
Early outperformers included conglomerate Alleghany (NYSE:Y), after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) offered to buy it for $11.6 billion, a deal that will add to Berkshire's insurance portfolio, among other things. 
Merger and acquisition activity was also behind the 25% rise in  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) stock. The software company had agreed to sell itself to private equity group Thoma Bravo for $10.7 billion.
Oil and gas stocks were also supported by a fresh rise in crude prices, after the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the EU is looking at expanding its current sanctions package on Russia to include energy purchases. The bloc's leaders are due to meet on Thursday with U.S. President Joe Biden in an effort to find ways to increase the pressure on Russia, which has intensified and expanded its artillery attacks across Ukraine over the weekend, and which downplayed reports of progress in peace talks earlier Monday.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 9.7%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 2.8% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock was up 1.2%. 
Among small caps,  Vallon Pharmaceuticals  (NASDAQ:VLON) stock fell 71% after it reported disappointing trial results for Adair, the experimental drug for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that accounted for most of its value."

SYDNEY/MILAN (Reuters) -Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti Group launched a Hong Kong initial public offering on Monday that values the company at up to $1.2 billion, a term sheet seen by Reuters showed, going ahead despite volatility in global equity markets.
Ferretti, whose customers include British fashion designer Jimmy Choo and former football star David Beckham, is a market leader for yachts measuring at least 80 feet, with a price tag ranging from 4 million euros ($4.4 million) to more than 20 million.
Downplaying risks to the group from the Ukraine war and ensuing sanctions against Russian oligarchs, Ferretti has said it has no exposure to mega- and giga-yachts chiefly hit by the measures. Fully customised superyachts measuring more than 100 feet account for only 9% of group revenues.
Braving choppy markets after a failed IPO attempt in 2019, Ferretti plans to sell 83.58 million shares, or around 25% of its total equity capital, to raise up to $301 million, according to the term sheet.
That entails a valuation of $932 million-$1.2 billion, with shares to be priced at HK$21.82 to HK$28.24 each, the term sheet showed.
Ferretti expects the value of the global yacht market to grow on average 7% a year, reaching 27 billion euros in 2025, with demand strengthening particularly in the Asia Pacific region, thanks also to tax breaks in China, an investor presentation seen by Reuters showed.
Building on 2021 revenues of 900 million euros, Ferretti plans to use most of the IPO proceeds to grow its core manufacturing business, adding new models, and to boost side services such as after-sales assistance or yacht chartering.
Ferretti, whose brands include Riva, Pershing and Wally, is owned by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group.
Piero Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), son of the eponymous luxury sports car company's founder Enzo Ferrari, owns 11% of the company and sits on the board.
Five Chinese cornerstone investors have subscribed for $129.5 million worth of stock in the issue.
The 54-year-old company runs six shipyards in Italy and competes with family-owned Sanlorenzo, which listed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-sanlorenzo-idUSKBN1YA0PP in Milan in 2019. 
Shares in Sanlorenzo, which has also downplayed the hit from the Ukraine crisis, touched a 17-month low this month, before regaining some ground.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has see-sawed in the past week but remains down nearly 9% for the year.
The value of Hong Kong IPOs in the first quarter tumbled to $837.4 million from $11 billion at the same time in 2021, Refinitiv data showed. 

The final price of Ferretti's shares is due to be set on Friday and the stock will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on March 31.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said no vote was planned at this meeting and there will not be any discussion of any of the COVID vaccine makers' applications for additional boosters.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), as well as rival  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc last week sought emergency use authorization from U.S. health regulators for a second COVID booster shot, as a surge in cases in some parts of the world fuels fears of another wave of the pandemic.

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee's (VRBPAC) discussion will focus particularly on factors that need to be looked at to update the strains that make up the vaccines as well as the timing and populations for booster doses.
""Now is the time to discuss the need for future boosters as we aim to move forward safely, with COVID-19 becoming a virus like others such as influenza that we prepare for, protect against, and treat,"" said Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Canadian department store chain Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co is bidding for Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
The company had previously rejected buyout offers from Sycamore and Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research, with each offering to pay between $64 and $65 per share, valuing the company at around $9 billion.
Kohl's, which is facing pressure from activist investors to sell itself, said the proposals received are non-binding and without committed financing.

Smartphone makers continue to grapple with global chip crunch issues which significantly affect their production output.
Several challenges such as miscalculated demand, plant shutdowns, and disputes between the United States and China have resulted in numerous automakers reporting chip sourcing problems.
Since then, the chip shortage has expanded to other sectors as well, including smartphones.
China-branded mobile shipments were down 35% y/y, but non-China branded mobile phones - a proxy for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone - were only 5% down y/y. For the first two months this year, total shipments were up 10% y/y.
UBS analyst David Vogt said that the iPhone outperformed local rivals in China in February with the market share increasing 320bps to 11.4% YoY.
On a LTM basis, we est iPhone shipments in China totaled 48M capturing ~14.6% share. While Apple's share gains are impressive, lockdowns in mid-March in China will likely be the focus of investors going forward. While initial checks indicate the lock down is manageable and should not be a material headwind for the March qtr, a wider and more prolonged lock down could be a modest headwind in the June qtr. That said, we are not changing our iPhone March (55M), June (45M), and FY22 (235M) forecast at this time given the mitigation efforts by Apple and its partners but are monitoring policy changes, Vogt said in a client note.
As a result, the analyst has left his March/June iPhone unit estimates unchanged amid solid China data. However, these market gains are offset by Russia and recent COVID lockdowns in Shenzhen.
Vogt estimates that Apple will sell 55 million iPhone units in the March quarter, lower than the 57 million consensus.

WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms Inc is embroiled in a Russian court case, with prosecutors seeking to label it an ""extremist organisation"", and authorities have actively promoted Telegram as they have banned other foreign platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.
Megafon, one of Russia's four main telecoms operators, said its analysis of mobile internet traffic showed that Telegram's share had jumped to 63% in the first two weeks of March from 48% in the first two weeks of February.
WhatsApp's share dropped to 32% from 48%, Megafon said.
The average Telegram user consumed 101 MB of data a day, compared to 26 MB for WhatsApp. 
Founded by Russian Pavel Durov, Telegram has long been a popular news platform in Russia, with almost all major media, government entities and public figures operating content channels. 
""The popularity of the service has grown against the backdrop of restrictions on access to other messengers and social networks,"" Megafon said in a statement. ""The service started actively growing on Feb. 24.""

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

543,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 08:44AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Last week, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced it acquired SoftBank's equity ownership stake in GM Cruise for $2.1 billion. In addition, GM will invest $1.35 billion in Cruise instead of SoftBank.
GM now owns roughly 80% of Cruise, while SoftBank is no longer a shareholder. The transaction values Cruise at around $30 billion, lower compared to the last funding that valued the startup above $30 billion.
The remaining 20% is held by employees and other investors, which include T. Rowe Price, Honda, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Here are 3 analysts discussing GM's decision to increase its stake in the autonomous vehicle (AV) business.
Wolfes Rod Lache (Outperform, $70): Until now, GM's options for retaining control and exclusivity of Cruise were somewhat limited. GM reset the table by buying out Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s stake, which will ultimately raise GM's stake in Cruise to >80%. We're also raising our GM target to $70 from $67.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Dan Levy (Outperform, $75): While the valuation was a negative (implying a down round for Cruise), and some might cite concerns of reduced independence of Cruise, we nevertheless focus on two positives: 1. The deal further ties Cruise to GM, creating a stronger case for operational synergies; 2. The tendering program + removal of IPO/liquidity vesting condition can help in talent attraction/retention. As it relates to GM stock, while investors likely are discounting AV valuations, we nevertheless believe the stronger tie to Cruise can eventually be a key long-term value creator.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s Colin Langan (Overweight, $83): The low Cruise valuation partially reflects SoftBank's desire to sell assets to improve its credit profile. GM was the most logical buyer with enough funds to execute the transaction quickly. On the other hand, the transaction is another sign that a Cruise IPO is not imminent. More importantly, the low valuation will likely raise concerns that Cruise is not worth the $30B value implied by the prior funding round. Cruise's market value is likely mid the two numbers. The $30B is likely lower, as investor interest in growth has moderated. And SoftBank likely accepted some discount to liquidate its position quickly. While GM traded up slightly post announcement, we expect the stock may end up trading down slightly on the low Cruise price.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse shook up its board on Monday, including the departure of its influential vice chair Severin Schwan, as it attempts to draw a line under a series of damaging scandals.
Switzerland's second largest bank said that Schwan, 54, who was its lead independent director as well as chief executive of Roche, would not stand for re-election to the board of directors at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s annual general meeting on April 29.
Schwan faced criticism for leading the Swiss pharmaceuticals firm while at the same time acting as vice chair of Credit Suisse, a demanding position as the bank grappled with several risk-management scandals which hit its share price.
Schwan was not immediately available for comment.
Another two of the 13 members of the Credit Suisse board, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas, will also not stand for re-election, the bank said in a statement.
The Zurich-based bank said it had nominated Christian Gellerstad to succeed Schwan, who joined the board in 2014 and has been vice chair and lead independent director since 2017.
Schwan was also a member of the governance and nominations committee which picked Antonio Horta-Osorio as chairman. Horta-Osorio left in January less than nine months into the job after a probe into breaches of COVID-19 rules. 
Credit Suisse has been hit by scandals and losses, notably from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management and British financier Greensill Capital. 
Shares in the bank, which lost more than 22% of their value last year and a further 14.5% this year, were up 0.5% at 7.63 Swiss francs at 1158 GMT. 
Investor representative group Actares said it was pleased that Schwan was going in the wake of the chairman fiasco and the scandals which occurred during the time he was on the board.

The bank said it had nominated Mirko Bianchi, who served as chief financial officer at UniCredit, Keyu Jin, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, and Amanda Norton, who most recently served at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) as group chief risk officer, for election as non-executive members.

BETA+, which includes Maxit and Digital Investor, provides back-office processing to the wealth management industry, including securities processing and tax reporting. It had revenue of about $300 million last year, mainly linked to U.S. markets.
LSEG said it expects to hand a ""significant proportion"" of the net proceeds to shareholders via a buyback, which would likely start in the third quarter.
""In addition, LSEG announces that it has entered into a new long-term strategic partnership for data, content and tools with BETA+ and portfolio companies owned by Motive and Clearlake,"" LSEG said in a statement.
The partnership will provide LSEG with new, recurring revenue at attractive growth rates through access to new client segments, the exchange said.
Shares in LSEG, which said leverage would be cut, were down 0.2% at 7,942 pence at 1200 GMT.

""The wealth management industry continues to demonstrate opportunities, bolstered by tailwinds across the spectrum including a significant movement in technology modernization, industry consolidation, increases in retail trading, and democratization of the capital markets,"" Clearlake and Motive said in a statement.

546,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 08:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Chinese e-commerce platform  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc on Monday reported quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street estimates, as it battles fierce competition from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com in the rapidly growing online shopping space.
U.S.-listed shares of Pinduoduo fell as much as 12% in premarket trading before paring losses.
A comparatively new entrant in the Chinese e-commerce sector, Pinduoduo faces competition from larger rivals with strong infrastructure and logistics as well as dominant market positions.
A slowdown in Chinese economic growth and COVID-19 outbreaks have also taken a toll on consumers' discretionary spending.
Total revenue was 27.23 billion yuan ($4.29 billion) in the fourth quarter, below estimates of 30.10 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 6.62 billion yuan in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 1.38 billion yuan a year ago.
Gross merchandise value (GMV), a metric widely used at e-commerce companies to measure the total value of sales, reached 2,441 billion yuan last year for the Shanghai-headquartered firm, up 46% from 2020.
Pinduoduo's GMV is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% in the next 10 years, according to a report issued by Morningstar Equity Research this month, mainly driven by growth in sales of agricultural products.
""In 2021, we made the strategic shift from sales and marketing toward research and development,"" said chairman and chief executive Chen Lei in a statement. ""We see ourselves making more long-term investment, especially in agriculture and R&D.""
Chinese regulators have been conducting a campaign to rein in the country's massive and fast-developing online economy since the end of 2020, and share prices of listed Chinese tech giants have fallen sharply since then.

Pinduoduo had lost 27% of its market capitalisation since the beginning of this year by Friday, closing at $42.6, after losing 67% in 2021.

Our analysis indicates that the inputs of UBER share gains vs. LYFT that we found in our Oct. 14 analysis have likely abated while driver supply has arguably worsened for both players and could portend rising driver incentive expense pressure, the analyst said in a client note.
More precisely, pick-up times appear to be over 50% higher compared to the October analysis, with LYFT still demonstrating shorter wait times.

Chief Executive Officer Marco Margiotta said the higher cashback in partnership with fintech company Payfare will help drivers stay on the road and ""ease the pain of rising gas prices.""
Prices for gasoline have soared more than 20% from last month, according to the American Automobile Association, driven by higher crude oil rates due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The company said Lyft Direct cardholders can save up to 21 cents per gallon on average with the increased cashback.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft drivers have considered quitting the app-based ride-hailing platforms as fueling up becomes costlier.

Both the platforms over the past few months have been investing in keeping drivers and bringing in more to meet rising demand as COVID-19 cases ease and consumers venture out.
In response to record gas prices, the companies earlier this month announced a 55-cent per-ride surcharge that would be paid directly to drivers.

The deal, announced on Sunday, would give Anaplan investors $66 for each share held, a premium of more than 30% over the company's last closing price on Friday.
With pandemic-led lockdowns accelerating digital transformations across enterprises, demand for cloud has jumped. While most software companies saw their shares jump last year, Anaplan failed to capitalize on the boom and its shares tumbled over 36%.
Anaplan provides planning software as a service to businesses that help in modeling different forecasting outcomes, and has more than 1,900 customers worldwide. 
Hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management took a nearly 5% stake in Anaplan last month to press the company to make changes.
Software-focused Thoma Bravo, which has with more than $103 billion in assets under management, will focus on Anaplan's software platform and branding to grow business. The deal is expected to close in the first half of this year.
The highly leveraged buyout is the latest in the software sector, which has attracted interest from private equity players. 
Many software firms have also taken the go-private route, largely seen as a way to grow for businesses in the midst of model transformation.

In January, software company Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) said it would be taken private for $16.5 billion including debt by affiliates of Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners. 
The news of the Anaplan deal, which has an enterprise value of $10.7 billion, was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

(Reuters) -Wall Street is taking a gloomy view of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) ahead of its quarterly results on Monday, as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues threaten to hit the sportswear giant's 2022 sales.
At least 10 brokerages have cut the stock's price targets this week on fears that a lift from strong sneaker demand in North America will be offset by persistent shortages, stemming from factory closures in top supplier Vietnam last year.
Nike's current quarter is also expected to take a hit from stalling shopping traffic in China due to rising COVID infections and the decision to temporarily shutter stores and online business in Russia, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The recent rise in geopolitical uncertainty, increase in oil prices, and growing strength of the U.S. dollar present risk of slowing growth for Nike's international segments ahead,"" Jefferies analysts said.
THE CONTEXT
Earlier this month, Nike's main rival Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) Inc flagged a knock to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts cut their forecast for Nike's current-quarter revenue growth in Europe to 7% from 15%, largely due to an estimated 2% hit to total sales from the Russia exit.
Still, resilient demand despite higher prices and a pivot to selling more products directly to consumers are expected to ease the pressure of higher supply chain costs on Nike's margins. 
""There is still a lot of strength in the way that Nike is running its retail strategy, and in its product. Those two strategies are key for its future,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Analysts on average expect Nike to report third-quarter revenue of $10.59 billion, down from $10.63 billion at the start of this week. Third-quarter revenue last year was $10.36 billion * Full-year revenue expectations have taken an even bigger beating since Monday, slipping to $46.90 billion from $47.06 billion * Third-quarter revenue from China is projected to fall nearly 12% to $2.01 billion, after slumping 19.8% in the prior quarter * The company is expected to report third-quarter earnings per share of 71 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, compared with the 76 cents reported a year earlier * The Dow component has declined over 22% since the start of this year to Thursday's close, compared with the 5.1% fall in the index for the same period
WALL STREET SENTIMENT

* The current average analyst rating on NKE shares is ""buy"", with 29 rating it ""strong buy"" or ""buy"", seven rating it a ""hold"" and two rating it a ""sell"" or ""strong sell"". 
* The mean price target is $168.24, down from $181.35 at the start of March

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Volkswagen will form joint ventures with Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan Group to secure nickel and cobalt supplies for electric vehicles in China, the world's No. 1 car market, and to slash costs at a time of surging raw material prices.
The move is part of a 30 billion euro ($33 billion) push by the world's second-largest carmaker to build a network of battery cell factories and secure more direct access to vital raw materials that are needed to supply them.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) , Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan have signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture in Indonesia, where more than 10% of the world's laterite nickel ore reserves are located, to focus on nickel and cobalt raw material production.
At the final expansion stage of the venture, it will be able to supply raw materials for 160 gigawatt hours worth of electric vehicle batteries, Volkswagen China Group said in a statement.
This corresponds to an annual output of around 120,000 tonnes of nickel and 15,000 tonnes of cobalt, Huayou said in a separate filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Volkswagen's second joint venture will be formed with Huayou in China's southwestern Guangxi region for the refining of nickel and cobalt sulfates, precursor and cathode material production, it said.
""The cooperation aims to achieve significant cost advantages, secure the raw material supply and achieve a transparent and sustainable supply chain,"" it said. ""The two partnerships target to contribute to the Group's long term target of a 30-50% cost reduction on each battery.""
Global nickel prices have surged almost 400% this year due to the Ukraine crisis, as Russia is a major supplier and its invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Moscow by the West lit a fire under an already hot market.
Prices on the London Metal Exchange got a further boost on March 8 when they doubled to $100,000 per tonne in a matter of hours, after Tsingshan bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its short bets on the metal and its exposure to costly margin calls.
Prices have dropped sharply since then however, after the LME was forced to halt trading for a period and reopened with new trading limits. 
Privately owned Tsingshan has become the world's top nickel producer thanks to its development of a low-cost process to make the metal. It already has major investments in Indonesia, including other joint ventures with Huayou.
Volkswagen's move comes as rivals, from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to BYD, are raising prices for EVs due to higher raw material costs, and follows Ford's announcement last week spelling out plans for a nickel cell joint venture in Turkey. 
On Saturday, the chief executive of Chinese EV manufacturer Li Auto, Li Xiang, said on his official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account that battery makers had increased prices at a rate he called ""outrageous"" in the second quarter, and warned that those EV makers that had not raised prices yet would likely have to soon.

Asked to comment on Li's remarks, Chinese battery maker CATL, which supplies major car makers including Tesla, told Reuters on Monday that it had raised prices for some battery products due to rising raw material costs.

Novatek, Russia's largest private natural gas producer, did not provide a reason for his resignation. A representave of Timchenko, who had served on the company's board of directors since 2009, declined to comment.
The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko and other billionaires with ties to Putin. 
Timchenko, already on a U.S. sanctions list over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, was Russia's sixth-richest billionaire last year with a net worth of $22 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it said were dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. 

Timchenko, who sits on the board of petrochemicals producer Sibur, was co-founder of Switzerland-based oil trader Gunvor. Timchenko sold his stake in Gunvor in 2014 after the United States imposed sanctions against him.
Timchenko has said he owned a few trading companies in and near St Petersburg in the 1990s, when Putin worked in the office of the city's mayor.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Monday, with the FTSE 100 outperforming on the back of its heavily-weighted resource companies as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine resulted in crude price gains.
By 4:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France traded flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4%.
The conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 is entering its fifth week. Diplomacy efforts are ongoing, with Turkey's foreign minister stating on Sunday that the two sides were nearing agreement on ""critical"" issues, but the fighting continues, particularly around the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
German producer prices increased 25.9% year on year in February, data showed Monday, the largest rise since 1949, mainly because of energy prices.
Oil prices jumped further Monday following a weekend attack on the  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) refinery joint venture in Yanbu, as well as concerns the EU will join the United States in imposing an oil embargo on Russia. 
U.S. President Joe Biden is set to arrive in Brussels on Thursday for summits with the members of NATO, as well as the European Union governments to discuss their response to Russia’s aggression. 
The West has already imposed a number of punishing sanctions on Moscow for its invasion, including a freezing of the assets of the Russian central bank. These moves have yet to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the fighting, and the obvious next move is for the bloc to target Russian oil.
This would be an economically tough choice, as the EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany the most dependent of the bloc's large economies.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's media regulator will be able to force internet companies to share data about how they have handled misinformation and disinformation under new laws that will bolster government efforts to rein in Big Tech.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will also be able to enforce an internet industry code on uncooperative platforms, the government said on Monday, joining others around the world seeking to reduce the spread of harmful falsehoods online.
The planned laws are a response to an ACMA investigation that found four-fifths of Australian adults had experienced misinformation about COVID-19 and 76% thought online platforms should do more to cut the amount of false and misleading content online.
The laws broadly align with efforts by Europe to curb damaging online content, which are due to take effect by the end of 2022, although the European Union has said it wants even tougher measures to stop disinformation given some of the output from Russian state-owned media during the invasion of Ukraine.
""Digital platforms must take responsibility for what is on their sites and take action when harmful or misleading content appears,"" Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said in a statement.
Australians were most likely to see misinformation on larger services like Meta Platforms's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), the ACMA said. 
False narratives typically started with ""highly emotive and engaging posts within small online conspiracy groups"" and were ""amplified by international influencers, local public figures, and by coverage in the media"", it added.
The authority also noted that disinformation, which involves intentionally spreading false information to influence politics or sow discord, was continuing to target Australians. Facebook had removed four disinformation campaigns in Australia from 2019 to 2020, it said.
It said conspiracy groups often urged people to join smaller platforms with looser moderation policies, like Telegram. If those platforms rejected industry-set content guidelines ""they may present a higher risk to the Australian community"", the ACMA said.
The crackdown adds another element to the ruling conservative government's assertion that it has taken a big stick approach to tech giants, as it faces an election that is due by May that most polls suggest it will lose.
Fletcher said the new powers for the regulator would be introduced to parliament in late 2022, meaning it would likely be up to the current opposition Labor party to shepherd them through if the government loses the election.

A spokesperson for Labor's shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Reuters the opposition supported the expanded powers but the government had taken too long to introduce them since they were recommended in 2019.
DIGI, an Australian industry body representing Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Twitter and video site TikTok, said it supported the recommendations and noted it had already set up a system to process complaints about misinformation.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Monday, with sentiment dented by higher oil prices and as the conflict in Ukraine rages on.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.8% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%.
The conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 is entering its fifth week. Diplomacy efforts are ongoing, with Turkey's foreign minister stating on Sunday that the two sides were nearing agreement on ""critical"" issues, but the fighting continues, particularly around the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
U.S. President Joe Biden is set to arrive in Brussels on Thursday for summits with the members of NATO, as well as the European Union governments to discuss their response to Russia’s aggression. Ahead of this the EU will meet to consider whether to join the United States in imposing an oil embargo on Russia.
The West has already imposed a number of punishing sanctions on Moscow for its invasion, including a freezing of the assets of the Russian central bank. These moves have yet to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the fighting, and the obvious next move is for the bloc to target Russian oil.
This would be an economically tough choice, as the EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany the most dependent of the bloc's large economies.
Oil prices jumped Monday as a result, while a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities also caused supply jitters with the  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) refinery joint venture in Yanbu seeing a temporary drop in output. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% higher at $106.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $111.11.
Oil prices recorded a second consecutive weekly decline last week, but hit the highest levels in 14 years two weeks ago, boosted by the supply crunch from traders avoiding Russian barrels and dwindling oil stockpiles. 
In economic news, German producer prices rose again in February, climbing 1.4% on the month and a massive 25.9% on the year, putting inflation firmly to the fore of investors' thinking ahead of a speech by ECB President Christine Lagarde later Monday.
Looking at the corporate sector, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) could be in focus, and the German car manufacturer’s Chinese unit said on Monday it will form joint ventures with Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan Group, in a bid to control battery costs at a time of surging raw material prices.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,923.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1043."

Until recent weeks relatively unscathed by coronavirus, Shanghai reported 24 new domestically transmitted COVID cases with confirmed symptoms for Sunday and 734 local asymptomatic infections, official data showed on Monday.
It is the fourth consecutive day that Shanghai's local asymptomatic infections have increased. 
Although the tally of infections is tiny by global standards, Shanghai has quickly followed China's ""dynamic clearance"" policies, shutting schools and testing residential compounds in the effort to limit the spread of the virus.
""When it comes to the entire situation of epidemic control and prevention that we are facing, it is very complex and serious, and it is also a very big test for us,"" city health official Wu Jinglei told a news briefing. 
Shanghai will stick with ""dynamic clearance"", Wu added, saying he hoped for continued public support for the policy.
The city also shut the Shanghai Disney Resort from Monday until further notice.
But there were signs of frustration with the city's ad hoc, district-by-district approach.
""Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen have had three different epidemic response models,"" said a user of China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) network.
""Hong Kong is the worst but will be the first to open up,"" the writer, going by the name zangyn, said in a widely shared post. ""Shenzhen is the most effective, and Shanghai may be the most tiring, and even the most miserable.""
The severity of outbreak responses by Shanghai's compounds and residential districts varied, with some opting for lockdowns as long as two weeks. Some people in other sealed-off districts said they were not told how long they would have to stay home. 
Residents' committees helping to organise testing programmes also encountered challenges. One compound distributed tokens to foil outsiders' attempts to take free tests. 
Including Shanghai infections, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed, up from 1,656 a day earlier.
The top steelmaking city of Tangshan, with just 12 local infections since March. 19, is allowing only essential vehicles on roads smaller than expressways, while people with special needs who must use vehicles have to seek approval.
The southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen has allowed work and production activities, as well as bus and subway services in most areas, to resume after daily local case numbers dropped following three rounds of city-wide testing. 
Tight curbs remain in some places, however. 
Shenzhen residents still need to show negative tests in order to use public transport from Monday until March 27, a period in which non-essential indoor services will stay closed, the city government has said. 
Vaccine candidates to target Omicron specifically, or among variants of concern, are in studies prior to clinical trials, a national health official said on Saturday, without identifying the companies involved.

China's new local asymptomatic cases, which it does not classify as confirmed cases, was 2,384, up from 2,177 a day earlier. The death toll was unchanged at 4,638, with no new deaths.
By Sunday, mainland China had reported 132,226 cases with confirmed symptoms, both among locals and arrivals from outside.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.31% by 10:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.96%. The People’s Bank of China stuck to expectations, keeping the one-year loan prime rate at 3.70% and the five-year LPR at 4.60%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.05%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.27%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.15%, with the country banning alumina exports to Russia.
Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
In the U.S., S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts retreated. This, alongside the moves in Asia Pacific, indicated that global equities were taking a breather from their best weekly performance in about 16 months.
The question for this week is whether they will maintain the rebound and slight dip in volatility from the previous week. China’s vow to support its markets and economy is also providing a small boost.
The conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 is entering its fifth week. Although Turkey said Russia and Ukraine are moving closer towards talks for a cease-fire, Russia issued an ultimatum for the surrender of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
It also continued to have an impact on the bond market, alongside the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent monetary policy tightening. The Treasury yield curve is flattening, with portions inverted, a potential warning of an economic slowdown. There is no cash trading in Asia due to the Japanese holiday.
While markets are deriving hope from the peace talks, “the truth is a bit more complex because, unfortunately, we have major devastation going on,” Mizuho Bank Ltd. head of economics and strategy Vishnu Varathan told Bloomberg. “Uncertainty remains elevated,” he added.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak later in the day, alongside Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. This comes less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates as it handed down its latest policy decision.
However, “our concern is that the Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown as it prioritizes high inflation,” Manulife Investment Management head of macro strategy for Asia Sue Trinh told Bloomberg.
“We think it will balance that trade-off of slower growth, higher inflation by lagging the market pricing in terms of the pace, the magnitude, and the duration of this tightening cycle,” she added.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the BIS Innovation Summit 2022 on Tuesday, with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and Powell following a day later.

Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) had announced plans in December to buy Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT), seeking to create the seventh largest real estate investment trust (REIT) in Asia with an expected market value of about S$10.5 billion.
The two REITs said in a joint statement on Monday that MNACT unitholders would now have the option to choose consideration in cash, in addition to the prior offer for MCT units or a combination of both cash and MCT units.
The value of the merger remained unchanged at S$1.1949 per MNACT unit, they said. However, the inclusion of the cash option will result in an additional cash requirement of up to S$2.2 billion, which will be funded through a preferential offering to MCT unitholders at an issue price of S$2.0039 per MCT Unit.
Last month, Reuters had reported that activist investor Quarz Capital Management was opposed to the terms of the proposed merger, saying MNACT was significantly undervalued.

Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd, the global real estate conglomerate owned by Singapore state investor Temasek, is the single largest unitholder in both the trusts, owning 32.6% of MCT and 38.1% of MNACT, as of Dec. 29.

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee with defrauding the iPhone maker out of more than $10 million in a series of schemes.
Dhirendra Prasad faces five criminal counts after exploiting his ""position of trust"" as a buyer in Apple's global service supply chain to defraud the company, according to filings on Friday with the federal court in San Jose, California.
Prosecutors said that as an Apple buyer, Prasad negotiated with vendors and placed orders, with Apple making payments based on invoice amounts he entered into its purchasing system.
Prasad allegedly defrauded Apple by taking kickbacks, stealing parts using false repair orders, and causing Apple to pay for items and services it never received
Prosecutors said Prasad also evaded taxes on and laundered proceeds from his schemes. Apple fired him in December 2018 after a decade of employment, court papers show.
It is unclear whether Prasad has a lawyer. Prasad could not immediately be reached on Sunday for comment. A phone number listed for him has been disconnected.
Two owners of vendors that did business with Apple and who allegedly conspired with Prasad on similar fraud schemes pleaded guilty to related charges in December, court records show.

Prasad faces charges including conspiring to commit wire and mail fraud, commit money laundering and defraud the United States, as well as tax evasion.
His arraignment is scheduled for March 24. Prosecutors also want Prasad to forfeit millions of dollars of real property and other assets.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco (SE:2222), under pressure from the West to boost output amid soaring prices, pledged on Sunday to hike investments by around 50% this year as it reported a doubling in 2021 profits.
Oil prices leapt 50% last year as demand recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, and then surged above $100 a barrel to 14 year highs in February after Russia invaded Ukraine, leading Western nations to urge major producers to increase output. 
Aramco said it would boost its capital expenditure (capex) to $40-50 billion this year, with further growth expected until around the middle of the decade. Capex was $31.9 billion last year, up 18% from 2020 - indicating an increase of about 50% for this year at the middle of the guidance range. 
Asked if Aramco would pump more oil to fill any gaps in the market left by the war in Ukraine, CEO Amin Nasser said it would produce according to guidelines from the Saudi energy ministry.
The company has said it plans to raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, and wants to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030. Its average hydrocarbon production was 12.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day last year.
Aramco made $110 billion in net profit in 2021, up from $49 billion a year earlier and compared with analysts' mean estimate of $106 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
With a rise in both output and prices, analysts expect net profit to reach $140 billion in 2022.
Aramco's shares rose over 4% in early trade to a high of 43.85 riyals, valuing it at 8.76 trillion riyals ($2.34 trillion).
A $2 trillion valuation was a goal sought by de-facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before the company's record $29.4 billion initial public offering in 2019. 
He has announced plans to sell more Aramco shares. 
The surge in Aramco's valuation on Sunday moved it above that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), though it remains behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $2.68 trillion.
The Saudi government said last month that Crown Prince Mohammed, who is leading a huge investment drive to diversify the kingdom's economy, had transferred 4% of Aramco shares to the country's sovereign wealth fund.
BOOSTING CAPEX 
""They are ramping up the reinvestment quite substantially and they are likely to use (the free cash flow) to de-lever the balance sheet,"" said Yousef Husseini, head of the materials team at EFG Hermes Research.
Aramco said its free cash flow was $107.5 billion last year, compared with $49.1 billion in 2020. It declared a dividend of $75 billion for 2021, in line with its earlier pledge. 
The company said it also planned to develop a significant hydrogen export capability and become a global leader in carbon capture and storage technology.
Nasser told an earnings call that global oil demand was growing healthily and spare production capacity was declining.

In a separate statement he said ""although economic conditions have improved considerably, the outlook remains uncertain due to various macro-economic and geopolitical factors.""

The Western Cape division of the High Court interdicted the project developer from continuing with works at the Cape Town site until there had been meaningful engagement and consultation with affected indigenous peoples.
""This matter ultimately concerns the rights of indigenous peoples .... The fundamental right to culture and heritage of indigenous groups, more particularly the Khoi and San First Nations Peoples, are under threat in the absence of proper consultation,"" Judge Patricia Goliath said in her ruling. 
The Khoi and the San were the earliest inhabitants of South Africa, the latter roaming as hunter gatherers for tens of thousands of years, and the former joining them as pastoralists more than 2,000 years ago.
Some of their descendants had objected to the River Club development, where Amazon would be the ""anchor tenant"" but which also includes plans for a hotel, retail offices and homes, as it lies at the confluence of two rivers considered sacred, the Black and Liesbeek Rivers.
Not everyone identifying with the Khoi and San was against the project. An association of Khoi and San who supported it was among the respondents in the case.
Amazon was not named as a respondent, and the company did not respond to an emailed request for comment sent outside office hours. When the court case was launched early this year a spokesperson declined comment.
Goliath said her ruling should not be construed as a criticism of the development but that the core issue was that there needed to be proper consultation before it could go ahead.

Amazon already employs thousands of people in data hubs in Cape Town, and with over a third of South Africans unemployed authorities are keen to encourage foreign investment.
Construction of the River Club development had continued despite the case being before the court.

""We are monitoring the situation closely and expect the parties to keep working until they reach an agreement,"" he said in a tweet just after midnight.
Canada, the largest country by area after Russia, depends heavily on rail to move commodities and manufactured goods to port. CP's network runs across much of southern Canada and extends as far south as Kansas City in the United States. 
The lockout is the latest blow to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that washed out track and suspended access to Canada's biggest port. CP has said a stoppage would disrupt the movement of grain, potash and coal.
CP had notified the union on Wednesday that it would lock out employees on Sunday, barring a breakthrough in talks on a deal covering pensions, pay and benefits.
It said the key bargaining issue is the union's request for higher pension caps. Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani told a New York investor conference on Tuesday that the railway was unwilling to accept that demand.

Canada's  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) said this week it may need to reduce potash production at its mines in the province of Saskatchewan if the shutdown lasts longer than a few days.
The country's last major railway labor disruption was an eight-day Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co strike in 2019. But in the past 12 years, there have been 12 stoppages due to poor weather, blockades or labor issues, according to the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

By Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Western companies that maintain a presence in Russia to provide essential goods such as food and medicines are trying to strike a balance between President Vladimir Putin's government and advocates of Ukraine pulling them in opposite directions. 
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since the launch of its attack on Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to a list compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. They have left behind assets that were worth hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate before the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
Yet about 80 companies have retained a presence, even as they suspended new investments and business ventures. Many are consumer and pharmaceutical companies that argue that pulling out would significantly harm the Russian population. Some are also concerned about legal repercussions for their employees in the country should the Russian government retaliate. 
""Companies believe they can't easily abandon small Russian businesses and consumers that rely on them,"" said Bruce Haynes, global co-chair of crisis communications at public relations firm SVC+FGH who has been advising companies on their withdrawal from Russia.
Consumer goods giants such PepsiCo Inc, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) have said they will retain a presence in Russia to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene, such as milk and diapers.
With casualties and refugees from the conflict in Ukraine mounting, pressure is building to pull out of Russia completely.
""Barring a turnaround we don't see right now, the pressure (to pull out) is going to grow,"" said BSR Chief Executive Aron Cramer, who advises companies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues.
Katie Denis, communications and research lead at the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that counts  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and P&G among its members, said its members by-and-large did not support Russia's actions in Ukraine, but that uninvolved Russian people should not be made to suffer for it.
Pharmaceutical companies such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have said they will halt non-essential operations in Russia but plan to continue supplying medications for diseases such as diabetes and cancer. They have noted that prescription medicines have been excluded from international sanctions because they serve an essential humanitarian need. However, in recent days, even those goods have come under scrutiny.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week urged pharmaceutical companies to join conglomerates withdrawing from Russia completely. Sonnenfeld, whose list has been seized on by human rights activists to pressure global companies to leave Russia, has also called for such a move.
Some drug companies have backing from their shareholders. Josh Brockwell, for example, an executive at investment firm Azzad Asset Management, said he supported Pfizer's decision to keep supplying Russia. ""I don't think the people should suffer for the actions of the (Russian) government,"" he said.
Many U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies say they do not make drugs in Russia, but some European peers, including Switzerland's Novartis SA, maintain manufacturing plants in the country.
CARVING OUT RUSSIA PROFITS
Putin said last week Russia could seize assets of companies that abandon their operations in the country. Russian prosecutors have also warned some Western companies that their employees could face arrests if they shut down production of essential goods, a person familiar with the matter said.
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Chief Marketing Officer Kingsley Wheaton told Reuters last week that exiting its business or stopping the sale or manufacturing of its products would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia that could expose its staff in the country to prosecution. 
Other challenges consumer companies still operating in Russia face are processing transactions under banking sanctions and securing raw materials, said Jack Martin, a fund manager at Oberon Investments, which has stakes in Unilever (NYSE:UL),  Diageo  (LON:DGE), Burberry, GSK, Eli Lilly and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
""The risk premium around investing in companies that do business in Russia has increased,"" Martin said.
Companies are trying to come up with ways to appease all sides. Pfizer and Eli Lilly, for example, said they would set aside for humanitarian relief any profits from sales in Russia. Novartis and Bayer have each pledged millions of dollars for Ukraine relief. 
Some companies are staying in Russia while seeking parties to buy or take over their local operations. British America Tobacco's Wheaton said his company was trying to do this ""rapidly."" Interested parties could include its Russian distributor of 30 years, Wheaton said.
Many companies are also concerned about what would happen to their facilities in their absence. An abandoned food plant, for example, could be repurposed by Russia to supply troops fighting in Ukraine.
Some investors want companies to consider how they may be indirectly funding the war by paying taxes. Hannah Shoesmith, director of engagement at asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), told Reuters last week companies need to ""think carefully"" about any taxes they are paying to the Russian government and if the products and services they are providing are worth that risk. 

Companies that left Russia may find it difficult to reclaim their property and assets once they are expropriated. Tiffany Compres, a partner with law firm FisherBroyles, said companies may sue Russia in international venues such as the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, but such cases can drag on for years and Russia cannot be forced to pay out.
""Even if the company wins the claim, Russia has a reputation for not paying,"" Compres said.

The fund voted against the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to break itself up by spinning off its devices business, a voting record showed.
It owns 1.22% of Toshiba, according to Refinitiv.
Similarly, the State Board of Administration of Florida, with a 0.22% stake in Toshiba, voted against the management-backed break-up plan and in favour of the proposal from Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners.
Even though their stakes are small, support from such prominent institutional investors for 3D's proposal could add momentum to activist shareholder demands that the board fully explore alternatives to the break-up.
Earlier this week, one of Toshiba's external board directors said he would back 3D's proposal, breaking ranks with the public stance of the company board's.
Toshiba has said there is no change in the board's opinion in opposing the shareholder proposal and that it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.

Glass Lewis, an influential proxy advisory firm, has backed 3D's proposal but rival Institutional Shareholder Services has not recommended voting for it even though it is opposed to the spin-off plan.
Explaining the rational for its vote, Norway's fund - operated by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) - said it considers such factors as whether there is sufficient transparency and whether all shareholders are treated equitably when evaluating corporate transactions.

Judge Hiram Puig-Lugo of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss the complaint filed last year by Washington D.C. attorney general Karl Racine.
""We believe that the Superior Court got this wrong, and its oral ruling did not seem to consider the detailed allegations in the complaint and a recent decision of a federal court to allow a nearly identical lawsuit to move forward,"" the Office of the Attorney General spokesperson said in an emailed statement, adding that the office was considering its legal options.
The decision did not state a reason for dismissing the case. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

Racine alleged the online retailer's policy could make prices for a given product more expensive on platforms that compete with Amazon, since its prices include fees that can run as high as 40% of the total price.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund exited its bet on General Motors (NYSE:GM) self-driving car subsidiary Cruise as the auto giant upped the ante, investing another $3.45 billion in the loss-making unit. 
SoftBank's departure, which comes as the Japanese conglomerate struggles with debts, prompted questions from sector watchers about whether Cruise is ready to generate meaningful revenue for the time being, and how deep GM might have to dig to fund development.
GM said on Friday that it has agreed to pay $2.1 billion to buy the SoftBank Vision Fund stake in Cruise, and to make a separate $1.35 billion investment in the unit that SoftBank had committed to make in 2018. 
Combined, the transactions will bring GM's stake in Cruise to 80%, GM said. Other remaining shareholders in Cruise include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Honda Motor Co.
In 2018, SoftBank invested $900 million in Cruise and said it would invest another $1.35 billion when Cruise's autonomous vehicles were ready for commercial deployment, potentially bringing its stake to 20%. 
As recently as last month, Cruise said SoftBank would invest the $1.35 billion in the company as outlined in 2018.
A person briefed on the matter said SoftBank, including follow-on fundraising rounds after 2018, invested about $1.2 billion in Cruise in total. The person declined to be identified because the information was not public.
The SoftBank exit comes as Cruise awaits a regulatory permit to allow it to charge riders for a driverless ride-hailing service launched in San Francisco. 
""Based on the experience that we have seen from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo in Arizona, the revenue that you will generate from that deployment will be very, very small,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, referring to a project developed by the parent of Google.
""It is a long road ahead,"" he said, adding that GM and partners like Honda may have to ""dig deep into their pockets"" to fund the unit for the time being. 
SoftBank has its own internal problems to deal with. 
The value of marquee companies in the tech investor's portfolio have tumbled, hit by China's crackdown on tech companies, the prospect of higher interest rates and war in Ukraine.
""We will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said last month, as he pivots from the collapse of the sale of chip designer Arm to a plan to list it in the United States.
SoftBank declined to comment on the Cruise exit. 
In a statement, GM CEO Marry Barra said, ""GM is leveraging the strength of its balance sheet to capitalise on the opportunity to increase its equity investment in Cruise and advance our integrated autonomous vehicle strategy.""
Kyle Vogt, CEO and co-founder of Cruise, said in a series of tweets that Cruise would begin allowing employees to sell vested shares to GM once a quarter in an effort to give financial flexibility to employees.
Going public would be ""a major distraction, especially right now,"" he said, adding he wanted the company focused on scaling up the driverless ride-hail service launched in San Francisco. 
In December, GM announced that Dan Ammann, then chief executive of Cruise, was abruptly leaving the company. One person briefed on the matter said he was dismissed, while another source said he and GM disagreed over when to take Cruise public. 

Barra previously downplayed the need for a quick Cruise public offering. 
GM spokesman David Caldwell said the latest deal showed GM's belief in Cruise and simplified the ownership structure. He said that other shareholders in Cruise including Microsoft, Walmart and Honda, had technology partnerships, such as a delivery project with Walmart.

Canada's second-biggest railroad operator notified the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference on Wednesday that it would lock out 3,000 engineers, conductors and yard workers early on Sunday, barring a breakthrough in talks on a deal covering pensions, pay and benefits.
""The negotiations are difficult and the parties are far apart,"" Teamsters Canada said in a statement, adding that discussions were resuming in Calgary late on Friday afternoon in the presence of a mediator.
Canadian Pacific in an emailed statement to Reuters said that in hopes of avoiding a labor disruption, ""CP will continue to bargain in good faith with the TCRC leadership to achieve a negotiated settlement or enter binding arbitration.""
Thousands of workers at CP threatened to strike this week, potentially disrupting the movement of grain, potash and coal at a time of soaring commodity prices.

The company says the main issue is the union's demand for higher pension caps, while the Teamsters also flag concerns about pay and benefits.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets gained on Friday after traders cheered a Russian bond payment that averted a historic sovereign default, while gold prices dropped as demand for the safe-haven metal eased following the start of the U.S. interest rate hike cycle.
The Russian finance ministry announced on Thursday that it had sent funds to cover $117 million in coupon payments on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds that came due this week.
The payments calmed investor worries that a Russia sovereign default, which would have been its first in a century, could rattle already nervous markets. Western sanctions have hobbled Russia's financial dealings since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
""If you think about where we could have been if Western governments had disallowed the use of frozen funds for coupon payments on Russian sovereign bonds, we would be sitting on a default of a world economy,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Virginia.
""As a result of that, some of the biggest impacts to the global financial system are being put off into the future - that's good.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stormed back this week after absorbing a long-awaited rate hike from the Federal Reserve, leaving investors to determine whether stocks are set for a sustained rebound or more turbulence. 
Following a months-long drubbing, the S&P 500 delivered its best weekly gain since November 2020 as investors cheered increased clarity on monetary policy and an encouraging assessment of the U.S. economy from the Fed. The surge cut the index’s year-to-date losses by nearly half, though it is still down 6.7% for 2022 after falling into a correction last month.
Whether to hop on board the rally is a thorny question in a market that still faces its share of risks – chief among them the hawkish rate hike path the Fed unveiled on Wednesday and geopolitical uncertainty over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Still, some big banks believe the worst may be over, for now. Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management on Friday said the projected pace of Fed tightening is “consistent with rising stocks” and advised clients to remain invested in equities.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) earlier in the week forecast the S&P 500 would end the year at 4,900, about 10% above Friday’s close, saying that markets “have now cleared the much-anticipated Fed liftoff with policy likely as hawkish as it gets."" 
Others are less sanguine. Worries that the Fed’s fight against inflation could bruise growth were apparent in the bond market, where a flattening of the yield curve accelerated after the Fed's policy meeting this week. An inverted yield curve, in which yields of shorter-term government bonds rise above those of longer-term ones, has been a reliable predictor of past recessions.
Stubborn inflation, sky-high commodity prices and few signs of an end to the war in Ukraine further cloud the picture for investors, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments. 
“The markets are more complicated now by interest rates, they are more complicated by inflation, and they are definitely more complicated by the Russian situation,” he said. “You had a lot of people in this week who thought we made a bottom, but it’s difficult to keep having higher and higher prices just based on that.” 
Many also believe the week’s sharp gains in stocks are unlikely to quiet the economic concerns that fanned bearish sentiment in recent months. 
Fund managers' allocation to cash stand at their highest levels since April 2020, according to BofA Global Research's monthly survey. Bearish sentiment among retail investors is close to 50%, the latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed, well above the historic average of 30.5%. 
""The thing we are most concerned about right now ... is really a question of whether we are going to go into a recession or not,” said King Lip, chief strategist at BakerAvenue Asset Management. 
Wary of a potential ""stagflationary"" environment of slowing growth and rising inflation, Lip's firm is investing in energy shares, commodities and precious metals such as gold ETFs or gold-mining stocks. 
Cresset Capital Management is recommending that clients underweight equities and raise their exposure to gold, which is viewed as a safe-haven asset, said Jack Ablin, Cresset's chief investment officer. 
“We see certainly a pretty aggressive Fed that has really made inflation-fighting its number one priority and not necessarily protecting equity market values,” Ablin said. 
To be sure, signs of rampant pessimism – such as high cash levels and dour sentiment -- are often seen as contrarian indicators that are positive for equities. Indeed, hedge funds tracked by BoFA Global Research were recently piling into cyclical stocks, which tend to thrive when economic growth is strong. 
“Despite weakening optimism on global growth, clients do not appear to be positioning for a recession,” BoFA’s strategists wrote. 

Stocks historically have weathered rate-hike cycles fairly well. Since 1983, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 5.3% in the six months following the first Fed rate rise of a cycle, data from UBS showed. 
""The Fed’s goal remains to engineer a soft landing for the economy,"" the firm's analysts wrote. ""We advise investors to prepare for higher rates while remaining engaged with equity markets.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Friday, with the biggest boost from recently battered technology stocks, after talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping over the Ukraine crisis ended without big surprises. 
Investors were also relieved by slowing gains in oil prices as they continued to digest the Federal Reserve's Wednesday interest rate increase and its aggressive plan for further hikes aimed at combating soaring inflation.
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a call that there would be ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House said. Both sides stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
While Xi called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow, he did not assign blame to Russia for the invasion.
""The read out from the meeting was as expected,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York regarding the Xi/Biden talks. He said that since Russia/Ukraine talks were continuing, investors were tending toward optimism. 
""Regarding Russia, Ukraine, the market has been more positive on news from the diplomatic front than negative on the escalation."" 
Hogan also cited calmer oil prices and relief that the highly anticipated Fed news was finally out.
""Instead of having fears and trepidation of what the Fed might do we have clear roadmap for monetary policy,"" he said. 
In addition to less onerous than expected Fed actions, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) in Greenwich, Connecticut said investors were reassured that U.S. crude oil prices weren't too far above $100 on Friday after recently surpassing $130. [O/R] 
""At least for this week oil has found a level. That's someway positive for the market as a rising oil price is overweighted in consumer minds as an inflationary indicator,"" said Sosnick. ""Does the market like oil around $100? No. But is it happier that it's around $100 than going up $20 every day? Of course.""
Investors were also monitoring for any impact from Friday's ""triple witching,"" in which investors unwind positions in futures and options contracts before they expire, which can lead to volatility and trading volume.
On Friday the expirations appeared to boost volume as 18.47 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 14.56 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.

Wall Street's three main indexes boasted their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020 with the S&P adding 6.2% while the Dow rose 5.5% and the Nasdaq jumping 8.2%.
Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed higher, with heavyweight technology and consumer discretionary both finishing up 2.2% while communication services rising 1.4%.
The only declining sector was utilities which ended the session down 0.9%. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc closed up 6.3% after the drugmaker submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow for a second booster of its COVID-19 vaccine.

But shares in U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) slumped almost 4% after a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of U.S. lawmakers led by House Oversight chair Carolyn Maloney asked Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp if it sought to avoid using union workers by deciding to build the next-generation U.S. Postal Service delivery vehicles in South Carolina.
Maloney and three other lawmakers want documents by April 1 from Oshkosh detailing the decision not to build the vehicles in Wisconsin and want the company to explain how quickly and how many electric delivery vehicles it can build.
The 10-year contract with Oshkosh's Defense unit makes an initial $482 million investment, but it could be worth $6 billion or more for the unit to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
Oshkosh said Friday it concluded South Carolina ""would best meet the needs of this important program"" and added hiring and facility preparations are well underway ""to ensure Oshkosh will meet contractual deadlines for vehicle production to begin in 2023.""
The United Auto Workers union and some Democrats in Congress have been extremely critical of Oshkosh's decision to build the vehicles in South Carolina.
""Workers and the environment are relying on USPS and the Biden administration to take every possible step to ensure public dollars protect our next generation,"" UAW President Ray Curry said last month.
On Monday, Maloney and four other lawmakers asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) to review USPS's plan to buy a new fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles from Oshkosh, a plan that has come under fire from the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The inspector general's office said Thursday it ""will be doing additional work in response to that request."" OIG said in a report https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2022/RISC-WP-22-003.pdf that EVs could be a ""good option"" on many USPS routes.

USPS said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""
Oshkosh said Friday it can make any mix of vehicles USPS wants - up to 100% electric models.

STOCKHOLM/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Thousands of telecom operator Veon employees are working from bomb shelters in Ukraine and moving equipment to border areas to maintain a digital lifeline for refugees fleeing the war, the company's chief executive said on Friday.
Their work has helped some 85% of Veon's telecom network remain operational in Ukraine since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, Veon CEO Kaan Terzioglu said in an exclusive interview with Reuters. But further risks loom both from electricity shortages and the conflict itself.
Amsterdam-listed Veon operates Ukraine's biggest cell phone provider under the name Kyivstar with 4,000 employees and a 25% market share.
Terzioglu, who spoke by Zoom conference call from the Netherlands, described how the company is coping with war, sanctions and financial concerns at the same time.
Terzioglu provided a lens through which one company is providing a phone network to a rapidly spreading diaspora.
Employees ""are practically working out of shelters and the moment they have the opportunity, they go out to the field to do maintenance,"" Terzioglu said.
The parts of the network which are not working were mostly because of loss of power and are not being targeted by Russian forces, he said. Getting these parts back up required workers to run gasoline to generators, which Terioglu described as ""one of the most logistically heavy jobs that our people are trying to do.""
Russia's attack, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize the country, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis. Russia denies targeting civilians in the country of about 44 million.
More than 3.2 million people have fled and an additional 2 million have been displaced internally, United Nations data showed.
On the basis of cell phone data, Terzioglu estimated that 4 million refugees had left, and 10 million were displaced.
Apart from opening up its offices as refugee shelters, Veon has also topped up mobile accounts without charge, said Terzioglu, who became Veon's group CEO last July. In his previous job as Turkcell CEO he grappled with the Syrian refugee crisis. 
Veon has also received support from American, Chinese and European companies in the tech and telecom industry. While operators such as Orange, Tele2 and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) have waived off interconnection and roaming charges, equipment makers such as Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) have been helping in network maintenance. These and companies including Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nokia (NYSE:NOK),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) have made a ""heroic effort"" to keep the networks running, Terzioglu said. 
RUSSIAN CONNECTION
Veon also owns the second-largest telecom network in Russia, operating under the name of Beeline, its most profitable market. That means Veon must navigate the impact of sanctions and political concerns on both sides of the border.
Veon has about 29,000 employees in Russia and the company has taken steps to operate its Ukraine and Russian businesses as separate from one another.
The company has also moved quickly to distance itself from Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, whose investment vehicle LetterOne holds a 47.9% stake in Veon, and an additional 8.3% economic stake through a Dutch foundation.
The European Union imposed sanctions on Fridman on Feb. 28, a decision he said he would fight.
Terzioglu said Fridman, who resigned from Veon's board Feb. 28 and LetterOne's board on March 3, now ""has no economic interest in LetterOne.""
LetterOne, which did not respond to a request for comment, said March 3 that Fridman's assets had been frozen and he had been stripped of shareholder rights.
Terzioglu said he could not speculate as to whether the company could eventually face EU sanctions or nationalization by the Russian government, but he hoped that it would be excluded on humanitarian grounds.
""We will do our best to position it as a service that is essential,"" he said.
Veon also faces financial worries, with its shares down 56% in the year to date, and its U.S. dollar denominated debt - $5.4 billion worth at the end of 2021 - trading at distressed levels. 
On March 4, Fitch downgraded the company's credit ratings to junk status, saying that together Russia and Ukraine accounted for 62% of 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $3.3 billion.
Russian capital controls and the war meant the company may not be able to move funds in or out of either country.
The company has issued several updates to reassure investors it remains liquid, with $2.1 billion in cash as of the end of February, of which $1.5 billion is in the Netherlands.

Terzioglu said he was aware of reports https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/veon-bondholders-enlist-advisors-ahead-of-planned-debt-talks-1.1739259 of a group of bondholders seeking talks and welcomed the opportunity to address them, though none have reached the company so far.
""Having them organized gives us the opportunity to explain why they should not be worried, and that we are well funded in terms of meeting our obligations,"" he said.

592,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 05:55PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia on Friday demanded that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on its YouTube video-sharing platform, a move that could presage an outright block of the service on Russian territory. 
The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said adverts on the platform were calling for the communications systems of Russia and Belarus' railway networks to be suspended and that their dissemination was evidence of the U.S. company's anti-Russian position. It did not say which accounts were publishing the adverts.
""The actions of YouTube's administration are of a terrorist nature and threaten the life and health of Russian citizens,"" the regulator said. 
""Roskomnadzor categorically opposes such advertising campaigns and demands that Google stop broadcasting anti-Russia videos as soon as possible.""
Google removed an advertisement that was flagged by the Russian government, according to a source familiar with the matter who declined to describe it.
The dispute was the latest in a series between Moscow and foreign tech firms over Ukraine.
YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally, is under heavy pressure from Russia's communications regulator and politicians. 
Outraged that Meta Platforms was allowing social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"", Moscow blocked Instagram this week, having already stopped access to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) because of what it said were restrictions by the platform on Russian media.
Russian news media including RIA and Sputnik quoted an unnamed source as saying YouTube could be blocked next week or as early as Friday. 
DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Friday wrote a fierce criticism of foreign social media firms, mentioning by name both Meta and YouTube, but he hinted that the door leading to their possible return to the Russian market would be left ajar.
""The 'guardians' of free speech have in all seriousness allowed users of their social media to wish death upon the Russian military,"" Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, wrote on the messaging app Telegram.
Medvedev said Russia has the necessary tools and experience to develop its own social media, saying the ""one-way game"" of Western firms controlling information flows could not continue.
""In order to return, they will have to prove their independence and good attitude to Russia and its citizens,"" he wrote. ""However, it is not a fact that they will be able to dip their toes in the same water twice."" 
VKontakte, Russia's answer to Facebook, has been breaking records for activity on its platform since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The site attracted 300,000 new users in the two weeks after Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" its neighbour.
On the day Instagram was blocked in Russia, VKontakte said its daily domestic audience grew by 8.7% to more than 50 million people, a new record.
Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications, pointed Russians to services that would help them move videos from YouTube to the domestic equivalent, RuTube. 
""It's not that I'm calling for everyone to immediately leave YouTube,"" he said on his Telegram channel. ""But, probably, in light of recent events it is worth following the principle of not keeping all your eggs in one basket."" 
He said earlier this week that YouTube may face the same fate as Instagram if it continues ""to act as a weapon in the information war"".

Russian tech entrepreneurs said this week they would launch picture-sharing application Rossgram on the domestic market to help fill the void left by Instagram.
In November, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Media launched Yappy as a domestic rival to video-sharing platform TikTok.

(Reuters) - U.S. booking sites including Vrbo, Hopper and KAYAK are seeing higher demand for spring and summer leisure travel as COVID-19 restrictions ease and travelers appear to be shrugging off added costs to plane tickets and road trips from rising fuel prices. 
""We are seeing strong booking activity for spring break and the beginnings of a very strong summer,"" said Jamie Lane, VP of research at AirDNA, which tracks the daily performance of over 10 million properties on vacation rental firms Airbnb and Vrbo.
Oil has soared over $100 a barrel as Russia's invasion of Ukraine jolted global markets. But U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airline Holdings Inc and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Inc this week reported a strong rebound in travel demand after the blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant.
AirDNA data said the booking pace for travel in the northern hemisphere spring is 49% higher than this time last year, and 26% higher than pre-pandemic 2019. 
""The rush to book summer vacation homes has further accelerated in 2022,"" said Vrbo in a statement earlier this month. The vacation rental booking platform reports demand for properties is already outpacing last summer by 15%.
""When reviewing the booking data, it's clear that Omicron was a bigger concern for travelers than rising fuel costs,"" said Dakota Smith, Chief Strategy Officer at Hopper, a travel booking app.
The app, which is popular among younger travelers, has seen a 50% increase in travel booking since fourth-quarter 2021.
Airline carriers are counting on strong demand to deal with the rising fuel costs. Some airlines intend to pass along a majority of that increase to customers.
""As gas prices reach record highs, jet fuel prices may not be far behind... this summer travel season may be a pricey one,"" said Paul Jacobs, GM and VP of KAYAK North America. Flight prices were up 17% last week compared to the same week in 2019, according to KAYAK.
The rising fuel costs will have less impact on domestic and short-haul flights, though, and indications are that the pandemic-era preference from U.S. travelers for those trips is continuing, and may remain while the war in Ukraine drags on, said Hopper's Smith.
Hopper said U.S. bookings to Europe have dropped from 21% of Hopper's international bookings to 15% since Feb. 12, with international bookings shifting toward Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. These locations now represent 61% of Hopper's international bookings, according to Smith. Europe accounted for approximately 30% of Hopper's international bookings in 2019.

Business travel and travel to urban locations has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, according to AirDNA.
Investors will also get another view on the recovery of leisure travel when Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp reports earnings on Tuesday. Carnival on average is expected to post a loss of $1.21 a share, while revenue soars to over $2 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - A lawsuit filed on Friday accuses Google of systemic racial bias against Black employees, saying the search engine company steers them to lower-level jobs, pays them less and denies them opportunities to advance because of their race.
According to a complaint seeking class-action status, Google maintains a ""racially biased corporate culture"" that favors white men, where Black people comprise only 4.4% of employees and about 3% of leadership and its technology workforce.
The plaintiff, April Curley, also said the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit subjected Blacks to a hostile work environment, including by often requiring they show identification or be questioned by security at its Mountain View, California campus.
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The complaint was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California.
It came after that state's civil rights regulator, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, began investigating Google's treatment of Black female workers and possible discrimination in their workplace.
Curley said Google hired her in 2014 to design an outreach program to historically Black colleges.
She said her hiring proved to be a ""marketing ploy,"" as supervisors began denigrating her work, stereotyping her as an ""angry"" Black woman and passing her over for promotions.
Curley said Google fired her in September 2020 after she and her colleagues began working on a list of desired reforms.
""While Google claims that they were looking to increase diversity, they were actually undervaluing, underpaying and mistreating their Black employees,"" Curley's lawyer Ben Crump said in a statement.
Crump is a civil rights lawyer who also represented the family of George Floyd after he was killed in May 2020 by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

Curley's lawsuit seeks to recoup compensatory and punitive damages and lost compensation for current and former Black employees at Google, and to restore them to their appropriate positions and seniority.
The case is Curley v Google LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01735.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so.
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the partner, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company.
Kolobov said in a statement to Reuters that he does not have the authority or power to decide whether to suspend restaurant operations.
Shear's long letter and Kolobov's response highlight the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators.
On March 8,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia.
Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. 
But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.
Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions.
Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement.
There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote.

""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No.""
Kolobov said he has never had control of operations since the joint venture formed in 2012. He controls 30% of the partnership and said the decision to suspend operations ""must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have"" on approximately 25,000 employees.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Friday to post its best week since November 2020, led by tech as the broader market shrugged off Federal Reserve officials calling on the central bank to get even more aggressive on rate hikes that many fear could slow the economy too much.
The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%, or 273 points, the Nasdaq rose 2.1%. The gains ensured that all three major averages posted their best week in 16 months. 
Tech continued its comeback to remain on course to snap a two-week losing streak as investors continued to pile into big tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) led the pack up more than 4%, followed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) up more than 2%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), were up more than 1% each.
Chip stocks were also in the ascendency, supported by a more than 6% gain in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker extended its rally for a fourth straight day.
Growth sectors of the market like tech were also helped by falling interest rates even as Fed officials urged the central bank to do even more.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday called on the Fed to consider more aggressive rate hikes and get balance sheet reduction underway to make a dent in the pace of the inflation.
The remarks arrived on the heels of remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who suggested the Fed hike rates by 50 basis points several times this year to push the central bank’s benchmark rate to 3% by year end.
That would be well above the Fed’s current outlook for rates to reach about 1.9% by year end.
Industrials struggled to join in on the broader market rally pressured by weakness in defense stocks and a slump in FedEx.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell 4% after reporting quarterly results that missed both the top and bottom lines as higher labor costs hurt results.
Defense stocks including Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) and L3Harris Technologies Inc (NYSE:LHX) ended in the red as investors appeared to be pricing in the prospect of progress on Ukraine-Russia peace talks that could prove key to ending the war.
On the geopolitical front, President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping of ""consequences"" should Beijing support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. 
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) ended the day more than 3% higher despite delivering a surprise fourth quarter loss.
Stocks were expected to have a volatile end to the week as triple witching -- when stock options, stock index futures, and index option contracts expire on the same day -- usually triggers wild moves as investors move out of old positions and take new ones.
The rally in the broader market has stoked debate on whether this is the start of a bottoming process, or further downside lies ahead.
Market technicians, however, urge caution on reading too much into the rally as options expiry tends to muddy market movements. Technical indicators including volume and market breadth have yet to improve significantly to signal that the market is establishing a bottom.
“If this is the beginning of something more broad based, you’d want market breadth conditions to improve meaningfully … volume being strong as the price is going higher, but I think the jury's still out on that,""  Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.

Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, and Representative Katie Porter said both rental car firms appear to have used their market position to raise prices as expenses fell.

602,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 03:36PM ET</span>","(Corrects paragraph 8 to indicate that U.S. bankruptcy is primarily civil, not purely civil)
By Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) -As foreign companies seek to exit Russia over the war in Ukraine, they face the prospect that Russian bankruptcy law could be used to seize assets and even lead to criminal penalties.
Here is how that could work:
HOW DOES RUSSIA'S BANKRUPTCY LAW DIFFER FROM BANKRUPTCY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES? 
In the United States, bankruptcy laws are meant to give indebted companies a fresh start. 
Distressed companies in the United States usually enter bankruptcy willingly and the law lets them retain existing management and control over assets.
Russia's law, however, generally prioritizes the needs of creditors who are owed money. This means creditors, including the Russian government, can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy and oust its management.
Some legal experts said foreign companies fear Russian creditors could abuse that process to install leaders willing to sell their assets to business rivals or companies aligned with the Russian government.
""In the late 90s and early aughts, this was often used as the device to raid companies"" in post-Soviet Russia, said Paul Stephan, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and expert in the Soviet and post-Soviet legal systems. 
CAN A BANKRUPT COMPANY FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN RUSSIA?
Yes. In the United States, bankruptcy is primarily civil. But Russian courts have been more willing to pursue criminal penalties for some bankruptcy-related offenses, such as hiding assets.
Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc has expressed concern that its exit from Russia could be viewed as a criminal act that leads to bankruptcy-related charges for local management. 
It would not be the first time the Russian government has threatened criminal bankruptcy charges against foreign companies and investors. Russia has repeatedly asked Interpol to arrest money manager Bill Browder, alleging charges against him including deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion. 
Browder has said that the ""bogus warrants"" are part of a vendetta by corrupt officials in the Russian state. Interpol has not acceded to Russia's arrest demands. 
HAS RUSSIAN BANKRUPTCY LAW BEEN USED IN THE PAST TO PUNISH COMPANIES FOR POLITICAL REASONS? 
Yes. Tax debt has been used to drive companies into bankruptcy in Russia, in a way that penalizes foreign investors, according to an international arbitration court.
Yukos Oil was forced into bankruptcy in 2006 after its former chief, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fell out with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russian government demanded billions in back taxes. 
Most of Yukos' assets were absorbed by the Kremlin's flagship oil producer Rosneft, but international shareholders argued that the Russian tax demands were illegitimate. The Permanent Court of arbitration in The Hague agreed, finding in 2014 that the Kremlin had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt the company and take Khodorkovsky's assets. 
Since the Russian government owns major energy companies, it could use energy bills as well as taxes to force a company into bankruptcy, experts said.
""If the government was using that power strategically, it may well have the ability to influence local courts, to influence local managers, and force a sale of the company that would oust foreign owners,"" said Jason Kilborn, a law professor at University of Illinois Chicago. 
IS THERE A SAFE WAY FOR COMPANIES TO LEAVE RUSSIA?
For companies that want to leave Russia, Russian officials have suggested a ""fast-track"" bankruptcy procedure that would put local managers in charge of their assets and operations. 
Still, some businesses are concerned that Russian bankruptcy law will be used to retaliate against the companies that are leaving, experts said. 
""If the hammer really comes down, you just hope that you've gotten as many people as you have out of the country, and you've minimized your asset risk in the country,"" Stephan said.

Russia's ruling party has recently proposed legislation that would allow the government to nationalize the assets of certain companies intending to leave Russia.
That proposal would build on the bankruptcy law's procedure for installing court-appointed external management, but could be wielded against companies with no debt, experts said.

The company's shares, which were at the heart of the 2021 meme stocks saga, fell 7% in extended trading.
""The combination of supply chain issues and the Omicron variant had a sizable impact on this past year's holiday season,"" Chief Executive Officer Matt Furlong said on an earnings conference call.
Usually, the holiday quarter is a strong one for the company as new Xboxes and Playstations are launched and demand is high. But component shortages and other supply chain issues, which had hit console makers like  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), impacted GameStop's business.
Like many other retailers, GameStop has already suffered as the pandemic wreaked havoc with curbs leading to store closures. The spread of the Omicron variant further exacerbated the situation.
The company's net sales rose 6.2% to $1.88 billion, while its gross profit fell 15.7% during the quarter ended Jan. 29.
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter noted that the company's gross profit fell ""due to exceptionally poor gross margins.""
""It's likely that used game sales were low and lower margin than normal and that hardware sales were higher than normal.""
GameStop has also been ramping up spending to hire talent, expand capacity, grow its e-commerce presence and also introduce new products to boost its digital presence. 

The company on Thursday also said it intends to launch its marketplace for non-fungible tokens or NFTs by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
The company posted a net loss of $147.5 million, or $1.94 per share, during the quarter, compared with a profit of $80.5 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 climbed Friday, led by tech as the broader market shrugged off Federal Reserve officials calling on the central bank to get even more aggressive on rate hikes that many fear could slow the economy too much.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, or 63 points, the Nasdaq rose 0.7%.
Tech continued to its comeback to remain on course to snap a two-week losing streak as investors continued to pile into big tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) led the pack up more than 3%, following by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up more than 1% each.
Chip stocks were also in the ascendency, supported by a nearly 6% gain in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker extended its rally for a fourth straight day.
Growth sectors of the market like tech were also helped by falling interest rates even as Fed officials urged the central bank to do even more.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday called on the Fed to consider more aggressive rate hikes and get balance sheet reduction underway to make a dent in the pace of the inflation.
The remarks arrived on the heels of remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who suggested the Fed hike rates by 50 basis points several times this year to push the central bank’s rate to 3% by year end.
That would be well above the Fed’s current outlook for rates to reach about 1.9% by year end.
Industrials struggled to join in on the broader market rally pressured by weakness in defense stocks and a slump in FedEx.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell more than 5% after reporting quarterly results that missed both the top and bottom lines as higher labor costs hurt results.
Defense stocks including Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) and L3Harris Technologies Inc (NYSE:LHX) were down more than 2% as investors appeared to be pricing in the prospect of progress on Ukraine-Russia peace talks that could prove key to ending the war.
Stocks are expected to have a volatile end to the session as triple witching -- when stock options, stock index futures, and index option contracts expire on the same day -- usually triggers wild moves as investors move out of old positions and take new ones.
The rally in the broader market has stoked debate on whether this is the start of a bottoming process, or further downside lies ahead.
Market technicians, however, urge caution on reading too much into the rally as options expiry tends to muddy market movements. Technical indicators including volumes and market breadth have yet to improve significantly to signal that the market is establishing a bottom.
“If this is the beginning of something more broad based, you’d want market breadth conditions to improve meaningfully … volume being strong as the price is going higher, but I think the jury's still out on that,""  Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
“At at this point, I'm still thinking of it as a tradable bounce within a downtrend.” Keller added."

Investing.com --  Wingstop Inc  (NASDAQ:WING) fell Friday after Piper Sandler double downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight.
Analyst Nicole Miller Regan also slashed the price target on Wingstop by nearly 50%, going from $195 per share to $102. Regan said the price target cut reflects lower earnings estimates which mirror “a lower royalty rate, revised advertising expense ratio, higher interest expense, and higher tax rate.”
""We have taken time to review checks, refine our model, apply a macro overlay, and finally weigh the restaurant industry cycle against our rating,"" the analyst said.
Adding: ""We fully understand and respect the recent executive shift with no material concern, or impact on this assessment. We do, however, expect WING shares to experience resistance in terms of garnering the same premium multiple in the face of a restaurant industry expansion cycle.”
Wingstop shares fell 4% in early Friday trading. However, they have recouped most of those losses and now trade just 0.3% below yesterday's closing price.

608,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 02:10PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russian gas flows to Europe remain stable, but Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and voluntary actions by buyers are starting to impact its crude oil and oil product sales.
While only a few countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, have imposed outright bans, some buyers in Europe are shunning Russian oil to avoid reputational damage or possible legal troubles. 
Some 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and products may not find their way to market beginning in April, the International Energy Agency estimates.
Russian officials, however, expressed hope that supplies would remain stable, while oil exports and transit from the country's western ports and Druzhba pipeline were expected to rise in the second quarter. 
Following are actions announced by countries and major European energy companies:
WHO IS STILL BUYING RUSSIAN OIL?
BULGARIA
Neftochim Burgas refinery, owned by Russia's Lukoil , could use 100% non-Russian crude if need be, up from 40% currently, a government official said.
CHINA
China is the second-largest Russian oil importer after the European Union, and the IEA says seaborne shipments could even increase. Petro-Logistics, which monitors oil production, is seeing more Russian crude heading to China.
EUROPEAN UNION
The 27-member bloc, which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas and 27% of its crude imports, is split over curbing Russian intake but a plan to ditch Russian fossil fuels over the longer-term is expected by the end of May.
FRANCE
Russian crude oil accounted for 9.5% of total imports in 2021, but the French Association of Petroleum Industry (Ufip) said alternative supplies can be found, adding it is already moving away from Russian diesel.
GERMANY
Russian crude accounts for about 14% of intake at Germany's largest refinery, Miro.. 
Germany's PCK Schwedt refinery, 54% owned by Rosneft, is fed via the Druzhba pipeline, as well as the landlocked Leuna refinery, majority-owned by TotalEnergies.
HELLENIC PETROLEUM 
Greece's biggest oil refiner said Russian crude accounted for about 15% of its feed in the second half of 2021 but can be replaced. It has already secured additional supplies from Saudi Arabia.

Poland's largest refiner has said it is buying Russian crude for its refineries in Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, but was prepared for ""any scenario"", including a complete suspension of Russian supply.
TURKEY
Turkey has no plans to stop buying Russian crude and related products. It opposes sanctions on Moscow. Tupras is the largest refiner in Turkey.
WHO HAS STOPPED BUYING RUSSIAN OIL?
AMPOL

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts have slashed their forecasts for McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)'s 2022 and 2023 profit, the latest sign that some Western companies stand to take a financial hit as the costs of Russia's invasion of Ukraine grow.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Thursday said it now expects net profit from the fast food company of $9.25 a share for this year and $10.62 for 2023, reductions of 8% and 3%, respectively, from its prior view.
Earlier, the research firm Gordon Haskett cut its estimate by 5% in 2022 to $9.75 a share and by 3% for 2023 to $10.66 a share. 
McDonald's declined to comment on the moves.
The American burger chain - among the first to open in Moscow in the post-Soviet era - is paying for leases and wages for its 62,000 employees in Russia, despite starting to close 847 restaurants there, most of which it owns and operates. It is also paying wages for its Ukraine staff. 
The cost is expected to be $50 million a month, or at least $450 million through the end of this year. 
Stores in Russia and Ukraine - which are now shuttered - would normally generate operating profit of roughly $310 million annually, according to Gordon Haskett.
The Chicago-based company also faces potential hits to the value of its assets in Russia, whether through a mark down, sale to a local owner or government seizure, according to Morgan Stanley, which did not factor those into its lowered profit estimates.
The bank still finds McDonald's shares attractive because they can hold up in uncertain consumer environments.
McDonald's has more exposure to Russia than other global fast-food chains. It entered the country in 1990 and owns 84% of its restaurants there.
Other brands including  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Burger King are less exposed in Russia. Their restaurants are largely owned by independent operators under joint ventures and master franchisee agreements.
After McDonald's, Yum Brands Inc, parent to KFC and Pizza Hut, is most exposed. Russia and Ukraine account for about 3% of its consolidated operating income, Gordon Haskett analysts said. That is about $64 million based on 2021 figures, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data.
Morningstar analysts have not changed their forecasts for McDonald's or Yum. But on March 8, said they are concerned about higher fuel prices related to the war and the impact on consumer spending and restaurant margins.

McDonald's global operating income reached $10.4 billion in 2021, Refinitiv data showed.
While McDonald's has said the Russia closures are temporary, Gordon Haskett analysts said they believe the stores in Russia with the iconic golden arches will remain shuttered into 2023.

The company is the latest hotel chain and Western company to scale back plans or halt business in Russia.
""We continue to operate in some capacity as we play a key role in supporting employees and local communities,"" the company said in a statement.
Two agencies - the Ukrainian Hotel and Resort Association and the State Agency for Tourism Development of Ukraine - sent Radisson and six other global hotel chains an open letter on March 14 urging them to pause all operations in Russia as well as exit franchise and license agreements regardless of cost.

All Radisson Hotel Group properties in Russia are owned by third parties, the company added.
There are 38 Radisson Hotels in Russia listed on the company's booking site.

(Reuters) - A number of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers are considering quitting the app-based ride-hailing platforms as fueling up becomes costlier, with some calling the newly announced surcharges ""insulting"".
The companies announced this month a 55-cent per-ride surcharge that would be paid directly to drivers, in response to record gas prices because of the Ukraine crisis.
But Uber and Lyft drivers, who form a big chunk of the gig economy and typically pay for their own gas, are not happy.
A survey of over 300 drivers conducted by the Rideshare Guy, a popular blog followed by drivers, showed about 15% of them had already quit driving and nearly 40% were driving less.
""It's rather insulting that they even suggest 55 cents per ride because you have rides that are two minutes long and then you have rides that are an hour long,"" said Fabricio Lombeyda, a part-time driver in Buford, Georgia.
Uber and Lyft, however, have said the number of active drivers on their platforms is steadily rising, as people return to offices, book more rides to airports and nightlife resumes.
""We've not seen a decline in the number of drivers on the platform or the hours they drive when, for example, you compare March to January,"" Lyft said in a statement.
Lyft cited an internal analysis that showed drivers in the United States were spending on average of 75 cents more on gas per hour, but were still earning more per hour than they were a year ago, when the pandemic dimmed demand for rideshare.
Uber lifted its core profit forecast earlier this month on faster-than-expected growth in rideshare demand.
Both companies, however, face the prospect of drivers quitting as runaway fuel prices burn a hole in their pockets.
""There is some risk of driver departures, otherwise you would not have seen both Uber and Lyft institute surcharges,"" MScience analyst Michael Erstad said.
Another survey by Coworker.org that polled over 200 participants showed 90% agreed the surcharges were just not sufficient and that they would not be able to afford to take longer rides.
The business model of ride-hailing companies was based on gas being $3 per gallon, said David Marcotte, a senior vice president at data analytics firm Kantar.
But gas prices on Friday stood at $4.27 per gallon, even surpassing $5 a gallon in some parts of the country.
He also warned a rollback of the surcharge could cause more problems in an already strained labor market, making a loose connection to retail workers seeking better wages after the reversal of ""hero pay"" offered during the height of the pandemic.

For now, drivers are caught between a rock and a hard place.
""First and foremost, we have been trying to get higher wages per trip even before the gas prices went up. Now to insult us with this minimal amount is ridiculous,"" a participant in the Coworker survey said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday moved to effectively ground 100 airplanes that have recently flown to Russia and are believed to violate U.S. export controls, including a plane used by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich.
The list includes 99 Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes operated by Russian passenger and cargo carriers including Aeroflot, AirBridge Cargo, Utair, Nordwind, Azur Air and Aviastar-TU -- as well as Abramovich's Gulfstream G650 -- and could further hinder Russian efforts to continue some international flights.
Reuters first reported the planned action on Friday.
The Commerce Department warned companies and other entities around the world that any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services violate U.S. export controls and subject companies to U.S. enforcement actions that could include ""substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions,"" the department said.
The department said in a statement the action means ""international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded."" Officials told Reuters said it could also prevent domestic Russia flights because of U.S. enforcement actions that could target companies servicing planes in Russia.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando said in a statement the department is ""publishing this list to put the world on notice—we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.""
The department released specific tail numbers https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/03/commerce-department-identifies-commercial-and-private-aircraft-exported of the planes, including 33 Boeing planes operated by Aeroflot, and 12 Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by AirBridge Cargo, a unit of Russia's biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group.
Aeroflot and a spokesperson for Abramovich, who owns the English soccer club Chelsea did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Volga-Dnepr declined to immediately comment but said Friday it has suspended all flights using Boeing aircraft citing sanctions and a decision by Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority to terminate their safety certificates.
The United States, Canada and much of Europe have barred Russian planes from flying over their airspace, which has forced the cancellation of much of Russia's international flights.
The rules apply to any U.S. manufactured aircraft or any with more than 25% U.S.-origin controlled content that were re-exported to Russia after the new stringent controls on aviation-related items for Russia took effect on Feb. 24.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said in a statement the series of U.S. actions ""have isolated Russia and Belarus from the global economy, and I hope that today’s action brings that fact home to the Russian businesses and oligarchs that seek to continue their operations.""
This week, Reuters reported Russian airlines have weeks to orchestrate alternative supplies of banned aircraft parts or start grounding jets to avoid safety concerns as Western sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine threaten their post-Soviet revival.
Moscow took a first step this week towards keeping its commercial fleet flying by allowing its airlines to re-register leased planes in Russia, giving local authorities direct control over the certificates of airworthiness needed for each jet.
Western analysts say airlines may start stripping some of Russia's 500 foreign-leased jets within weeks or even days for parts while shopping around for genuine, but resold, parts from countries such as China.
Boeing said earlier this month it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said since March 2, based on publicly available information, it ""identified a number of commercial and private flights from third countries to Russia"" and could add more planes as it continues its review.
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod said the ""action lets Vladimir Putin’s enablers know that, as a consequence of their actions, they have fewer places to hide and fewer ways to get there.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell by the most in a year in February as a perennial shortage of houses and double-digit price growth continued to squeeze first-time buyers out of the market.
With mortgage rates rising above 4% for the first time in nearly three years, sales are likely to slow this year, though that would do little to curb house price inflation. Contracts to buy previously owned houses, a leading indicator of home sales, fell for three straight months through January.
""It will take a sharper drop in sales to bring the market back into balance and allow prices to increase at a more modest pace,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Existing home sales dropped 7.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.02 million units last month, the largest decrease since February 2021, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. 
Though the decline reversed January's jump, sales remained above their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decrease to a rate of 6.10 million units.
Sales fell in all four U.S. regions. Home resales account for the bulk of U.S. home sales. They dropped 2.4% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Mortgage rates surged in February, with the 30-year fixed rate approaching a three-year high, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). It averaged 4.16% in the week ending March 17, breaking above 4.0% for the first time since May 2019. 
Still low by historical standards, mortgage rates are set to increase further after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023.
""Home buyers have likely missed their opportunity to lock in ultra-low mortgage rates,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
But Vitner also noted that the 30-year conventional mortgage has been higher than its current level for more than 90% of the time over the past 30 years, which he said was ""an important reminder that home sales should remain fairly strong even if mortgage rates rise a bit further."" 
A separate report from the Conference Board on Friday showed a gauge of future U.S. economic activity rebounded in February, suggesting the expansion would persist despite tighter monetary policy and uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were largely lower.
TIGHT SUPPLY
Higher mortgage rates and rising homes prices amid a prolonged housing shortage will reduce affordability, especially for first-time buyers. The median existing house price increased 15% from a year earlier to $357,300 in February. House prices have increased on a year-on-year basis for a record 120 straight months.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities expects strong house price growth will continue this year and into 2023 because of tight supply.
Sales remained concentrated in the upper-price end of the market. Sales in the much sought after $100,000-$250,000 price range plunged 26.1% from a year ago.
According to the NAR, the typical monthly mortgage payment has surged 28% from a year ago, a huge burden for first-time buyers, who accounted for only 29% of sales last month. Economists and realtors say a 40% share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.
""Home prices inflating with higher interest rates together is a toxic brew that forces us to downgrade our forecast for housing sales later this year,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""More bad news is coming your way if you are actively trying to buy a new home."" 
There were 870,000 previously owned homes on the market in February, down 15.5% from a year ago. Supply is likely to remain tight as builders struggle with shortages and high prices for key materials like lumber, which is used for framing.
Data from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the backlog of homes yet to be build reached a fresh record high in February. A National Association of Home Builders survey this week showed homebuilder confidence dropped to a six-month low in March due to supply constraints and inflation. 
At February's sales pace, it would take 1.7 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

All-cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions last month, up from 22% a year ago. Individual investors or second-home buyers made up 19% of sales last month, up from 17% in February 2021. With supply tight, houses typically stayed on the market for 18 days last month, down from 20 days in February 2021. 
Eighty-four percent of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month.

Shares of the Chinese companies jumped on Friday, with ride-hailing firm Didi Global leading the gains with a 54% surge. Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) was trading up 21%, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com up 9%, Alibaba gaining 10% and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) up 6.3%. 
The iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund was up 5%.
On Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the economy and caution in introducing measures that risked hurting markets.
He said talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators on Chinese companies listed in the United States have made positive progress and regulators are working on specific cooperation plans. 
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday spoke on a two-hour video call about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Chinese media said Xi underlined that such conflicts are in no-one's interests. 
China's securities regulator said on Wednesday it would continue to communicate with U.S. regulators and strive to reach an agreement on China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation as soon as possible. 
Didi, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2021, has been the target of a probe by Chinese authorities who have asked it to take down its app from mobile app stores while its handling of customer data was under investigation.

Commenting on Didi's stock price surge on Friday, Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK said, ""This is a bit of a repricing of Didi because it really didn't move in the first couple of days of the rebound that we saw earlier this week."" 
S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Didi had reduced its short exposure over the last month, while its shares were shorted when its price weakened recently.

Sanctions have cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia. The United States and Europe have closed their airspace to Russian airlines, and Moscow has responded by imposing the same measure on them. 
Volga-Dnepr said in a statement it had stopped operations of two of its subsidaries - AirBridgeCargo and Atran - that use 18 Boeing 747 and 6 Boeing 737 airplanes due to sanctions and a decision by Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA) to terminate their safety certificates.
""The management of Volga Dnepr has made a conscious decision to find a possible solution together with partners and state regulators,"" it said.

Volga-Dnepr, which describes itself as the world leader in the oversize and heavy cargo market, continues to fly Russian-made aircraft including An-124 and Il-76 cargo jets. 
Russia has passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place aircraft leased from foreign companies on Russia's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners.

(Reuters) - Wall Street is taking a gloomy view of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) ahead of its quarterly results on Monday, as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues threaten to hit the sportswear giant's 2022 sales.
At least 10 brokerages have cut the stock's price targets this week on fears that a lift from strong sneaker demand in North America will be offset by persistent shortages, stemming from factory closures in top supplier Vietnam last year.
Nike's current quarter is also expected to take a hit from stalling shopping traffic in China due to rising COVID infections and the decision to temporarily shutter stores and online business in Russia, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The recent rise in geopolitical uncertainty, increase in oil prices, and growing strength of the U.S. dollar present risk of slowing growth for Nike's international segments ahead,"" Jefferies analysts said.
THE CONTEXT
Earlier this month, Nike's main rival Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) Inc flagged a knock to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts cut their forecast for Nike's current-quarter revenue growth in Europe to 7% from 15%, largely due to an estimated 2% hit to total sales from the Russia exit.
Still, resilient demand despite higher prices and a pivot to selling more products directly to consumers are expected to ease the pressure of higher supply chain costs on Nike's margins. 
""There is still a lot of strength in the way that Nike is running its retail strategy, and in its product. Those two strategies are key for its future,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds, easing doubts about its willingness and ability to honour external debt after harsh sanctions imposed by the West, but a busy payment schedule ahead will keep investors on edge.
Failure to pay could have led to Russia's first external bond default in more than a century and was seen as a key test after the sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
On Friday, Russia's finance ministry said it had fully met its obligations. Sources involved in the multi-step process of the $117 million coupon payments also confirmed the funds were on their way to creditors.
Some European bond holders said they received funds due in U.S. dollars, while two creditors in Taiwan told Reuters the funds were in the process of being remitted.
""The payment on both coupons has been executed,"" one source familiar with the situation said. 
The coupons were due on Wednesday but Russia had a 30-day grace period for the payment, which must be received in full and in the right currency to avoid default.
News of the payment lifted Russian bond prices, with the 2043 bond, one of the issues on which a coupon had been due, rising to 45 cents in the dollar.
While trading volumes were thin, that marked a rise from a record low of 12 cents hit on March 8, Refinitiv data shows. 
Russia has around $40 billion of external bonds outstanding, half of which are held by foreign investors. It was not clear if domestic holders of the bonds, which include some of the country's biggest lenders, had received payments. 
However, this week's payments are the first of many Russia must make to preserve its complex web of external borrowing. 
It must pay another $615 million in coupons this month while on April 4, a hefty $2 billion bond must be repaid. In total, more than $4.5 billion in coupons and maturities are due by year-end. 
One complication is that Eurobonds placed after 2014 -- the year Russia first came under sanctions for annexing Crimea -- allow for payment in alternative currencies such as euros and pounds. 
And the next international coupon due March 21 is a $66 million payment on a 2029 dollar bond, which like others sold after 2018, lists the rouble as an alternative currency option. It too has a 30-day grace period.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Jonny Goulden said upcoming payments may treat investors differently ""either because those bonds are cleared via the Russian NSD settlement mechanism or because they have a rouble fallback as a payment currency, which the Russian government may look to pay in roubles.""
POST-MAY 24 BONDS
But questions have arisen on what happens to Russian bonds maturing after May 24. 
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general license 9A on March 2, authorising U.S. persons to receive dividends and bond payments on Russian securities from the finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund -- all of which are under sanctions. 
That exemption runs out on May 25, leaving in balance nearly $2 billion in external sovereign bond payments due until end-2022. 
Christopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard reckons the flow of money will continue, with further OFAC exemptions likely. 

""It's safe to say it will be remain manually controlled, intermediaries will be able to apply for exemptions and if Russia allows payments, why would they want U.S. creditors to suffer?"" Granville said.
""Also the payments will hurt Russia by eating into their hard currency reserves.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British American Tobacco Plc is in advanced talks to transfer its Russian business to Russia's SNS Group of Companies, its distributor, SNS said, after Moscow suggested it could nationalise assets of foreign firms that left the country.
Many international firms with investments or operations in Russia have withdrawn since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the West imposed sweeping sanctions.
BAT (LON:BATS), which makes Pall Mall and Rothman's cigarettes, controls just under 25% of the Russian tobacco market.
""The process of transferring the management of BAT business in Russia to SNS GC is well under way at remarkable speed,"" an SNS spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the handover details were being negotiated.
BAT declined to comment on Friday.
BAT said last week it was looking for parties interested in the transfer of its Russia business.
Chief Marketing Officer Kingsley Wheaton had said then that BAT's distributor could be interested in a transfer, adding that exiting the business or stopping sales or manufacturing would be seen as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia with legal consequences.
The SNS spokesperson said the level of production and the supply and distribution chain would be maintained with a transfer.
It was not immediately clear whether BAT would pull out completely, or whether it would still supply SNS with raw materials or manufacturing support.

SNS began working with BAT as a distributor in 1993, according to the SNS website.
A tobacco industry expert said the move by BAT had surprised those working with the company in Russia.

It comprises 11.6 billion euros in customer loans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% in roubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euroswith no parent funding from Vienna. RBI also holds 2.2billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.* 
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) had 18.6 billion euros of overall exposure to the country at end-2021 - or 1.7% of the group total. Its Russian unit Rosbank has around 200 branches and 12,000 staff, which rise to 15,000 for all group activities.

The French bank, which started doing business in Russia in 1872, left in 1917 and returned in 1973, said its Russian activities in 2021 represented 2.7% of group net income.
SocGen calculated it would lose half a percentage point of its core capital ratio in an extreme scenario where its Russian business is confiscated.

UNICREDIT
Italy's second-biggest bank is evaluating exiting Russia, where it runs the country's 14th largest bank with 4,000 staff.

UniCredit's cross-border exposure to Russian clients is 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees. The direct exposure is 1.9 billion euros net of currency hedges.
It could also suffer an up to 1 billion euro loss on derivatives if the rouble's value fell to zero. 
UniCredit will still pay cash dividends for 2021 in a worst-case scenario, while a planned 2.6 billion euro share buyback hinges on core capital staying above 13%.

European Union sanctions have restricted exports of dual-use goods since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. More sanctions have been imposed since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Bosch said in a statement it had no knowledge that any official investigation had started.
It earlier said it had suspended deliveries of truck components inside Russia and to Russian customers partly because of indications its products were being used for non-civilian purposes in violation of local contracts. 
The company, which has plants producing vehicle parts and other goods in Russia, said much of its business in Russia had been curtailed because of the Ukraine war.
""We examine the impact of the respective current sanctions lists very carefully and then implement them consistently and in every detail,"" the company said.
A spokesperson for the economy ministry said it did not comment on individual cases.
Der Spiegel's report follows one by broadcaster ARD this week that quoted Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba saying Ukraine had found Bosch parts in Russian military vehicles.
""We take the Ukrainian foreign minister's allegations very seriously and immediately initiated an intensive investigation,"" the company said, adding that any parts were not supplied directly to the manufacturer of the military vehicles.
Bosch employs about 3,500 people in Russia, where it mainly produces consumer goods, vehicle parts and other items for the local market at three locations.

Last year, Bosch generated sales of 1.2 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in Russia.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday after hawkish-sounding comments from a senior Federal Reserve official, which added to concerns about a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166 points, or 0.5%, at 34,315 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down in parallel. All three cash indices had made solid gains since the Fed raised U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, and are still set to end the week in positive territory. 
Fed Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC that the central bank may have to raise the fed funds target range by 50 basis points (rather than the expected 25) at one of its next meetings, owing to the strength of inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy. He said that only the geopolitical situation - meaning the war in Ukraine - had held it back this week from raising by more than 25 basis points.
""I really favor frontloading our rate hikes...Just do it rather than just promise it,"" Waller said.
Earlier, the outspokenly hawkish St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had said that the Fed may need to raise rates as high as 3% this year to rein in inflation, which is currently running at a 40-year high.
The barrage of Fed-speak is set to continue throughout the day, with appearances from governor Michelle Bowman, Richmond's Tom Barkin and Chicago's Charles Evans also due. 
Those comments come at the end of a week when hopes for a quick end to the Ukraine war, and a reversion to more normal circumstances in global commodity markets, have receded as Russia broadened its assault on Ukraine's cities and China continued to resist Western efforts to isolate President Vladimir Putin's regime. Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping began a call to discuss the war and other issues at 9 AM ET.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said Biden would make clear that the U.S. will impose 'costs' on China if it supports Russia more actively, for example by shipping military aid to the country. The U.S. approved $800 million in military aid to Ukraine earlier this week, while the European Union also earmarked more funds to help Ukraine defend itself. 
Among early movers, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 5.6% to test a 13-month low after the videogame retailer posted a surprise loss of nearly $150 million over the holiday quarter late on Thursday. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock fell 5.2% after it also posted - albeit less disappointing - results caused by the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 over the winter, which left it short-staffed at times. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock outperformed, rising 0.8% after Reuters reported that it's in advanced talks to sell 100 of its 737 MAX 10 aircraft to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which would be a substantial morale-booster at a time when the investment case is still clouded by the post-pandemic outlook for air travel.
Children's fashion retailer  Kidpik  also continued to make gains in the wake of its announcement of a tie-up with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) earlier in the week. Kidpik (NASDAQ:PIK) stock rose another 44%. and has quadrupled this week.

Allowing ""parallel imports"" reflects how Russia's retail sector has been upended by Western economic sanctions and decisions by international firms like H&M and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to restrict their activity in Russia.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said its head had met the director of Russia's top online retailer Wildberries where legalising parallel imports was discussed. Both sides were confident the move would be positive for consumers and Russian businesses.
FAS said it had prepared draft regulations on parallel imports - sometimes also called ""grey imports"" - which were being discussed by the government.
""The FAS initiative allowing parallel imports will be an effective support measure. ... Small and medium-sized businesses will be allowed to legally import foreign goods without seeking additional permissions, and the consumer will get access to a wider assortment of goods of a high quality for reasonable prices,"" Wildberries general director Tatyana Bakalchuk said in a statement.

""This is especially important for socially-significant goods like medicines, foodstuffs and children's products,"" Bakalchuk added.
Russia's government has proposed a raft of support measures to try to buttress its economy in the face of Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless the Kremlin faces its most severe economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

LONDON (Reuters) - While the West's big investors have ditched Russia in recent weeks, one small group of armchair investors sees a bargain and is shrugging off any ethical qualms.
At a time when many in Britain are pouring cash into charities to support relief efforts in Ukraine after its invasion by Russia, others are looking to profit and offering tips to ""buy the dip"" on social media.
""For me it is a one (sic) in a lifetime chance to buy,"" said an investor about stock in Russia-focused steel and mining group Evraz on the Reddit website on March 4. 
Just six days later, Evraz's London-listed shares were suspended after its biggest shareholder Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, meaning any investor who took a punt on the stock had that money frozen.
Despite the risks, Russia-focused investments have proved popular with retail investors even as the war has taken a heavy human toll.
Russia - which calls its actions a ""special operation"" - fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands of refugees are sheltering far from Ukraine's battlefields.
Major investors have called Russia ""uninvestable"", but DIY investors - many of whom took up stock-picking during the ""stonks"" trading frenzy in the pandemic - have been undeterred.
London-listed stocks of Russia-focused companies - including Abramovich's Evraz and gold and silver producer Polymetal - have recently leapt into the most-bought stocks tables at several of Britain's largest investment platforms, according to a review of their websites by Reuters.
Evraz stock plummeted 67% prior to its suspension, and Polymetal is down more than 85% since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24. 
""It's playing with fire and seems mad to me, but some people want to take aggressive bets. And that will never change,"" said Holly Mackay, founder and chief executive of personal finance website Boring Money.
Markets regulator the Financial Conduct Authority told Reuters it was monitoring the situation. 
""Investors should take care when investing in companies that may be impacted by the Russian invasion,"" the regulator said.
Evraz was one of the top five most bought stocks last week by customers on the AJ Bell, interactive investor (ii) and  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) platforms, prior to the stock's suspension. 
It was also the stock with the highest buy-to-sell ratio on the Freetrade platform. All four cater specifically to retail investors, non-professionals who trade securities through online platforms.
The UK has claimed in its sanctions that Evraz has helped provide financial support towards destabilising Ukraine and may have supplied steel used for the production of Russian tanks. Evraz denies the claims.
AJ Bell said Evraz holdings would remain in customer portfolios at the price it was suspended at, while ii said shares were being held until further information was available.
Polymetal was also one of the top 10 most bought stocks last week across the platforms reviewed by Reuters and was top of AJ Bell's list.
The company is not subject to UK sanctions and its shares are still trading, although the stock was deleted from indexes by FTSE Russell on Monday after many brokers refused to trade its shares.
Polymetal, which has eight gold and silver mines in Russia and makes most of its revenues in the country, has said the situation in Ukraine is ""horrifying and heartbreaking"", and has called for a peaceful resolution.
'MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS'
Retail investors have become a bigger force in the markets in the past couple of years as more platforms have offered commission-free trading and stock-pickers have become more vocal on social media.
Online platforms are the fastest-growing part of the consumer investment industry in Britain, with newcomers much more likely to be younger or first-time investors.
The platforms may need to consider providing more warnings or ethical filters as more established investors have done in the Ukraine crisis, Mackay said, though she cautioned against being too restrictive.
Regulators have in the past warned of risks to retail investors, particularly after the suspension of British property funds in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016 and COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, and with the suspension and subsequent collapse of investor Neil Woodford's flagship fund in 2019.
Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell said they primarily provided a platform for customers to make their own investment decisions taking into account their ethical beliefs.
""Our role is to help inform so that clients can make their own decisions,"" a spokesperson for Hargreaves Lansdown said, adding the company was ""horrified by this human tragedy"" and was working with regulators.
Freetrade said it was monitoring the situation, liaising with regulators, and communicating regularly with customers to educate them about the risks of investing in Russian-linked stocks.

ii, which was bought by investment giant Abrdn in December, said the Russia-linked trades were not representative of a typical investor, adding it was working on ethical filters for assets, though these were not Russia-specific.
""There will always be some who choose to lean on extreme volatility,"" a spokesperson for ii said. ""It has always been the case, and we are not here to judge.""

637,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders are bracing for fresh equity-market fireworks Friday after another week of global turbulence.
In a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.
And once again, this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.
Friday’s session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its footing with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Futures contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 dipped in early Friday trading.
In the telling of derivatives pros, the recent rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.
Now as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts. 
“I’ve never seen an environment where you’ve had so many potential overhangs in the market that can not be controlled,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “We’ll see if people can see to redeploy their puts.”
The S&P 500 has climbed almost 6% over three sessions this week in the best rally since 2020, as the likes of Marko Kolanovic at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) urge investors to go all-in.
Exploding derivatives volume has been a fixture of the post-pandemic market -- whipsawing underlying stocks in both directions, again and again. To strategists including Charlie McElligott at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR), the recent advance in the S&P 500 has again been amplified by the hedging activity of market-makers. 
It’s a complicated process, but it works roughly like this: When a dealer sells a put option, it’s essentially taking a bet on the underlying asset to go up. To offset this unwanted directional risk, the market-maker typically sells some of the asset to maintain a neutral position. When the put options expire or get exercised, it will reverse those hedging moves -- potentially creating a tailwind for the asset. 
Another factor involving dealers is their current “short gamma” or “short delta” position that requires them to go with prevailing market trends: Buy stocks when they go up and sell when they fall. 
At the start of the week, their exposure on S&P 500 products sat at a level near the maximum “short gamma” relative to history, according to estimates by McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura. Three days later, that has turned into “zero gamma.” Along the way, dealers were forced to buy back stocks and close their short positions. 
With market sentiment weak and institutional-fund exposure to equities near mutliyear lows, caution in the derivatives market is everywhere. The 20-day average of the Cboe put-call ratio for equities, for example, hovers near a two-year high.  
“We see a general trend of continued risk aversion among investors, and expectations that the stock market remains volatile,” said Steve Sears, president at Options Solutions. “There are so many major events that could change the market’s tempo that hedging and patient fortitude appears to be the message from the options market.”
Options either far out of money or in the money receive less attention on Wall Street around expiration dates. Now with an unusually large number of S&P 500 contracts sitting close to the spot price this time round, trading activity on Friday looks set to be more frenetic than usual, according to Goldman strategist Rocky Fishman.
“The most interesting is options that are near the money, since as we approach expiration, there’s uncertainty about whether or not they end up in the money,” he said. “That uncertainty can lead investors to actively trade around those positions.” "

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) -Global infrastructure funds have approached Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) to invest in its $16 billion mast company Vantage Towers but the telecoms giant's preference is for an industry merger, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The bidders, which include investment firms Brookfield and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), have submitted unsolicited proposals in recent weeks valuing Vantage Towers at a premium to its current valuation of 15 billion euros ($16.57 billion), one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The offers are for a majority stake in Vantage Towers, the source said, adding that Vodafone was studying the proposals and had not taken any decision.
Shares in Vantage Towers jumped 11.4% to a record 33.59 euros at 0926 GMT on the Reuters news and were up 10.4% at 11 GMT.
Vodafone shares were up 1.4%, outperforming their peers in the telecoms sector which was broadly flat.
Vodafone, which listed Vantage Towers in Frankfurt in March 2021 and still owns 81% of the business, has been reluctant to engage in talks with financial investors as it seeks to clinch an industry merger for Vantage with either Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s towers unit DFMG or Orange's Totem, two separate sources said, cautioning no deal was imminent.
Vodafone, Orange and Brookfield declined to comment while GIP was not immediately available for comment.
A spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom said the company was reviewing strategic options for its infrastructure business, without elaborating.
Vodafone faces pressure from Europe's largest activist fund Cevian Capital to simplify its portfolio, enhance its strategy in key markets and boost returns.
If it goes ahead, a deal for its towers business would align Vodafone's strategy with Cevian's demands to look into strategic opportunities for its tower assets.
Such a move would come after the London-listed company turned down an 11 billion euro approach for its Italian operations in February, while its ambitions to consolidate the Spanish market hit a snag in early March after Orange and MasMovil announced exclusive talks to combine their respective businesses in Spain.
Telecoms executives have repeatedly called for market consolidation to reduce competition and boost operators' profitability at a time they need cash to invest in the rollout of 5G mobile telecom infrastructure.
""LIKE-MINDED PLAYER""
Vodafone is now focusing on extracting value from its controlling stake in Vantage Towers, with boss Nick Read repeatedly mentioning Orange's Totem or Deutsche Telekom's tower assets as suitable candidates.
""The next stage (for Vantage) should be an industrial merger, bringing our towers with another large player, a like-minded player, a like-minded operator,"" Read told reporters last month, stressing his interest in exploring a combination with the infrastructure assets of either Orange or Deutsche Telekom.
He added that while Vodafone was open to cutting its stake in Vantage, there was ""plenty of room for us to monetize down while staying in co-control of that entity with that like-minded player.""
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Deutsche Telekom had kicked off an auction for its towers business with indicative bids expected in mid March.
One of the sources said that while Vodafone is closely monitoring Deutsche Telekom's towers sale, it is more likely to pursue a deal with Orange's Totem due to antitrust concerns in Germany.
This source ruled out a deal with financial investors, saying that at this stage only an industry tie-up was on the cards.
Burdened by heavy debt and huge costs, telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years.

Independent tower operators such as Spain's Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) are also on the lookout for infrastructure deals as they race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks closed higher in New York on Friday, with participants balancing the future path of the Ukraine war after a key phone call between the U.S. and Chinese Presidents.
President Joe Biden talked to his counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, for two hours Friday morning. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden planned to warn Xi that the U.S. will retaliate against China if its - so far only verbal - support of Russia morphs into something more substantial. U.S. officials claim that Russia asked China for military aid earlier, a request that is likely to have become more urgent, given the heavy losses of equipment that it has sustained due to surprisingly fierce Ukrainian resistance. 
The U.S. approved $800 million in military aid, including sophisticated drone weaponry, to Ukraine earlier this week.
Biden was expected to warn Xi against any efforts to weaken the economic sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia since its invasion three weeks ago. Biden will travel to Europe next week to attend a summit of NATO members.
By 4:19 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 274 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq was up 2%. All three indices had made solid back-to-back gains over the last two days in a relief rally that followed the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike in three years.
However, there is little on the data calendar after a busy week for economic news, existing home sales for February being the sole indicator of note.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported a surprise loss for the holiday quarter after the bell on Thursday. Analysts had expected a profit of 85 cents a share. 
Porsche (OTC:POAHY) CEO Oliver Blume said it had been in talks with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) about possible projects. The news revived interest around Apple's long-awaited-but-never-confirmed foray into automobiles.
Elsewhere, the dollar pushed back toward a two-year high against the yen after the Bank of Japan warned of a possible hit to the Japanese economy from a war that could lead to higher raw material prices. BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda indicated that he wasn't concerned about the weakness of the yen, however.
Crude oil prices also continued to push higher amid fears that the war could drag on and even intensify. The U.S. warned Russia against using chemical weapons, a move that some analysts see as possible, given the struggles of Russia's conventional forces. U.S. crude futures were up 1.8% at $104.81 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.1% at $107.84 a barrel.
Gold futures were down 1.2% at $1,919 an ounce.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S.-based fund has called for Japan's Shimizu Corp to halt a $190 million bid to take control of road builder Nippon Road Co Ltd, saying the deal would be unfair to minority shareholders and go against governance reform.
In a letter to Nippon Road's board this week that was seen by Reuters, Kaname Capital objected to Shimizu's bid to double its holding to 50.1%.
Kaname, which owns 1.8% of Nippon Road, said the deal would put minority shareholders at a disadvantage by turning them into investors in a listed subsidiary.
""A partial bid is unsatisfactory. Only a 100% bid allows for fair and equal treatment of all shareholders,"" the Boston-based long-only fund said in its letter. 
The offer price of 10,000 yen ($84.13) a share was too low given Nippon Road's cash on hand, shareholdings and other assets, Kaname said, putting the share value closer to 12,500 yen. 
The offer by Shimizu, one of Japan's top construction firms, left minority shareholders with ""a poor choice"" of either hurrying to accept a low price or getting stuck with the reduced valuation and trading liquidity of a listed subsidiary, the $250 million Japan-focused fund said.
Shimizu declined to comment. No one was immediately available for comment at Nippon Road.
Both the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Japanese government have pushed for a reduction in the number of so called ""parent-child listings"", where subsidiaries of large listed companies are also listed.
Critics say the practice can lead to laxer governance and ultimately lower valuations, as the parent's controlling stake weakens the voting power of minority shareholders.
Shimizu's tender offer is set to close on Tuesday. Its offer of 10,000 yen represents a roughly 20% premium to Nippon Road's closing price just before the deal was announced.
Shares of the company closed not far off the offer price at 9,790 yen on Friday. Still, the company is trading at less than its book value, according to Refinitiv data, meaning it is worth less than its assets.
Japan had 248 listed subsidiaries as of March last year, down more than 40% from the peak of 417 in 2007, according to Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research. 
Governance rules have discouraged such listings, citing an inherent conflict of interest.
The Tokyo bourse is also introducing stricter rules for liquidity in April, its biggest overhaul of its equity market in a decade. That will make it tougher for firms largely owned by parent companies or business partners.
Some industrial conglomerates are selling off group companies to eliminate parent-child listings. Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd, for example, sold or took control of more than a dozen subsidiaries in recent years, including Hitachi Chemical and Hitachi High-Technologies.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese authorities will address the concerns of international investors when finalising new rules for offshore listings, two sources quoted a senior regulatory official as telling a lobby group for foreign financial firms.
Western banks have been rattled by proposed rules for overseas listings announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last December that they see as cumbersome. There is also no clarity on whether there will be a single point of regulatory contact for mainland companies wanting to list overseas or in Hong Kong.
Given concerns in the market, ""we definitely need a very clear direction of action,"" Shen Bin, the director-general of the CSRC's international department told a virtual meeting of the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) on Thursday, according to the sources.
Shen added that there was a very strong consensus among different authorities in China about supporting capital markets, the sources said. 
His comments come on the heels of remarks from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who on Wednesday gave assurances that China would pursue market-friendly policies and said caution was needed about the introduction of measures that risked hurting markets.
Liu's remarks, which also touched upon Beijing's efforts to reach an agreement on a thorny bilateral dispute over audits of U.S.-listed Chinese firms, spurred huge rallies in the stocks of Chinese firms with overseas listings.
The CSRC did not immediately comment. ASIFMA, which counts 52 global banks and other financial institutions among its members, declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the meeting.
The CSRC's proposed rules included a requirement that banks which manage a Chinese firm's offshore listing register with the regulator. That fanned concerns about an increase in compliance burdens and other regulatory risks, and there were also concerns that companies could be subject to multiple regulatory checks.
In feedback to the CSRC on the draft rules, ASIFMA had said the proposed guidelines would ""greatly impact the willingness of offshore securities companies and professionals to participate in Chinese companies' offshore listings"".
Further muddying the situation, the Cyberspace Administration of China in January also announced rules requiring a security review of all platform companies with data of more than 1 million users before they list overseas.

The comments from Liu and Shen come amid a murkier outlook for the world's second-largest economy. Investors are fretting about blowback from Beijing's dealings with sanctions-hit Russia, uncertainty in global demand, the impact of a broad regulatory crackdown and a recent spike in domestic COVID-19 cases.
Shen did not say if there would be significant revisions to the CSRC rules or when they would be finalised and published.

U.S. investors exited bond funds for a 10th consecutive week, selling $7.24 billion worth, compared with net selling of $7.8 billion in the previous week, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.

The Fed announced a quarter of a percentage point increase to near-zero U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, and signalled it would hike rates more aggressively than expected to tame soaring inflation, following a firm inflation reading last week.
U.S. taxable bond funds lost $5.18 billion in a second consecutive week of net selling, while municipal bond funds saw a fifth weekly outflow, worth $2.04 billion.
Investors sold U.S. high yield funds to the turn of $1.86 billion and pulled $3.8 billion out of U.S. short/intermediate investment-grade funds, marking a 10th weekly outflow in a row.

Water reserves for the region are being completely exhausted, Wasserverband Strausberg-Erkner, said in a statement Thursday following a meeting on the Tesla project. WSE said further commercial and industrial development plans aren’t possible without additional extraction permits due to the lack of groundwater extraction.
Concern about Tesla’s plant straining the area’s water supply is one of the main reasons the carmaker will start producing Model Y electric vehicles months later than Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk planned. The economy minister for the state of Brandenburg, where Tesla has constructed the facility, has said that while there was enough water for the first stage of the factory, more will be needed as Tesla expands.
Tesla secured approval for the project early this month and said it expected to obtain an operating license within a matter of weeks. The company has sent out invitations to a delivery day event at the factory on March 22.

Investors jettisoned global bond funds worth $17.01 billion, after selling $15.75 billion in the previous week, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.

The Fed announced a quarter of a percentage point increase to near-zero U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, and signalled it would hike rates more aggressively than expected to tame inflation, following a firm inflation reading last week.
The European Central Bank's announcement of an end to asset purchases in the third quarter also weighed on sentiment.
European bond funds saw outflows worth $9.11 billion, while U.S. and Asian bond funds witnessed net sales of $7.24 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.
Global high yield funds lost $4.88 billion in the biggest net selling in four weeks, while short- and medium-term, and government funds faced withdrawals of $3.95 billion and $0.88 billion respectively.
However, inflation-linked funds received $1.15 billion in a third straight week of inflows.

Investors were also net sellers of global equity funds for a third consecutive week, as they withdrew $11.8 billion. 
Global consumer discretionary, tech and industrial sector funds saw outflows of $1.28 billion, $0.88 billion and $0.79 billion, respectively, while health care and mining funds attracted inflows of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.

Among commodity funds, precious metals funds drew $1.39 billion in a ninth straight week of net buying, while energy funds pulled in $129 million in inflows.

An analysis of 24,062 emerging market funds showed equity funds lost $5.4 billion in the biggest weekly outflows since at least April 2020, while bond funds faced outflows of $1.38 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - You may not have heard of Joshua Mitts, a young Columbia University professor who is making some powerful enemies on Wall Street.
The 36-year-old securities law specialist has become an increasingly influential figure in the hot debate over activist short selling since publishing a 2018 analysis of trading data that suggested some players were manipulating the market.
Interviews with 12 people familiar with his work and career, including Mitts himself and some of his toughest critics, shed light on how an academic little known outside his field just a few years ago has since taken center stage in the ugly feud between short sellers and the companies they target.
That struggle has sparked a sprawling probe by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into suspected trading manipulation by short sellers and hedge funds.
Activist short sellers like Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT)' Carson Block bet against public companies they deem over-valued and then publish their investment thesis. They say their work aids market efficiency and dispute Mitts' analysis as flawed.
Nonetheless the interviews, which detail Mitts' contacts with U.S. authorities, show the professor and his work have played a significant role in the federal probes. 
""One reason the work really resonated was it took a large sample and showed there was evidence for what companies were saying: that there was potential abuse,"" said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. 
Mitts declined to comment on his work for the Justice Department beyond pointing to a statement on his resume that he has ""extensive experience supporting"" the agency. He defended his research and said he wanted to be objective and is not opposed to short selling.
""Not only is short selling not illegal, it's important to have bears,"" he said.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the SEC, the main stock market regulator, declined to comment. 
Mitts' journey began in August 2018 when he reached out to real-estate company Farmland (NYSE:FPI) Partners Inc, which was grappling with a steep fall in its shares after an anonymous online post raised questions about its solvency.
Weeks earlier, he had published his analysis of 1,720 pseudonymous posts attacking publicly listed stocks on financial website Seeking Alpha between 2010 and 2017. His study found such posts were preceded by unusual and suspicious trading through stock options, in a process he called ""short and distort"".
Prior to 2018, the battle between U.S. companies and their detractors focused largely on the merits of short sellers and the veracity of their claims. Mitts' work gave companies new ammunition: they could use data to point to potentially manipulative trading tricks and allege fraud. 
'ON A SILVER PLATTER' 
Mitts spoke with Farmland executives about his work and Farmland then retained him as an expert in late August 2018, the company said. Mitts' analysis showed investors bought put options https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-shorts-insight-idINKCN1R20AW with a short expiration window ahead of a Seeking Alpha posting. They became profitable once Farmland's shares began to tumble, and subsequently ginned up additional selling interest.
Put options are derivative contracts that give holders the right to sell the underlying stock at a set price.
Short-selling graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HyuFCE
In early September, Farmland CEO Paul Pittman and the company's attorneys took the professor to meet with officials at the SEC's Denver office, where they rebutted the short seller's claims and laid out the short and distort arguments.
Pittman and the attorneys subsequently met officials at the Justice Department in October, without Mitts, and again laid out their rebuttal and manipulation theories, Farmland said.
""This is not about shorting. This is about securities fraud,"" CEO Pittman told Reuters. 
Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University, said scrutinizing such types of trading patterns would have been a no-brainer for U.S. prosecutors.
""Josh Mitts handed them some potential indicators of fraud on a silver platter. Once they get handed that, they are going to look into it,"" she said.
Mitts had more corporate callers. 
After Farmland, several other companies trying to repel short sellers hired him to consult, including  Banc of California  (NYSE:BANC) Inc, Burford Capital Ltd and  Neovasc  (NASDAQ:NVCN) Inc, according to court and regulatory filings. 
Banc of California and Neovasc did not respond to requests for comment. Burford Capital did not provide a comment for this story. 
In 2019, Mitts began working as a consultant for the Justice Department, according to one source familiar with the matter who declined to be named because such work is sensitive. 
SHORT SELLERS HIT BACK 
Reuters and other media outlets have reported that the Justice Department had launched an expansive criminal investigation into the relationships among hedge funds and firms that publish negative reports on certain companies, often with the aim of sending the stock lower. 
The department has issued subpoenas to dozens of companies, which included requests for funds' trading records, according to the reports, bringing the issue of short selling to the forefront of market attention.
The debate over the practice has long raged, with activist short sellers saying they act as whistleblowers rooting out fraud or other corporate misconduct, and critics saying they often spread false or misleading information.
Spreading false information with the intent to move a stock price could constitute market manipulation, but U.S. free speech protections mean the bar for bringing such cases is high. 
Mitts said the aim of his research is simply to shed more light on short selling. 
""My goal is to better understand how short reports affect the markets. I appreciate when industry participants take the time to engage with academics on these important questions."" 
Yet his critics are angry, including big-name investors Block of Muddy Waters and Citron Research's Andrew Left, both of whom are being scrutinized as part of the Justice Department probe, according to the media reports.
Left said Mitts' analysis was fundamentally flawed because it did not account for all the potential reasons behind trading patterns that may appear to be suspicious, describing the study as ""sloppy"".
Block, who made his name outing fraud at Chinese companies, first learned about Mitts in January 2019 when the law professor was quoted in a news report about regulators looking into aggressive short sellers, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said. 
Initial interactions between the two men were friendly. Block attended Mitts' class at Columbia in early 2019. That April, during a public panel discussion featuring the two men, Mitts told the moderator that he thought ""Carson's a good American.""
But the relationship has soured. 
Last month, Block published a paper, ""Distorting the Shorts,"" refuting Mitts' paper, in which he said the academic's work consulting for companies was a conflict of interest. 
Mitts told Reuters he stopped consulting work for targets of activist short sellers in April 2020.
Block also argued that Mitts' analysis was misleading as the authors of the majority of posts Mitts reviewed were not actually short the stock concerned, according to disclosures required by Seeking Alpha. Trading patterns Mitts cites as key evidence of manipulation may be accounted for by corporate earnings reports rather than short reports, the paper said. 

""Mitts' 'Short and Distort' badly misrepresents the underlying data,"" it added. 
Mitts declined to comment on Block's paper.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is edging towards a landmark order from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) for up to 100 of its 737 MAX 10 jets, a model it is battling in separate talks to get approved before year-end rule changes, people familiar with the matter said.
The deal, if confirmed, would be the first order from Delta for Boeing's best-selling single-aisle airplane family, and the first major Boeing order for the carrier in a decade. 
It comes as Delta - the only major U.S. carrier without a 737 MAX on order - reshapes its fleet in anticipation of a swift recovery from the pandemic.
Boeing and Delta, which have had a frayed relationship in past years, are working on details of an order that could consist of 100 aircraft, many or all of which could involve the largest variant, the 737 MAX 10, two of the people said.
If a deal is reached, an announcement could come as soon as next month, one of the people added. 
Boeing and Delta declined to comment. 
Industry sources cautioned negotiations typically go down to the wire and no final decision had been taken. There has been speculation about a MAX order from Delta in the past, without a deal coming to fruition.
The MAX 10 competes with Airbus' strongest-selling model, the A321neo. Both planes are aimed at the fast-growing segment of the market just above 200 seats. 
The A321neo, which leasing company Air Lease (NYSE:AL) described on Wednesday as the ""hottest airplanes in the market"", has a commanding lead in sales, but Boeing has scored a series of contract wins in the past year.
Airbus also declined to comment. 
In September, Airline Weekly quoted Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian as saying there was a place for the MAX at Delta if the carrier could figure out how to bring them in.
Asked about the MAX in London earlier this month, he told reporters Delta was always looking at all airplane models.
CERTIFICATION TALKS 
For Boeing, which is entrenched in broader certification and industrial headaches, the deal would cement a major new customer for its cash-cow narrowbody.
The planemaker is facing a separate but increasingly high-stakes battle to win certification of the MAX 10 before a new safety standard on cockpit alerts takes effect at year-end.
The deadline for changes was introduced as part of broader regulatory reforms at the Federal Aviation Administration following fatal crashes of a smaller MAX model in 2018 and 2019.
Boeing has held talks with some lawmakers about the potential of asking for more time, but has not formally sought an extension to address a flight deck issue, the people said.
Asked about the possibility, an FAA spokesperson said, ""safety dictates the timeline of certification projects"".
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the MAX before end-year.
Boeing has raised with some lawmakers the potential impact on jobs and production if the 737 MAX 10 is not approved, the people said. 
""We continue to work transparently with the FAA to provide the information they need, and we are committed to meeting their expectations to achieve 737-10 certification,” Boeing said in an emailed statement.
It did not comment directly on any talks with lawmakers but said the jet would support ""tens of thousands of jobs at Boeing and across our supply chain, including in Washington state"". 
The issue is also likely to get entangled in the confirmation hearings of the next FAA administrator. Current FAA Administrator Steve Dickson is set to step down March 31. 

The Seattle Times this month cited an earlier Boeing submission to the FAA citing an estimated cost of full compliance for the MAX at ""more than $10 billion"". 
(The story refiles to amend dateline to March 18.)

(Reuters) -Sycamore Partners is in the early stage of making a possible cash offer for fashion retailer Ted Baker, the private equity firm said on Friday, in the latest sign of strong U.S. interest in taking over British entities. 
New York-based Sycamore, which specialises in deals in the struggling retail sector, has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed Ted Baker. Sycamore said there was no certainty an offer would be made and did not disclose what the terms might be for any deal. 
Ted Baker said it has not received an offer but would evaluate any proposal, although it was confident in its independent prospects.
Shares of the upmarket retailer jumped 20% on Friday but were still trading just above a pound each, compared with the nearly 30 pounds it was worth in 2015, giving it a current market valuation of nearly 220 million pounds ($289.26 million), Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Takeover interest in British companies, ranging from defence groups to a leading supermarket, is its highest in years, as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union have reduced valuations. 
Ted Baker is in the middle of three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it tries to boost its online presence and rebuild its image after profit warnings and accounting issues.
Osborne took charge in 2019 in a management reshuffle that included the exit of former chief executive Ray Kelvin following allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Kelvin has denied the allegations and retains a nearly 12% stake in the company he founded in 1988 in Glasgow. 

Ted Baker, which has nearly 400 locations mostly in Europe, North America and the United Kingdom, said in February it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about outlook for the current year as people slowly return to working in offices.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese manufacturers began restarting production at plants in the country's quake-hit northeast, but  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it plans to idle 18 assembly lines for a few days next week due to a shortage of parts from suppliers.
On one hand, the limited damage caused by the magnitude 7.4 temblor has highlighted Japan's success in building resilience against the frequent tremors that shake the archipelago.
But the quake has sparked concerns of further disruptions to a pandemic-hit supply chain for precision components vital to electronics and autos production and in which Japanese manufacturers play a leading role.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales volume, said it will idle the 18 lines at 11 domestic factories, mostly for three days.
It had suspended operations at three factories due to the quake and sees lost production of 20,000 units due to the stoppages. Toyota has already cut its global production target due to the ongoing chip shortage.
Murata Manufacturing Co (OTC:MRAAY) Ltd, the top global supplier of ceramic capacitors used in smartphones and cars, said it restarted production on Friday at two stopped plants with the remaining two idled plants to restart next week. 
A fire that broke out at a factory which produces chip inductors caused some damage to equipment. 
Renesas Electronics Corp, which makes nearly a third of the microcontroller chips used in cars globally, said it has restarted production after stopping it at two factories with a partial stop at a third. 
All three factories, including the Naka factory where fire broke out last year, are expected to return to pre-quake capacity by Wednesday, Renesas said. 
Power has mostly been restored across the northeast, which suffered Japan's biggest earthquake 11 years ago. Areas of Tokyo lost power for nearly three hours after the latest quake, in which three people died and 183 were injured. 
The blackout has forced the disposal of some COVID-19 vaccines held in cool storage, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.

Tech conglomerate  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp is in the process of gradually restarting production at three factories in the quake-hit area, a spokesperson said. 
There is some damage to a facility in Shiroishi, Miyagi prefecture which produces laser diodes but the impact on production is limited, Sony said.

Unprecedented Western sanctions have hit the heart of Russia's financial system over events in Ukraine and Sberbank was among the companies targeted. The bank quit almost all its European markets earlier this month.
""Due to sanctions, from March 18, the list of currencies available for transfers to other banks in Russia and abroad has been restricted,"" Sberbank said on its Telegram channel. 
""This means that Sberbank will not be able to make transfers to other banks in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, Danish crowns and Swedish krona.""
Transfers of some currencies, including roubles, euros, Japanese yen and Swiss francs, remain possible at Sberbank branches. 
Several Russian banks have been banned from the SWIFT international payments network, hampering their efforts to move money outside of Russia, but operations within the country have remained largely unscathed until now.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened slightly lower on Friday but were still on course for a weekly gain, as participants awaited the outcome of key talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
By 4:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was down 6 points, or 0.2% while the broader-based Stoxx 600 was flat. The best performing major index was the FTSE MIB in Italy, while France's CAC 40 underperformed with a 0.4% drop, a day after President Emmanuel Macron warned that the state may have to nationalize ""certain energy companies"" - a comment taken to refer to Electricite de France (PA:EDF).
Stocks look likely to finish the week higher; thanks to the ongoing diplomacy that has accompanied Russia's war in Ukraine, which has seen the two sides' positions inch closer to each other since last weekend. However, on the ground, the campaign remains as destructive as ever, with Russian rockets striking the city of Lviv in western Ukraine overnight.
A vital part of that diplomatic process - despite its location on the other side of the world - is China, whose political support for Russia has cushioned the impact of the West's economic sanctions on the country. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Thursday that “China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs.”
Foreign exchange markets were broadly stable although the dollar pushed back toward a six-year high against the yen after the Bank of Japan warned of negative impacts to the Japanese economy from the Ukraine war, largely through the channel of higher raw material costs. That follows similar warnings from the European Central Bank and Bank of England this week. The BoE hiked its key rate for a third straight meeting to 0.75% on Thursday, but sterling weakened as the Bank's warning about war impacts put a greater emphasis on the downside risk to growth than on the upside risk to prices. As such, traders scaled back their bets on the BoE, keeping step with the Fed as it tightens policy throughout 2022.
By 4:20 AM ET, the euro was down 0.1% at $1.1077 while the pound was up 0.1% at $1.3153. The dollar was also trading at 118.90 yen, up 0.3% on the day.
A busy week for central banks comes to an end later with the Central Bank of Russia's policy meeting. The pressure on the ruble has eased off in recent days, but it has still lost one-third of its value since the invasion. President Vladimir Putin proposed a new term for Governor Elvira Nabiullina on Thursday, days after rumors swirled about her unsuccessfully offering her resignation.

LONDON (Reuters) - As they switch off the lights in Moscow, the world's top banks face a risk-ridden retreat, juggling obligations to anxious clients and staff while complying with sanctions that have rewritten the rules of doing business in Russia.
There is a growing realisation that these sanctions are likely to remain long-term, industry sources told Reuters, which means strategic not just tactical decisions are needed as executives look to protect hard-won improvements to their credibility since the global financial crisis.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have committed to helping clients with the complex task of unwinding their Russian operations, whilst at the same time supporting the relocation of staff who wish to leave.
""(President Vladimir) Putin has fewer and fewer ways to hit back, he's in a corner and these people could end up as pawns,"" one senior compliance executive at a large U.S. bank said of the effects of Western sanctions on Russia.
But the sweeping scope of these sanctions mean banks will need more rather than less manpower in order to ramp up client screening and avoid potentially costly financial penalties for any violations.
In a sign of both the immediate strain and the prospect of sustained pressures, alerts about potentially problematic transactions at one institution rose by 50-60% on the first day sanctions were introduced, one source told Reuters.
""That must suggest that their operational teams are at least 50-60% smaller than they need to be at this time, so that is definitely a concern,"" one of the sources said.
While Citi, JPMorgan and Goldman have all closed their doors to new business in Russia, they have declined to comment on whether they might surrender their potentially lucrative Russian banking licenses in the longer term.
Around half of the 80 Goldman employees in Moscow have moved or are relocating to Dubai, three sources familiar with the matter said, but the Wall Street firm's Russia head is remaining in the Russian capital, one source said.
JPMorgan has around 160 staff in Moscow, where it has been for 50 years, and a large percentage are Russian nationals who will remain, another source familiar with the matter said.
Citi, which had put its consumer business in Russia up for sale before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is also mothballing its institutional and wealth management businesses.
Citi, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.
RELATIONSHIPS
Citi and JPMorgan face some of the biggest headaches as they act as custodians for many Western firms trading assets in Russia, where the stock exchange has been shut since Feb. 25.
This role involves particular legal obligations, including the safeguarding, clearing and settling of transactions, the duration of which can vary from hours to years.
Asset management firms such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and PIMCO will be relying on banks to help mitigate losses on tens of billions of dollars of Russian holdings when trading resumes.
But this assumes they are able to obtain the necessary permits and can find others willing to buy.
Moscow has set out strict new terms foreign investors must meet if they wish to buy or sell Russian assets. These include providing data on beneficial owners and setting out ""the purpose, subject, content and essential conditions of the transaction"" in Russian. 
While divesting to sanctioned entities may be permitted if banks and investors can obtain special licences from authorities such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, it is unclear how long applications might take, experts said.
There is also a lack of clarity on whether Western lenders may need further dispensations to repatriate earnings from managing those disposals, or proceeds from sales of their own assets, particularly if the buyers are subject to sanctions.
France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) has even warned of the possibility that Russia could confiscate its bank assets, including a 99.97% stake in Rosbank.
And the European Union has barred settlement systems in the bloc from completing stock, bond or derivatives transactions in roubles, the only currency many Russian firms could pay in.
Banks have just weeks to close out outstanding contracts such as derivatives with sanctioned Russian customers, and painstakingly ensure each remaining transaction with non-sanctioned customers does not breach the curbs indirectly.
""The impact and required actions will depend on their individual circumstances,"" the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said of its members.
'DISENTANGLING'
Sanctions mean that some of the key prerequisites to engaging in overseas trading, capital raising or advisory work are no longer easily accessible, including market data and ratings services for sovereign and corporate debt or equity.
Without these, banks cannot easily judge the value or creditworthiness of an asset or accurately assess how much risk capital they need to hold to comply with their own domestic regulatory requirements.
Italy's UniCredit has said it may need to write off 7.4 billion euros in a worst-case winding down of its Russian business, while CEO Andrea Orcel warned that ""disentangling"" from the country was a huge task.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Fitch and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) have slashed their scores on Russia by several notches since the war with Ukraine began, putting the sovereign deep into ""junk"" territory.
Further downgrades are also likely, as the government battles to avoid defaulting on its first international debt repayments since the Bolshevik revolution.
The London Stock Exchange last week suspended all products and services for all customers in Russia, days after suspending news and commentary distribution. 
And the Big Four accounting firms have also severed ties, making it harder for banks to get their businesses audited in line with internationally accepted practice.
A public backlash over Russia's invasion, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" is also cause for concern.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) abruptly changed course after stinging criticism from some investors and politicians, after initially saying it planned to maintain ties with Russia.
And Austria's Raiffeisen, one of the European banks most exposed to Russia, said it was studying a possible withdrawal after earlier saying it had no plans to.

For Pushan Dutt, INSEAD Professor of Economics, a shift in global geopolitics will put banks at heightened risk of Russian-related legal and regulatory trouble for decades to come.
""Absent a regime change, Russia will remain cut off from the international banking system,"" Dutt said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Aquila Acquisition Corp shares slipped on Friday in the first special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listing in Hong Kong as the city's bourse talked up what it calls ""a new route to market"".
The stock declined to HK$9.70 on its first day of trading, down 3% from the offer price of HK$10 each with only one live trade during the session. There were two further cross trades, Refinitiv data showed.
Hong Kong regulators gave the green light for SPAC listings in January and a further nine SPACs have since lodged filings to follow Aquila's debut, in which it raised just under $130 million.
But amid restrictions on retail investors and what market watchers called unfamiliarity with SPACs, Aquila shares had a muted day.
Professional investors are allowed to trade the shares but need to prove to their brokers they meet criteria put in place by regulators to restrict buying and selling SPAC shares.
Market participants said Hong Kong hoped to attract investors from mainland China to list SPACs, firms that raise cash to buy private firms, taking them public without a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
The deals come after Singapore became the first major market in Asia to allow SPACs to trade in the wake of a surge in 'blank cheque' firms listing in the United States. But a number of those U.S. firms are now trading under water, tempering the appetite of global investors for such deals.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) welcomed the SPAC listing on the exchange's main board.
""It adds a new route to market for issuers (and) further diversifies our listing offering,"" HKEX Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Aguzin said in a statement.
Aquila said in filings it raised HK$1 billion ($128 million) by selling 100 million Class A shares at HK$10 each, in an offering that also included 50.03 million warrants. It said it intends to look for deals among companies in new economy sectors such as green energy.
A total of 99 investors bought into the Aquila SPAC, the filings show, with 40 of those considered professional institutional investors.
""It is new in the market and is only a shell,"" said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian, as the shares failed to trade. 
""It may take a while for investors to get used to it and until sentiment for SPACs heat up again. And there are restrictions for retail investors, they cannot simply jump into it like other stocks.""
Retail shareholders are restricted from buying the SPAC stock until the company makes an acquisition, which reduces the number of investors who can trade the shares.

Meanwhile Chinese investment banks regulated by the China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) have been barred from being SPAC promoters in Hong Kong, Reuters reported last week.

(Reuters) - Hong Kong startup Greater Bay Airlines has scaled back its initial growth ambitions due to tight pandemic-related quarantine restrictions and has yet to set a date for its first commercial flights, its chief executive said on Friday.
The carrier, which intends to compete against the financial centre's dominant airline, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, was granted a licence last month to operate regular flights. 
The second of three Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-800s leased from China's ICBC Leasing arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
However, Chief Executive Algernon Yau said requirements for two weeks of hotel quarantine on arrival to the city would need to relax before Greater Bay would commit to a launch date and its first routes.
""I think we would need around three months in advance,"" he said in a phone interview of the notice needed to gain traffic rights and airport slots. 
The airline said in October it hoped to have seven jets in operation by the end of 2022, but Yau said growth plans had been scaled back due to setbacks in border openings as COVID-19 cases rose in its home city.
""I think we will operate three aircraft this year,"" he said. ""And maybe we will reach the level in the second half of 2023 where we are adding two more aircraft.""
The carrier is developing a longer-term growth plan that could involve a fleet of up to 30 Boeing 737 MAX 10 or Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A321neo planes flying to destinations in mainland China and around Asia over the next five years, Yau said. 

Greater Bay has not yet decided if it will source the planes directly from manufacturers or from lessors or a mix of the two, he added.
The airline will have all economy class seats and a mid-market model similar to Virgin Australia and JetBlue, Yau said, positioning it between full-service Cathay Pacific and that airline's budget offshoot Hong Kong Express.

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc on late Thursday sought emergency use authorization from U.S. health regulators for a second COVID-19 booster shot, as a surge in cases in some parts of the world fuels fears of another wave of the pandemic.
The U.S. biotechnology company said its request covered all adults over the age of 18 so that the appropriate use of an additional booster dose of its vaccine, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities, could be determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health care providers. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s request is significantly broader than  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s application that was filed earlier this week with U.S. regulators for a second booster shot for people aged 65 and older.
Moderna, without specifically commenting on the effectiveness of a fourth shot, said its submission was partly based on data recently published in the United States and Israel following the emergence of the Omicron variant.
FDA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
U.S. health officials, including top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have raised the prospect of a fourth shot, especially for older people and to prepare for the possibility of another surge in cases.
CDC data has shown that vaccine efficacy wanes over time and a third shot helps restore it. It, however, has not released comprehensive data based on age or health status to back the case.
Pfizer and Moderna are betting additional booster doses will be needed as new virus variants emerge.

The news was first reported by the New York Times.
While COVID cases are falling in the United States and much of the world, infections are rising in China. In the UK and Europe, there has been a reversal in the downward trend of COVID cases as economies have opened up and a second variant of Omicron circulates.

(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space tourism service has postponed until March 29 a flight initially set for next week, while ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson will not be a passenger on the launch, the company said on Thursday.
The company, in a brief notice first posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), gave no immediate explanation for the change or Davidson's withdrawal from the manifest of Blue Origin's fourth commercial flight since last summer.
Davidson, 28, the boyfriend of reality TV star and socialite Kim Kardashian, had just been officially named on Monday as Blue Origin's ""honorary guest"" to join five paying customers on the flight initially set for March 23.
With ""Davidson no longer able to join"" the new flight, Blue Origin said it would announce the sixth crew member ""in the coming days.""
The five previously revealed are angel investor Marty Allen; real estate veteran Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon Hagle; University of North Carolina professor Jim Kitchen and George Nield, founder-president of Commercial Space Technologies.
Like the first three groups of Blue Origin passengers, they will ride to the edge on a six-story-tall, fully autonomous spacecraft called the New Shepard, which will lift off from Blue Origin's launch site near the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.
The suborbital joyride, lasting about 10 minutes from liftoff to touchdown, will ascend to about 350,000 feet (106 km), treating passengers to a few moments of weightlessness, before a descent back to Earth for a parachute landing.
Bezos, the billionaire founder of online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) tagged along himself on Blue Origin's inaugural crewed flight to space last July.

He accompanied his brother, Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian female aviator Wally Funk and an 18-year-old Dutch high school graduate.
Later passengers included 90-year-old ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner, who became the oldest person to fly to space, ""Good Morning America"" co-host Michael Strahan, and the eldest daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard, after whom Blue Origin's spacecraft is named.

Estimating the year-to-date default rate at 5.5%, Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting said in a note Friday that this headline figure understated stress in a sector where developers have entered into bond exchanges to avoid triggering defaults.
""If we assume all the bonds from issuers that have entered into bond exchange or maturity extension transactions as being in default, the (year-to-date) default rate would rise to 23.4%,"" they said.
Ho and Ting said they maintained a default forecast for the sector of 19% for 2022, with a bull case of 10.5% and a downside case of 31.6%.
""Whilst credit stresses have picked up, China policymakers have also reiterated their accommodative policy stance,"" they said, adding that ""risks are clearly tilted towards the downside case.""
Of bonds in the sector that have passed their final maturity dates so far this year, 31% have entered into bond exchange or maturity extension transactions, 26% have defaulted and 42% were fully repaid.

More bond exchanges and defaults are likely, with $2.3 billion maturing in April, and more than $3 billion each in June, July and August, they said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with a rally in Chinese shares in the U.S. cooling. Investors continue digesting mixed signals on peace talks to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.28% by 10:36 PM ET (2:36 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan handing down its monetary policy earlier in the day. Data also showed that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% year-on-year in February 2022. The national CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.02% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.32%
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.7%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.02% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.64%. U.S.-traded Chinese shares eased a historic rally as investors await follow-up action from the government on its vow to stabilize markets.
The ceasefire talks to resolve conflict stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 are also on investors’ radars. However, Russia has cast doubt on the talks’ progress and the Pentagon warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin may threaten to use nuclear weapons if the conflict drags on.
Global shares have rallied in recent days and are set for their best week since November 2020. This suggests that some of the worst fears about the inflationary commodity shock and the conflict in Ukraine are easing.
However, continued fighting and tightening Federal Reserve monetary policy could mean more cross-asset swings ahead.
“I don’t necessarily expect the rest of the year to be that easy,” RBC Capital Markets LLC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Bloomberg.
“Volatility is likely to stay elevated for quite some time” even as sentiment gauges “have been a screaming buy in some respects for quite some time.”
U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss the situation in Ukraine with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later in the day. Biden will warn of “costs” if China backs Russia, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted to end Russia’s Most Favored Nation status, leading the way to sharply higher tariffs on Russian goods. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings also slashed Russia’s credit score to CC, saying its debt is “highly vulnerable to nonpayment.”
However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. processed funds for interest payments due on Russian government dollar bonds, which eased fears of a default.
U.S. data showed that building permits showed a reading of 1.859 million while contracting 1.9% month-on-month in February. The reading for housing starts was 1.769 million, while it grew 6.8% month-on-month.
The data also showed that industrial production grew 7.45% year-on-year and 0.5% month-on-month. This supported U.S. Federal Chairman Jerome Powell’s view that the economy can withstand monetary tightening.

Investors are taking a step back after rushing in to buy in the past couple days, as several concerns remain -- including the risk of possible U.S. sanctions on China given its ties with Russia. China’s muted response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hardened views within the U.S. administration that President Xi Jinping may be moving closer to supporting Moscow as the conflict continues, according to several people familiar with the matter.
Beijing denies that it has tacitly backed the invasion and Chinese officials have rejected U.S. reports that Russia asked China for financial and military assistance shortly after touching off the war, labeling them disinformation.

LONDON (Reuters) -Despite the turbulent, stop-start trading of nickel on the London Metal Exchange, frustrated investors who may want to shift their business elsewhere have found there are no quick and easy alternatives. 
The 145-year-old institution suspended activity and cancelled trades last week due to volatility that saw prices double to above $100,000 a tonne within hours. A spate of technical glitches after trading resumed this week has left traders fuming.
Amid the chaos, some pointed to the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), where there have been few such interruptions to nickel trading, as a defacto benchmark. 
But a lot would have to change for ShFE to set global reference prices.
Trading on ShFE is difficult for non-Chinese, who need an affiliation with a Chinese entity. Then there are differences in currency and language and adjustments for duty and VAT, traders said.
Shanghai also has a lot of small-scale retail speculators, whereas the LME is dominated by financial institutions, producers and industrial users.
""I don't think there's a quick fix. It's a real problem,"" said Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum.
""In the longer term the LME seems to be in lots of trouble.""
The LME benchmark nickel contract slumped to $41,945 a tonne on Thursday, hitting its daily limit for the second day in a row.
Traders said it would probably continue to slide until it reached parity with the price of the metal in China at about $34,300 a tonne. 
However, European industrial users were not flocking to Shanghai, one trader at a LME ring-dealing member said.
""I don't see any physical players pricing on ShFE, even the Chinese themselves, but longer term, the LME has to get its house in order,"" he said.
The LME called last week's situation ""unprecedented"". 
""However, we fully recognise that we must consider taking action in order to prevent such a situation from happening again,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will consider carefully any appropriate future steps we could take to further build market resilience.""
ShFE was not immediately available for comment.
Price said that until orderly trading of the LME nickel contract resumes, some local physical buyers may need to somehow peg their business to exchange prices reported before the disruption.
CHINA PRICING POWER
In the longer term, China as the world's biggest consumer and producer of many commodities, wants to take a greater role in establishing global prices.
""The nickel futures incident highlights the importance and urgency of promoting internationalisation of relevant nonferrous metal futures,"" said Duan Shaofu, an official from the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
Establishing Chinese-based international base metals contracts would reinforce China's commodity pricing power, he added in an article posted on the group's website on Thursday.
New international contracts may follow the lead of a copper futures contract that is open to foreign traders, launched in 2020 on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE). https://reut.rs/3D4xbuF
CME OPPORTUNITY?
Another possibility is the CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) launching a nickel contract alongside its successful copper futures. 
The CME declined to comment.
Although it has rolled out contracts in aluminium, zinc and lead, they have so far failed to gain momentum.
Copper performs strongly on the CME because its contract, with a traditional monthly settlement date, is easy for hedge funds and speculators who often use the metal as a proxy for the global economy.
Complex LME contracts, in contrast, allow trading any single day for the first three months, set up to allow miners and industrial consumers to hedge physical shipments for odd periods.

The physical basis of the LME, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., will make it difficult to dislodge the exchange from setting global benchmarks, despite the current ructions.

SEOUL (Reuters) -As COVID curbs cut travel and duty-free shopping, South Koreans are driving a luxury goods boom at home that has left Chanel barring nearly a third of would-be shoppers to stop bulk buyers snagging $10,000 bags for resale with markups of 20% or more.
The storied French fashion and luxury company told Reuters it has seen traffic to its boutiques in South Korea skid since it began screening for customers it believed might be stocking up purely to flip to others in the resale market.
""We were able to identify them (bulk buyers) after having analysed their buying patterns. Since this policy was implemented, the traffic in our boutiques has decreased by 30%,"" Chanel told Reuters in a statement. It didn't disclose exactly how it deemed those customers to be potential bulk buyers, and the privately owned business doesn't disclose sales numbers by country.
Chanel's strategy, implemented since July last year, came as global demand for luxury goods was picking up after the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea is the world's seventh-biggest luxury goods market according to Euromonitor, and the research firm estimates it was one of only two of the top seven markets by revenue - the other being China - to see sales grow last year from 2019 levels.
Supply at brands like Chanel, though, is tightly controlled, preserving exclusivity and boosting appeal with no online shopping option beyond cosmetics, perfumes and some small accessories. Such is the appetite in downtown Seoul that long queues form before dawn outside department stores as shoppers brace for what's known as an 'open run' - a sprint to Chanel's doors at opening time.
""I arrived ... at 5.30 a.m. for an open run and I was notified that there were more than 30 people in front of me,"" a shopper told Reuters in front of a Chanel boutique in Seoul. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of privacy concerns, he said by the time he entered the store - nearly 10 hours later - the item he wanted was sold out.
Reflecting such red-hot demand in the resale market, a Chanel medium classic flap bag was sold at 13.5 million won ($11,031) - 20% more than its standard retail price - in January on KREAM, a platform offering everything from sneakers to tech and luxury goods that is an affiliate of tech giant Naver Corp.
KREAM, an acronym for 'Kicks Rule Everything Around Me', was launched in 2020. It told Reuters its monthly transactions exceeded 100 billion won in December, and said South Korea's resale market is worth more than 1 trillion won - nearly $820 million - even at the most conservative estimates.
'QUEUE MANAGEMENT'
While resale platforms like KREAM offer a range of brands, Chanel, like Swiss watchmaker Rolex, is a particularly sought-after brand because of its status among couples in South Korea as one of the most popular wedding gifts, and frequent price increases of its most iconic handbags.
    Chanel increased prices of some handbags, accessories and seasonal ready-to-wear earlier this month in Asia and Europe, including by 5% in South Korea - where prices have just been raised for the fifth time in nine months, according to Chanel Korea.
In tandem with its screening for bulk buyers, Chanel said it has implemented a ""queue management system"": Clients are asked to give their contact number and reason for visiting the store so that they can be informed via text messages when they will be able to enter the boutique.
Brand experts and consumers are divided on the impact of the new buying pattern on Chanel.
""Consumers are voluntarily doing free ads for Chanel – camping outside (boutiques), doing open runs, posting their experiences on social media,"" said Lee Eun Hee, a professor of consumer science at Inha University.
""I think all those phenomena have helped Chanel draw younger customers and make a big chunk of money off it.""
'LINE STANDERS'
Still, some consumers say long queues and waiting lists have put them off.
""I just gave up buying a Chanel product long ago,"" said a Seoul resident in her 30s, declining to be named due to privacy concerns. 
""It's too difficult to buy one, with some 300 people usually on a waiting list, and by the time it's my turn, there is no product left. This really puts me off and I don't want to be at the centre of this craziness.""
Not giving up any time soon are the bulk buyer-resellers.
Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, some resellers told Reuters they're hiring ""line standers"" for a fee of up to $125 a day to stand in queues or enter stores on their behalf. 
One reseller in his 30s told Reuters he's been reselling his purchases at usually more than 20% profit - and it can be far more profitable when inventory level is low.

He said he sold a Chanel flap card holder recently on secondhand marketplace app Karrot for nearly 1 million won, 40% above its retail price - five minutes after it went up for sale.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Thursday said its Chief Executive Larry Culp would take a 67% cut to an incentive grant this year after shareholders last year rejected his compensation package in a non-binding but rare rebuke over executive pay.
In its annual proxy statement filed on Thursday, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate said Culp's annual equity incentive grant for 2022 will be reduced to $5 million from $15 million. 
The company also disclosed Culp's annual compensation last year was about $22.7 million, down 69% from 2020, due to a reduction in stock awards.
Proxy votes against executive pay at S&P 500 companies became more common last year and were often sparked by ""questionable practices and metrics,"" such as easier performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.
Among the S&P 500, a record 16 companies had the pay of their CEOs and other top leaders rejected by more than half of investors last year, up from 10 in 2020 and seven in 2019, the report said.
As part of an extension of Culp's employment contract to 2024, GE in 2020 canceled old shares he had been given and granted him new shares tied to lower financial targets. The compensation package entailed a payout through 2024 of as much as $230 million.
Some 57.7% of GE shareholders last year rejected the pay deal, according to preliminary results, which some proxy advisory firms argued was too generous.
GE said in the proxy statement its board had gathered feedback from shareholders on the issue and tried to address concerns related to compensation matters.
While defending the 2020 grant, the company said its board does not intend to enter into a similar modification of the CEO's employment agreement in the future.

It also promised to use discretion sparingly in determining bonus pools.
GE's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled in May.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian stock exchange operator B3 reported on Thursday its recurring net profit for the fourth quarter grew by 6.0%, but was slightly below analysts' estimates.
The company posted recurring net profit of 1.23 billion reais ($244.05 million), compared with the market consensus, compiled by Refinitiv, of 1.27 billion reais. 
Net revenue fell 4.2% to 2.18 billion reais, while revenues from the firm's listed segment, which includes equities and equity instruments, shrunk 5.5%.
The sharp rise in interest rates and inflationary pressures in Brazil in the last three months of 2021 led to a decrease in the number of public offerings during the period, with only one initial public offering and two follow-ons.
Even so, ""B3 continued to see high trading volumes on its platforms,"" the company said in its earnings report. The average daily traded volume on the Sao Paulo stock exchange was 31.53 billion reais in the quarter, mostly in line with the previous year. 
The company posted recurring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 1.65 billion reais, while its EBITDA margin fell by 278 basis points to 75.9%, mainly due to B3's strategy to lower trading fees as more Brazilians start to invest.

According to B3, the number of individual investors in Brazil grew 37.6% during 2021, reaching almost 3.7 million people.

(Reuters) - All three of Wall Street's major indexes advanced more than 1% on Thursday as investors considered the Federal Reserve's path for interest rate hikes and worries eased about the prospects of a Russian default after creditors received payments.
Investors were reassured that Russia may, at least for now, have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century. This was because creditors received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq registered their biggest 3-session percentage gain since early November 2020 after the reports boosted risk appetites in a market already benefiting from bargain hunting. The S&P 500 also witnessed its third straight day of more than 1% advances.
The Fed had raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday as expected and forecast an aggressive plan for further hikes while policymakers also trimmed economic growth projections for the year.
The Russian payment news and a breaking of technical decline lines ""to the upside"" in indices, including the S&P and the Nasdaq, all boosted stocks, according to Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
""It's giving investors an increased level of cautious optimism which is a change from the significant pessimism we've been experiencing since early January,"" said James.
""People have gotten more comfortable with the fact rates are going higher. This has been talked about ad nauseum by Chairman (Jerome) Powell since early December,"" he said. ""The fact there were no significant negative surprises in the Fed's plans coming out of the meeting, and Powell's commentary, gave people a sense that maybe we've seen as bad as it's going to get in the near term.""
Describing the Fed's plans as dovish, Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York also said the continuation of Russia, Ukraine peace talks helped the mood.
""What you're seeing today simply as a spillover effect from yesterday,"" said Blancato. ""There's a potential resolution for the conflict overseas, the positive effects of the Federal Reserve and stocks at a very fair entry point, providing an opportunity to add risk.""

The energy sector .SPNY was the biggest percentage gainer among the S&P's 11 major industry sectors, ending up 3.5% as oil prices rose 8% as the crude market rebounded from several days of losses with a renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia. O/R

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) on Thursday expanded its services to allow Ukrainian citizens and refugees to receive payments from overseas, a move a senior Ukrainian official called a huge help as Russian forces continued to attack the country.
PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman told Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov in a letter that Ukrainians would also be able to transfer funds from their PayPal accounts to eligible credit and debit cards. The company has waived its fees on such transactions through June 30. 
More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, an action Russia has described as a ""special military operation."".
PayPal's move will allow refugees and Ukrainians to receive funds from friends and family members in the United States and elsewhere, and could also be used to transfer social payments by governments in the future, said Vladyslav Rashkovan, Ukraine's alternative executive director at the International Monetary Fund.
""It makes a huge difference for people,"" Rashkovan told Reuters, lauding Schulman's personal engagement in accomplishing the change in just two weeks.
Rashkovan said he spoke with some Ukrainians on the street outside his office about the new capability and they immediately opened an account at PayPal.com/ua/home https://www.paypal.com/ua/home to send money to their relatives. Ukrainian officials have been pushing for the expanded services since 2015, after Russia annexed the Crimea region, he added.
PayPal said it would start making the expanded services available on Thursday, with customers able to send and receive funds from their Ukrainian PayPal Wallet in dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds and euros. 
Once a customer transfers funds from their PayPal Wallet to an eligible Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard debit or credit card, the money will be available in the currency associated with that card.
While PayPal is waiving its fees for several weeks, it noted exchange rates and fees charged by a customer’s card issuer or bank account may still apply.

Previously, Ukrainian citizens could send money from PayPal accounts, but were unable to receive funds.
PayPal earlier this month shut down its services in Russia, joining many financial and tech companies in suspending operations there after its invasion of Ukraine.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican airline Grupo Aeromexico said on Thursday that it has emerged from bankruptcy protection, adding it now plans to spend $5 billion over the next five years on fleet modernization and other upgrades. 
The airline, which filed for bankruptcy after the pandemic sent demand plummeting, detailed plans to receive 22 more planes in 2022, bringing its total fleet of aircraft to 147 by the end of the year. The company last year signed a deal to buy 28 planes from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co , which it argued would result in $2 billion of savings.
The previously announced fleet upgrade could help reduce the company's fuel costs since Boeing 737 MAX cost 20% less than their predecessors to operate, said Rene Armas Maes, commercial vice president and aeronautical consultant at Jet Link International LLC.

Beyond upgrading its fleet, Aeromexico needs to implement technology that further reduces unit costs, so it can better compete with local low-cost carriers Volaris and Viva Aerobus, and its peers operating international routes, he said.
In a news release, the carrier said it will also restart some international routes it had halted during the pandemic, including to London, and open new ones.

(Reuters) -U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, hit by ongoing labor woes and the Omicron outbreak, and said second-half Ground margins will miss internal targets. 
Shares of FedEx fell 3.5% to $219.90 in extended trading.
E-commerce shipments fueled revenue at FedEx and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) during the COVID-19 pandemic, but FedEx has been less successful than its rival at translating that additional business into profit.
While labor challenges began to ease in the latest third quarter, FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said volume was softer than forecast due to Omicron. 
""As such, we expect our second-half Ground margins will be lower than our previous expectations and not reach double digits,"" Subramaniam said. 
Executives said volume rebounded as Omicron waned. Still, analysts called out the growing gap between the Ground operations at UPS and FedEx. 
""You guys are operating, give or take, at an 8% margin. UPS is on its way to 12(%). You guys used to be better,"" said Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group. 
""We're laser-focused on improving our margins,"" Subramaniam said.
In January, FedEx warned that Omicron infections had caused pilot shortages and delayed shipments in its aircraft-dependent Express operation. That news came after FedEx said staffing shortages in its non-union, contractor-based Ground division were hurting profits and delaying deliveries.
Meanwhile, the unionized workforce at UPS has been a bright spot in the tight U.S. labor market. UPS offers employees better pay and benefits than their non-union peers that deliver for FedEx and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which have struggled to hire and retain drivers and other key workers.
Memphis-based FedEx's adjusted net income for the fiscal third quarter increased almost 30% to $1.22 billion, or $4.59 per share. However, that missed analysts' call for a profit of $4.64 per share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S Estimates. 

Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 grew nearly 10% to $23.6 billion.
FedEx on Thursday affirmed the full-year forecast it reinstated in December, again calling for earnings excluding items of $20.50 to $21.50 per share. In September, FedEx lowered that range to $19.75 to $21.00 per share.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) -Electric carmaker Lucid is looking into raising prices for future models, its chief executive said on Thursday, citing ""huge inflationary pressures"" but said the company was committed to honoring prices for existing reservation holders.
""There's an inevitability that we will have to look at the price points of models that are coming out in the future,"" CEO Peter Rawlinson told Reuters, citing soaring nickel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
""I think it would be absolutely foolish of me to say we're never going to raise our prices,"" Rawlinson said in the interview on the sidelines of the South by Southwest music, technology and film festival (SXSW).
""What we want to do is to honor and keep our commitments to existing reservation holders. I think that's what was ill received in the market with Rivian.""
He was referring to this month's decision by electric truck maker Rivian to hike prices on existing reservations and then reverse course after consumers protested.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has recently raised vehicle prices in the United States and China after CEO Elon Musk said the biggest electric carmaker faces significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics. 
Lucid in February cut its production forecast for this year to a range of 12,000 to 14,000, from its original target of 20,000 vehicles, citing ""extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges."" Its shares slid after that announcement.
Rawlinson on Thursday said the bottlenecks were caused by a handful of suppliers for windshield glass, carpeting and some exterior trim parts. 
""I'm super frustrated because we're not gated by silicon chips, we're not gated by our ability to make electric motors,"" Rawlinson said.
Switching to different suppliers for those parts would compromise quality, he said. 
He questioned whether Rivian would be able to make a profit on its pickup trucks without raising prices, given the costs of battery packs. 
""I don't think even we could, with the best technology in the world, make an affordable, practical pickup,"" he said. 
Tesla, which is developing its own electric pickup, faces a ""primary challenge"" in making it affordable, CEO Elon Musk said this month. ""If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale & better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others,"" Musk said.

Rivian was not immediately available for comment.
Rawlinson also said Lucid has started on a prototype of in-house battery cell production, adding that it also has partnerships with battery suppliers Samsung (KS:005930) SDI and LG Energy Solutions.

682,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 06:50PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - S&P on Thursday lowered Russia's rating to 'CC' from 'CCC-', as the country reported difficulties meeting debt payments due on its dollar-denominated 2023 and 2043 Eurobonds.
Russia's payment woes stem from international sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the ratings agency said. The sanctions have reduced the country's available foreign exchange reserves and restricted its access to the global financial system.
""Although public statements by the Russian Ministry of Finance suggest to us that the government currently still attempts to transfer the payment to the bondholders, we think that debt service payments on Russia's Eurobonds due in the next few weeks may face similar technical difficulties,"" the agency said. 
Peer agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) had also cited concerns about Russia's ability to meet its debt obligations when cutting the country's rating by several notches earlier in March. 
Fitch said on Tuesday Russia's ratings would be further lowered to ""restricted default"" if the coupon payments are not made in U.S. dollars, in line with the original terms, by the end of a 30-day grace period.
Russian bonds are hovering at deeply distressed levels in very illiquid trading, with most issues trading less than a handful of times a day, according to Refinitiv data.
Adding to Moscow's debt troubles, an exemption that currently allows U.S. citizens or residents to receive Russian debt and equity payments will run out on May 25.

After the sanctions exemption deadline and until year-end, Russia is due to pay nearly $2 billion more on its external sovereign bonds.
Some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources told Reuters on Thursday. Some other creditors said they are yet to receive their funds but were optimistic they were on the way, according to the report.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions activity has tailed off after a record-breaking 2021, as the war in Ukraine adds to a bevy of distractions faced by corporate boards and management in their existing businesses.
Bankers and lawyers speaking at the Tulane Law conference in New Orleans on Thursday noted that while conversations were still taking place and deals would continue to get done, the market volatility of recent weeks has made signing off on acquisitions more tricky.
""I'm finding myself, as a banker, advocating 'no' to selling a company much more than I ever have before,"" said Gordon Dyal, the managing partner of investment banking advisory Dyal & Co.
""No matter how attractive that premium is, the chance the deal falls apart and it's 18 months or 12 months from now, even if you negotiate a huge break fee, it doesn't matter because it does not compensate a company for its lost franchise."" 
The widespread economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having significant ramifications on companies' operations, sucking up the attention of leadership and putting some inorganic growth plans on the backburner.
""It's very hard to have a board meeting to talk about M&A deals when you're sitting there wondering whether your general manager in Russia is going to go to jail for who knows how long, in a country where all of a sudden there truly are no rules,"" said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
Global dealmaking this year through mid-March is down around 20% on the same period in 2021, according to data provider Refinitiv.
While megadeals have tailed off, in the face of heightened regulatory scrutiny from the Biden administration, private equity firms continue to deploy substantial cash piles into new purchases.
Refinitiv data shows that while overall dealmaking is down, transactions involving buyout firms globally are up 12% year-to-date.
For corporations though, the ripples from war in Eastern Europe, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", are creating challenges on the back of emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, plus supply chain issues and inflationary pressures.
CONNECTIONS
A unique aspect of this is that many corporate boards, which have been refreshed with new directors in the last two years - either by choice or amid investor pressure - have not met in person during the pandemic, making building trust between boards and management more difficult.
Lawyers said this lack of connectivity makes boards more cautious about pursuing growth opportunities that could include acquisitions, sales or other structural changes.
""It is really hard to build up a sense of collegiality and trust and confidence in that environment. And, after all, boards are human beings and deals rely on people trusting each other and trusting the advice that they are receiving,"" said Melissa Sawyer, global head of M&A at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.
The Tulane event, one of the most influential gatherings in the dealmaking community, is hosting its 34th edition in person, having been forced online last year by the pandemic. Its last live conference in 2020 took place just days before lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 were implemented.
As well as enjoying the benefits of meeting others in the flesh, and reestablishing professional and personal connections, the dealmakers spoke of confidence that their business would be equally buoyant in the months ahead.

""It's busy. It's still busy. I think on the public side, we're seeing a lot of deals,"" said Barshay of Paul, Weiss.
""I still have the numbers, even if the sizes are a bit lower.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street stocks rebounded from early session losses on Thursday as investors weighed economic implications of the Federal Reserve's surprisingly aggressive interest rate stance, while oil prices surged on supply shortage concerns arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The Fed announced a quarter of a percentage point increase to near-zero interest rates on Wednesday, its first hike in nearly three years as it sought to combat soaring prices. The U.S. central bank also projected six more similarly sized rate hikes this year, sparking worries among traders about the effect on economic growth.
U.S. Treasury yields held just below three-year highs on Thursday and the closely-watched yield curve steepened, after earlier sitting at its flattest level in more than two years.
Benchmark 10- and 2-year yields were last at 2.1653% and 1.969%, respectively.
""The big surprise yesterday was the dot plot,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York, referring to the Fed's interest rate projections.
""It was a dovish hike but a hawkish rhetoric and outlook. We believe that if they get anywhere near their projections they'd invert the yield curve and cause a guaranteed recession."" 
On Wall Street, the three main indexes reversed early losses, driven by the healthcare, consumer discretionary, technology, and financial sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.23%, to 34,480.76, the S&P 500 gained 1.23% to 4,411.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.33% to 13,614.78.
""We had a relief rally yesterday and the market is digesting that today, consolidating a little bit and trying to get comfort with the reality versus expectations in terms of what the Fed is projecting,"" Hayes added.
European stocks also gained in choppy trading following the Fed rate hike and a similar move by the Bank of England.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.45%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.77%.
Oil prices rose more than 8%, continuing a series of wild daily swings, as the market rebounded from several days of losses on renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia.
Benchmark Brent crude futures settled 8.79% higher at $106.64 a barrel, its highest percentage gain since mid-2020. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 8.35% to $102.98 a barrel. 

The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against six trading currencies, was last down 0.47% at 98.026.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fox News on Thursday appealed a judge's decision to let voting systems company Smartmatic pursue a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit alleging that the network falsely accused it of rigging the 2020 U.S. presidential election against incumbent Donald Trump.
The network, part of Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp, also countersued Smartmatic to recoup legal costs, saying the lawsuit was designed to stifle its constitutionally protected right to inform viewers about newsworthy events.
Thursday's filing came nine days after Justice David Cohen of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan found a ""substantial basis"" to suggest that the network ""turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims"" about Smartmatic, evincing a ""reckless disregard"" for the truth.
""It is ironic that Fox claims that Smartmatic's lawsuit is without basis"" after that decision, Smartmatic's lawyer J. Erik Connolly said in an email. He said courts around the country reviewing similar claims ""are saying something very different.""
Smartmatic accused Fox News and several on-air personalities in its February 2021 lawsuit of decimating its business with a bogus narrative that its election software helped Democrat Joe Biden steal the 2020 election from Trump, a Republican.
The Florida-based company said Fox News did this to cater to Trump supporters, boost ratings and keep viewers from defecting to the smaller right-wing networks Newsmax and One America News.
In Thursday's filings, Fox News called the $2.7 billion damages claim ""pure fiction.""
It cited a report by University of Chicago law professor Daniel Fischel that Smartmatic had been a ""failing enterprise"" with $82.8 million of losses over five years and four straight years of declining revenue.
Fox News also said Smartmatic's claims violated New York's November 2020 ""anti-SLAPP"" law, short for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation"" and meant to protect journalists from frivolous lawsuits designed to harass critics.
""New York's anti-SLAPP statute was made for lawsuits like this one,"" Fox News said. ""The best way to deter baseless attacks on the freedoms of speech and efforts to chill the press is to provide robust protection for speech on matters of public concern.""
In a separate case, a federal judge on March 11 rejected Trump's bid to invoke the anti-SLAPP law against E. Jean Carroll, a writer who said Trump defamed her in 2019 by denying he raped her in the mid-1990s.
Cohen also let Smartmatic sue anchor Maria Bartiromo and former anchor Lou Dobbs and pursue some claims against former Trump lawyer and on-air guest Rudy Giuliani.

In December, a Delaware judge rejected Fox News' attempt to dismiss a similar $1.6 billion lawsuit by another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems.

The annual revenue of the world's largest custodian bank is also expected to reduce by $80 million to $100 million going forward, the bank said, adding it has halted buying Russian securities under its investment management business. 

Operating in Russia has become harder for Western financial institutions as international sanctions crimp the country's economy. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine ""a special operation"".
Last week, Wall Street giants  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) became the first major U.S. banks to announce they were unwinding their Russia business.

Investing.com – Stocks rallied on Thursday as investors settled into the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates at each of its remaining meetings this year, after lifting the short-term benchmark a quarter-point on Wednesday.
The Fed’s move was of course well-telegraphed and long expected. The central bank’s policy setting members are forecasting the fed funds rate to end up the year around 1.9%
Despite rising rates, tech stocks rose 1% on Thursday. Normally rising interest rates would spark a sell-off in growth stocks, but investors can’t seem to resist big tech companies.
The broader rally in stocks could also indicate investors believe the Fed will be able to fight inflation by raising rates without tipping the economy into a recession, as is what tends to happen.
Economic data on Thursday showed new claims for unemployment insurance dropped to 214,000 last week, beating expectations. Continuing claims dropped to the lowest level since 1970.
Earnings season is largely over, though a couple more reports are due out from GameStop and FedEx on Thursday after the closing bell.
President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk with China’s Xi Jinping on Friday, expected to emphasize the consequences of assisting Russia either militarily or financially in getting around Western sanctions for its incursion into Ukraine.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Another day watching oil
The International Energy Agency said three million barrels per day of Russian oil and products could be shut in from April, and that sent energy stocks up, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and APA (NASDAQ:APA) which rose more than 9%, 9% and 7%, respectively.
Occidental Petroleum was also boosted by news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) purchased 18.1 million more shares of Occidental.
2. Logistics play
FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)missed earnings per share expectations, while revenue exceeded forecasts thanks to a boom in online shopping. FedEx revealed earnings per share of $4.59 on revenue of $23.6 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.68 on revenue of $23.4 billion.
The company said its results benefited from lower variable compensation costs and less severe winter weather, resulting in favorable year-over-year comparisons. However, the positive numbers were partially offset by the effects of the Omicron variant and higher purchased transportation costs and wage rates.
3. GameStop earnings
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) fell more than 7% in after-market trading after it reported a fourth quarter loss of $1.86, from $1.39 a year earlier, but that missed expectations for a profit of 85 cents a share. Revenue rose to $2.25 billion from $2.12 billion a year earlier.
GameStop, one the original so-called meme stocks, entered into a partnership with Immutable X to create a marketplace for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The partnership will provide the company with up to $150 million in IMX tokens upon achievement of certain milestones.

Escondida's Union 1 requested an urgent meeting with company executives to discuss its complaints over promotions, saying many conditions in the contract were not being upheld by the firm, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
It asked the issues be resolved shortly or it will initiate ""labor actions,"" implying a stoppage.
This ""may mean, among other measures, the exercise of strikes or collective abstentions from work, for as long as is agreed,"" the union said in the letter. If the union calls for a stoppage, it will let the company know beforehand so measures can be adopted to ""safeguard"" company assets.
BHP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The union and the company signed the new collective contract last August.

In January, the union accused the firm of being erratic and irresponsible as COVID-19 infections had risen among the workforce.
Last year, workers at the mine won a historic benefits package at the bargaining table, which included bonuses distributed to all workers in equal parts, the union said at the time.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coupon payments on Russian sovereign bonds due this week were received by correspondent bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), processed and the bank then made an onwards credit to the paying agent Citi, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday, an indicator that the country may have averted default.
The payment received was a U.S. dollar payment, the source said. After being credited to the paying agent, it would be checked and distributed on to various bondholders, the source said. 
Russia said on Thursday it had made debt payments that were due this week. Russia was due to pay $117 million in coupon payments on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and some creditors had received payments, market sources separately told Reuters, also indicating it avoided what would have been its first external bond default in a century. 
The payments were widely seen as the first test of whether Moscow would meet its obligations after Western sanctions hobbled its financial dealings. 
The source said that JPMorgan's obligation as a foreign correspondent bank was to process payments, but that given the circumstances, also to check with authorities before doing so.
Sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have cut Russia off from the global financial system and blocked the bulk of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, while Moscow has in turn retaliated - all of which complicate payments. 
The bank checked with authorities before processing, the source said. Not to process the payment would have harmed bondholders, the source said. 

Under the sanctions and restrictions announced last month, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. banks were prohibited from correspondent banking - allowing banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days. Washington and its partners also started barring some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system - a step that will stop lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide.
A March 2020 report https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2003g.pdf by the Bank for International Settlements showed that correspondent banks have been ""paring back their cross-border banking relations for the past decade."" The number of correspondent banks fell by 20% between 2011 and 2018, even as the value of payments increased, the report said.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Thursday, led by energy as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s plan to hike rates several times this year, and the reports suggesting that a solution to ending the Ukraine-Russia war is still some ways off.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%, or 416 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3%.
Energy stocks rallied sharply, up more than 3%, as oil prices clawed back some recent losses to trade above $100 a barrel after Russia downplayed progress on peace talks with Ukraine.
The Kremlin reportedly said that news pointing to progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks was “wrong,” prompting investors to resume bets for a prolonged war that could disrupt energy supplies and keep oil prices rising.
Adding to expectations for a shortfall in supply, the International Energy Agency said three million barrels per day of Russian oil and products could be shut in from April.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and APA (NASDAQ:APA) were up more than 9%, 9% and 7% respectively.
Occidental Petroleum was also boosted by news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) purchased 18.1 million more shares of Occidental.
Consumer discretionary was also involved in the heavy lifting of the broader market, pushed higher by in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Garmin (NYSE:GRMN) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG).
Dollar General jumped more than 4% as the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 31% after reporting fourth-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines.
 Pagerduty Inc  (NYSE:PD) rallied more than 20% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, as new product launches helped bolster results.
Bank stocks, meanwhile, which delivered swashbuckling gains on Wednesday, failed to keep up momentum as the further flattening in the yield curve - when short term rates increase faster than longer term rates – added to worries about the Federal Reserve causing a recession by slowing the economy down too much.
Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) were down more than 1%.
“We would expect some type of inversion of the yield curve, which is definitely going to get the recession word thrown around much more given that it's going to skew growth to the downside,"" David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.

The Moscow District Arbitration Court was unable to provide information by phone and did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Google, which Tsargrad said blocked the YouTube account in July 2020, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Google was disputing a daily 100,000 rouble ($1,050) fine it was ordered to pay in April 2021 after failing to unblock Tsargrad TV's YouTube account, a Christian Orthodox channel owned by businessman Konstantin Malofeev.
The Moscow Arbitration Court said last year the daily fine would double each week that Google failed to comply. Tsargrad said Google already owes 1 billion roubles in fines, as of mid-March. 
""Currently, writs of execution have been issued, enforcement orders have been initiated and funds sufficient to fulfil the court acts have been seized from Google's accounts,"" Tsargrad said in a statement. 
A simmering confrontation between Moscow and foreign tech firms has escalated in light of the crisis in Ukraine, and Russia has blocked access to Meta Platforms Inc's flagship social media, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram. 
Tsargrad has said the fine would stop compounding when it hit 1 billion roubles. From September, that limit will be removed. 
The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Malofeev in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, which he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal.
Malofeev said Tsargrad intends to file new lawsuits against Google, demanding the channel's YouTube accounts be unblocked in other countries.
""Some local courts will refuse to support us, for example, in the United States, because I am under sanctions. And elswehere they will help us,"" Malofeev told Reuters. 

""Thank God Google exists in India, China, Brazil and other countries. We will collect the money there until the court decision is fully realised.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so.
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the franchisee, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company.
It was not immediately clear how to reach Kolobov for comment.
Shear's long letter highlights the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators.
On March 8,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia.
Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. 
But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.
Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions.
Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement.

There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote.
""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No.""

In a statement, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would welcome all MGM employees to the company and work with the studio's leadership, indicating there would not be layoffs. Its decision to close comes after a deadline passed for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to challenge the deal.
The Seattle-based retailer announced the transaction in May 2021, saying MGM offered a trove of content to draw consumers to its fast-shipping and streaming club Prime, which costs $14.99 per month in the United States.
Nearly a year later, Amazon is clear of regulatory hurdles. The European Commission approved the deal Tuesday, with no conditions. Likewise, Amazon earlier informed the FTC that it had ""substantially complied"" with requests for information about the deal.
According to Amazon, MGM's staff will join the organization of Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios.
MGM bolsters Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated ""Licorice Pizza"" and a long list of television shows that may help Amazon compete with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
Hopkins praised MGM's ""broad slate of original films and television shows.""
""We welcome MGM employees, creators, and talent to Prime Video and Amazon Studios, and we look forward to working together,"" he said in a statement.

An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific transaction but noted that the agency may challenge a deal after it closes ""if it determines that it violates the law.""
The FTC has a broader probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan had ruled in January for the FTC and seven states that accused Shkreli, the founder of Vyera Pharmaceuticals, of using illegal tactics to keep rivals out of the market while raising the price of the drug Daraprim to $750 per tablet from $17.50 in 2015.

She had also barred Shkreli, who is in prison, from the pharmaceutical industry for life. Another judge in February barred Shkreli from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.
An FTC spokesperson said it was ""pleased with the court's decision."" Lawyers for Shkreli did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) -European stocks gained in choppy trading on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve's widely anticipated U.S. interest rate hike, as investors eyed Russia-Ukraine peace talks. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%, paring March losses spurred by the Ukraine conflict.
Investors took in stride the long-expected start of a U.S. monetary tightening. The Fed increased rates by a quarter percentage point, as expected, and telegraphed equivalent hikes at every meeting for the rest of the year.
""It is not totally unexpected what the Fed said in terms of further rate hikes. What is worrying for the market is the confirmation of quantitative tightening that will come sooner or later,"" said Salvatore Bruno, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners.
Investors also ratcheted up bets of a rate hike by the European Central Bank and priced in a total increase of 50 basis points this year.

A company spokeswoman, who confirmed the increase, said it would be received by about 75,000 employees, but that it would not apply to pilots, who are covered under a union contract, and some others including senior-level executives.
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in the memo https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1504451363614375954?s=20&t=ifSBeySkf5jY2c-oi1nNHw to employees that the Atlanta-based airline is ""seeing healthy demand for spring and summer travel as customers continue to return to Delta, with corporate offices re-opening, business travelers rebuilding face-to-face relationships and international restrictions lifting.""
The ""base pay increase, for eligible scale and merit employees globally,"" Bastian wrote, ""is the direct result of the dedication, hard work and excellence that you demonstrate every day.""
He added that Delta continues to be ""optimistic in our ability to generate a profit this year.""

Bastian noted that it was March 2020 when ""the United States declared a national emergency over the COVID-19 outbreak, which began the most difficult and challenging time in the history of our company. We’ve come a long way since the darkest days of 2020.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will help planemaker Airbus in its effort to develop a hydrogen-powered passenger airplane, the companies said on Thursday.
Delta is the first U.S.-based airline the European planemaker is partnering with for hydrogen aircraft. Atlanta-based Delta said the partnership does not entail any financial investment on its part.
Airbus has plans to produce a small ""ZEROe"" passenger aircraft powered by hydrogen to enter service in 2035, and wants to get feedback from customers while the new aircraft is being developed, Amanda Simpson, vice president for research and technology at Airbus, said in an interview.
""We're in...the pre-product development phase, where we're trying to understand clearly what is the realm of the possible - what is going to work,"" Simpson told Reuters.
Last month, Airbus said it would build a demonstrator to test propulsion technology for hydrogen airplanes in co-operation with French-U.S. engine maker CFM International.
Amelia DeLuca, vice president of Sustainability at Delta, said the collaboration would focus on understanding the requirements for the new plane's deployment including the production of green hydrogen in the United States and its accessibility at the country's airports.
The carrier said the partnership would also advocate for a decarbonized future in aviation, including hydrogen pathways, with key stakeholders.

U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has been more skeptical about commercial prospects for hydrogen-powered air transport by 2035, putting greater public focus on sustainable aviation fuels.
Delta is one of the biggest customers of Airbus. As of end-December, it had 368 Airbus planes in its fleet. The company has purchase commitments for another 245 Airbus planes and has options for additional 120 aircraft.

(Reuters) -Impossible Foods founder Pat Brown will step down as chief executive and hand over the reins to Peter McGuinness, the former chief operating officer of Greek-yogurt maker Chobani, as the alternative meat producer expands rapidly and launches new products.
Brown, who founded the plant-based burger maker in 2011, will remain a director and take on the title ""Chief Visionary Officer"" to focus on research and technology and new initiatives, the company told Reuters.
McGuinness will be tasked with steering the company at a time when the plant-meat sector faces cooling demand after an investment frenzy in the past few years and launches by major fast food chains Burger King and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).
McGuinness, who takes over on April 4, plans to announce new launches and make the company's products available at more retail stores.
""We just need more people to try it,"" McGuinness said in an interview, adding that he is ""very bullish"" about the plant-meat sector.
""We have more work to do on the distribution side ... We could easily triple, if not, quadruple the distribution points (in the United States) at retail.""
Impossible's plans to launch new products and expand globally as well as the momentum in the brand mean ""the leadership demands of the commercial business will inevitably continue to grow,"" Brown wrote in a blog post on Thursday that confirmed the change in leadership.
Impossible launched a spate of products, including imitations of chicken nuggets,  sausages and  meatballs, last year as it looks to create more demand for its products. The company said its quarterly retail revenue at the close of 2021 jumped 85% year-over-year.
Rivals Maple Leaf Foods and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), however, flagged demand concerns in their latest quarterly results.
Reuters reported last year that Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based Impossible was exploring options for going public at a valuation of $10 billion or more.

McGuinness said there was no urgency as the company has enough capital to fuel its growth.
At Chobani, McGuinness also served as the company's president and was in charge of research and development and the company's expansion into new categories such as plant-based probiotic drinks, oat milks and coffees.

713,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 12:42PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment funds that market themselves as sustainable under European rules get similar levels of ""green revenues"" through the companies they invest in as traditional funds, according to a new study published on Thursday.
So-called ""green revenue"" is the percentage of sales generated from products that benefit the environment such as with cleaner water or contribute to mitigating climate change. 
Clarity AI, a sustainability data technology platform part-owned by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), analysed 31,000 funds to assess how they perform against a new European Union classification system that defines a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. Its research found that just 3.6% of revenues globally are ""green"".
Under the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, fund managers can classify their products by the degree to which they promote environmental, social and governance goals. 
They can market themselves as either Article 8, which means fully or partly focused on environmental, social or sustainability issues, or a more stringent Article 9, which means fully focused on sustainable objectives. 
Investments that fund firms class as Article 6 mean that they do not focus on sustainability.
Clarity found that for Article 8 funds, 3.9% of their revenue through the portfolio companies they own can be classified as green, similar to the 3.1% share for Article 6 products.
Funds in the smaller pool of Article 9 had 15% of revenue as green.
""Article 8 funds are defined as 'promoting E or S characteristics', which is a vague term. As such, we are seeing the market interpreting this term often by integrating a very light touch of sustainability-related considerations into their strategy,"" Patricia Pina, Clarity AI's Head of Product Research & Innovation, told Reuters.

While new and still-emerging EU regulatory frameworks have been hailed for trying to improve transparency in the fast-growing world of ESG finance, vague definitions can result in managers loosely interpreting the sustainability credentials of their funds.
Earlier this year Morningstar, which closely tracks the funds industry, stripped more than 1,000 funds of their ESG label in its classification system after finding they did not live up to their sustainability claims.

Total sales in 2022 jumped 50% and the company is now forecasting the growth to be around 6% in the current year, notwithstanding its decision to stop buying diamonds and precious stones mined in Russia.
Total revenue in 2023 is seen between $8.03 billion and $8.25 billion with profit per share at $12.64 at the midpoint of its guidance range.
The company improved its U.S. market share by 2.7 percentage points to 9.3% for the year.

The company has hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 11%, to 20 cents per share. Margins improved on higher sales and tighter control on distribution costs. This was even as selling, general and administrative expenses rose because of advertising to push holiday sales.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 29% to $2.8 billion. Brick and mortar sales were higher as customers returned to stores, shunning online that grew in the single digit range.
Both average transaction value and number of transactions were higher in North America. However, in international markets, average transaction value fell even as quantum of transactions went up.

718,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 12:26PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russian oil market participants have switched their trading tactics, favouring private deals over public offerings due to new Western sanctions, traders said on Thursday.
About a quarter of Russian oil exports, including flagship Urals and ESPO Blend oil grades, is usually sold on a spot basis, normally via public tenders in which a number of companies generally have been invited. 
As of March 17, Russian oil companies haven't issued any spot tenders for May ESPO Blend, which would normally be offered in tenders by this time. No spot tenders for Urals loading in early April have been issued either, according to the loading plan for April 1-5 released on Wednesday, traders said.
Spot tenders had been a perfect instrument to place spot barrels, and the results of the tenders were used by the market as a price reference.
Since the end of February, however, tenders have been shunned by buyers spooked by sanctions imposed on Russia by Western nations targeting Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
As part of its sanctions, the United States has implemented a ban on Russian oil. However, the European Union - a much larger importer - has not.
Even so, there has been a chilling effect on the oil trade with buyers loath to be seeing doing business with Moscow, and U.S. and EU sanctions on Russian banks have complicated deal-making.
""Tenders are of no use now. They only frighten potential buyers,"" a source with a Russian oil company told Reuters.

Russia's Surgutneftegaz and Zarubezhneft companies have failed to place Urals oil in tenders, while India's ONGC was unable to attract bids in a tender for Sokol crude. 
Russian oil companies and foreign buyers have been looking for workarounds to their regular trading practices given the sanctions-related pressure on the market, such as offering alternative payment methods and conducting transactions in alternative currencies.

LYON, France (Reuters) - When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie decided to let his staff work a four-day week, on the same pay as before, he knew he risked hurting his bottom line. ""Some people took me for a crazy person,"" he recalled.
But a year on, he says the opposite has happened: his LDLC company selling consumer technology has increased its annual turnover by 40% without hiring any extra staff.
The secret, he said, is that the approximately 1,000 people his firm employs feel trusted and appreciated, and so they are more productive.
""At the end of the day, it's brought only good things for the team,"" said 51-year-old de la Clergerie.
As the world emerges from a pandemic that prompted many people to re-evaluate their work-life balance, companies and workers around the world are asking if, like de la Clergerie's firm, they could work less.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gave its 2,300 Japan-based employees Fridays off in 2019, and said it saw productivity rise 40%. Consumer group Unilever (NYSE:UL) launched a four-day week trial for local staff in New Zealand. Spanish telecoms company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has trialled a four-day week for 10% of its domestic workforce.
Johann Peters, who works in one of LDLC's stores near its headquarters in a suburb of Lyon, south-east France, uses the extra day off to head to the supermarket to pick up his weekly shopping. He then takes his daughter, 9-year-old Melissa, to her tennis practice.
""You come into work after your day off much more rested, and more efficient operationally,"" he said.
De la Clergerie said before he embarked on the change, he worked out that even in the worst case scenario, it would add to labour costs by at most 1.5 million euros per year. He said he felt that was a manageable risk.
Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves were down, and that the company had not had to hire new people to offset the reduction in hours worked. 
Though the four-day week was not the only factor involved, de la Clergerie said it had contributed to a jump in turnover from around 500 million euros before the change, to close to 700 million euros ($769.86 million) since then.
Celine Henniaux, a 36-year-old who works in one of the firm's distribution centres, said she had no desire to go back to the way things were before.
""No no,"" she said. ""We've got a taste for having a day off during the week.""

""Purchasing power, the price of petrol, the price of gas are worries for people and the mood may not be as good as we had hoped,"" said Tornare, who has been leading the brand since 2017.
He said, however, that most markets, in particular the United States, were still doing well, and he was confident the brand would achieve double-digit sales growth in the first quarter and was also aiming for that for the year as a whole.
Rival Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) confirmed on Thursday it expects double-digit sales growth this year and no material impact on business from the crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Tornare said Russia was not a key market for the brand, even though it had a long history there. ""When the situation allows it, we'll redeploy means to develop that market,"" he said.
Its parent company LVMH temporarily closed its 124 boutiques in Russia on March 6, saying it would continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country.
He said new lockdowns in China to rein in COVID-19 were a concern, but China remained an important growth driver in the longer term. ""We had a good start in China in January. February and March were a bit more quiet.""
Tornare said the brand wanted to absorb part of the higher costs for energy and raw materials, but would raise prices globally by 2% to 4% on certain collections within the next weeks. The average price is currently at 10,000 euros ($11,087.00), 30% higher than when Tornare took over as CEO.

Based in Le Locle in western Switzerland, Zenith is known for its El Primero watch mechanisms launched in 1969 that only survived the arrival of battery-powered quartz watches in the 1970s because a foreman hid the tools and plans in an attic at the factory against management orders. Modernised versions of the El Primero still power Zenith watches today, notably its Defy collection.

(Reuters) -  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) on Thursday forecast sales and profit for 2022 above estimates, as higher prices of everyday essentials make more Americans frugal and turn to discount stores for their groceries and household supplies.
U.S. discount stores have seen improving store traffic, as people gradually resume their pre-pandemic life after an Omicron-led pause.
The pandemic-led trend of cooking at home, however, has sustained as restaurants have raised prices, keeping grocery sales elevated. Dollar General, in particular, has been adding fresh produce to more stores, while also doubling down on frozen and refrigerated categories.
It also said products priced $1 or less form one-fifth of its assortment, while rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) recently raised product prices to $1.25 from $1.
""Our customer runs out of money before that month runs out. And that $1 bridges that last few days for her, always has, and that continues to do so,"" Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said during an earnings call.
Dollar General forecast fiscal 2022 net sales to increase about 10%, while analysts on average expect growth of 7.5%, according to Refinitiv IBES. It also projected profit growth of 12% to 14%, versus estimates of 9.3%.
That compares to dull sales forecast from Dollar Tree, which typically sells more non-essentials.
""There's no question that Dollar General has significantly outperformed Dollar Tree from an execution standpoint,"" Truist Securities analyst Scot Ciccarelli said.

Dollar General's shares, however, pared premarket gains to trade 3% higher as cost pressures, supply disruptions and waning impact of stimulus checks prompted it to forecast a downbeat first quarter.
It expects to earn between $2.25 and $2.35 per share and same-store sales to decline 1% to 2% for the quarter ending April 29. Analysts expect same-store sales to increase 1% and adjusted per-share earnings of $2.73.

Alnylam said it was seeking damages over the use of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to carry and deliver genetic material into the body.
Representatives for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuits.
Shares of Moderna, whose lone commercial product is its COVID vaccine, were off about 4%. Pfizer shares were up 1.7% and Alnylam was up 2%. 
Alnylam's lawsuit against Moderna says it discussed licensing its technology to the company in late 2013 or 2014, and shared confidential information about it with Moderna at the time.
The lawsuit against Pfizer said Alnylam's LNP technology is also ""essential"" to the effectiveness and safety of Pfizer's vaccine.
Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS) Corp separately sued Moderna in Delaware federal court last month, claiming Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine infringes its patents, which also relate to RNA-delivery technology.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has also implied it may sue Moderna over a vaccine-related patent application that NIH says should have listed its scientists as co-inventors.

Alnylam asked the court for an undisclosed amount of money damages from Pfizer and Moderna. It said in a statement it does not intend to take action that impedes the production, sale or distribution of the vaccines.
Moderna has said its vaccine earned the company $17.7 billion in revenue in 2021. Pfizer said last month that it expected $32 billion in revenue from its vaccine this year.

Microsoft simultaneously announced plans for the construction of the data centres, which will be powered by renewable energy, with their location chosen to allow for recycling of heat created from the cooling of computer servers.
District heating is widely used in Finland, pumping hot water through pre-insulated underground pipes, and has traditionally relied on fossil fuel sources.
Fortum operates a system of underground pipes stretching 900 kilometres and serving 250,000 users in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Once completed, the data centres will account for 40% of the system's heat supplies, the two firms said.
Fortum said its investment for the heat capture side from the data centres was estimated at 200 million euros ($221 million), with expectations this would cut some 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
Microsoft declined to say how much it would invest in the centres.
It estimated however that it would initially require some 400-500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy per year, which it said was comparable in scope to other local industries such as a paper or pulp mill.

Microsoft plans to buy the electricity via one or several long-term power purchasing agreements (PPA), although no supplier has yet been selected, the company told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) shares rose on Thursday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it spent nearly $1 billion on additional shares in the oil company, giving it a 14.6% stake.
Berkshire disclosed in a Wednesday night regulatory filing that it owns 136.4 million Occidental shares, including 18.1 million purchased between Monday and Wednesday.
Buffett's company began disclosing this month that it was investing in Occidental common stock, on top of $10 billion in preferred stock it already owned. Berkshire has spent at least $6.4 billion on the common stock, regulatory filings show.
In morning trading, Occidental shares were up 8.5% at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. They traded below $9 as recently as October 2020.
Occidental shares have benefited in part from rising oil prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a special operation.
Vicki Hollub, Occidental's chief executive, said this month that supply chain troubles and labor shortages make it difficult for oil companies to ramp up production to meet demand.
Occidental is also trying to cut debt by more than half and boost payouts to shareholders, including through a higher dividend announced last month.
Berkshire bought its preferred stock in 2019 to help finance Occidental's $35.7 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The preferred stock throws off $800 million of annual dividends. Berkshire also has warrants to buy $5 billion of additional Occidental stock at $59.62 per share.

It isn't clear whether Berkshire is funding its latest purchases with available cash or by selling other stocks it owns, which include  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents. It was a net seller of stocks in 2021, and Buffett said in his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter ""we find little that excites us"" in equity markets.

Investing.com – Guess (NYSE:GES) stock climbed 8% Thursday after the retailer posted better fourth quarter margins than anticipated, persuading traders to ignore the misses on both sales and profit fronts.
Adding to the gains is the company’s plan to do a $175 million accelerated share repurchase.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter rose 3.6% to 15.7% because of higher markups, fewer discounts, and lower occupancy costs. Retailers have been able to cut back on discounts as demand has stayed elevated while inventories are stabilizing.
The gains were partially offset by lower comparable sales in Europe and higher inbound freight costs.
Assuming no meaningful COVID-related shutdowns, the company expects 2023 revenue to grow in low-single digits. It forecast a deterioration in operating margin, but still sees it close to 10.5% for the year. Revenue in 2022 was $2.6 billion.
Fourth quarter adjusted profit per share was $1.14, while revenue was down 5% to $800 million.
CEO Carlos Alberini said the company’s 26% return on invested capital for the year is the highest it has been in ten years.
“Our balance sheet is strong, and we plan to use our capital opportunistically to return value to our shareholders through dividends and increased share repurchases.”
The company will pay a quarterly dividend of 22 cents.
For the current quarter, the company is expecting first quarter revenue to be up in low-teens."

SYDNEY/MILAN (Reuters) -Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti Group is expected to kick off on Monday the process to list its shares in Hong Kong, aiming for a valuation of around $1 billion as it sells a 25% stake, two sources close to the matter said.
Ferretti, controlled by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group, is pushing ahead with its initial public offering (IPO) despite the conflict in Ukraine rattling financial markets and hitting shares in the superyacht sector.
The pre-marketing phase ends on Friday and the company, which ditched a previous IPO attempt in Milan in 2019, could still change its plans depending on the market.
Ferretti has sought to play down the impact of international sanctions against Russian oligarchs on its business. It has said that countries involved in the conflict account for less than 3% of its revenues and it has no exposure to the largest mega-yachts more likely to be targeted by sanctions.
Shares in listed Italian rivals such as Sanlorenzo and The Italian Sea Group plunged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, shedding between a quarter and a third of their value, but have cut losses in the past 10 days. 
""The supportive environment enjoyed by the yachting industry over the past 12 months will continue over the mid-term,"" Berenberg said in a recent note, adding the share slide provided a good entry point.
Ferretti met with investors and analysts over the past two weeks and it is slated to launch the institutional offering on Monday, broadening it to retail investors the following day, one of the sources said.
Having met interest including from Western names and securing support from cornerstone investors that could make up about 60% of the deal, it aims to raise $300 million selling newly-issued shares for an overall valuation of around $1.2 billion, the source said.
A second source pointed to a $900 million valuation.
Both sources said shares are expected to start trading at the end of March. IPOs in Hong Kong normally take around four days with another five days before the trading debut.
Ferretti is expected to use the proceeds to expand its range of yachts while also developing services such as yacht brokerage and chartering.
The 54-year-old company, which runs six shipyards in Italy, owns brands such as Pershing, Riva and Wally, in addition to Ferretti Yachts.

Ferretti filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the end of December, with investment bank CICC as sole sponsor as well as joint global coordinator together with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY).
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained more than 5% on Thursday, adding to Wednesday's 9% surge driven by the prospect of fresh Chinese economic stimulus.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has undermined hopes for renewed growth in Central Europe's car industry this year and for the wider economy, just as businesses were looking forward to a recovery from the pandemic.
Audi Hungaria Chairman Alfons Dintner told a media briefing the factory in the western town of Gyor was already changing its engine manufacturing shifts and had stopped exports to Russia, in line with a decision by Audi owner Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
But the impact on the Hungarian factory would ""not be dramatic"" he said, adding that the plant produced 1.6 million engines last year, including 250,000 electric drivetrains.
""Our revenue will be slightly lower, but this is still the beginning of the year, and we have lots of serious opportunities, so there is a good chance for us to make up for many things by the end of the year,"" Dintner said.
Suzuki's Hungarian factory has also suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine as of March, while German premium carmaker Daimler-Benz said it had lowered output to two shifts at its Hungarian plant.

Dintner said the Hungarian Audi factory, whose revenue rose by 2.6% to 7.7 billion euros ($8.52 billion) last year, had fulfilled all orders so far despite supply chain challenges, adding that its order books were in a good shape.

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to ask a judge to stop the deal in February, saying it would give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs. 
Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump, said that the trial would last 12 days with the Justice Department allotted seven days and the companies five.
The companies had asked for the trial to start around June 20 while the government had suggested August 24.
In their answer to the government's complaint, UnitedHealth and Change said that one of concerns that the government had about the deal would be moot because they planned to sell Change's claims editing business, which they advertise as a way to ""improve payment accuracy, reduce appeals, and reap both medical and administrative savings.""
The companies said that they would fight the government on the other harm allegedly caused by the merger. The government had said that UnitedHealth could misuse data from Change's network and hoard innovations so as to better compete in selling health insurance to big corporations.
""Plaintiffs' hypothetical speculation about data and innovations ignores stark market realities and is entirely inconsistent with UHG's long history,"" the companies said in their answer to the government complaint. 

UnitedHealth announced the all-cash deal in January 2021, saying it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.
UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims and together serve 38 of the top-40 health insurers in the country, the Justice Department said in the complaint. They would have at least 75% of that market, it said.

The Japanese government on Dec. 24 selected three consortiums, all led by Mitsubishi, as the operators of offshore wind farms in Akita, northern Japan, and Chiba, near Tokyo, with a total generation capacity of 1.7 gigawatts (GWs).
Mitsubishi's rivals were stunned by the low tariff prices the trading house's group had proposed - 11.99 yen ($0.1) per kilowatt hour (kWh), 13.26 yen kWh and 16.49 yen kWh - far below a ceiling price of 29 yen kWh.
But Yoshihiro Iwasaki, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions Ltd, said on Thursday: ""We will be fine.""
""We made our bids by accumulating all the costs from suppliers, after thinking out specifications and construction methods to trim expenses,"" he told Reuters on the sideline of the Smart Energy Week event.
""That was after we had examined all the risk factors and made thorough discussions with our group's experts at home and abroad.""
One executive at an overseas wind power company, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the issue, predicted Mitsubishi will likely make losses following its success at the auction.
""The results sent a shockwave to the industry as their prices were so low,"" he said, speaking on the sidelines of the same event.
Asked whether Mitsubishi will make bids with similar or lower tariff prices in the future tenders, Iwasaki said it will depend on a project as each site has different conditions.

A number of global wind power companies such as Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Germany's RWE are keen to enter Japan's market. The government plans to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040.

The company said it lost sales of around $15 million to disruption caused by Omicron at the start of the year. It cost the company 3 percentage points of growth, Warby Parker said. The company has, for long, strived to prove that eyewear retailing can be a business of scales and profits.
The company now expects current-year revenue to be $655 million at the midpoint of its guidance range, up 21%. This compares to the 2021 revenue of $541 million, which grew over 37% year-over-year.
WRBY went public through a direct listing on NYSE in September. Its market cap has since halved to $3 billion now.
The company closed the year with 161 stores across U.S. and Canada; opened 35 new stores year-to-date, including seven openings in the quarter. It has a unique ‘Buy a Pair, Give a Pair’ program under which it gives a pair to someone in need against every pair of glasses or sunglasses sold.
Margins improved slightly in the quarter due to the scaling up of progressive lenses business, partially offset by increased penetration of contact lenses.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose due to higher staff compensation and more spending on marketing to push sales in the holidays.
Net revenue jumped 17.8% year-over-year to top $133 million. Net loss was higher by $41.6 million, reaching $46 million due to higher SG&A expenses."

The decision means Samsung is not restricted on its sales under Russian law, although the company said this month - in a move unrelated to the case - it would halt shipments of devices to Russia because of ""geopolitical developments"".
Many foreign firms have halted business in Russia after Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.
The lawsuit against the South Korean company filed last year by Switzerland-based SQWIN SA claimed Samsung Pay infringed its electronic payment system patent registered in Russia.
The ban was never implemented because Samsung appealed the initial ruling and efforts by SQWIN SA for interim measures to be imposed were not granted.
The Russian court upheld Samsung's appeal, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
Court officials did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
""We are fully satisfied with the appeal decision and that Samsung's arguments were carefully considered and accepted,"" said Natalia Gulyaeva, managing partner at Hogan Lovells in Moscow, one of Samsung's legal consultants on this case. 
Samsung said it welcomed the decision. SQWIN SA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

A court ruling in October listed 61 Samsung models the company was prohibited from importing and selling in Russia, citing the patent numbers.

Investing.com -- Wall Street rallied in New York on Thursday, lifted by the energy sector after strong data on jobs followed the expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. 
By 4:12 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 417 points, or 1.2%, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.3%. The Dow rose 1.5% on Wednesday after the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points and signaled at least another six quarter-point increases over the next 12 months.
The hike had long been anticipated by markets, which chose to focus instead on the accompanying economic forecasts from the Fed, which suggested that the tightening cycle could proceed without causing a recession.
Also helping the mood on Wednesday had been reports of a detailed peace plan drafted by Ukraine and Russia. However, the Kremlin said Thursday that reports of significant progress were ""wrong"" and Russia has reacted angrily to President Joe Biden's designation of Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday. The comments followed reports of a Russian strike on a theater in Mariupol that was being used as a shelter by hundreds of civilians of all ages.
Analysts warned against what appeared to be some ""magical thinking"" by both the Fed and by some market participants, noting that even a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will not remove all the headwinds currently blowing.
""It would be unwise to assume that even if actions do follow words, there is a return to the pre-war status quo,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Wealth Management, in a morning briefing. ""Sanctions are likely to be unwound slowly...There has been an irreparable break in how the world works.”
Thursday will be the busiest day this week for U.S. economic data. Weekly jobless claims came in at 214,000, slightly below expectations. February housing starts rose 6.8% and building permits were down 1.9%. The Philly Fed index was 27.4, above expectations for a reading of 15. 
In corporate news, Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) quarterly report included guidance that was above expectations and a warning about the loss of business in Russia, while Dollar General (NYSE:DG) more or less met estimates for profit and revenue. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports after the bell.
In commodity markets, oil prices have rebounded as the Kremlin downplayed peace talks, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates rebuffed pleas from U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for more oil.

By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 88 points, or 0.3% at 33,975 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. The Dow had gained 1.5% on Wednesday, the S&P 2.2% and the Nasdaq 3.8%. 
The market appeared unable to shake its fixation with the war in Ukraine, which continues to escalate with reports of Russia sending reinforcements to the region from the Far East and Caucasus, as well as shelling targets around Odesa, an important port city still under Ukrainian control. The U.S. said it will send $1 billion in additional military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday, including armed drones. The White House said earlier that President Joe Biden will talk to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about the war and other matters of mutual interest on Friday. 
Earlier, new data showed a sharp rebound in U.S. housing starts in February, while building permits stayed close to their highest levels in 15 years.

Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs both fell 6.6%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) fell 11%. Robin Brooks, an economist with the International Institute of Finance, noted that China is currently experiencing substantial capital outflows even while other emerging markets are receiving inflows.

739,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 09:46AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -IT consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates and flagged a potential impact to its business if the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict continued.
The upbeat forecast, which did not include the impact from the war, helped drive shares 2.4% higher in early trading.
Earlier this month, Accenture said it was discontinuing business in Russia. Revenue from the country stood at about $120 million during fiscal 2021, a fraction of its overall revenue of $50.53 billion in the year.
Chief Financial Officer KC McClure told analysts the forecast took into account the revenue impact of discontinuing its business in Russia and the cost of winding it down. 
But it was difficult to predict the impact of the war since it was still very early, and hence the forecast ""does not take into account any significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the complex current scope,"" she added.
The company expects current-quarter revenue between $15.70 billion and $16.15 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.11 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Sanctions and other measures imposed on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty, Accenture said. 
The company, whose clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500 companies across communications, media & technology as well as financial services industries, is also strategically investing in cloud, acquisitions and partnerships to gain more market share.

Revenue for the second quarter stood at $15.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $14.65 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.54 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $2.39 per share.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) does not expect a material negative impact on its sales or regarding access to raw materials following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its Chief Executive said on Thursday.
Nick Hayek said Russia accounted for around 1% of group sales and it didn't source any gold from the country that has been hit by western sanctions. The company's cheaper Tissot and Swatch labels were its biggest brands in Russia, showing its business there was ""not only oligarchs,"" he told a press conference on its already announced annual results.
""We have no sources (of) gold in Russia,"" Hayek said. ""The other precious materials, we also have a lot of stock and multi sourcing ... so for the Swatch Group, we see no impact, except for prices that will maybe go up over the mid or long term.""
""We are shocked about the situation, it's only been three weeks,"" Hayek said. ""We should all take three deep breaths and hope a solution will be found.""
The group, also known for Omega and Longines timepieces, said last week it had temporarily suspended the operations of its stores in Russia ""due to the increasing complexity and difficulty of the situation"" after initially only halting exports.
Doing business in Russia has become complex since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States, Britain and the Europe Union to impose sweeping sanctions.
Only about 1% of Swiss watches were exported to Russia last year, watch federation statistics http://www.fhs.swiss/eng/statistics.html show, but wealthy Russians also like buying luxury goods abroad. 

Swatch Group sells many watches via wholesale partners, but Hayek said it also had 52 stores in Russia. 
One of its brands, Longines, opened its first flagship store in Moscow last year and Swatch Group's more affordable Tissot brand also developed its retail network and signed agreements for new monobrand pop-up stores in various regions in Russia. Its Swatch brand also opened two new stores in Moscow last year.

Investing.com – Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock jumped 3% in premarket Thursday after the discount chain issued a strong forecast for 2022, led by hopes that inflation will drive bargain-hunting consumers to its stores.
Adding to the gains in the stock is a 31% higher quarterly dividend.
Dollar General is also opening more pOpshelf stores aimed at wealthier customers who enjoy a treasure-hunting experience. It is maintaining its pricing even as rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) recently completed its exercise of putting most of its products under the $1.25 price point, junking the 35-year practice of charging $1 for a majority of items.
Dollar General expects 2022 net sales to rise about 10% while it targets 1,110 new store openings in the year. The forecast is a sharp jump after net sales rose 1.4% in the year ended January 28. It also compares favorably with rival Dollar Tree’s forecast of a less than 6% growth. Dollar General’s profit per share is seen rising 12-14% on a diluted basis for the year.
The company’s same-store sales fell during the quarter as well as in the year as customer traffic fell, going through upheavals due to the virus.
Fourth quarter net sales rose 2.8% to $8.7 billion, mainly due to new stores. They were lower than estimates; thanks to same-store sales falling 1.4%, driven by a decline in customer traffic but partially offset by an increase in average transaction amount.
Same-store sales declined in each of the apparel, consumables, seasonal, and home products categories.
Diluted earnings per share fell 2% to $2.57, but ahead of estimates."

(Reuters) - Cineworld expressed confidence on Thursday that a meatier slate of movies in 2022 would help the British cinema chain bounce back from a two-year lull, although its mounting debt pile remained a challenge.
The world's second largest cinema chain with over 9,000 screens globally, Cineworld said its 2021 losses narrowed to $708 million from about $3 billion in 2020, thanks partly to Marvel superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".
This year it is pinning hopes on sequels such as James Cameron's ""Avatar 2"" and Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun: Maverick"" as well as several Marvel films.
But any movie delays and further COVID-19 restrictions that could hit ticket sales pose a risk to its ability to repay credits due in June and early 2023, Cineworld said.
Its net debt stood at $8.9 billion at end-December, up some $600 million from 2020. Refinitiv data showed its credit score had sunk to 1, the lowest on a scale of up to 100, meaning it was highly likely to default in the next year.
Cineworld's setbacks include a potential multi-million-dollar fine in a dispute with Canada's Cineplex and delayed payments to disgruntled former shareholders of its U.S. chain Regal.
Cineworld has warned that it would not have enough liquidity to pay the C$1.23 billion ($971 million) sought by Cineplex as damages if its court appeal is unsuccessful.
It is now looking for new sources of liquidity after raising over $425 million last year, it said on Thursday.

Cineworld, which operates in 10 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, admitted 95 million movie-goers in 2021, up 75% over 2020, but well below the 275 million seen pre-pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp, Murata Manufacturing Co (OTC:MRAAY) Ltd,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp and other precision parts makers halted some operations on Thursday after an earthquake jolted the country's northeast, the latest blow to the global supply chain.
Even as Japan's dominance of consumer electronics had faded, manufacturers have carved out a world-leading niche in highly specialised components such as Murata's ceramic capacitors and Sony's image sensors.
Thursday's production halt comes after pandemic-related component shortages have already hobbled production of autos and electronics globally.
""An earthquake stopping production is a pure negative given components are currently selling as fast as you can make them,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute.
The magnitude 7.4 tremblor struck just before midnight on Wednesday east of the Fukushima prefecture, the same area that suffered Japan's biggest quake 11 years ago.
Renesas last year emerged as a supply chokepoint after a fire broke out at its Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture. 
The firm, which makes nearly a third of the microcontroller chips used in cars globally, said on Thursday it had temporarily halted production at two plants and partially stopped output at a third.
Among them was the advanced 300 millimetre wafer Naka plant. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) said as much as 80% of its lost vehicle production in the second quarter of last year was due to the fire. 
Kyoto-based Murata, the top global supplier of ceramic capacitors, which are used in smartphones, computers and cars, said it had suspended operations at four factories following the quake. 
A fire, later extinguished, broke out at one facility producing chip inductors, it said.
Highlighting the strain on the auto industry, Japan's largest automaker,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, said its global production target would be 10% lower in May and 5% lower in June than previously estimated.
The revised estimates did not include the impact of the quake, it said.
While many of the companies are not household names in the West, such makers are increasingly being seen as key national assets amid growing tech competition between China and the United States. 
One of Japan's best known conglomerates, Sony, said it halted production at two factories in Miyagi prefecture and a third factory in Yamagata prefecture producing storage media, laser diodes and image sensors. 

The firm said later that production would be restarted gradually. 
Chipmaker Kioxia said some production equipment at a factory in Iwate prefecture stopped automatically after shaking caused by the quake was detected.

LONDON (Reuters) -Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer said it would no longer insure most new oil and gas projects following mounting pressure on big business to do more to help the world cap global warming.
Last year, the International Energy Agency report said no more new oil and gas fields should be developed if a target of capping planetary warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average by mid-century is to be met.
In its annual sustainability report on Thursday, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said it would no longer insure projects that get the go-ahead from their parent company from 2022, unless the company has an independently verified, science-based plan to reach net-zero emissions.
By 2025, Swiss Re said it wanted half of its overall oil and gas premiums to come from companies aligned with such a net-zero by 2050 plan, and by 2030 all its clients in the sector should have done so.
Also, from 2022, the company said it will no longer insure companies or projects with more than 10% of their production in the Arctic, apart from Norwegian producers.
On the issue of treaty reinsurance, whereby it insures bundles of risk in a job lot, Swiss Re said it expected to finalise a policy for the oil and gas sector in 2023.
The shift by Swiss Re was an important signal from ""one of the world's ultimate risk managers,"" Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of NGO Insure Our Future, said.
""Oil and gas operations need to be phased out in accordance with climate science or they may become uninsurable by the end of the decade.""
Bosshard said the onus was on rivals Munich Re, Lloyd's and SCOR, which account for 26% of the global reinsurance market, to commit to even greater action ahead of their annual general meetings.

""The policy is not perfect yet and we encourage its peers to build on it to fully align with a realistic 1.5°C scenario,"" Lucie Pinson, director of Reclaim Finance, said.
""As the IEA Net Zero Roadmap shows, this should mean drawing a red line against fossil fuel expansion and excluding both projects and companies that cross that line well before 2025.""

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - To keep factory lines open in the face of COVID curbs Chinese firms are asking workers to eat, sleep and work in bubbles isolated from the wider world, sterilising premises as often as three times a day and testing for COVID daily.
Dubbed ""closed-loop management"", this approach has been part of China's efforts over the past two years to keep local transmission extremely low by global standards.
It was used for example at the Winter Olympics in Beijing to seal event personnel off from the public. 
It is now being touted by local Chinese authorities as a solution for companies who want to stay open as the country tackles its biggest outbreak in two years. 
Many of the harshest curbs have been applied in manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, forcing numerous factories to shut. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn said it was able to restart some production at its campus in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen after it put such an arrangement in place. 
State media outlet Securities Times said on Thursday that television maker TCL Corp, chip fab Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, and Apple supplier Shenzhen Deren Electronic Co Ltd were keeping factories in affected areas open via closed loop systems. 
The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is planning a similar arrangement for its Shanghai factory, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, Shenzhen, which has suspended buses, subways and all non-essential economic activity in a week-long containment programme, said it will allow firms to resume work in an ""orderly"" manner.
TOUGH REQUIREMENTS 
Creating such bubbles, however is not easy. Foxconn said it could only apply the bubble on campuses that included both employee housing and production facilities. 
Jin Yong, a factory worker in Shenzhen, told Reuters he had not stepped out of the electronics plant where he works since late February, when they started operating a ""closed-loop"" system for more than 2,000 workers. 
While it was slightly depressing to not be able to leave for a walk, he said he felt that it was a good approach to battle COVID. 
""We have to take a COVID test every day. And every day we have to maintain a special code showing that we’ve been tested within 24 hours,"" he said, describing the factory site as self-sufficient with a barber shop, canteen and fruit shop. The workers live in dormitories. 
Companies also need to strictly follow government guidelines for how to manage staff inside the bubble. A notice from the Dongguan city government on Tuesday said firms had to control the flow of people on their sites to prevent large groups from gathering and to stop people from dining in the canteens. 
One industrial zone in Dongguan went a step further by telling firms that they needed to cap the number of workers per 100 square metres at 10 people and sterilize factory floors, elevators and canteens at least three times a day. 
But few factories will be able to meet such requirements, said Shenzhen-based Renaud Anjoran, CEO of quality control firm Sofeast Ltd, estimating that only hundreds out of the tens of thousands of factories in Shenzhen would have the resources to conduct closed-loop management. 

He was not optimistic, for example, for small plants like his own of about 150 workers that was asked to suspend work on Wednesday evening. He worries losses could amount to ""millions of yuan"" if production stops for more than two weeks.
""At least in 2020 some of the down time was during Chinese New Year, and we were forced to delay the re-opening a bit. This 2022 lockdown is much, much worse for manufacturers.""

(Reuters) - A Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp independent director broke ranks with the company board's public stance on Thursday, saying he would back a shareholder proposal at next week's extraordinary meeting that could pave the way for a potential buyout deal.
The comments from American Raymond Zage, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and hedge fund manager, mark the latest twist in a long-standing fight between the 146-year-old Japanese conglomerate and its large number of foreign shareholders.
Last week U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, where Zage was previously a managing director and remains an adviser, joined a chorus of investors who oppose the company's plan to break itself up by spinning off its devices business. 
Zage said in a statement he would vote at the March 24 extraordinary meeting for a proposal from Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners requesting that the company solicit buyout offers from private equity firms. Toshiba's board has said it opposes the resolution.
""It should not be difficult, nor time consuming, to obtain preliminary bid indications and that some level of additional information could be provided to shareholders for the purposes of comparing a potential privatisation with the potential value of the proposed spin-off plan,"" he said.
Zage, one director in an eight-member board, said he believed he was one of the top 100 shareholders in the company and owned more shares than the rest of the board and senior management combined.
Toshiba said in response to Zage's statement that there is no change in the board's opinion opposing 3D's proposal. ""This statement was issued by Zage as an individual and is not a statement from the company,"" it said.
Toshiba will continue to make every effort to gain shareholders' support for the management-backed break-up, it added.
3D in January submitted the proposal that Toshiba solicit buyout offers, saying that a five-month strategic review leading to the break-up plan was flawed as a take-private option was never fully explored. 
3D is Toshiba's second-largest shareholder with a stake of over 7% while Farallon is Toshiba's third-largest with a holding of more than 6%.
Glass Lewis, an influential proxy advisory firm, has backed 3D's proposal but rival Institutional Shareholder Services has not recommended voting for it even though it is opposed to the spin-off plan.
Foreign hedge fund shareholders own an estimated 30% of Toshiba combined. 

Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa resigned this month, a sudden departure that came after sources said the spin-off plans had also sparked division with the company in addition to fuelling shareholder anger. Tsunakawa, however, remains chair of the board.
Toshiba shares finished 1.5% higher, underperforming a 3.5% climb for the broader market.

Faced with headwinds including slumping stock markets, Oyo-operator Oravel Stays Ltd. could clip its Indian IPO from the nearly $1 billion initially sought to half that, the people said, declining to be identified discussing internal matters. It’s considering also halving its expected valuation from the $12 billion originally targeted, they said. Oyo could even decide to suspend its IPO plans, the people said.
The deliberations underscore investors’ reluctance to buy into IPOs during a time of extraordinary market turmoil. The Airbnb Inc.-backed startup had already considered lowering its target valuation to $9 billion earlier this year after Paytm’s disastrous debut -- but that was before the Ukraine conflict and inflationary concerns ignited a global tech selloff.
Oyo, backed by investors including Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp. (T:9984) and Sequoia, made preliminary filings in September aiming for an IPO in early 2022. Nearly six months later, the initial documents, known as a draft red herring prospectus, have yet to get a green light from India’s stock market regulator.

None of Oyo’s IPO-related deliberations have proceeded far enough to come up for formal discussions or approval at the board level, the people said. Oyo representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oyo’s hesitance is emblematic of a cooling in India’s unicorn-minting technology industry, where nearly 50 startups got venture funding at valuations of $1 billion or more in 2021 alone. This year, there have been signs of slower fundraising and contracting valuations, as investors harbor second thoughts.
The most palpable slackening has been in the IPO arena, after tumbling stock prices dampened investor enthusiasm.
SoftBank, Oyo’s largest backer and one of the most prolific dealmakers in Indian startups, is now taking a more cautious approach with its investments there. The Japanese firm, which was bullish throughout last year, has held back funding for at least two startups after handing out term sheets, or agreements that spell out the terms and conditions of an investment, according to a person aware of the matter.
The two startups operated in the e-commerce and software-as-a-service segment, where valuations have diminished dramatically.
If Oyo decides to modify its IPO terms drastically, it will need to file a fresh DRHP, one of the people said.
Many other startups that have received approval for their IPOs have chosen not to proceed. Delhivery Ltd.’s nearly $1 billion IPO hasn’t moved ahead, and neither has API Holdings, which operates online pharmacy Pharmeasy. Delhivery and API received regulatory approvals in January and February, respectively.

The news comes about a week after Toyota said it would scale back domestic production by up to 20% during the months of April, May and June to ease the strain on suppliers battling shortages of chips and other parts.
""It is still difficult to foresee the situation several months ahead, and there is a possibility the current plan will be revised downward,"" the company said in a statement.
Average monthly global production for the period from April to June would be about 800,000, Toyota added. 
Its global vehicle production will be down 10% in May and 5% in June from previous estimates at the beginning of the year, said Toyota executive Kazunari Kumakura.
The shortages have led the automaker to repeatedly change its production plan, frustrating suppliers and prompting President Akio Toyoda to call the interval from April through June an ""intentional cooling off"" period. 
Apart from the persistent chips shortage, Toyota faces a number of challenges.
Curbs against COVID-19 forced it to suspend a joint venture with China's FAW Group in the northeastern city of Changchun.

The automaker also cited logistical hurdles for suspension at a plant in Russia amid political uncertainty sparked by the Ukraine invasion, which Russia calls a special operation.
These factors were not reflected in the April-June global production plan, Kumakura said, adding that while Toyota had not yet suffered specific impacts from the Ukraine crisis, it would look into short- and long-term risks.

(Reuters) - U.S. corporations face an unprecedented wave of shareholder resolutions focused on ESG themes for 2022, a new review shows, as activists look to build on favorable regulatory changes and more executives seem willing to make deals.
Shareholders have filed a record 529 resolutions related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues for the annual meetings of publicly traded U.S. companies so far this year, up 22% from the same point in 2021, according to a study released Thursday by activist group As You Sow and researchers including the Sustainable Investments Institute.
Many seek details on carbon emissions or workforce diversity. Successes activists scored last year such as changing directors at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) could make directors look at proposed changes more favorably, said sponsors of the review.
""Companies are realizing that their investors want them to have less risk,"" said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow. He and others said shareholders may benefit from new guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which makes it harder for companies to skip votes.
Wins for activists so far this year include a March 4 vote at the annual meeting of fast food company Jack in the Box Inc, where 95% of votes cast were in favor of a resolution dealing with sustainable packaging sponsored by Green Century Capital Management.
Jack in the Box had recommended investors vote against the measure. A Jack in the Box representative did not immediately comment.
In another case, activist Boston Trust Walden agreed to withdraw a shareholder resolution filed for the spring meeting of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)

In return, the Wall Street bank agreed to provide more details in a report this fall including about its lobbying activities and trade association memberships, according to a securities filing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are racing to work out how much monetary policy tightening the economy can handle as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on its rate-hike cycle, with some expecting an even steeper path ahead as others fret over possible missteps.
The Fed's first rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday was baked into markets, but the central bank surprised by projecting the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate increase at each of its six remaining policy meetings this year. 
Hiking rates should tame sky-high inflation that is biting at people's ability to purchase everyday items, but it runs the risk of crimping growth and tipping the economy into recession. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed confidence the economy could flourish despite less accommodative policy. 
""The Fed (is) trying to right the ship,"" said Andy Kapyrin, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic. ""My expectation is that they will get more hawkish as the year goes on, especially if inflation stays high."" 
Kapyrin is increasing overweights in value stocks – shares of comparatively cheap, economically sensitive companies that tend to thrive in an environment of strong growth and higher rates – as well as floating rate bonds he expects to benefit from rising borrowing costs. 
The speed at which the Fed is moving drew some comparisons to former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, who sharply raised rates in 1979 in a fight to tame double digit inflation, with analysts at research firm Bespoke saying Powell was having a ""mini Volcker moment.""
Still, the clarity on the Fed's projected rate hike path and the central bank's insistence that the economy is strong enough to handle a cocktail of policy tightening, higher inflation and volatile commodity prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reassured some.
""The big overhang for the market was the uncertainty as to what the Fed was going to do, and now we have a rate path,"" said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. 
The benchmark S&P 500 closed up more than 2%, a move that some investors took as relief that the Fed has kicked off its inflation fight.
The pace of rate hikes and balance sheet tightening could, however, weigh on the economy. Powell said details on reducing the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet could be finalized in May.
""It is good that the Fed left sort of unclear when they will start reducing their balance sheet,"" said Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at FS Investments. ""We have real concerns over whether the markets can continue to function if the Fed starts to drain their balance sheet more aggressively.""
EYES ON RISK
Some concerns over future growth were apparent in the Treasury market, with yields on some shorter-dated Treasuries rising above longer-dated ones, a sign that investors see economic risks ahead.
The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes flattened, the yield gap between five-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to the smallest since October 2018 and yields on five-year notes rose above those on 10-year notes, showing an inversion for the first time since March 2020. 
An inverted yield curve has been a reliable predictor of past economic downturns in key parts of the curve, although the closely-watched parts of the curve most associated with recession have not yet flipped. 
""The longer that curve stays flat or begins to flatten, or if it does start to invert throughout the curve, that would be a concern of ours,"" said Joe Bell, chief investment officer at Meeder Investment Management.
Fed policymakers began to discount the new risks facing the global economy, marking down their gross domestic product growth estimate for 2022 to 2.8%, from the 4% projected in December. 
""They don't have a great record in engineering 'soft landings',"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, who expects the economy to shrink in the first half of 2023.

There could however be relief if commodity prices ease, said Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at asset manager Nuveen, who is moving into low quality mortgage bonds and high yield corporate bonds. That could take pressure off the Fed to tighten rates as much as it has projected, he said. 
""If we have learned anything over the past two years it's that the Fed's economic projections are more often than not a little bit off base,"" he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M is selling external fashion brands on its core brand's hm.com website for the first time in Sweden and Germany, with the intention of adding more brands and markets. 
Taking on fashion online marketplaces such as Zalando, Asos and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), H&M started in February by expanding its offering in home market Sweden, as first reported by Fashion Network.
""Customers are now able to shop from more brands in the H&M Group family, as well as from a curated selection of other fashion brands such as Lee, Wrangler and Kangol, among others,"" a spokesperson told Reuters by email.
""We launched the concept in Germany in March. We will continue to add brands going forward and expand the concept to other markets.""
Some of H&M's smaller and newer independent chains, such as & Other Stories and Arket, sell external brands, mainly accessories and shoes. 
The H&M chain, which accounts for the bulk of the group's business, has previously only offered beauty products of external brands. 

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic H&M was struggling to contend with declining footfall at the core H&M brand's physical stores in the face of tougher competition, not least from online platforms. 
The H&M spokesperson said it had also introduced a second-hand offer at hm.com in Sweden.

Investing.com – Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) stock traded 0.3% higher in premarket Thursday on plans to raise potash output to capture demand currently unserved due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The world's biggest fertilizer producer plans to increase potash output by nearly 1 million ton this year to about 15 million ton in response to the uncertainty of supply from Eastern Europe.
Potash is a key input required for producing nitrogen-containing fertilizers, and Russia and Belarus are the world's second and third largest producers of the commodity after Canada. The potash fertilizer production is concentrated in a few countries. And with supplies from east Europe ruled out due to the sanctions on Russia and Belarus,  Nutrien  sees scope to capture additional market share.
The majority of the additional volume is expected to be produced in the second half of the year, the company said.
Nutrien’s 2022 potash production is expected to increase by nearly 20% compared to 2020 and account for more than 70% of global production added over this period, according to the Canadian firm.
“We expect a small increase in our 2022 capital expenditures and will be hiring additional employees across our network of low-cost potash mines in Saskatchewan,” it said.
Nutrien said it will update on its outlook and 2022 guidance in the first quarter earnings release in May.
Reports of  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP), which moves potash fertilizer into the U.S., sending a lock-out notice to its employees are capping the gains in the stock. 
This happened after the transporter's talks with a union on wages and other issues failed, a move that could disrupt the supply of the commodity.",,,,,

Investing.com – Ocado Group's (LON:OCDO) stock plunged 8% in London trading Thursday after Ocado Retail, the Group’s 50/50 online grocery joint venture with Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS), lowered its sales outlook for the current year.
The number of customer transactions grew in the first quarter to February 27 but a fall in basket sizes overshadowed that, reflecting softness in retail sales as more customers return to offices and shift to a lower stock level of groceries. 
The joint venture firm said it will now begin to cut costs across the business.
Ocado has lost 45% of its market cap in the last year as labor shortages, capacity constraints, and intense competition have capped its growth.
Rising raw material and food prices, surging energy costs, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are also adding to the challenges of the company, reports said.
The JV company said it had increased some retail prices, where increased costs could not be mitigated.
Industry data published earlier this month showed British grocery inflation hit 4.3% in February, the fastest rate of increase since 2013, according to Reuters.
Annual revenue growth is now seen closer to 10% compared to the previous forecast of “mid-teens”.

The lender has operated in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago and its business there - Russia's No. 10 bank by assets - contributed almost a third to the group's net profit of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last year.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, banks with operations in Russia have been under pressure as investors fear writedowns, business interruption and slower economic growth.
""This unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia, up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia,"" RBI chief executive Johann Strobl said in a statement.
Raiffeisenbank Russia said separately it will continue servicing its clients in Russia irrespective of a potential withdrawal by its Austrian parent. Such a move would be ""a measure of last resort"", it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has joined a group that sets environmental and social standards in mining as the world's No.2 carmaker steps up efforts ensure its raw materials are sustainable, especially in electric vehicles (EVs).
Big companies have come under increasing pressure from shareholders and consumers to meet stricter standards relating to the environment, social issues and governance (ESG).
VW is the biggest member company by revenue to join the 
Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), the carmaker told Reuters ahead of an announcement later on Thursday.
Other carmaker members of IRMA include General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford.
""In many cases, it is not the Volkswagen Group itself that is going to purchase the raw materials,"" said Murat Aksel, VW's board member for purchasing. ""But we want to know where they come from and under what conditions they are mined and processed.""
IRMA, which launched in 2006, includes both buyers and producers of minerals, investors, labour unions, community representatives and independent experts. 
VW is making a huge push to ramp up EV output and has boosted spending in the area by around half to 52 billion euros, compared to the previous five-year rolling investment plan, it said in December.
Cobalt, a key component in EV batteries, has been in particular focus because the bulk of production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has a large informal sector with a legacy of unsafe working practices and child labour.
VW is participating in a pilot project in Congo with a mine operator to test new certification standards developed by another organisation, CERA, Aksel added.
He said VW also supported a European initiative to develop domestic sources of supply for critical minerals, which has targeted rare earth magnets used in EVs and wind turbines as its top priority.

""The development of sustainable supply chains for raw materials is a core strategic goal for us. We believe that strengthening our European supplier network plays an important role in this,"" he said, without giving details.
In 2020, Volkswagen and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) launched a study to push for more ""sustainable"" mining in Chile of lithium, another key EV battery ingredient.

Airbus said it had no comment on market rumours or speculation.
""As a global company we are in constant discussion with our partners, customers and suppliers across the industry - these conversations are private in nature,"" Airbus said in an e-mail to Reuters.
Atos declined comment, reiterating its BDS cybersecurity business was not up for sale.
By 0810 GMT, Atos shares gained 3%, having risen as much as 4% in early dealings.
BFM, in its report, cited one source as saying Airbus had been looking into a potential acquisition of Atos over the last few weeks, driven by its interest in the field of cybersecurity, but added that at this stage, no outright takeover was on the cards.
""(Airbus CEO) Guillaume Faury believes that this topic (Atos) is too complicated given Airbus's interests,"" BFM cited one source as saying. 
The report added that the group therefore opted against buying Atos as a whole as it had no interest in acquiring the French firm's other activities. 

Last month Atos said its cybersecurity arm, BDS, was not for sale after sources told Reuters that French defence company Thales was working on a plan to buy the business, having approached private equity firms about exploring a joint offer and break-up.
Thales said at the time it would potentially be interested in any cybersecurity activities that were on sale, but that no discussions were under way with Atos.

LONDON (Reuters) -Hit by surging inflation and Russian invasion of Ukraine, European shares have sunk to their lowest level in a year on March 7, falling over a fifth from their January highs to end up in what investors consider a bear market.
Funds have dumped a record $20 billion of European equities in the past two weeks, including $13.5 billion just last week, according to data from funds tracker EPFR, backing out of what at the start of the year appeared to be one of leading bets for 2022.
But strategists and portfolio managers say market reaction had far exceeded the scale by which 2022 earnings forecasts have been trimmed and see as overblown fears of economic stagnation and high inflation, or ""stagflation"", gripping Europe.
For now, they just expect slower growth than earlier anticipated.
On Wednesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index returned to where it opened at on Feb. 24 when Russian troops entered Ukraine, a sign that bets on Europe Inc were still on.
""We kind of agree with the 'flation' side of the stagflation but not the 'stag'"", said Nick Nelson, head of Global & European Equity Strategy at Swiss bank UBS. 
His team has almost halved its 2022 growth expectations for European earnings to 8% from the previous 15%, but does not see a worst case materialising at the moment and UBS says European shares have room to gain 7%.
Europe has been hit by the conflict the hardest because of its proximity and close business ties to the area. Russia accounts for 2-4% of sales for many leading European companies and is also a key supplier of natural gas. 
Data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S shows a spike in downward revisions of earnings forecasts for STOXX 600 companies, with outlook cuts now accounting for over 60% of all revisions. 
Negative tweaks to expectations now constitute over 60% of total revisions. 
While outright stagflation is considered unlikely, some like Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Prime Partners are factoring in slower economic growth and his firm has already diversified outside the financial and cyclical sectors.
But the outlook for profit growth is still upbeat with earnings seen rising during the four quarters of 2022 by 21.5%, 8.4%, 13% and 7.6% respectively, according to Refintiv I/B/E/S estimates.
While European Central Bank cut its 2022 growth target from 4.2% to 3.7% to reflect the war's impact, it would leave the euro zone still with a growth rate far exceeding how it performed on average over the past 20 years. 
""Euro zone growth is still trending above trend,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of the European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), adding that stock markets probably over-reacted. 
His team cut its 2022 profit growth forecast for Europe to 8% from 14% but does not see a repeat of the oil shocks of the 1970s which triggered deep recessions. 
JP Morgan strategists also see a decline in earnings as unlikely unless economic growth slows below 1%, well below the 3.2% rate now expected by their economists. 
Kasper Elmgreen, Head of Equities at French asset manager Amundi, said that while the recent sell-off hit European stocks across the board, companies' pricing power and ability to preserve margins will be key for their performance.

""If you are a company and your prices are very sticky, you don’t have ability to move them a lot, then wages go up 5-10%, and raw material prices go up, your earnings may disappear,"" Elmgreen said. 
""If you run a business with pricing power, like luxury or pharma, the customer is willing to pay that, and earnings will be more stable.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday voted to revoke authorization for Chinese telecom Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide U.S. telecommunications services.
The 4-0 vote to revoke the authorisation first granted in 2001 is the latest move by the American regulator to bar Chinese telecommunications carriers from the United States citing national security concerns. The FCC said Pacific Networks and ComNet are indirectly and ultimately owned and controlled by the Chinese government.
Jeffrey J. Carlisle, a U.S. lawyer representing Pacific Networks, declined comment. In January, he told the FCC that Pacific Networks and ComNet are owned by CITIC Telecom International Holdings. 
The FCC says the carriers are ultimately controlled by CITIC Group Corp, a Chinese state-owned limited liability company.
Carlise's letter said the carriers ""engage in very limited and small scale facilities-based operations in the United States that do not pose national security concerns....The primary business of the companies is providing retail calling cards.""
The Chinese commerce ministry criticised the U.S. actions, and said China would adopt measures necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights of its firms. 
""The U.S. should stop the groundless crackdown on Chinese firms right now and the wrongdoings of politicizing trade and economic issues immediately,"" Gao Feng, a spokesman at the ministry, said during a regular press conference on Thursday. 
FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks noted the three-year commission effort to address Chinese telecom carriers. ""Taken as a whole, our actions have strengthened our national security,"" Starks said. 
In March 2021, the FCC found Pacific Networks and ComNet had failed to ""dispel serious concerns regarding their retention of their authority to provide telecommunications services in the United States.""
In January, the FCC voted to revoke a similar authorization for China Unicom (NYSE:CHU)'s U.S. unit to operate in the United States, citing national security concerns.

In October, the FCC revoked the U.S. authorization for China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) (Americas), saying it ""is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government."" Chinese Telecom failed to convince a U.S. court to reverse the decision.
In 2019, the FCC rejected China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd's bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services, citing national security risks.

SHANGHAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - China's top financial policymaker rescued stock markets from a bloodbath this week with a promise of stability, but plenty of investors reckon mere words will not restore lasting calm in an economy beset with multiple large risks.
Hong Kong markets, which have borne the brunt of the brutal selloff in Chinese stocks, rallied fiercely after Vice Premier Liu He's assurances on stability, regulatory clarity and monetary easing.
Investors worried by more sombre concerns, chiefly around a potential blowback on China from its dealings with sanctions-hit Russia and a spike in domestic COVID-19 cases that threatens to disrupt economic activity, weren't convinced. 
Alan Song, chairman of Harvest Capital, a Chinese private equity firm, likened the rally in stocks to drowning investors clutching at straws, and expects the rebound will be short-lived because fundamental reasons for the rout remain.
""Hoping that a speech can change market trends, is like expecting a WeChat message can change the world,"" Song said, referring to a popular Chinese social messaging app.
China needs to earnestly resolve Sino-U.S. antagonism and improve its anti-virus strategy, as ""trillions in market value wiped off is a colossal loss that requires serious reflection,"" he said.
Liu's speech caused the Hang Seng index to leap from 2008 lows and clock a massive 2-day rally. Stocks of sectors targeted in China's regulatory crackdown, mainly technology, have bounced.
The decline in stocks this year had wiped out about $1.3 trillion or 17% of China's main CSI300 index market value from January through Tuesday. Even after the rally, Chinese stocks markets remain the world's worst performers this year, after Russia.
As proof of the lack of investor conviction, Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, points to the narrowness of the rally, even within Chinese markets. 
The bounce in China also failed to enliven stocks such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Australian miners, whose fortunes are linked to China.
""I certainly wouldn’t be brave enough to be adding to China today,"" Duhra said on Wednesday. 
Duhra says he senses a change in the sentiment toward China, driven not just by concerns that China's close ties with Russia will draw Western ire, but also a host of problems such as power outages, property sector woes, rising household debt and an ambitious growth target.
""There's a lot of things that you could put together and say, this doesn't look very good,"" he said. ""Those issues have not gone away.""
SHOW AND TELL
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts noted how various ministries had sprung into action after Liu's speech at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a regulatory body under the State Council, which is China's Cabinet. 
State-run Xinhua news agency reported the finance ministry was putting a plans on hold for a trial property tax this year. 
China's securities regulator said it would strive to reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts on cooperating over the audit of Chinese firms as soon as possible. As a result, U.S.-listed shares of JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) notched their biggest daily percentage advances as they appeared at less risk of being delisted by New York exchanges.
Yin Peixin, an investment manager at RBH Asset Management in Shanghai, said despite the immediate boost to market sentiment, Liu's remarks won't change the course of the Sino-U.S. conflict, or China's worsening coronavirus situation.
""I think Sino-U.S. decoupling is inevitable. It's just a matter of time,"" Yin said.
The Ukraine crisis was also forcing companies to take sides, deepening geopolitical rifts, and rhetoric wouldn't stop the spread of the coronavirus, he said.
Yuan Yuwei, a fund manager at hedge fund house Water Wisdom Asset Management, said the rebound won't reverse the trend of global investors exiting China stocks to avoid the rising risks Beijing could also face sanctions.

""China is being forced to pick sides"" in the Ukraine conflict, said Yuan, who still holds short positions in Chinese tech firms such as Meituan and Li Auto.
For a global investor, ”if you own a lot of China holdings, of course you're worried, as China and Russia are both seen as rivals by the U.S.,"" and the fear is deepened by what you've seen happen to Russian assets, he said.

Global markets surged overnight as traders hailed China's pledge to support its economy, chased an elusive breakthrough for a ceasefire in Ukraine and saluted a hawkish interest rate lift-off by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
Yet, despite the positive mood this morning, the market turmoil triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine isn't going away. 
A wild spike in nickel prices which left traders facing billions of dollars in losses continued to reverberate through commodity markets with the London Metal Exchange halting trades again on Wednesday.
""What a mess. It's embarrassing, disorderly doesn't even begin to describe it,"" was how one metals trader commented on the chaotic reopening of nickel trading at the LME.
Oil markets are also gyrating wildly with prices bouncing up and down the symbolic $100 level after last week's frenzied rally which pushed Brent crude briefly to a 2008 high of $139 a barrel.
This morning, prices are up again after the International Energy Agency said markets could lose three million barrels per day of Russian crude from April and Britain's Boris Johnson failed to secure a pledge to ramp up production from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Foreign exchange markets made counter-intuitive moves with the U.S. dollar index falling after the Fed projected said its policy rate would hit a range between 1.75% and 2% by year's end in a newly aggressive stance.
For all the cheer resonating across U.S. stock markets following the Fed's announcement, the word 'recession' came in with a disturbing recurrence among analysts giving a quick take on the monetary tightening. 
Today, investors brace for another hike from the Bank of England and may feel perhaps more reluctant to chase a breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks after President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a war criminal"" which the Kremlin said was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"".

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened mostly higher on Thursday as the sharp relief rally that followed the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike in over three years faded. 
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.2% while the broader Stoxx 600 was up 1.8 points, or 0.4%. They had risen 4% and 3% respectively on Wednesday, as the U.S. market action amplified a movement that had begun with growing hopes of a deal to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. The biggest gains were seen in Spain's IBEX, up 0.7%, while Italy's FTSE MIB lagged, staying largely unchanged. The German DAX rose 0.1% while the FTSE 100 rose 0.5%.
The Fed raised the target rate for fed funds by 25 basis points as widely expected, and indicated it will raise rates at least another six times this year and continue tightening into 2023, in addition to selling off its bond portfolio. The market had largely discounted that scenario and took comfort from the Fed's projections that it could tighten without causing a recession. Some analysts cast doubt on that optimism, as did the bond market, where the yield curve flattened considerably - a development that typically signals an economic slowdown in the future.
Thursday is likely to be dominated by central bank action in Europe, with the Bank of England widely expected to raise its key rate by another 25 basis points to 0.75%. In addition, the European Central Bank will hold an annual conference at which President Christine Lagarde, chief economist Philip Lane and board member Isabel Schnabel will all speak.
European currencies rose after the Fed's action on Wednesday having had a rough couple of weeks since the outbreak of the biggest war in Europe since 1945, an event that is likely to hit the European economy much harder than the U.S. one. The euro was up 0.2% at $1.1051, while the pound was up 0.2% at $1.13175.  In Russia, meanwhile, the ruble continued to strengthen, rising over 3% to a two-week high of 104.27 against the dollar. 
Markets have grasped at every sign of peace in eastern Europe, even though it is far from clear that the current talks can deliver that. The U.S. agreed on Wednesday to send an extra $1 billion in military assistance after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy begged Congress to neutralize Russia's air operations in the country. U.S. President Joe Biden also called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a 'war criminal', a step that could complicate future negotiations. In addition, China - seen by many as the one country capable of persuading Russia to end the war - again refused to condemn the invasion. 
At a corporate level, U.K. supermarket and logistics group Ocado (LON:OCDO) fell 8.0% after it posted a decline in first-quarter revenue, while German steelmaking and engineering group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) also fell by 8% after warning that the plan to spin off its steel division has been put in doubt by events in Ukraine. The company said it still believes a spinoff is the best course of action.
There was more downbeat economic news from the car sector. EU car sales fell 6.7% in February according to industry association ACEA, and the hit to European car production since the start of the war suggests that worse is to follow in March.

(Reuters) -The gleaming, late-model European jet for sale was a rarity in the hot market for second-hand corporate aircraft.
It was only after aviation lawyer Amanda Applegate's client did some additional digging that they discovered the aircraft, while not registered in Russia, was in fact Russian-owned. 
For that buyer, it was a deal-breaker, said Applegate, a partner at U.S.-based Soar Aviation Law, as the West imposes sweeping sanctions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
The private jet world is on high alert to avoid doing business with Russia at a time when a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account run by a Florida teenager, @RUOligarchJets, has focused popular attention on the fugitive luxury fleets of the ultra-rich.
""When I look at compliance, it's like a taco, wrapped in a burrito, wrapped in a chalupa,"" said an executive at a business jet manufacturer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
According to European data research and consulting company WINGX, there are only about 100 business jets on the Russia Register. Yet about 400 corporate aircraft flew frequently from the country last year, raising questions over the true extent of Russian control of the fleet. 
""We think that a good proportion of the 400 are owned by Russia-based individuals or entities,"" said WINGX managing director Richard Koe. 
Worried planemakers are handing out questionnaires and doing extra vetting to make sure parts shipped to repair centers outside Russia aren't inadvertently sustaining jets covered by sanctions, the manufacturing executive said.
That's far from easy in the ultra-private world of corporate aviation.
Most Russian-owned business jets are registered outside the country and ownership is camouflaged behind layers of shell companies and trusts.
Some 5% of European business jets are registered in Russia, according to Jefferies analysts. But those actually owned by Russians could be up to triple that amount, analysts say. 
VETTING EXPORTS
One of the world's largest maintenance firms, Germany's Lufthansa Technik, has set up a task force and created an export approval process to avoid violating sanctions that ban technical support as well as shipments of parts to Russia.
""This means more complexity for our global supply chain processes,"" a spokesperson said.
Planemakers must be sure that a part shipped to a maintenance center won't later end up on an aircraft owned by a sanctioned person or entity. 
That's not such a problem when orders come in for parts for a specific aircraft, identified by its serial number. But in some cases the order could come from a maintenance center without mentioning a specific jet.
""I expect that the (manufacturers) and other suppliers will start to ask more questions so that they can vet the end-users for parts exports to certain countries,"" said aviation lawyer Jonathan Epstein, partner at U.S.-based Holland & Knight.
Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream are among the biggest suppliers of jets with Russian owners, according to analysts and brokers.
Bombardier, which has cut ties in Russia, said it is strengthening company procedures. 
It has suspended the accounts of some customers even though they are not directly covered by sanctions, and won't provide parts or technical support to anyone located anywhere if they use the aircraft in Russia, the Canadian planemaker said in a customer bulletin seen by Reuters.
Gulfstream did not respond to a request for comment. 
It is equally a headache for buyers. Like Applegate's client, many are avoiding all Russian-owned planes, not just those belonging to sanctioned owners. 
William Quinn, president of U.S. consulting firm Aviation Management Systems, said he expects to see more deals for European business jets come under scrutiny.
He recently represented a lender on a deal for a year-old Pilatus jet registered in Guernsey. That deal, too, fell through when the client discovered it was Russian-owned, Quinn said.

One broker has advised clients ""to run, don't walk"" from deals with any Russian for fear that more names will end up on blacklists, or that deals would worry lenders. The Kremlin has warned against anti-Russian feelings in the West.
""There is real concern the 'list' isn't yet refined and will continue to grow,"" said the broker on condition of anonymity. ""Much more risk of getting caught up in it than simply going in another direction.""

GAYDON, England (Reuters) - Aston Martin on Wednesday launched the final fossil-fuel version of its limited-run powerful V12 Vantage sports car, with every vehicle already snapped up before the British luxury carmaker starts its gradual shift to an electric lineup.
""This V12 Vantage is really a swan song,"" Aston Martin executive chairman and investor Lawrence Stroll told Reuters. ""There is a history of V12 Vantages at this company that goes back several decades and it will be the last one we make... before we move onto hyrbidisation and electrification.""
Aston Martin plans to launch its first fully-electric vehicle in 2025 and has said that as of 2026 all new car lines will have an electric option. 
Fictional secret agent James Bond's car brand of choice had a tough time after going public in 2018, failing to meet expectations and burning through cash. In 2020, it brought in fresh investment from billionaire Stroll.
The V12 Vantage and the DBX707, a luxury SUV, are the carmaker's first two new vehicles produced under Stroll.
Aston Martin has been incorporating technology into its cars from shareholder Mercedes-Benz, which increased its stake in the struggling carmaker in 2020.
The carmaker's petrol-powered V12 Vantage is limited to 333 units globally with a starting price of around $300,000. Stroll said the car was three times oversubscribed. 
Since 2007, Aston Martin has crammed its biggest engine into its smallest model to create the Vantage. 

The carmaker said the latest and last version ""offers an intoxicating combination of magnificent low and mid-range muscularity with searing top-end power"" and a top speed of 200 miles (323 km) per hour. 
Premium and luxury car sales soared in 2021, especially in key global markets like China and the United States, as pandemic travel restrictions left wealthy consumers with more disposable income.

Vice Premier Liu He, China's economic tsar, said on Wednesday the government needs to reduce risks in the industry and proposed measures to facilitate a new development model for the sector.
In the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a regulatory body under the State Council, Liu urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the economy.
Liu's pledge received widespread support from other top institutions, including the central bank and securities and currency regulators.
That pushed up the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index 14.8% by midday on Thursday, versus a 5.8% gain in the main Hang Seng Index. The sub-index had already jumped 14.7% on Wednesday.
""The shares that are bouncing a lot are also those that have dropped a lot previously, and they're still at low levels now,"" said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities. ""Is the rally sustainable? That's a concern, because we may not see clear policies that will fundamentally change the liquidity problem for the developers.""
Sunac China, the nation's No.3 property developer by sales, jumped 47.5% to a one-week high, after losing nearly 40% this month on debt repayment concerns.
Top developer Country Garden and embattled China Evergrande Group both rose 22%.
The real estate sector, a key driver of growth, has struggled for months as Beijing's campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis among some major developers, resulting in bond defaults and shelved projects.
After Liu's comment, the banking and insurance regulator also said on Wednesday it would seek to stabilise land and home prices, transform the real estate sector and encourage mergers and acquisition loans for developers to purchase distressed assets.
The finance ministry later said China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Trading in property stocks has been very volatile in recent months. They firmed early this year on expectations that more easing in the sector is coming, but plummeted this month due to continued worries over the liquidity risks in the companies.

Citi, however, cautioned a broad-based easing with flooding liquidity for property is nearly impossible, and, despite the encouraging tones from Wednesday, saw no substantial policy changes. 
""Recent marginal fine-tunes...are not game-changers,"" the investment bank said in a report. ""The best to expect for now is targeted downside protection for a few (company) names through coordination with local government and financial institutions.""

(Reuters) - Kanye West has been suspended from social media network Instagram for 24 hours after the rapper infringed the platform's policy regarding harassment, a spokesperson for its parent firm Meta Platforms Inc said.
The platform deleted content sent from the 44-year-old rapper's account that was in violation of its policies on ""hate speech and bullying and harassment,"" the spokesperson, Joe Osborne, told Reuters in an emailed statement.
West, who legally goes by 'Ye', will be restricted from posting, commenting or sending direct messages from the account for 24 hours, Osborne said, adding further action could be taken if he continued to violate policies on regaining control of the account.
Representatives for West did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
A report in entertainment industry publication Variety said West directed racial slurs at Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" in an Instagram post after Noah discussed a row between West, West's former wife Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson.
The post has since been deleted, the report said.
Meta declined to provide details of the posts that violated its policy.
However, posts of West criticising actor D.L. Hughley and SNL writer Dave Sirius can still be seen on his profile.
Kardashian, a businesswoman and star of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" filed for divorce a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences with West. The couple have four children ranging in age from 2 to 8.

After the divorce, West criticised the reality star's new relationship with Davidson on social media and publicly appealed to her to return to him.
A Los Angeles judge granted this month Kardashian's request to be declared legally single following nearly eight years of marriage to the rapper.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said on Thursday they will go ahead with a project to boost gas output from their Gippsland Basin Kipper field off southeast Australia, which would help fill a looming gas shortage in the local market.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM)'s Esso Australia said the project would cost about A$400 million ($291 million) to extract an additional 200 petajoules (PJ) of gas over the coming five years, adding that about 30 PJ will be produced next year.
The country's regulators have warned that eastern Australia faces a gas shortfall from 2026, largely because the ageing gas fields in the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, which has been the biggest supplier into the market for decades, are drying up.
Esso operates the joint venture in a 50-50 partnership with global miner BHP.
The extra production from the Gippsland Basin will come online ahead of five proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, looking to serve the same market. Only one of those has begun preliminary construction work.
BHP's stake in the Gippsland Basin joint venture is set to go to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum pending a vote of the Australian company's shareholders in May on a merger with BHP's petroleum business.
BHP will continue to contribute its 50% share of the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture's development spending for as long as it remains a stakeholder, a BHP spokesperson said.

Esso Australia also said it was advancing funding decisions to begin production from the Turrum field in Bass Strait, offshore Victoria.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn plans to use a COVID bubble arrangement that allowed its Shenzhen campus to resume production until at least Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. 
The world's largest contract electronics maker said on Wednesday it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campuses after arranging for some staff to live and work in a bubble, an arrangement requested by the local government as it battles the spread of COVID.
The ""closed-loop management"" system in its campuses there will last until midnight on Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters and confirmed by two people familiar with the matter.
The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has seen ""limited"" impact so far but some managers are worried about the bubble arrangement extending beyond Sunday as it meant the campus was not working at full production, one of the sources, who's not authorised to speak to the media, said.

Foxconn referred Reuters to its earlier statement, in which the company said it adheres to strict industry guidelines and policies issued by the Shenzhen government.
Only a small part of Foxconn's production for Apple's iPhone production in China takes place in the southern city of Shenzhen, with the majority happening in Zhengzhou in the central province of Henan, the two sources said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, with the U.S. Federal Reserve betting that the U.S. economy will be able to weather its campaign against high inflation. However, the flatter U.S. Treasury yield could mean that economic growth will not be as resilient as hoped for.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.88% by 10:39 PM ET (2:39 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.77%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 1.41%. Employment data for February 2022 showed that the employment change was 77,400, the full employment change was 121,900, and the unemployment rate was 4%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index soared 4.52%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.72% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.6%. The country’s more market-friendly stance, announced on Wednesday, boosted sentiment and an index of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks soaring 33% overnight.
U.S. shares recorded their best two-day gain since April 2020, after the Fed hiked its interest rate to 0.5% in its policy decision handed down on Wednesday. It also hinted at hikes at all six remaining meetings in 2022, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying the U.S. economy is “very strong” and can handle monetary tightening.
Gains for U.S. Treasuries were smaller, and the yield curve remained flatter. The latter led some investors to question whether the Fed will be able to curb inflation without triggering a sharp slowdown in growth, or even a recession.
“The overall message you got from the Fed today was very clear,” Deutsche Bank AG chief international strategist Alan Ruskin told Bloomberg. “They want financial conditions to tighten. The issue there is, can you soft-land this thing? Historically, when the Fed tightens, you do get some hard landing somewhere.”
The central bank will also begin allowing its $8.9 trillion balance sheet to shrink at a “coming meeting” but did not provide further details.
“It’s possible we’re going to see a yield curve inversion,” JPMorganAsset Management global market strategist Meera Pandit told Reuters.
That doesn’t necessarily mean a U.S. recession since bond market signals are being shaped by an unusual combination of Fed asset tapering, interest rate hikes, and balance-sheet reduction over a relatively short period, she added.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision later in the day. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane will speak at a conference on the same day.
The Bank of Japan will hand down its policy decision on Friday.
Meanwhile, the commodity shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 continues to aggravate both price pressures and economic risks. The latest round of ceasefire talks between the two countries ended with Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that a neutral Ukraine with its own army is a possible compromise.
However, Ukraine said it needs security guarantees, and U.S. President Joe Biden said his country would send Ukraine drones and thousands of anti-aircraft as well as anti-tank missiles."

CP has commenced work stoppage contingency plans and will gradually work to wind down its Canadian operations, unless the parties come to a negotiated settlement or agree to binding arbitration, the company said.
The company said it had tabled an offer to address issues of wages, benefits and pensions but it was rejected by the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) union on Wednesday. 
""Delaying resolution would only make things worse. We take this action with a view to bringing this uncertainty to an end,"" CP's chief executive officer, Keith Creel, said.
The union confirmed that it had been served with a lockout notice from  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) and said, ""At the bargaining table, CP continues to dismiss our members' demands and are unwilling to negotiate the issues they have created."" 
TCRC is willing to remain at the bargaining table until the lockout deadline on March 20 and beyond to reach a negotiated settlement, it said in a statement. 
Canada, Russia and Belarus are among the main sources for the world's potash, a key input required for producing nitrogen-containing fertilizers.
Concerns about fertilizer supplies have peaked since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanction on Belarus.

Canadian federal mediators are assisting the two sides in talks and the government is encouraging both parties to consider making the compromises necessary to reach a fair deal, Minister of Labour Seamus O'Regan Jr said in a statement.
The Canadian government can seek to pass legislation that will order workers back to their jobs if they strike.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 3 million people and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
After the United States and Europe cut it off from swathes of the global economy with retaliatory sanctions, Russia is facing its gravest economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
""There has been no halt to the work of these enterprises and there will be none. Everyone is continuing work,"" Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said, according to a government statement.
""I stress again - we will press on with the implementation of our MS-21 and SSJ-100 flagship projects,"" he said.
Borisov said Russia's military aerospace industry had thrived despite working under sanctions since 2014, when Crimea was annexed from Ukraine. But he acknowledged that the situation was more difficult for the civilian sector as so many projects depended on international cooperation.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia's once mighty aerospace sector was thrown into turmoil. Since President Vladimir Putin came to power in 1999, it has tried to claw back market share from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.
The Sukhoi Superjet 100, Russia's main domestic-made passenger jet, typically seats just under 100 passengers. Introduced in 2011, it was conceived as competition for Airbus, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) and Embraer. 

The medium-range Irkut MS-21/MC-21, with a potential capacity of over 200 passengers, is due to enter service this year. First designed with U.S.-made engines, in December 2020 it flew for the first time with Russian-built turbofans.
Both planes are built by Irkut Corporation, part of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), and the engines are built by United Engine Corporation, all of which are majority owned by Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As war in Ukraine drives up already high input costs, even firms with business models fine-tuned to Japan's deflationary economy are toying with higher prices, testing acceptance by consumers hardened by repeated affirmations of an elusive inflation goal.
High street price rises have broadened as wholesale inflation accelerates at record rates, with increases in the prices of commodities such as oil, for instance, reaching shop shelves in the form of more expensive plastic packaging.
In Japan, the knock-on effect has pushed companies used to nearly two decades of deflation to pass on costs more directly than ever before. On top of changing ingredients or reducing portion sizes, firms have given unusual price boosts to goods such as cooking oil, snacks and popular instant noodle brands.
Such is the inflationary pressure that some firms are moving away business models that assume persistent deflation, such as sticking to particular price points or favouring low-margin domestic fare over higher-quality imports.
""Companies that can add value to their products and services are able to raise prices more sustainably,"" said analyst Shota Sugihara at market researcher Teikoku Databank.
""It makes sense for companies to shift away from deflationary price-setting behaviour to boost profit and wages.""
Conveyer-belt sushi chain Sushiro, famous for making the delicacy more affordable with its 100 yen ($0.85) dishes, has expanded its range of 150 yen and 300 yen offerings.
""Many visitors stick to 100 yen dishes, so we ensure they're happy. But we're also seeing more customers willing to pay for finer sushi,"" said Koichi Mizutome, chief executive of Sushiro parent Food & Life Companies Ltd.
Small supermarket chain Benny Super is turning its back on a protracted price-cutting war by replacing as many as half of its products with higher-margin alternatives, such as culinary oil from Italy, Greece and New Zealand.
""We'll stock products not offered by other companies, such as rare or small-quantity goods. That's the strategy that works in times of inflation,"" said Benny Super owner Tomoya Akatsu.
Kobe Bussan Co Ltd has raised prices for most of the roughly 4,000 items it sells at its discount supermarkets.
About a third of those items are made at Kobe Bussan's domestic and overseas factories, giving the company stronger pricing power over those items than items from other food firms.
It also has a line-up of uncommon imported goods such as frozen waffles from Belgium and hummus from Jordan.
""We have raised price levels little by little from 10 years ago after realising that it would become harder to keep securing profit, and are doing it all out now on a really wide range of products,"" said Kobe Bussan President Hirokazu Numata.
URGENCY
The economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only added urgency to the move away from business models tailored to deflation, with grain prices on the rise and oil prices hitting record highs, while sanctions against Russia complicate supply lines. Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Though modest by global standards, Japan's core consumer inflation - which excludes volatile fresh food prices - is widely expected https://tmsnrt.rs/35ZneCt to speed up https://tmsnrt.rs/3tZqVzV from April toward the 2% target the Bank of Japan set in 2013 and reached only during the fiscal year ended March 2015.

(Graphic: Japan's wholesale inflation is soaring, https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-ECONOMY/DEFLATION/klpykbwjnpg/chart.png) 
In a January poll of 500 firms, 21% of respondents told Reuters they had raised prices, versus 15% in mid-2021.
Including those planning to raise prices, the ratio reached 64% from 61% in the previous survey, signalling more costs being passed on. In 2016, the ratio of those that raised or planned to raise prices was just 9%, while 7% planned cuts.
A survey by Teikoku Databank in February showed 41% of respondents in industries as varied as clothing, construction and chemicals were able to pass on rising raw materials costs.
Still, with increasingly frequent price hikes for a range of daily necessities and little sign of wage hikes, households may not have the capacity to splurge on higher-priced items.
Sceptics, including the Bank of Japan, question whether prices can keep rising, but fear surging fuel bills and slow wage growth will snuff out any burst of spending.

""For many customers, it's still the cheaper the better,"" said Sushiro's Mizutome. ""What we're doing is very cautiously, slowly trying to increase the amount each customer spends per visit.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Group launched a new automotive plant on Wednesday that will produce Indonesia's first locally assembled electric vehicle, part of President Joko Widodo's goal of developing a full EV supply chain utilising the country's mineral resources.
At the plant's inauguration on Wednesday, Jokowi, as the president is known, said the government was providing incentives and had removed red tape to try to boost investment in EV development.
""We need to be an important player in the global supply chain of electric cars,"" he said. 
""Our country has large mineral resources that can be used for development of electric cars.""
Indonesia is a major nickel ore producer, an important material for EV batteries. 
It also produces cobalt, also used for batteries, and has large deposits of bauxite and copper ores, which can be used for EV production, Jokowi said.
Downstream development of Indonesia's natural resources has been one of Jokowi's key economic goals to lure foreign investment and create jobs. 
By 2024, all EVs produced in Indonesia will use locally made batteries and other key components, he added.
Hyundai in 2019 said it would invest $1.55 billion up to 2030, with starting capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, to be later expanded to 250,000 annually. 

The group's chairman Euisun Chung said the new plant would also be linked with a Hyundai-LG joint venture battery plant, which is scheduled to open in 2024.
LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Hyundai started construction of the $1.1 billion EV battery plant in September, which at its full capacity is expected to produce 10 gigawatt hours of battery cell power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron will testify on March 23 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee as the industry and lawmakers make the case for $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing.
The chief executive of truckmaker Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) Inc will also testify at the hearing, which will look at vulnerabilities in semiconductor supply chains and the sector's connection with American competitiveness.
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell announced the https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2022/3/developing-next-generation-technology-for-innovation hearing on Wednesday. Reuters reported the planned hearing earlier.
Two decades ago, the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips and today it accounts for only 12% of global production, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said.
Last week, President Joe Biden met with executives of chipmakers including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and other companies as part of an effort to push the U.S. Congress to fund subsidies to chipmakers to ease the semiconductor crunch.
The Senate in June and the House in February approved the $52 billion in subsidies in separate bills. ""Get it to my desk as quickly as you can,"" Biden said last week.
The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Cantwell said it was urgent to act, noting the chip shortage cost the global auto industry an estimated $210 billion in revenue in 2021 and a loss of production of 7.7 million cars.
""It's 30% to 50% cheaper to build a semiconductor foundry in Asia than in the United States, mostly because of foreign government investment... We can't wait,"" she said.
Intel said it was pleased to have the opportunity to ""advocate for the importance of investing in American semiconductor leadership.""
In January, Intel said it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio.
Micron said in October it plans to spend $150 billion over the next decade globally on leading-edge memory chips manufacturing and research and development. Micron said funding from Congress ""would open the door to new industry investments.""

SEMI, an industry association, said in a letter https://www.semi.org/sites/semi.org/files/2022-03/SEMI_House_FABS_Act_Support_Letter_Mar_16.pdf to Congress that chips funding ""is vital to provide a foundational incentive for investments in domestic design and manufacturing facilities for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.""
Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders question why Congress would give subsidies to a large profitable industry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Main Wall Street stock indexes and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates and laid out an aggressive plan for further increases to combat inflation.
In a widely expected move, the Fed announced a quarter percentage point increase in the overnight federal funds rate, lifting that key benchmark from its near-zero level. It was the first rate increase since 2018.
The U.S. central bank also said it expects to begin unwinding its massive holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at an upcoming meeting.
""The Fed did not rock the boat. They increased rates like expected, they did lower GDP forecast this year, and upgraded inflation expectations but none of that was a surprise,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in North Carolina.
After the Fed announced its rate hike decision, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields reached 2.246%, the highest since May 2019, before retreating to 2.192%.
Two-year note yields rose to 2.002%, further flattening the closely-watched yield curve
On Wall Street, the Dow, benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed higher after choppy trading following the central bank's moves. The gains were driven by stocks in the technology, financials and consumer discretionary sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.55% to 34,063.1, the S&P 500 gained 2.24% to 4,357.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.77% to 13,436.55.
""It was nice to see some follow through of yesterday's big gains. This is the first time we've had two big up days since the war started in Ukraine,"" Detrick said. ""With the Fed not rocking the boat, buyers stepped in to find values.""
The U.S. dollar fell. While the Fed unveiled a hawkish monetary policy stance, it did not deliver a tougher surprise that might have added to the greenback's weeks-long momentum.
The dollar index, which had gained 3% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on Feb. 24 and 10% since May, dropped as much as 0.6% on Wednesday.
European stocks closed at more than two-week highs as fresh talk of compromise in the Russia-Ukraine conflict boosted market sentiment just as China promised to roll out more economic stimulus.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 3.06%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 2.76%.
Oil lost ground for the fifth time in the last six days as traders reacted to hoped-for progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks and a surprising increase in U.S. inventories.
Benchmark Brent settled below $100 per barrel at $98.02, down 1.9%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended fell 1.5% at $95.04 a barrel.

Safe-haven gold rebounded after falling to more than a two-week low earlier in the session.
Spot gold added 0.5% to $1,926.57 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 1.02% to $1,908.90 an ounce.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed up more than 2% while the Nasdaq rallied almost 4% on Wednesday as investors shrugged off initial jitters following the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate increase and its signal that more hikes would be needed to fight inflation, ending the pandemic-era's easy monetary policy. 
The central bank announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark overnight rate as was widely expected but the projection that its rate would hit between 1.75% and 2% by year's end was more hawkish than some investors said they had expected.
While the Fed flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation the country has witnessed in 40 years.
While the major indexes pared earlier gains sharply and the S&P and the Dow both dipped into the red briefly after the Fed statement, the indexes steadied as Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at a press conference.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis said investors may be relieved the Fed is taking action against surging inflation. 
""Hearing the Fed finally 'say and act' to tackle inflation is somewhat calming for the investment community, and for Main Street struggling with higher inflation,"" he said. 
But other market analysts were concerned the aggressive rate hike projected could cause the economy to skid.
""This looks like a Fed that is intending on causing recession in order to stamp out the inflation problem and that is as short sighted as calling inflation transitory a year ago,” Scott Ladner, chief investment officer, Horizon Investments, Charlotte, North Carolina.
Joseph LaVorgna, Americas chief economist at Natixis in New York was also skeptical. 
“They’re going to try to be aggressive here in raising rates. I wish Jay Powell and company all the best of luck because they're not going to get anywhere near as they think, unless they’re willing to throw a lot of people out of jobs, because that's what's going to happen.  Because we're going to have a recession. This is a recession forecast,"" he said.
""I just don't see the Fed being able to engineer this kind of tightening for what right now is inflationary demand destruction.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, to 34,063.1, the S&P 500 gained 95.41 points, or 2.24%, to 4,357.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 487.93 points, or 3.77%, to 13,436.55. 
Of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, the biggest gainers were sectors that had fallen sharply in a recent sell off with consumer discretionary and technology both finishing up more than 3% while communications services and financials added almost 3%. 
Only two of the sectors ended the day in the red with energy falling 0.4% and utilities losing 0.2%.
Historical data suggests tighter monetary policy has often been accompanied by solid gains in stocks. The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7% in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955.
Ahead of the Fed statement stocks had been rallying as talk of compromise from both Moscow and Kyiv on a status for Ukraine outside of NATO lifted hope on Wednesday for a potential breakthrough after three weeks of war.
The global mood had also been lifted earlier by China's promise to roll out more stimulus for the economy and keep markets stable.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 93 new lows. 
On U.S. exchanges 15.82 billion shares changed hands compared with the 14.04 billion 20-day moving average.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday signaled much faster interest rates hikes this year than they had expected just a few months ago, getting them to about 1.9% by the end of the year as they try to tamp down soaring inflation. 
Markets swiftly priced in their agreement, and then some, with trading in contracts tied to the Fed's target policy rate pricing in a rate of 1.93% by the end of 2022.
The last time the Fed raised rates as quickly as policymakers now expect was in 2004-2006. 
Back then, they lifted rates by a quarter of a percentage point at every meeting; since then they have gone much slower when tightening policy, amid weaker recoveries and sleepier inflation. 
Now, with inflation by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge running at three times its 2% goal, policymakers are ""acutely"" aware of the need to stabilize prices and committed to doing so, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday. 
But the exact tempo of the rate hikes remains in question, with markets pricing in a good chance of a half-point interest rate hike in May or June. 
Powell left the door well open to that possibility, saying repeatedly that if inflation did not cool off as expected, the Fed would accelerate its rate hikes. 
And indeed, seven of the Fed's 16 policymakers penciled in rate hike paths that would require at least one half-point increase, if not more, this year. 

""Clearly, the (Fed's policysetting) committee intended to send an aggressive signal of their resolve to rein in inflation and keep inflation expectations in check,"" wrote Regions' Chief Economist Richard Moody. 
The markets got the message.

The SPACs, ACI Corp III and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Crest Investment Corp IV, had filed for their IPOs in March last year and were looking to raise up to a combined $1 billion. 
Moelis was among a number of high-profile investment bankers and investors, a list that includes Bill Foley and Chamath Palihapitiya, who rushed to take advantage of the lucrative dealmaking frenzy with SPACs.
However, interest in the market has waned, with shares of several companies such as Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed Inc, which merged with SPACs, tumbling after going public.
High rates of redemptions by SPAC investors have also dampened investor appetite, as has volatility in the U.S. markets triggered by rate hike concerns and geopolitical tensions.

A SPAC backed by Moelis, founder and chief executive officer of investment banking firm  Moelis & Co , has previously taken electric aircraft startup Archer Aviation Inc public. However, even on that deal, the companies had to amend terms to cut Archer's enterprise value by $1 billion.
SPACs are listed firms with no business operations but a pool of capital raised through an IPO that they use to merge with private companies, in deals that take the private companies public.

The carrier said because of ""evolving coronavirus pandemic control measures in the Shanghai region, China Eastern has been instructed"" by Chinese aviation officials ""to divert Shanghai-bound passenger flights arriving from the U.S. to certain alternate airports in China.""
China Eastern asked approval starting March 31 to move existing twice-weekly Shanghai westbound passenger flights from New York to China's Fuzhou Changle International Airport through the end of April.
China's aviation regulator said on Tuesday it will divert 106 international flights scheduled to arrive in Shanghai to other domestic cities from March 21 to May 1 due to COVID-19.
The impacted flights include those operated by Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Juneyao Air and Spring Airlines, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.

Shanghai, which reported five new local symptomatic transmissions and nearly 200 domestically transmitted asymptomatic carriers on Tuesday, said on Wednesday it has identified some key areas and would finish testing all people in those areas twice between Wednesday and Thursday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is suspending production at its Shanghai factory on Wednesday and Thursday, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, while the notice did not give a reason for the stoppage.

(Reuters) - Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has questioned 19 financial companies to clarify their investment policies on fossil fuels, his office said on Wednesday, showing the breadth of a review that could see firms losing state pension mandates.
Letters were sent to companies including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co among others ""that may be boycotting the fossil fuel industry,"" according to a statement and other material sent by a spokesman for the Republican state official.
Even if companies currently hold oil and gas investments today, some may be ""selling the hope of a 'green' tomorrow with promises to divest or reduce"" fossil fuel exposure, Hegar said in the statement.
Another round of letters will soon be sent to more than 100 other publicly-traded investment companies ""that appear to have one or more funds boycotting fossil fuels,"" according to Hegar's letter. 
Under a new state law, Hegar will draw up a list of financial companies found to boycott fossil fuels. Those firms could then be barred from managing state pension money. Hegar told companies they have 60 days to provide details.
At stake is access to state pension funds like the $197 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has about $2.5 billion with BlackRock for example.
Major investors face balancing acts as some pension funds and endowments move to divest from fossil fuel stocks over climate change concerns. High energy prices have helped keep other investors in the stocks however. 

A spokesman said Hegar was not available for further comment.
Representatives for BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo did not comment. In a previous letter, BlackRock had argued to Texas officials that as a long-term investor in fossil fuel companies, ""we want to see these companies succeed and prosper.""

(Reuters) - Former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo filed a request for arbitration on Wednesday, seeking $125 million in damages for alleged wrongful termination. 
The network fired Cuomo in December, following an inquiry into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had been accused of sexual harassment.
Chris Cuomo maintains that he was transparent with CNN about his role as his brother's confidant, and had ""no reason to believe"" that this violated the network's policies. He also claimed that former CNN chief Jeff Zucker and one-time marketing chief Allison Gollust had themselves provided advice to the former governor.
Details of Cuomo's assistance to his brother came to light in November, when the New York State Attorney General released materials related to its investigation of Andrew Cuomo.
The filing alleges the law firm CNN hired to investigate Cuomo's role in advising his brother, and a subsequent allegation of sexual misconduct that surfaced in a Dec. 1 letter, failed to give him an opportunity to explain what happened or address the woman's allegations, which he claims are false. 
Chris Cuomo's lawyers also argue that CNN was willing to bend its rules when it would benefit the network, citing the early days of the pandemic, in early 2020, when the network lifted its ban on Chris Cuomo interviewing his brother ""to exploit the Cuomo family relationship for its own purposes.""
""As CNN has admitted, network standards were changed in a calculated decision to boost ratings,"" said Bryan Freedman, one of Cuomo's attorneys, in a statement. ""When those practices were called into question, Chris was made the scapegoat.""

Representatives of CNN parent, AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia, declined comment.
Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Zucker and Gollust, previously said that ""Jeff was never aware of the full extent of what Chris Cuomo was doing for his brother, which is why Chris was fired."" She said neither Gollust nor Zucker offered advice to the former governor. Both left the network after failing to disclose a consensual relationship.

Shares of the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder were up 1.8% at $90.10 in after market trading.
Demand for housing soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as buyers capitalized on record-low mortgage rates and remote workers sought more living space.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN)'s first-quarter revenue came in at $6.20 billion, ahead of analysts' estimates of $6.08 billion. Orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 1% to 15,747 homes in the reported quarter, while deliveries increased 2% to 12,538 units.
The company said it expects second-quarter new orders of between 17,800 and 18,200 homes, barely hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
""Both gross margin and net margin remained strong, even as materials costs and wages have increased, and home prices have continued to rise while remaining affordable even as interest rates have ticked up,"" Lennar Chairman Stuart Miller said.
Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $503.6 million, or $1.69 per share, in the quarter ended Feb.28, from $1 billion, or $3.20 per share, a year earlier.
Lennar faced volatility in its LenX platform, that invests in companies that focus on homebuilding, affecting its bottom line performance for the reported quarter.
Excluding the impact from its LENx investments, the company reported a profit of $2.70 per share. 

The pricing environment helped larger rival D.R. Horton post a 44.2% rise in quarterly profit last month.
