The winner of the May 3 primary will represent the party in the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, where the Republicans are expected to make gains off President Joe Biden's Democrats. 
""Like some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,"" Trump said in a statement. 
Rivals in the contest include former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, former state Republican Chair Jane Timken, financier Mike Gibbons and state lawmaker Matt Dolan. 
The winner will likely face U.S. Representative Tim Ryan, who is expected to win the Democratic nomination.
While some candidates actively seek Trump's endorsements to tap into his base, they are sometimes designed to seek revenge on Republicans who failed to support him previously and have not always made the handpicked candidate the favorite. 

Vance is a Yale-educated lawyer and venture capitalist who published the bestselling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" in 2016. Initially a Trump critic, Vance visited Trump's Florida resort last year to meet with the former president, who won Ohio by eight percentage points in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.
A recent move to endorse celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania divided local party officials and stunned close advisers, two sources familiar with the internal deliberations told Reuters.

(Reuters) -Texas will halt enhanced inspections of trucks arriving from Mexico after reaching an agreement with the last of four neighboring Mexican states, Governor Greg Abbott said on Friday, a move expected to alleviate costly, long backups over the past week.
The agreement calls for the Mexican state of Tamaulipas -- located on the easternmost part of the Texas-Mexico border -- to increase security efforts targeting illegal immigration and drug smuggling, Abbott and Tamaulipas Governor Francisco Garcia Cabeza de Vaca said during a news conference in Weslaco, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Last week, Abbott, a Republican running for reelection in November, ordered state authorities to conduct ""enhanced safety inspections"" of vehicles as they cross from Mexico into Texas in order to uncover smuggling of people and contraband. 
The stepped-up inspections, which Abbott said were needed because of President Joe Biden's inability to secure the border, snarled truck traffic and sparked protests by Mexican truckers in their country that shut down several commercial crossings in Texas and New Mexico.
The traffic jams caused millions of dollars in losses and prompted pressure from business groups, including the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, an alliance of more than 100 companies involved in the import and distribution of Mexican produce in the United States. 
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a fellow Republican, urged Abbott on Tuesday to end the additional truck checks, saying they would ""quickly lead to $2.00 lemons, $5.00 avocados and worse.""
On Wednesday, the White House slammed the inspections, saying they were unnecessary and had disrupted food and automobile supply chains, driving up prices. Biden, a Democrat, is already battling rising inflation and challenges to the movement of goods stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Abbott has also chartered buses to carry migrants from Texas to Washington to send a message to Biden, with the third bus arriving on Friday, according to the governor's office and news reports.
The Texas governor said at Friday's news conference that he could reinstate the truck inspections if the four Mexican states fail to take steps to reduce illegal immigration, even if resulting border backups lead to ""knock-on economic effects.""
Abbott and Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), said they found no smuggling attempts during the beefed-up inspections, which followed screening for smuggling and contraband by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.
McCraw said the Texas state inspections persuaded Mexican drug cartels not to engage in smuggling, but did not provide direct evidence for that assessment.
""The cartels know what they're doing,"" he said.
As of Thursday, Texas DPS had taken more than 1,400 vehicles out of service for safety violations such as defective brakes, tires and lighting, the agency said.

Earlier in the week, Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat challenging Abbott in the Nov. 8 elections and a former U.S. congressman, criticized Abbott in tweets and videos, calling the governor's actions a ""political stunt"" that sowed chaos at the border.
Abbott had struck similar deals in recent days with the governors of the three other Mexican states that share a border with Texas -- Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua and Coahuila -- amid pressure from business groups.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden and his wife Jill released their federal tax returns on Friday, showing the couple earned more than $600,000 last year and paid an effective federal income tax rate of 24.6%.
The Bidens also donated roughly 2.8% of their income, or $17,384, to charities, including $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, which works to prevent child abuse. Beau Biden, the president's son, died of cancer in 2015.
The tradition of presidents making their federal tax returns public was broken by Biden's predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Trump said he was not able to do so while being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, even as the agency claimed he was free to release them. 
The Bidens reported federal adjusted gross income of $610,702 and paid $150,439 in federal income tax. The previous year, when Biden was running for president, they reported $607,336 in income.
Biden earned $378,333 with his presidential salary, slightly below what would normally be $400,000 in pay because he entered office on Jan. 20. Jill Biden earned $67,116 from her job teaching at Northern Virginia Community College.
The couple earned $103,258 in taxable interest, pensions, annuities, IRA distributions, and Social Security benefits as well as $61,995 in book royalties. 
""With this release, the president has shared a total of 24 years of tax returns with the American public, once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the commander in chief,"" the White House said in a statement.
Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, reported federal adjusted gross income of $1,655,563, the White House said, paying $523,371 in federal income tax for an effective federal income tax rate of 31.6%.
Emhoff stepped down from his law firm in 2021 and the firm is paying back his partnership stake over a number of years, a White House spokesperson said.
Last year he received $582,543 from his law firms DLA Piper, which he left last year, and Venable, which he left in 2017. 
Harris' book sales increased in 2021 and she made a net profit of $386,713 on those. 

Emhoff, who teaches at Georgetown Law, and Harris made $380,288 in combined wages and roughly $319,000 in a gain on the sale of their house in San Francisco.
They contributed roughly 1.3% of their income, or $22,100, to charity, according to the information from the White House.

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China said it conducted military drills around Taiwan on Friday as a U.S. Congressional delegation visited the island in a show of support to a fellow democracy, with Beijing blaming the lawmakers for raising tensions with their ""provocative"" trip. 
China's military sent frigates, bombers and fighter planes to the East China Sea and the area around Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command said, in a statement released as the lawmakers were holding a news conference in Taipei.
""This operation is in response to the recent frequent release of wrong signals by the United States on the Taiwan issue,"" it said, without mentioning the visiting U.S. delegation.
""The U.S. bad actions and tricks are completely futile and very dangerous. Those who play with fire will burn themselves,"" it said.
China's Defence Ministry, in a separate statement, said the U.S. visit was ""deliberately provocative"" and had ""led to further escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait"".
Taiwan is a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington.
Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) told Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen during the delegation's meeting with her that the war in Ukraine and provocative behaviour by China have united U.S. opinion in a way not seen before.
""To abandon Taiwan would be to abandon democracy and freedom,"" he said. ""There's a backlash growing in the world to thuggery - to the bad guys.""
Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the technology hub is a ""country of global significance"" and its security has implications for the world.
The bipartisan group of six lawmakers arrived for their two-day visit on Thursday, in a previously unannounced trip. 
Such visits, and a reference to Taiwan as a ""country"", always anger Beijing, which dismisses any suggestion that Taiwan is a country. China regards the island as one of its provinces.
The United States has no formal relations with Chinese-claimed Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.
Menendez acknowledged the Chinese government was ""very unhappy"" with the delegation's visit but said that would not dissuade the group from supporting Taiwan.
""With Taiwan producing 90% of the world's high-end semiconductor products, it is a country of global significance, consequence and impact, and therefore it should be understood the security of Taiwan has a global impact,"" Menendez told Tsai. 
Taiwan has been heartened by the U.S. support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the democratically governed island. 
That has added to strains in Sino-U.S. relations. 

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also put Taipei on alert for any possible moves by Beijing to use the Ukraine crisis to make a move on the island. The government though has reported no sign that China is about to invade.
Taiwan has complained for the past two years or so of stepped-up Chinese military activity, including almost daily air force flights into Taiwan's air defence zone, but not close to the island itself.

Ed Buck, 67, was found guilty on nine criminal counts in a in a U.S. District Court trial last July stemming from his role in soliciting men for sex games in which prosecutors said he gave out drugs or injected them into his partners.
Two of the men suffered fatal overdoses at Buck's apartment in West Hollywood: Gemmel Moore, 26, on July 27, 2017 and 55-year-old Timothy Dean in January 2019.
Buck, a prominent local and national figure in Democratic politics who contributed to the campaigns of President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, was sentenced by a federal judge on Thursday to 360 months in prison, according to a U.S. Justice Department release.
A restitution hearing in the case was scheduled for May 16, the statement said.

Prosecutors said at trial that the wealthy political donor targeted homeless, drug-dependent or otherwise vulnerable men, most of them Black, for his ""party and play"" sessions. Buck did not testify in his own defense at trial.
Jurors found him guilty of two counts of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death, four counts of distribution of methamphetamine, one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, and two counts of enticement to travel in interstate commerce for prostitution.

GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday defended his handling of the U.S. economy amid a 40-year-high spike in inflation that he blamed in part on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, Biden promoted his efforts to strengthen U.S. supply chains, accelerate American production of semiconductors and ease dependence on foreign makers.
But he spent a considerable amount of his speech talking about his handling of the economy, a factor in a dip in his job approval rating that could spell trouble for Democrats in November congressional midterm elections. 
Biden said job growth had accelerated in his first year in office, including 365,000 new manufacturing jobs, and that the unemployment rate had dropped sharply.
Dogging Biden, however, are persistent increases in prices across the board.
""I know that we're still facing the challenge of high prices and inflation,"" said Biden. ""Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices all over the world."" He said food prices have been impacted as well by a drop in exports of Ukraine wheat.
Biden called on Congress to give final approval to the Bipartisan Innovation Act to boost spending for emerging technologies and American manufacturing and to compete with China.
White House officials say Biden wants Congress to pass the legislation as soon as possible, and is heartened that lawmakers from both the House of Representatives and the Senate have begun working to iron out differences between each chamber's version of the legislation, the official said.
""Congress needs to get this bill on my desk as quickly as possible. Our economic strength is on the line and national security as well is on the line,"" Biden said.
Biden spoke after watching a four-legged robot named Spot march around a room at the university, an example of the research going on at the school. The robotic dog was said to be able to maneuver through complex environments to conduct remote missions.

Biden's visit to a historically Black university in a competitive election state comes as a November Senate race there is expected to be among those that decide whether Biden's Democratic Party retains their narrow control of Congress.
The president's popularity has slipped, with his public approval standing near all-time lows at 41%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican National Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying the group that has run the debates for decades was biased and refused to enact reforms.
""We are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,"" the committee's chairperson, Ronna McDaniel, said in a statement.
The RNC's action requires Republican candidates to agree in writing to appear only in primary and general election debates sanctioned by the committee.
The nonprofit commission, founded in 1987 to codify the debates as a permanent part of presidential elections, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
It was unclear what format future RNC-backed debates would take or whether they would take place as often as in recent decades. 
The move, which followed months of wrangling between the RNC and the commission, will potentially deprive voters of seeing Republican and Democratic candidates on the same stage. 
Millions of Americans usually watch the presidential debates, and many viewers say they help them make up their minds about whom to vote for, according to research by the Pew Research Center.
The Democratic National Committee, the RNC's counterpart for President Joe Biden's party, accused Republicans of trying to hide from voters. 
""Voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris, who are proud of their records,"" DNC chairperson Jaime Harrison said in a statement. 
The RNC's decision follows grievances aired by former President Donald Trump and other Republicans about the timing of debates, debate formats and the selection of moderators.
Defenders of the debates say they are an important element of the democratic process, but critics say they have become television spectacles in which viewers learn little about the candidates' policies.

Trump refused to participate in what was supposed to be the second of three debates with Biden in 2020, after the commission switched it to a virtual contest following Trump's COVID-19 infection. 
The RNC said the commission ""refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms.""

A letter, first reported by the Washington Post, was sent by Representatives Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Oversight Committee, and Jim Clyburn, the Democratic whip, to ID.me chief executive Blake Hall. It was dated Thursday.
The letter reflects unease over the use of facial recognition software to secure important transactions, including those with the Internal Revenue Service, amid concerns about privacy violations and inaccuracy. 
For its part, ID.me touted its efforts in helping U.S. agencies fight government benefits fraud by foreign criminal gangs.
""We look forward to providing important information to the Committee on how ID.me has expanded access to government for disadvantaged Americans, including individuals who do not have credit history, are underbanked or are without a home,"" the company said in a statement.

The lawmakers asked ID.me for information about what services it provides to federal agencies and 30 state governments, how often the technology fails to make an accurate identification, how many users' biometric data have been collected and how long users with concerns waited for help.
They also asked how often identifications found what ID.me believed to be fraud, and if that determination was made via a human review process, artificial intelligence or both.

(Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement agencies have agreed to change some of their policies for responding to demonstrations on federal property, part of a partial settlement agreement reached with Black Lives Matter protesters who were violently cleared from a park near the White House in June 2020.
The Justice Department has settled claims in four civil lawsuits brought by racial justice demonstrators who said their rights were violated in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., according to a Justice Department press release https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-civil-settlement-lafayette-square-cases issued on Wednesday. 
As part of the settlement, U.S. Park Police officers will face new limits on the use of non-lethal force and procedures to facilitate safe crowd dispersal, the Justice Department said.
The partial settlement agreement calls for Black Lives Matter D.C., a plaintiff in the litigation, to dismiss claims for non-monetary relief against the U.S. government. The plaintiffs are continuing to seek financial compensation from some defendants.
The U.S. government did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
""We are pleased that the Biden Administration is taking an important step to protect protesters’ rights so that what happened on June 1, 2020 doesn’t happen again,"" said Scott Michelman, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties of the District of Columbia involved in the litigation.
The lawsuits alleged that federal agencies used unreasonable force to enable a ""photo op"" of former President Donald Trump holding a Bible outside of St. John’s Church, a historic building near the White House.
A federal judge narrowed the litigation last year, ruling that federal defendants such as then-Attorney General William Barr were immune from any potential liability.
A U.S. government watchdog has rejected the claim that police cleared protesters so Trump could pose for a photograph. In a June 2021 report, the U.S. Interior Department’s inspector general said police dispersed protesters as part of a plan made earlier in the day for a contractor to install fencing.

The violent clearing of protesters sparked divisions and frustration among some White House staff, and a top military official later apologized for walking with Trump before television cameras that day.
“I should not have been there,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a videotaped statement. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden has authorized the release of a new tranche of records from Donald Trump's presidency to the congressional committee probing last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to a government letter released on Wednesday.
In the letter, U.S. National Archivist David Ferriero said Biden had declined to use a presidential power known as executive privilege to keep the Trump records confidential.
The letter is consistent with Biden's earlier statements that it is in the country's best interests for Congress to obtain Trump White House records relating to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.
Ferriero's letter said the U.S. National Archives will deliver the latest batch of records to the committee on April 28. The letter did not say what types of records would be transmitted, but the committee has previously obtained speech drafts, call and visitor logs, handwritten notes and other files. 
The National Archives, a federal agency that maintains presidential records, has already turned over hundreds of pages of documents to the House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.
Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications.
The U.S. Supreme Court in January rejected a request by Trump to block the release of a tranche of White House records sought by the congressional panel.

Only one of the court's nine members, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, publicly noted disagreement with the decision.
The Select Committee has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s decision to endorse celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania Senate race has divided local Republican Party officials and stunned close advisers who thought he had decided to stay out of the contest to pick a Republican candidate, two sources familiar with internal deliberations told Reuters.
Oz and David McCormick (NYSE:MKC), a former hedge fund CEO who has hired many former aides to Trump to work on his campaign, are the top two candidates in the Republican nominating contest that will determine who faces a Democratic candidate in the November congressional elections. The Senate race could determine control of the Senate and the fate of Democratic President Joe Biden's legislative agenda. 
In recent months, top advisers urged Trump to stay out of the Republican primary during routine monthly meetings at his Mar-a-Largo, Florida estate where potential endorsements of candidates were reviewed, according to the sources. In the last meeting, held in March, the former president and advisers agreed to put aside the decision for now, the sources said.
A third source with knowledge of the situation said Trump's wife Melania had encouraged him to endorse Oz.
The internal deliberations on the endorsement have not been previously reported.
While both Oz and McCormick had been vying for Trump’s support, the advisers saw no reason for Trump to endorse either of them, as both men have enthusiastically adopted the former president’s America First agenda. 
""It's not like he was knocking out a never-Trumper,"" with his endorsement of Oz, said one of the sources, using a name typically used to describe moderate Republicans who reject Trump's no-holds-barred approach to politics.
Ultimately, Trump always makes the final call and he ""went with his gut,"" the second source said. 
Neither source was able to shed light on why Trump changed his mind and decided to back Oz.
A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brittany Yanick, the communications director for the Oz campaign, said there was nothing surprising about Trump's endorsement. 
""President Trump endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz because he's a conservative outsider who will stand up to Joe Biden and the woke Left,"" she said. 
The McCormick campaign did not respond directly to questions about the endorsement.
While the primary includes a crowded field of contenders, recent polls show Oz and McCormick as the clear frontrunners.
Oz, a Turkish American, hosts the syndicated ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and is a household name in the United States, but his public image took a blow in 2014 when he told lawmakers probing bogus diet product ads that some of the products promoted on his show lacked ""scientific muster."" 
BLOWBACK
The former president's endorsement has confused and riled Republicans in pro-Trump regions of Pennsylvania.
Mark Hrutkay, the vice chairman of the Republican Party in Washington County in western Pennsylvania, says callers have been flooding his office phone since Trump announced the endorsement on Saturday night.
“I have not had one call from a voter who supported the endorsement. They are pissed off,” says Hrutkay. “This doesn’t mean they are abandoning Trump, because they’re not. They just don’t understand the endorsement.”
Sean Parnell, who was Trump’s first choice in the Senate race before dropping out amid spousal abuse allegations, said Oz lacks a conservative track record and will be burdened by a long list of “head scratching” moments from his years on television.
Sam DeMarco, who heads the Republican Party in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, was also surprised that Trump decided to weigh in and doesn’t expect it to have a major impact. 
“Voters have a lot of questions about Oz’s conservative credentials on issues like guns and abortion.” DeMarco said. “I am not quite sure why (Trump) decided to endorse at this point in the race. He’s putting his credibility on the line.”
Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg University in Pennsylvania, says Trump “went out a limb” with the Oz endorsement.
“It certainly carries risk for Trump, whose goal in the end is to look good and there’s a good chance he won’t when the race is over,” Borick said.
Still, some Trump loyalists in Pennsylvania fully support his endorsement of Oz and don't understand the blowback it is generating.

“People are becoming unhinged. Oz is a great candidate,"" said Lee Snover, a Trump loyalist who chairs the Republican Party in Northampton County.
""I got the same treatment when I backed Trump and people criticized me. They were wrong then and they are wrong about Oz,” Snover said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mark Meadows, who served as former Republican President Donald Trump's chief of staff and echoed his false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, has been removed from the voter roll in North Carolina as the state investigates possible irregularities in his registration.
""The Macon County Board of Elections administratively removed the voter registration of Mark Meadows ... on April 11, after documentation indicated he lived in Virginia and last voted in the 2021 election there,"" North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesman Patrick Gannon said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
State authorities said last month that Meadows was being investigated in North Carolina over his voter registration. North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation was assigned to lead the probe after a district attorney referred the matter to the state Department of Justice Special Prosecutions Section.
The investigation was in response to claims that Meadows, who represented North Carolina in Congress from 2013 until joining the Trump administration in 2020, registered to vote in September 2020 with an address at which he did not reside, own or visit, the News & Observer newspaper had reported.
""What I found was that he was also registered in the state of Virginia. And he voted in a 2021 election. The last election he voted in Macon County was in 2020,"" Macon County Board of Elections Director Melanie Thibault said in an email on Wednesday.

In North Carolina, voters must live in the county where they are registering and have resided there for at least 30 days prior to the election date, according to the state elections board website.
Meadows was also the subject of contempt charges by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, in which Trump and his supporters sought to stop the certification of now-President Joe Biden's election victory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa David Satterfield will step down from his role before summer, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, after less than six months on the job and at a time of persistent political turmoil in the region.
Deputy Special Envoy Payton Knopf will take over the post in an acting capacity, sources said, adding that Satterfield's departure was not imminent.
Earlier, the State Department announced Satterfield and Knopf were set to arrive in Ethiopia on Wednesday, for meetings with Ethiopian government officials, representatives of humanitarian organizations, and diplomatic partners.
The State Department had no official comment when asked about Satterfield's departure. 
The news of Satterfield's expected departure, first reported by the Foreign Policy magazine, comes at a time of multiple crises in the region. 
A more than year-long conflict in Ethiopia has sparked accusations of atrocities on both sides, while Sudan is in economic and political turmoil following an October coup.
The frequent change of personnel also raises questions about the Biden administration's commitment to the region, particularly at a time when it is grappling with pressing foreign policy crises elsewhere, primarily the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The region remains an ""absolute priority"" for the administration, a senior State Department official said, without elaborating further.
Satterfield, a long-time career diplomat with decades of experience, had replaced Jeffrey Feltman, another veteran U.S. diplomat who had stepped down at the end of last year after about nine months in the job. Feltman continues to serve in an advisory capacity.
Two leading human rights groups last week accused armed forces from Ethiopia's Amhara region of waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing against ethnic Tigrayans during a war that has killed thousands of civilians and displaced more than a million.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a joint report that abuses by Amhara officials and regional special forces and militias during fighting in western Tigray amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. They also accused Ethiopia's military of complicity in those acts.
Ethiopia's government said in a statement last week it was committed to holding all those responsible for violations of human rights and humanitarian law accountable.
Amhara government spokesman Gizachew Muluneh told Reuters last week the allegations of abuses and ethnic cleansing in western Tigray were ""lies"" and ""fabricated"" news.

Last week, the United States expressed concern about reports of ethnically motivated atrocities Tigray and called for an end to unlawful detentions based on ethnicity.
In Sudan, the military takeover derailed a transition that had raised hopes of an end to decades of autocracy, civil conflict and economic isolation after former president Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in a 2019 uprising.

DES MOINES, Iowa/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time on Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, a significant escalation of the president’s rhetoric. 
Biden used the term genocide in a speech at an ethanol plant in Iowa and later stood by the description as he prepared to board Air Force One.
“Yes, I called it genocide because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian and the evidence is mounting,"" Biden told reporters.
He added: ""We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.""
Biden has repeatedly called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, but Tuesday marked the first time he accused Russia of committing genocide in Ukraine.
""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away,"" Biden said at an event in Iowa on fuel prices. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan have both stopped short of describing Russia’s assault as a genocide in recent days.
“Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities,” Sullivan told reporters last week. “We have seen war crimes. We have not seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide.”
Shortly after Biden's remarks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted, ""True words of a true leader @POTUS Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil."" 
Under international law, genocide is an intent to destroy - in whole or in part - a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
According to U.N. convention, this includes through killings; serious bodily or mental harm; inflicting lethal conditions and measures to prevent births, among other means.
Biden has made a handful of statements about the war that U.S. officials have later had to walk back. The president stirred controversy on a recent trip to Poland when he ad-libbed a line at the end of a speech and said that Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. The White House clarified that U.S. policy was not to seek regime change.
Genocide, considered the most serious international offense, was first used to describe the Nazi Holocaust. It was established in 1948 as a crime under international law in a United Nations convention.

Since the end of the Cold War, the State Department has formally used the term seven times. These were to describe massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq and Darfur; the Islamic State’s attacks on Yazidis and other minorities; China’s treatment of Uighurs and other Muslims and this year over the Myanmar army's persecution of the Rohingya minority. China denies the genocide claims.
At the State Department, such a determination normally follows a meticulous internal process. Still, the final decision is up to the secretary of state, who weighs whether the move would advance American interests, officials said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell to 41% this week, a blow to his Democratic Party's hopes of retaining control of Congress in November's elections, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. 
Sagging under the weight of higher consumer costs, the 41% approval rating was just above Biden's all-time low of 40% hit in mid-March, one of the lowest levels of support in his presidency. The drop suggests that the small burst of momentum Biden briefly enjoyed last week, when he hit 45%, has stalled. 
Inflation, which hit a 40-year high on Tuesday, is seen as a major liability for his party as it heads into the elections. Americans are struggling with rising energy and food costs fueled by the war in Ukraine.
The poll found Americans want Biden to prioritize economic issues, with 27% saying the economy is the most important problem facing the United States today. 
On Tuesday, Biden unveiled plans to extend availability of higher biofuel blends of gasoline during the summer to curb soaring fuel costs and to cut reliance on foreign energy sources.
Democrats are widely expected to lose control of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate to Republicans, who would likely block many of Biden's legislative efforts.

The two-day national poll found 53% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance. Only one-quarter of Americans said they believe the country was headed in the right direction.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,005 adults, including 444 Democrats and 369 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of +/- 4 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden unveiled a new rule to rein in so-called ghost guns and ban the manufacturing of the untraceable firearms on Monday as the administration faces growing pressure to crack down on gun deaths and violent crime in the United States.
Ghost guns are privately made firearms that are not marked with a serial number and are difficult for law enforcement to trace when used to commit a crime.
The Department of Justice's final rule has been making its way through the federal regulation process for nearly a year and is likely to draw opposition and litigation from gun advocates in the coming weeks.
""These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,"" Biden said during an event in the White House Rose Garden. ""We're going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice.""
The rule would make it illegal for businesses to manufacture such kits without a serial number and for a licensed gun dealer to sell them without a background check, Biden said.
The rule is part of a series of measures announced by Biden and the Justice Department in April last year to tackle growing gun violence in the United States and curb mass shootings. 
In 2021, there were about 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) as having been recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations – a tenfold increase from 2016, according to statistics shared by the White House.
The Justice Department rule bans unserialized ""buy build shoot"" kits that individuals can buy online or at a store without a background check and can readily assemble into a working firearm in as little as 30 minutes with equipment they have at home. It also turns some ghost guns already in circulation into serialized firearms.
Gun deaths increased in 2021 over 2020, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. 

In 2021 there were 20,726 gun deaths in the United States, not counting suicides by gun, the group reported. This included 693 mass shootings, defined by four or more people being shot, and claimed 702 lives and injured more than 2,800 people, the group reported. 
Biden also nominated Steve Dettelbach, a former U.S. attorney from Ohio, to run ATF.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. House of Representatives Democrats on Monday proposed legislation requiring employers give their workers paid time off to vote, following failed attempts by Congress to pass major voting rights legislation earlier this year.
The ""Time Off to Vote Act"" would close gaps in state laws, U.S. Representative Nikema Williams of Georgia said in a statement, citing the long lines at polling places seen in her state and others during previous elections.
Democrats, led by U.S. President Joe Biden, tried earlier this year to get major voting rights legislation passed, but were prevented by two centrist Democratic senators' refusal to eliminate the filibuster in the Senate, a mechanism that requires most bills to gain at least 60 votes in order to advance. All 50 Senate Republicans also opposed the broad voting rights legislation.
The new narrow bill would ""ensure no worker has to sacrifice their wages or jeopardize their job security to exercise their sacred right to vote,"" Democratic Representative Andy Levin, a co-sponsor, said in a statement.

Many Democrats are concerned that the lack of action on voting rights will hurt them in November's midterm elections, particularly in states like Georgia where they won narrow victories after campaigning hard on protecting access to the ballot box.
A voting rights bill that was passed by the House in January but buried by the Senate would have established minimum federal voting standards so that any registered voter could request a mail-in ballot. It also would have established at least two weeks of early voting and expanded use of ballot drop boxes that make voting more convenient in many areas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Monday asked a federal appeals court to allow the Biden administration to resume enforcing a federal employee vaccine mandate that had been blocked by a lower-court judge in January.
A 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Thursday reinstated President Joe Biden's executive order mandating that federal civilian employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. The White House last week had told federal agencies they ""must continue to take no action to implement or enforce the COVID-19 vaccination requirement"" pending additional procedural steps by the court.
On Monday, the Justice Department asked the appeals court to take ""appropriate steps so that the government may resume implementation and enforcement"" of President Joe Biden's executive order.
It said the appeals court should issue its order immediately to allow the ruling to take effect, arguing it is ""justified by the serious ongoing harm to the public interest and to the government.""
Biden in September said he would require about 3.5 million government workers to get vaccinated by Nov. 22, barring a religious or medical accommodation, or face discipline or firing.
The Biden administration argued the federal trial court had no power to hear the dispute. It told the appeals court that employees were required to raise their grievance through the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA).
The panel's 2-1 majority said the plaintiffs had sought ""to circumvent the CSRA's exclusive review scheme."" 
The White House has said more than 93% of federal employees have received at least one vaccination and 98% have been vaccinated or are seeking a religious or medical exemption.

In mid-January, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Biden's COVID-19 vaccination-or-testing mandate for large businesses. The court allowed a separate federal vaccine requirement for healthcare facilities.
A third major vaccine requirement aimed at employees of federal contractors like airlines and manufacturers was blocked by a federal judge in December.

(Reuters) - Republicans are vowing to spend record amounts in key state supreme court races this fall, seeking to take advantage of a favorable national political environment to elect conservative judges at the state level amid deep political divisions. 
A string of decisions throwing out Republican-drawn congressional maps in Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania has intensified the party's determination to install justices who could give lawmakers fresh opportunities to muscle through more advantageous maps.
""The stakes in this election are going to be as high as the Senate race,"" said Robert Paduchik, the Republican chair of Ohio, where an open U.S. Senate seat is up for grabs.
There are nearly 90 state supreme court seats on the ballot nationally this year, according to the elections website Ballotpedia, and control of the top courts in Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan and Illinois are all in play.
The Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), which supports down-ballot statewide candidates, plans to pour more than $5 million into the most high-profile contests. That would be a record for the group, which is one of dozens of organizations and political action committees likely to spend money on the races.
The investment will counter successful Democratic efforts - led by former U.S. Attorney Eric Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee - to use state court lawsuits to fight Republican-approved maps, said RSLC spokesperson Andrew Romeo. 
""We know that controlling state legislatures alone is no longer enough to stop liberal gerrymandering,"" Romeo said, referring to Democrats' strategy as ""Sue Until it's Blue."" 
NDRC and other Democratic-aligned groups are marshaling their own resources, saying Republicans will otherwise have free rein to manipulate district lines to entrench power in Congress and in state legislatures.
Kelly Burton, NDRC's president, said justices from both parties have reprimanded Republicans ""for gerrymandering maps so egregiously as to prevent free and fair elections.""
Democrats face long odds in November's elections to maintain their fragile majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
State supreme courts played a significant role during the 2020 election and its aftermath, issuing rulings on everything from mail-in ballots to former President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud.
State supreme court races saw nearly $100 million in spending between 2019 and 2020, by far a new record, according to a report from New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. That total included some $35 million from outside interest groups.
The report's author, Douglas Keith, said he expects even higher spending this year given the courts' importance for partisan agendas.
""It is absolutely on stakeholders' minds that these courts are positioned to play a significant role in the 2024 election,"" he said.
OHIO COURT 'HANGS IN THE BALANCE'
In Ohio, three Republican seats on the seven-judge court are on the ballot this year.
The state party cut an ad criticizing Democratic Justice Jennifer Brunner, who is running for chief justice, for a 2020 fundraiser headlined by Holder, whose group has filed lawsuits challenging Ohio's congressional maps.
The court is split 4-3 in favor of Republicans. But Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, a Republican retiring at year's end, sided with the Democratic minority in throwing out a Republican-backed congressional map in January – drawing threats of impeachment from some Republican lawmakers.
Republicans sidestepped the decision by adopting a second map that appears likely to remain in place for November's elections while the litigation is pending. Installing a new chief justice could give Republicans a more receptive court ahead of the 2024 election cycle.
This fall marks the first time that the ballot will list party affiliations for state supreme court hopefuls. The change, approved by the Republican-majority legislature, is expected to benefit the party's candidates given Ohio's Republican lean.
The state Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed the three Republican candidates, plans to spend $4 million this fall, said President Steve Stivers, a former congressman.
""The court hangs in the balance,"" he said. ""You can have a pro-business governor, a pro-business legislature, and if you have the wrong four people on the Supreme Court, you can go backward every day.""
OTHER BATTLEGROUNDS
In North Carolina, the Democrats' 4-3 edge is at stake, with two Democratic seats up for election in November.
The RSLC released an advertisement in January accusing Democratic incumbent Sam Ervin of a conflict of interest in hearing redistricting litigation while also running for re-election.
Bobbie Richardson, the state Democratic Party chair, said Republicans have made ""our judicial branch more and more partisan."" Democrats will be ""investing heavily"" to preserve a balanced court system, she said.
The Republican state party did not respond to a request for comment.
In Pennsylvania, Republicans were frustrated that the state's Democratic-controlled top court approved a map earlier this year backed by Holder's group over one favored by Republican lawmakers.
Pennsylvania does not have any supreme court elections in 2022. But the Republican-majority legislature is considering ditching statewide supreme court elections in favor of a system based on regional districts, which would lessen the voting power of Democratic cities such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

Russ Diamond, a legislator running for lieutenant governor, is leading the effort. He said the current system creates a ""natural gerrymander"" favoring the largest counties.
Deborah Gross, the CEO and president of Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, a reform group, said the motivation behind the proposed change was clear: ""This is about Republicans trying to take over the court.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he is endorsing celebrity surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is running as a Republican in a closely watched U.S. Senate contest in Pennsylvania.
""Dr. Oz is smart, tough, and will never let you down, therefore, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement,"" Trump said in a statement.
The Senate race in Pennsylvania could determine control of the Senate and the fate of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda. A crowded field of candidates are vying to replace the retiring Republican Senator Pat Toomey.
Trump ""knows how critical it is to change the kinds of people we send to Washington. I’m ready to fight,"" Oz said in a statement. ""I thank him for that, and I am proud to receive his endorsement.""
The top Republicans in the race are Oz and David McCormick (NYSE:MKC), a former hedge fund CEO. Recent polls had Oz and McCormick neck and neck in the Republican primary contest to be held on May 17.
On the Democratic side, Pennsylvania's progressive lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, is locked in a race against Congressman Conor Lamb, a moderate representing the northwestern suburbs of Pittsburgh.
Toomey was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in February 2021 following Trump's impeachment on a charge that he incited last year's attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. The Senate vote of 57-43 fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump.
Oz, known for the syndicated ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" brings substantial name recognition to the wide-open Nov. 8, 2022, contest.
Oz rose to fame shocking audiences with show-and-tell displays of decaying lungs and rotting livers, telling viewers they should take care of themselves.

His public image took a blow in 2014, however, when he told lawmakers probing bogus diet product ads that some of the products promoted on his show lacked “scientific muster.” Senators at the hearing focused on green coffee bean extract, a dietary supplement Oz touted in 2012 as a “miracle.”
Trump in September 2021 endorsed Sean Parnell for the open Pennsylvania seat Oz is vying for. But Parnell suspended his campaign in November 2021 after his estranged wife alleged physical abuse and he lost a battle over the custody of his three children.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York state's attorney general is seeking to compel real estate company Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK) to comply with subpoenas in connection with its civil probe into the Trump Organization, according to court filings on Friday.
Attorney General Letitia James has been investigating former U.S. President Donald Trump's business practices for three-and-a-half years, with a focus on whether his company misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.
James said on Friday that Cushman had conducted appraisals for several Trump Organization properties, including the Seven Springs estate in New York's Westchester County, the Trump National Golf Course in Los Angeles, and 40 Wall Street in downtown Manhattan.
James' office is seeking to determine whether the appraisals prepared by Cushman were fraudulent or misleading, but Cushman has refused to comply with a subpoena issued in February 2022 and has only partially complied with an earlier subpoena, according to a filing.
""While Cushman initially expressed its desire to comply with OAG's subpoenas, the company nonetheless withheld hundreds of responsive documents and instructed four witnesses not to answer numerous questions based on meritless privilege assertions by the Trump Organization,"" the filing from James' office read.
A Cushman spokesperson said the filings did not accurately characterize the company's responses.
""Any suggestion that Cushman & Wakefield has not responded in good faith to the Attorney General's investigation is fundamentally untrue,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""We stand behind our appraisers and our work.""
Cushman said in January 2021 that it had cut ties with the Trump Organization.
Trump, a Republican who lost his bid for re-election in November 2020, denies wrongdoing and has dismissed James' probe as a politically motivated witch hunt. James, a Democrat, is running for re-election for her post.

James' pursuit of Cushman's records comes after she asked a New York judge to hold Trump in contempt of court for not turning over documents she subpoenaed, and to fine him $10,000 for each day he does not comply. 
On Friday, New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron said he would hold a hearing on April 25 on whether Trump should be held in contempt.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday celebrated her historic confirmation as the first Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court with a declaration that ""anything is possible"" in America and a reference to fulfilling the dreams of slaves.
Jackson, a federal appellate judge, was confirmed to the lifetime post by the Senate on Thursday on a 53-47 vote in a milestone for the United States and a political victory for Democratic President Joe Biden, who nominated her in February. Jackson, 51, will replace the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, later in the year on the liberal bloc of a court with a 6-3 conservative majority. 
""It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,"" Jackson said at an event on the White House South Lawn, American flags fluttering in the background. ""But we've made it - we've made it - all of us, all of us,"" she said.
Biden pledged as a presidential candidate to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court if given the chance. 
""We're going to look back and see this as a moment of real change in American history,"" Biden said, with Jackson and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black and Asian American woman to hold that job, flanking him at the podium.
Black women are a key Democratic constituency and helped propel Biden to the party's presidential nomination in 2020 with a victory in its pivotal South Carolina primary.
Jackson quoted another famous Black woman, the late poet Maya Angelou, in describing her own historic ascent to the nation's top judicial body. 
""'Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave,'"" Jackson said, alluding to America's legacy of slavery. ""In my family, it took just one generation to go from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States.""
Harris noted that Jackson's confirmation also means that four women will be serve together on the Supreme Court for the first time.
The outdoor setting was chosen in part as a nod to COVID-19 safety amid a rise in cases in the Washington region and a raft of top Democrats becoming infected.
Given a standing ovation by the audience, Jackson thanked Biden and vowed to rule independently as a justice ""without fear or favor"" while aiming to uphold the rule of law.
Jackson is due to replace Breyer after he departs at the end of the court's current term, usually in late June. All but three of the 115 justices who have served on the high court have been white, with two Black members, including current Justice Clarence Thomas, and one Hispanic, current Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
PAINFUL PROCESS
Biden said he knew that his Supreme Court nominee would face a painful and difficult confirmation process. 
""What Judge Jackson was put through was well beyond that - there was verbal abuse, the anger, the constant interruptions, the most vile, baseless assertions and accusations. In the face of it all, Judge Jackson showed the incredible character and integrity she possesses - poise,"" Biden added. 
During her March confirmation hearings, some Republican senators pursued hostile lines of questioning including accusing her of being too lenient as a trial judge in sentencing child pornography offenders.
Jackson said she has received notes of support, including from children. 
""And our children are telling me that they see now more than ever that here in America anything is possible,"" Jackson said.
Biden has been suffering in opinion polls, with high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushing geopolitical concerns to the fore. Jackson's confirmation could be a needed jolt to excite Black voters and other left-leaning constituents ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections in which Democrats risk losing control of one or both chambers of Congress.
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday showed that Biden's public approval rating inched higher this week to 45%, up 3 percentage points amid stronger support from within his Democratic Party. In the poll, Biden's job approval among minorities was 53%.

Among those invited to the event were members of Jackson's family, various Democratic lawmakers, labor figures and advocacy groups. Biden thanked the three Republican senators who broke with their party to vote for Jackson: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney. They did not attend the ceremony.
The decision to hold the event outdoors comes after former President Donald Trump's 2020 nomination ceremony for his Supreme Court appointee Amy Coney Barrett turned into a COVID-19 super-spreader event, affecting many top Republicans who attended. During his four years in office Trump was able to appoint three justices, who together moved the court rightward.

The text from then-President Donald Trump's eldest son was sent Nov. 5, 2020, as votes in several states were still being tallied, and laid out ideas to subvert the Electoral College process to ensure a second term for Trump, CNN said on Friday.
""We have operational control,"" Trump Jr. told Meadows, according to a CNN review of the message turned over to the U.S. House of Representatives panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
""We have multiple paths We control them all,"" Trump Jr. wrote, outlining a plan involving lawsuits and recounts in swing states as well as alternative slates of ""Trump electors,"" CNN said. If that failed, Trump Jr. suggested Congress could instead vote to reinstall Trump on Jan. 6, 2021.
Major news media projected Democrat Joe Biden the 2020 winner on Nov. 7 - two days after Trump Jr's text to Meadows - and the Electoral College certified the Biden's victory on Dec. 14. 
Congress was poised to certify the results on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers into hiding and delaying the certification for hours. 
The House panel is investigating the attack, which has been linked to seven deaths and nearly 800 arrests. 
Representatives for Trump Jr. did not immediately reply to a request for comment. His lawyer Alan Futerfas told CNN: ""After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.""
Representatives for Meadows could not immediately be reached. His lawyer George Terwilliger declined comment to CNN.

Trump has called the House probe a politically motivated attack.

Investing.com -- The European Union officially confirmed its latest round of sanctions on Russia on Friday, taking its first tentative steps to ban Russian energy sales across the continent.
The measures, which were proposed at a summit meeting earlier in the week, include a ban on Russian coal imports, albeit only from August. The timeline was pushed out after opposition from Germany, which says it cannot adapt immediately to a sudden stop in Russian energy deliveries.
The news came on a day when over 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 injured when artillery shells hit the railroad station at Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. The region has been earmarked by Russia's Defense Ministry as the top priority for conquest in the wake of its defeat around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Kramatorsk is located in the part of the region of Donetsk which stayed under Ukrainian control after Russian proxies set up their own self-declared states in Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk in 2014.
The attack happened as Ukrainian authorities were trying to evacuate as much of the town's civilian population as possible, in anticipation of a fresh assault on the region by Russian forces.
Shrapnel of an Iskander ballistic missile was recovered at the site of the attack.
Reports quoted Oleksandr Kamyshin, the head of Ukraine's railroad operator Ukrzaliznytsia, as saying that a Russian airstrike near the town of Barvinkove had hit the only Ukrainian-controlled exit route from the cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, and Lyman, stalling evacuations from the region.
The UN estimates that over 10 million Ukrainians - more than a quarter of the country's population - have been displaced by Russia's invasion. Attempts to establish 'humanitarian corridors' to enable the evacuation of civilians have been repeatedly disrupted by hostilities.",,,,,

(Reuters) - Republicans in at least a dozen U.S. states have passed legislation this year restricting the rights of transgender youth in a range of areas, including healthcare, sports and classroom instruction. 
The bills, some of which have been signed into law by governors, come in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, with transgender rights emerging as a major front in America's culture wars.
Here are some of the bills passed or enacted this year targeting trans children and adolescents:
SCHOOL SPORTS BANS 
ARIZONA: Governor Doug Ducey signed a law prohibiting transgender students from participating in school sports teams consistent with their gender identity in both public and private schools.
GEORGIA: Lawmakers passed a bill with an amendment creating a school athletics oversight committee that would determine whether transgender students can play on school sports team that align with their gender identity. The measure is headed to the desk of Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican. 
KENTUCKY: Democratic Governor Andy Beshear vetoed a bill that would have banned trans women and girls from school sports teams in grades six through 12 and at Kentucky colleges and universities. 
INDIANA: Republican Governor Eric Holcomb vetoed a bill banning trans girls from girls' school sports. Republican leaders in the legislators have vowed to override it. 
IOWA: Republican Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill requiring student athletes to join school sports team based on the ""sex at birth"" across public and private schools as well as in higher education.
KANSAS: Democratic Governor Laura Kelly is likely to veto a bill that cleared both chambers of the state legislature banning transgender women and girls from participating in female school sports. Kelly vetoed a similar bill last year. 
OKLAHOMA: Republican Governor Kevin Stitt banned transgender girls from participating and competing in girls' school sports. The law also requires parents or guardian of student athletes under 18 to sign an affidavit ""acknowledging the biological sex of the student at birth."" 
UTAH: Lawmakers voted to override Governor Spencer Cox's veto on a bill banning transgender girls' participation in girls' sports teams in school. Cox, a Republican, called the bill a flawed measure in a lengthy letter explaining his veto.
SOUTH DAKOTA: Governor Kristi Noem, a Republican, signed a bill prohibiting transgender women and girls from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identity. The ban applies to all state-accredited schools. 
HEALTHCARE RESTRICTIONS 
ARIZONA: Doug Ducey, the Republican governor, signed into law a bill banning physicians from performing ""irreversible gender reassignment surgery"" on minors. 
ALABAMA: Lawmakers passed a bill that would criminalize parents and medical professionals who provide gender-affirming medical care to minors. It is awaiting the governor's signature or veto.
TEXAS: Bypassing the legislative process, Governor Greg Abbott issued an order to investigate parents who provide gender-affirming care to their transgender children. Abbott has said these treatments amount to ""child abuse,"" and prompted some healthcare providers to pause or restrict care for transgender children. The order is currently being challenged in court. 
OTHER RESTRICTIONS 

FLORIDA: Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that bans any classroom conversation, including instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade, and says all teaching for grades 4-12 must be ""age-appropriate,"" wording that is not defined in the bill. The law allows parents to sue school districts they believe to be in violation.

26,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 05:33PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A federal jury ended a fourth day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a verdict in the trial of four men charged with a plot to kidnap Michigan's governor, allegedly over her COVID restrictions and with hopes of starting a new civil war. 
Prosecutors said Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris planned to abduct Governor Gretchen Whitmer from her vacation home in northern Michigan, aiming to end what they perceived to be draconian restrictions championed by the Democrat to control the spread of coronavirus.
The defendants had hoped the kidnapping would spark a second American civil war ahead of the 2020 presidential election as the pandemic exacerbated the country's intense political and cultural polarization, prosecutors said. 
During a trial that has lasted nearly a month, defense attorneys argued that FBI informants coerced their clients into discussing the plot. The men never made concrete plans on their own and were victims of entrapment and overreach by the prosecution, their attorneys argued. 
All four of the defendants face charges of conspiracy to kidnap the governor. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of the kidnapping plot because of efforts to buy explosives -- which they allegedly would have used to blow up a bridge as part of their getaway plan after snatching the governor. If convicted, the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
Earlier in their deliberations, the jury asked U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker for a definition of a ""weapon,"" in an apparent reference to the second charge. They also asked Jonker for transcripts of testimony from the trial. He declined that request, saying that the 3,400 pages of transcripts were not yet available and that jurors must rely on their memories, the Detroit Free Press reported. 
""I've been a judge for 15 years, but I still get a little breathless when we're waiting for the jury,"" Jonker said on Wednesday in reference to waiting for the jury's verdict, the newspaper reported. 
The case has cast a spotlight on the emergence of militant right-wing organizations in the years since Republican Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. It also suggests the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.
Two other men who had been initially charged -- Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks -- struck plea deals and served as star witnesses for the prosecution during the trial. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks awaits sentencing.
The four men on trial, plus Garbin and Franks, are among 13 who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.
The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. The group's goal was to end curbs on social and business activities imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. 

Prosecutors have also accused them of wanting to start a second American civil war, while defense attorneys have said their clients were often high on drugs and prone to ""crazy"" talk rather than concrete action.
Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the ""Three Percenters,"" a similar far-right organization.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has launched an early-stage investigation into former President Donald Trump's removal of official presidential records to his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The investigation comes after the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration in February notified Congress that it had recovered about 15 boxes of White House documents from Trump's Florida residence, some of which contained classified materials. 
The U.S. House Oversight Committee at that time announced it was expanding an investigation into Trump's actions and asked the Archives to turn over additional information. Trump previously confirmed that he had agreed to return certain records to the Archives, calling it ""an ordinary and routine process."" 
On Thursday, Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich blasted the Justice Department investigation and called it a sham.
""The Democrats, who are failing tremendously at governing, continue to weaponize every branch of government with sham investigations,"" Budowich said. ""Their partisan distractions won't stop President Trump and his endorsed candidates from sweeping Democrats out of power this November.""
A federal law called the U.S. Presidential Records Act requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president's official duties.
The Justice Department investigation is still in a very early stage, the source said, and it is unclear if it could lead to any criminal charges. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
The investigation was reported earlier by the Washington Post.
News about the Justice Department probe came to light after Carolyn Maloney, the House Oversight Committee's Democratic chair, earlier on Thursday sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to complain that the department was stonewalling her congressional probe. 

In her letter to Garland, Maloney cited March 28 correspondence from the Archives to her committee in which the agency informed her that ""based on our consultation with the Department of Justice, we are unable to provide any comment"" about the contents of the boxes located in Mar-a-Lago.
She asked Garland to provide a written explanation by April 14 on whether the department will give the Archives a green light to cooperate with the congressional investigation.

Trump, a Republican, told the newspaper he has not been contacted by congressional investigators about the assault, which occurred as then-Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers gathered to certify the Nov. 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden.
Just before the crowd marched to the Capitol, Trump repeated his false claims about election fraud at a raucous rally outside the White House.
The Washington Post reported last week that there was a gap of nearly eight hours in the White House record of Trump's calls as the rioting unfolded a few miles away.
Trump told the newspaper he had a ""very good"" memory but could not remember whom he talked to that day.
""From the standpoint of telephone calls, I don't remember getting very many,"" he said, according to the Post. ""Why would I care about who called me? If congressmen were calling me, what difference did it make? There was nothing secretive about it. There was no secret."" 
Several U.S. lawmakers, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, have said they talked to Trump during the riot.
Trump did not speak out until hours into the violence. Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought with rioters died the next day. 
On Wednesday, he defended his public silence and told the Post he did not regret urging supporters to come to Washington.
The House of Representatives' Democratic-led Jan. 6 Select Committee has interviewed about 800 people before expected public hearings in May.
Trump, who has invoked executive privilege to try to block the Jan. 6 committee from White House records, said he did not know what he would do if contacted. 
""It depends what the request is,"" he told the Post.

The committee recently interviewed his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his top White House advisers. 
Trump confirmed reporting that he spoke with Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, during his presidency. He declined to comment on whether former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows should have given the panel text messages in which she urged Trump to work to overturn the election.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Republicans are registering formerly Democratic voters at four times the rate that Democrats are making the reverse conversion in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, a warning sign for Democrats as they try to keep control of the U.S. Congress.
The Republican gains in Pennsylvania, home to a critical U.S. Senate race, follow a pattern seen in other states that could have competitive contests in November's elections, as high levels of disapproval with President Joe Biden's handling of his job are helping narrow the long-held advantage held by Democrats in numbers of registered voters.
""I just got fed up and just felt like there has to be a better way,"" said Beth Jones, 48, a retired Philadelphia police officer who last month registered as a Republican, ending her three-decade affiliation with the Democratic Party. 
Similar to other recent converts interviewed by Reuters, Jones cited concerns about inflation and violent crime in making the switch. 
Reuters examined registration data in six states that could see tight U.S. Senate races in November and which generally require voters to be members of a party to participate in nominating contests. While each state tracks voter registration differently, the review pointed to Republican gains in four of those states, and no substantial difference in two of them.
If Republicans retake control of either of both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, that will give them the power to bring Biden's legislative agenda to a halt.
'BAD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS'
Nowhere is the Republican advance in voter registration more evident than in Pennsylvania, where so far this year Republicans have converted four Democrats for every Republican who has switched to the Democratic Party, according to data published by Pennsylvania's Department of State. That's on track to be the highest conversion rate in at least a decade and well above 2016, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives and Senate.
""This is bad news for the Democrats,"" said Kevan Yenerall, a political scientist at Clarion University in Clarion, Pennsylvania. 
While registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans by more than half a million in Pennsylvania - 4 million Democrats to 3.4 million Republicans as of March 28 - the long-held Democratic advantage continues to narrow and is on pace to be the smallest in a general election since 2005.
The smaller gap could have significant implications for the race to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Senator Pat Toomey. Pennsylvanians will also vote for governor in November to follow Democrat Tom Wolf.
In North Carolina, where a tight Senate race is expected due to the retirement of Republican Senator Richard Burr, Republicans so far this year have picked up three Democratic converts for every voter that Democrats have poached, according to state election board data. Throughout 2021, the Republican advantage was about half that.
In Florida and Nevada, the numbers of registered Republicans rose in the first few months of the year while the ranks of Democrats declined modestly. In New Hampshire and Arizona, the removal of inactive voters from registration rolls has led both parties to lose similar numbers of voters in recent months.
PHILADELPHIA PUSH
Jeff Sheridan, a senior adviser for the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania, said the party isn't sitting on its hands. Efforts include hiring field staff earlier than usual for an election year, including additions of staff in January on college campuses around Philadelphia who are working to register younger voters, a demographic that leans Democratic.
But even in Philadelphia, a traditional Democratic stronghold, Republicans are gaining ground. Voter data shows that 1,315 Democrats in the city have filed forms this year to change their party registration to Republican, more than four times the number of Republicans making the opposite switch.
Not all the Republican conversions that show up in the registration data represent net losses for Democrats.
Angered by the city's violent crime wave, Alexandra Field said she registered as a Democrat last year in an unsuccessful attempt to help oust Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner in the Democratic primary before re-registering as a Republican in March. 
Ed Rumick, 72, a retired union electrician, told Reuters that his switch to Republican merely formalized a years-old decision to no longer support a Democratic Party that he sees as weak on border control and bent on socialism.
But Calvin Tucker, deputy chair for the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said the gains point towards a strong showing for the party.
Speaking from the party's recently opened office in northwest Philadelphia, Tucker estimated that petition drives and other efforts to engage with Black and other traditionally ""underserved communities"" in the city had yielded more than 100 converts or newly registered Republicans so far this year.
""It is a citywide outreach,"" Tucker said. ""We will do canvassing, knocking on doors, standing on corners, and talking to citizens and neighbors about who we are and what we are trying to achieve.""
In addition to inflation and other economic issues, a growing number of Pennsylvania voters have become disillusioned with the Democratic Party over its perceived shift leftward on cultural matters, said Terry Madonna, a senior fellow in residence at Millersville University, a longtime political analyst in the state.

Madonna pointed to Republican Glenn Youngkin, who won the governorship of Virginia last year after campaigning on a promise to ban the teaching of critical race theory in schools, as an indicator of what will resonate with Pennsylvania voters.
""It's not just inflation,"" Madonna said, noting that Republicans scored a series of victories in municipal elections in the Philadelphia suburbs last year. ""I think it's a combination of things.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives recommended contempt of Congress charges on Wednesday for Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino, former aides to Donald Trump, for failing to cooperate with a House probe into the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to the Republican former president, and Scavino, who was a deputy chief of staff, did not comply with subpoenas to appear before the House Select Committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.
The Democratic-controlled House backed the charges against the two men by a vote of 220-203, which refers the matter to the Department of Justice for a decision on whether to press criminal charges.
Only two Republicans, Jan. 6 Select Committee members Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, joined Democrats in voting in favor.
The nine-member Select Committee had voted unanimously in favor of the contempt charges last week.
Scavino and Navarro have argued that their communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that principle does not apply to former presidents. President Joe Biden's administration has denied executive privilege to the former Trump aides. 
The two men have not responded to requests for comment on the matter.
Contempt of Congress bears a penalty of up to a year's imprisonment and a fine up to $100,000.
Republicans lined up to object before the vote, accusing Democrats of waging a political war. ""Democrats are using the power of the federal government to jail their political opponents,"" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said.
Supporters of the charge said the two former aides have a legal and moral obligation to comply with subpoenas.
""In America, no one is above the law. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro is some form of royalty,"" Cheney said before the vote.
TESTIMONY BY TRUMP RELATIVES
Representative Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the Select Committee, questioned the two men's insistence that their communications with Trump were protected by noting that Trump's daughter Ivanka had agreed to be interviewed by the committee.
Ivanka Trump, who was a senior adviser to Trump when he was president, along with her husband, Jared Kushner, was interviewed by the panel for about eight hours on Tuesday. Kushner spoke to the panel on March 31. 
Navarro and Scavino are the third and fourth associates of the former Republican president to face a House contempt vote.
Some 800 people, including many White House aides, have been interviewed in the committee's investigation, as the panel prepares for public hearings expected in May.
The House backed contempt of Congress charges last year for Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser. He was charged in a case set to go to trial in July.
The chamber also voted in December in favor of a contempt charge for Mark Meadows, a former House member who became Trump's chief of staff. There has been no word from the Justice Department on whether charges will be filed.
The Democratic-led Select Committee has been investigating events leading to the assault on the seat of the U.S. government by thousands of Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, when Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers gathered to certify Democrat Biden's victory in the November 2020 presidential election.

After Trump repeated his false claims at a raucous rally that his defeat was the result of fraud, mobs rampaged through the Capitol, injuring police officers and sending Pence, lawmakers, staff and journalists fleeing for safety. 
Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought with rioters died the next day. Four officers have since taken their own lives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday issued the first acquittal in a criminal trial stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, saying prosecutors failed to prove their case against a New Mexico man facing misdemeanor charges.
In a case that could embolden some of the hundreds of other defendants facing minor misdemeanor charges to go to trial rather than seeking plea deals, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden accepted Matthew Martin's argument that he did not know he was breaking the law when he entered the Capitol complex.
Martin, a former U.S. government contractor from Santa Fe, asserted that police officers allowed him into the Capitol building during the Jan. 6 assault on the building by supporters of former President Donald Trump who sought to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.
Prosecutors were required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Martin knew he was entering a restricted area. McFadden, who was appointed as a judge by Trump, decided prosecutors had not met that burden.
Martin's lawyer Dan Cron said in an interview that Martin looks forward to moving on with his life.
Following the Capitol riot, Martin lost his top-secret level clearance and his job as a contractor supporting the U.S. Department of Energy's nuclear stockpile in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
Martin had waived his right to a trial by jury, instead asking McFadden to determine his guilt or innocence in a proceeding known as a bench trial. This was the second such trial McFadden oversaw following one last month for another New Mexico man also facing Jan. 6 misdemeanor charges.
McFadden found that defendant, Couy Griffin, guilty of entering a restricted area protected by the Secret Service. But McFadden acquitted Griffin on a disorderly conduct charge, saying prosecutors failed to prove Griffin riled up the crowd.

Also last month, the U.S. Justice Department secured an important victory in the first Jan. 6 criminal case to culminate in a jury trial. Jurors found Guy Reffitt of Texas guilty of all five of the felony charges he faced, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding.
In another case, Enrique Tarrio, the former top leader of the right-wing group the Proud Boys, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to criminal charges accusing him of conspiring ahead of the Capitol riot to block Congress from certifying Biden's 2020 election victory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday dealt a setback to Steve Bannon ahead of his upcoming criminal trial, blocking former President Donald Trump's adviser from telling jurors that he relied on advice from lawyers when he defied a congressional subpoena.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols blocked Bannon's attorneys from making an argument known as the ""advice of counsel"" defense during the trial, which is scheduled to begin on July 18.
Bannon was charged in November with two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena issued by a House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. Bannon refused to provide requested testimony or documents, citing Trump's claim - rejected by other courts - that the material is protected under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.
The ""advice of counsel"" defense can be used to beat criminal charges. Defendants invoking the defense argue that they relied in good faith on advice from lawyers and therefore did not intend to break the law.
Bannon's lawyers said in a February court filing that this defense was a key part of their case.
""The government alleges that Mr. Bannon committed a crime,"" Bannon's defense lawyers said in the filing. ""Every act that they intend to rely upon as proof involved Mr. Bannon's reliance upon legal advice.""
Bannon's attorneys hope to argue that he relied on legal advice from his lawyer Robert Costello, who previously advised him that he could not testify or provide records to the panel unless it brokered a deal with Trump or convinced a federal court to agree to waive executive privilege.

Costello, who still represents Bannon, cited a number of prior legal opinions published by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which found that current and former executive branch officials were immune from congressional subpoenas. Costello and his co-counsel M. Evan Corcoran did not immediately respond to a request for comment following the judge's decision.
Bannon, a prominent figure in right-wing media circles, was an architect of Trump's 2016 presidential victory and served as White House chief strategist in 2017. The former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) banker and Navy veteran has promoted right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad.

(Reuters) -Democrats in the U.S. Congress proposed a raft of new rules for the federal judiciary on Wednesday including a formal mechanism to remove judges from hearing cases in the event of a conflict of interest and another intended to reduce secret court filings.
The legislation was being introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Among its sponsors are House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Senate Judiciary Committee members Sheldon Whitehouse and Richard Blumenthal.
The bill comes as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced calls by some Democrats to recuse himself from any cases involving the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, citing the activities of the justice's wife Virginia Thomas, a conservative political activist.
Under current practice, the nine Supreme Court justices individually decide whether to recuse themselves from a case because of a conflict of interest. Under the proposed legislation, the full Supreme Court would be required to review requests for recusal.
The proposed legislation also would require all federal judges to announce a compelling reason for sealing any document, and would require that the secrecy would last ""no longer than necessary."" The bill would mandate public notice when a party has requested records to be sealed in a case and would direct judicial leaders to devise an inexpensive process for someone outside the case to contest a secrecy motion.
A spokesperson for the U.S. judiciary did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters revealed in a 2019 series ""Hidden Injustice"" how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal information that is pertinent to public health and safety. (See Hidden Injustice series https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-courts-secrecy)
The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products - including drugs, cars and medical devices - while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.
Though they are required in most of the regional circuits of the federal judiciary to explain why they allow records to be sealed, judges in cases involving defective products rarely do so, Reuters found. 
In addition, the legislation would require the Supreme Court to provide live video of its oral arguments on the internet as well as other ethics guidelines for judges. The Supreme Court has not allowed video of its arguments but began allowing live audio in 2020 at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued that practice.

It is the latest legislation pursued by some Democrats that would make changes in the federal judiciary. 
Legislation unveiled last year that would expand the U.S. Supreme Court to 13 justices from the current nine - in a bid to erase its current conservative majority - drew an unenthusiastic response from the White House and top congressional Democrats and was denounced by Republicans.

""To enable Americans to continue to get back on their feet after two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced, my administration is extending the pause on federal student loan repayments,"" Biden said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Barack Obama returned to the White House on Tuesday for the first time since leaving office in 2017 to tout the benefits of his signature healthcare law and bolster his friend and former governing partner, President Joe Biden.
Obama arrived in the East Room to robust cheers from the assembled crowd of Congress members and administration staffers, and remarked on the changes that had been made in the White House since he was last there - notably the arrival of a feline.
""There’s a cat running around,"" he said to laughter, ""which I guarantee you Bo and Sunny would have been very unhappy about,"" referring to his family's dogs.
Obama jokingly referred to Biden as ""vice president"" before correcting himself, inspiring a salute from Biden, then offered broad praise of the Affordable Care Act, whose passage he described as a ""high point"" of his time in office.
""If you can get millions of people health coverage and better protection, it is, to quote a famous American, a pretty ... big deal,"" Obama said to hoots of laughter from the crowd, referencing an off-color Biden remark picked up by a hot mic when the law was signed. 
Biden, who hosted Obama for lunch, joked that the two men did not know who should sit where when they dined, and lauded Obama for his leadership on the healthcare law.
“The Affordable Care Act has been called a lot of things but Obamacare is the most fitting,"" Biden said.
While Obama remains a popular figure, Biden faces moribund public approval ratings thanks in part to high inflation and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Democrats risk losing control of at least one, if not both, chambers of Congress in November, which would bring Biden's legislative agenda to a halt.
Biden unveiled a measure to fix an element of the healthcare law known as the ""family glitch"" that left family members of those with access to employer-provided health plans ineligible for certain subsidies, and he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to do all they could to expand healthcare coverage. 
Before signing and as he finished his remarks, he quipped: ""Barack, I'm going to remind you: it's a hot mic."" 
Focusing on healthcare has helped Democrats politically in the past. Obamacare was the former president's top legislative accomplishment, and Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal it.
""But what the Affordable Care Act shows is that if you are driven by the core idea that, together, we can improve the lives of this generation and the next, and if you're persistent ... you can have an impact on millions of lives,"" Obama said. 
Obama and Biden became friends during Obama's time in office, meeting for lunch weekly. Their families became close and Obama spoke at the funeral of Biden's son, Beau.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Obama and Biden had an expansive conversation and a walk. ""They did go take a look at the Oval Office and take a walk around, and I know they enjoyed spending time together,"" she said.

The White House said the proposed adjustment to the Affordable Care Act, put forward in a rule by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service that must be finalized, would save hundreds of dollars a month for hundreds of thousands of families.
It said the ""family glitch"" affects some 5 million people and ""has made it impossible for many families to use the premium tax credit to purchase an affordable, high-quality Marketplace plan.""

""Has it occurred to you that Russia has not overrun Ukraine because of what we've done? And our allies have done? Have you ever even thought about that?,"" Austin asked rhetorically to Rep. Matt Gaetz during testimony to the House Armed Services Committee. Austin and other U.S. officials say U.S. support to Ukrainian forces, along with Ukraine's strong will to fight, has thwarted Russia's plans for a swift victory in a campaign now in its sixth week.
General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the conflict in Ukraine could last for years.
""I do think this is a very protracted conflict and I think it is at least measured in years,"" Milley told lawmakers during the same hearing.

He added that ""NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time.""

The credit cards, issued to all 435 members of the House, are used to pay for airline flights, office supplies and other goods.
Texas and some other states have enacted new abortion restrictions and the U.S. Supreme Court has been weighing a challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision protecting nationwide access to abortion. Citigroup was the first major U.S. bank to commit to covering workers' abortion-related costs.
Abortion is a deeply divisive issue in the United States, and a key focus for both parties in the run-up to the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress for 2023 and 2024.
""By choosing to underwrite travel to abortions for its employees, Citi has explicitly staked out its position to advance the liberal agenda of abortion on demand and has shown no regard for whether a particular state’s laws are in place to protect the safety of a woman and her child,"" Representative Mike Johnson and 44 fellow Republican colleagues wrote in a letter to the House's chief administrative officer, who oversees logistics issues like credit cards.
There are 209 Republicans in the 435-member House that is narrowly controlled by Democrats. Most Democrats in Congress support abortion rights.
The Republicans' demand was the latest sign that the political party, which for decades was closely aligned with corporate America, had become at odds with big business over disagreements on social issues.
A spokesperson for House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor was not immediately available for comment.
A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment.
Another hot-button topic that has divided Republican officials and corporations is LGBTQ issues.

In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has embraced a feud with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, whose Disney World complex is one of the state's major economic engines. The company is seeking repeal of a law DeSantis signed limiting discussion of LGBTQ issues in schools.
""Disney has alienated a lot of people now,"" he said at a press conference last week, threatening to revoke regulatory conditions that allow it to oversee its Orlando complex with little government intervention.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating rose this week to 45%, boosted by stronger support from within his Democratic Party, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday.
The two-day national poll found that 50% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance as the country struggles with high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed geopolitical concerns to the fore.
Biden's approval rating has been below 50% since August and last month sunk to the lowest levels of his presidency.
But his rating rose in recent days by three percentage points, up from 42% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted March 28-29. 
Further increases, if sustained, could assuage the rising concern in the Democratic Party it could lose its narrow congressional majorities in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, which would torpedo Biden's legislative agenda.

In a positive sign for Democratic enthusiasm, Biden's approval rating within his own party rose to 82% from 75% the prior week. Only 15% of Republicans approve of his job in office.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 381 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of four percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The prospects of a $10 billion U.S. COVID-19 relief package were complicated on Tuesday by Senate Republicans' demand to link the bill to a vote on border restrictions and concerns by some House Democrats that the proposal did not provide international aid.
The competing demands come as top Democrats were aiming to pass the bill, which is less than half the $22 billion President Joe Biden had sought, before a two-week recess starts late this week.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that a resolution to keep in place Title 42 restrictions on border crossings imposed by then-President Donald Trump early in the COVID pandemic be among several amendments his caucus wants to consider when the Senate eventually moves to pass the COVID bill.
""There will have to be an amendment on Title 42 in order to move the bill,"" McConnell said at a news conference, adding that his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, would need to agree on an amendment process before proceeding. 
It was not clear what other amendments Republicans want to vote on. 
Schumer pushed back on the idea of twinning COVID-19 funding to immigration, telling reporters, ""It should not be held hostage for an extraneous issue.""
Senate negotiators led by Republican Mitt Romney on Monday had unveiled the bill, which dropped international aid from the package. That bill would provide more funding for making vaccines available at no cost and boost surveillance and testing. [nL2N2W22BK ]
It met mixed reviews from Democrats in the House of Representatives due to its lack of an international aid provision. The House would take up the legislation if it passed the Senate.
Prominent progressive Representative Rashida Tlaib said she was not sure it made sense to pass a bill she considered too small and made comments suggesting that Democrats could have trouble passing the measure in the House that they control by a narrow 221-209 margin. 
Tlaib told reporters she has not decided whether to support the bill, arguing that the United States has an obligation to ensure adequate global resources in the fight against COVID-19. 
""A lot of the success that we can have in crushing COVID-19 is making sure we understand that this is a global issue, just like climate,"" said Tlaib, a member of the progressive group known as “The Squad.” 
Some House Democrats offered grudging support for the bill.
""I'll support it. But I think it kind of sucks,"" House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern told Reuters.
An amendment vote on Title 42 could further complicate the path forward for COVID aid, if a Senate amendment vote made the restrictions became part of the legislation. It was not clear whether passing a Title 42 amendment would require a supermajority of 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber. 
U.S. health officials are expected to end the sweeping, pandemic-related expulsion policy that has effectively closed down the U.S. asylum system at the border with Mexico. The restrictions were set in place in March 2020 under Trump.

Early this month, Congress failed to pass a $15.6 billion relief bill amid Republican opposition to new federal spending. Many Democrats, meanwhile, rebelled against taking back some money earmarked to help state and local governments in order to pay for the new round of coronavirus relief. 
The House was also expected to vote later this week on legislation replenishing a fund created last year that provides federal grants to restaurants and other small businesses hurt by the COVID pandemic. That bill would provide around $40 billion for around 177,000 restaurants that have applied for aid under the 2021 law but have not received any because funding ran out, according to the National Restaurant Association.

(Reuters) - Early voting began in Ohio on Tuesday for the May 3 primary elections, all but ensuring that voters will pick their candidates for the U.S. Congress using a Republican-backed congressional map despite ongoing litigation over its legality.
The state Supreme Court in January threw out a previous iteration of the map, ruling that it violated a state constitutional provision barring congressional districts drawn to benefit one party over another, a practice known as gerrymandering.
In response, the Republican-controlled state redistricting commission, including Republican Governor Mike DeWine, approved a second map last month that made some changes but still gave the party an edge.
The revised plan created 10 safe Republican seats, two safe Democratic seats and three competitive districts in a Midwestern state where Republicans have received about 54% of the vote statewide over the last decade.
Voting rights advocates and Democrats filed another lawsuit challenging the second map, but the state Supreme Court has set out a schedule that will delay any decision until after the primary.
A panel of three federal judges overseeing separate litigation had weighed whether to postpone the election but had not done so as of Tuesday, when voters began casting ballots.
""The Republicans have been stalling, making excuses, and passing unconstitutional maps since day one, knowing that time was on their side,"" the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio said in a statement after suing over the revised map.
Daniel Tierney, a DeWine spokesperson, said the commission addressed the court's concerns about specific counties while following the constitution's requirements to preserve local communities and use compact boundaries.
In addition to U.S. House of Representatives races, the ballot includes nominating contests for a U.S. Senate seat and governor. The candidates selected in the May 3 primary will represent their parties in the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.
The crowded Republican Senate primary includes author J.D. Vance, former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, former state Republican Chair Jane Timken, financier Mike Gibbons and state lawmaker Matt Dolan. The campaign has turned increasingly negative as most candidates have sought to ally themselves with former President Donald Trump, who has not endorsed anyone.
The winner will likely face U.S. Representative Tim Ryan, who is expected to win the Democratic nomination.
DeWine is facing three Republican challengers: former U.S. Representative Jim Renacci, former state legislator Rod Hood and Joe Blystone, a farmer. Former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley and former Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley are vying for the Democratic nod.

The state will hold a second primary, likely in August, for state legislative races, after the Ohio Supreme Court invalidated three successive maps advanced by Republicans on the redistricting commission.
Under the U.S. Constitution, all states must reallocate House districts every 10 years following the census.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Enrique Tarrio, the former top leader of the right-wing group the Proud Boys, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to criminal charges accusing him of conspiring to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory ahead of last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Tarrio's attorney entered the not guilty plea on his behalf during a virtual hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The judge also announced a postponement in the planned May 18 start to the trial. 
Tarrio, 38, is one of the most high-profile of the more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on the day Congress convened to certify Biden's victory. Tarrio and five other members of the Proud Boys are charged with conspiring to block the certification.
Tarrio himself was not present at the time of the attack, unlike his co-defendants. Prosecutors said Tarrio still maintained an active leadership role behind the scenes.
He was arrested on March 8, and remains in jail, after a federal magistrate judge in Florida ruled that he presents a danger to the community if released.
Members of various right-wing organizations have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack, also including the Oath Keepers militia and its leader Stewart Rhodes. 
During Tuesday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly also said he will be granting a request by the government to postpone the trial date and added that he will release a written ruling later in the day. 

Tarrio was added last month as a co-defendant in the case, and prosecutors also indicated there is still a chance they could file additional charges or charge more defendants.
With a packed trial schedule ahead for the court, both because of the number of cases and due to delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, Kelly said he will hold off on selecting a new date until attorneys in the case can confer with one another. He said he will schedule another court hearing for April 21 to hopefully finalize a new trial date.

Two other U.S. representatives, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and John Katko of New York, decided not to seek re-election without a Trump-backed challenger.
REPRESENTATIVE FRED UPTON
On Tuesday, Upton, a lawmaker from Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1987, said he would not seek re-election after Trump backed two people seeking to unseat him. Upton was an early critic of Trump's false claims that he lost the November 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden due to widespread fraud. Upton said he voted for impeachment to ""send a clear message"" that the country will not tolerate a president impeding the peaceful transfer of power. Trump initially endorsed Michigan state lawmaker Steve Carra's bid to challenge Upton. Then, after Michigan drew new House district boundaries that put Upton in the same district as Republican Representative Bill Huizenga, Trump endorsed Huizenga and Carra ended his campaign.
REPRESENTATIVE ANTHONY GONZALEZ
A two-term U.S. representative from Ohio who voted to impeach Trump, Gonzalez in September became the first of Trump's targets to withdraw from a re-election bid after the former president endorsed a Republican challenger. 
Gonzalez's impeachment vote had drawn a rebuke from the Ohio Republican Party, which in May called on him to resign his seat in Congress. In a statement, Gonzalez said ""the toxic dynamics inside our own party"" played a role in his withdrawal. Trump has endorsed former White House aide Max Miller for Gonzalez's seat.
His seat was eliminated as a result of redistricting and Miller is now a candidate for the Republican nomination to represent that state's new 13th District in the May 3 primary.
REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE
Shortly after taking office as the first Republican woman elected to represent South Carolina in the House, Mace said Congress should consider censuring Trump because lawmakers needed to find a way to hold him accountable for his role in his supporters' Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Mace voted against impeachment but has been a regular critic of Trump's circle, including Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado who in November suggested a liberal Democratic colleague, Representative Ilhan Omar, was part of a ""jihad squad"" on Capitol Hill. Boebert later apologized though Mace criticized her for using ""racist tropes."" On Feb. 9, Trump endorsed South Carolina state representative Katie Arrington's bid to challenge Mace for the party's nomination in the June 14 primary. Trump said Mace's ""remarks and attitude have been devastating for her community.""
REPRESENTATIVE DAN NEWHOUSE
The Republican from Washington state was among 10 House Republicans to join Democrats in voting to impeach Trump last year. ""A vote against this impeachment is a vote to validate the unacceptable violence we witnessed in our nation's capital. It is also a vote to condone President Trump's inaction,"" Newhouse said at the time. Trump in February endorsed Loren Culp, a former small-town police chief, to challenge Newhouse in the Aug. 2 Republican nomination contest. 
REPRESENTATIVE TOM RICE
The South Carolina Republican backed Trump until shortly after Trump told the Jan. 6 crowd of supporters to march on the Capitol and fight for him. ""This utter failure is inexcusable,"" Rice said after joining Democrats in an impeachment vote against Trump. Trump on Feb. 1 endorsed South Carolina state representative Russell Fry, who is challenging Rice for the Republican nomination.
REPRESENTATIVE PETER MEIJER
Meijer, a first-term member of Congress from Grand Rapids, Michigan, said he voted for impeachment with a ""heavy heart."" Trump on Nov. 15 endorsed John Gibbs' primary challenge of Meijer, calling him ""a fabulous talent who loves the State, our Military, and our Vets."" Gibbs served in Trump's administration. The primary will be held on Aug. 2.
REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY
Cheney was the highest-profile lawmaker of the 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump. A U.S. representative from Wyoming since 2017, she was ousted from her role as the No. 3 House Republican following the impeachment vote. Cheney's father Dick Cheney served as U.S. vice president from 2001 to 2009. In a Sept. 9 statement endorsing Wyoming attorney Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Cheney in the Aug. 16 primary, Trump called Cheney ""disloyal."" 
REPRESENTATIVE JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER
The U.S. representative from Washington state not only voted to impeach Trump, she also submitted evidence in his Senate trial against the former president. Herrera Beutler said in a statement that the top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, had told her about a call he had with Trump on Jan. 6 while hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, in which Trump said, ""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are."" Trump has endorsed Army veteran Joe Kent's bid to unseat Herrera Beutler, who has been in Congress since 2011.

SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI
The U.S. senator for Alaska was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump and remove him from office. The vote failed and Trump was acquitted. Murkowski, known for her long independent streak, is the only one of the seven Republicans up for re-election this year. Trump has endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner, to challenge Murkowski for her seat in the Aug. 16 primary.

(Reuters) - Georgia's legislature approved a bill expanding law enforcement's power to investigate election fraud over the objections of voting rights groups, adding to a wave of Republican-backed legislation passed after former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was rigged.
The legislation passed late Monday would give the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), the state's top investigative agency, the authority to initiate probes of election crimes. Under current law, the secretary of state's office looks into allegations of irregularities and can ask the GBI for assistance as needed.
Trump has fiercely criticized Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both fellow Republicans, for their refusal to overturn the results of the 2020 election, in which President Joe Biden became the first Democrat in nearly 30 years to win the state.
Raffensperger and state election officials have said there were no major problems with the election results after conducting multiple audits and investigations. Trump has endorsed Republican challengers to both Kemp and Raffensperger and held rallies with them in Georgia on March 26.
The legislation, which passed the state Senate along party lines, was significantly pared back from a version that earlier passed the state House of Representatives. That bill included several other provisions that were stripped out, including restricting nonprofit grant money to local elections officials and added ballot security measures.
The bill now goes to Kemp for either his signature or veto. A spokesperson for the governor did not comment on the bill specifically, saying only that he has 40 days to consider the legislation.
Voting rights groups and Democrats have pointed out that election fraud is extremely rare in the United States and argued that greater law enforcement involvement in elections could intimidate voters, particularly those of color.
The proposed state budget includes approximately $580,000 to fund four election investigators at the GBI.
""This year's rushed process looks likely to cost Georgia taxpayers $580,000 a year – which will be spent chasing conspiracy theories,"" Aunna Dennis, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a good government group, said in a statement.
The bill's supporters have said it simply ensures that any allegations are fully investigated, which will improve public confidence in the results.

Republican lawmakers in Florida last month approved a measure creating a first-of-its-kind elections police force to investigate allegations of fraud.
Georgia and Florida last year passed sweeping voting restrictions, along with several other states controlled by Republicans.

(Reuters) - When Donald Trump holds his next rally in North Carolina on Saturday, he'll be trying to boost his handpicked favorite for the U.S. Senate, Representative Ted Budd, in a tight and intensifying contest for the Republican nomination.
Budd is locked in a dead heat with the state's former governor, Pat McCrory, ahead of the May 17 primary, with former congressman Mark Walker in third place. The crowded field could force a July run-off, risking Republican chances of keeping the seat now held by retiring Senator Richard Burr. 
Two weeks after Trump withdrew his endorsement from Senate hopeful Mo Brooks' struggling Alabama campaign, the race illustrates the dangers facing the party's bid to retake the Senate majority as it gets ready to battle Democrats for seats in seven competitive states, including North Carolina. 
Trump surprised many Republicans last June when he endorsed Budd, 50, a rank-and-file member of the House of Representatives with little statewide name recognition. 
Despite the endorsement and more than $8 million in advertising support so far from the Trump-aligned conservative group Club for Growth, Budd carried only 32% of Republican voters in a recent poll, barely topping the 30% threshold to avoid a run-off and well below the 50% mark that a separate poll forecast for a Trump-endorsed candidate. Other polls have shown Budd in the mid-20% range in a race with 14 declared Republican candidates. 
""It goes to tell me, and tell the people of North Carolina, that maybe he's not the right candidate,"" said Walker, who has defied Trump's efforts to persuade him to drop out. 
""I believe that President Trump prematurely hitched his wagon to the wrong horse in this race,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich said: ""The rally is in support of Ted Budd and all President Trump’s endorsed candidates who will be propelled to victory due to the power of his endorsement and the support of the MAGA movement."" 
DEMOCRATS DECIDED
Democrats have already consolidated behind their own presumptive nominee, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley. But political strategists from both parties say Trump's upcoming rally could put Budd over the top, when coupled with an expected $10 million advertising barrage by the Budd campaign and outside supporters including Club for Growth.
""It's not a flashy campaign,"" said Budd adviser Jonathan Felts. ""It's slow and steady. But we're winning consistently in the metrics that matter - grassroots, survey trends, and fundraising. We've gone from being declared 'unelectable' and down 40 points to right in the middle of things ... we're going to be where we need to be.""
Budd began airing his first television ad on March 23, a 30-second spot focusing on illegal immigration that promotes his Trump endorsement and shows him walking the U.S.-Mexico border with a pistol on his belt. His campaign expects to spend $2.5 million on ads in the run-up to the primary.
But not all of Trump's endorsed candidates are winning. Another Trump-endorsed Senate Republican candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, has largely trailed Senator Lisa Murkowski in polling and fundraising in Alaska's Republican primary race, though a mid-March survey showed her leading Murkowski 51-49%.
McCrory, 65, jumped to an early lead in North Carolina, after serving as governor, though he lost his 2016 reelection bid to Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. Political analysts also say McCrory faces skepticism from some primary voters who view him as not conservative enough, an assertion his campaign denies.
But the former governor has remained at the top, despite repeated Club for Growth attacks seeking to paint him as a closet liberal.
""The fact that McCrory is still at the front of the pack is a testament to just how difficult it's going to be to beat him in this race. He is well known to Republican primary voters, most of whom have voted for him multiple times before,"" his campaign adviser Jordan Shaw said. 
A poll released March 28 by the conservative North Carolina Values Coalition shows a statistical dead heat, with Budd at 32% support, McCrory at 29% and Walker at 12% with a 4.4% margin of error. Twenty-five percent were undecided. 
Budd leads in campaign fundraising with $2.2 million of cash on hand as of Dec. 31, the latest date for which Federal Election Commission data is available. McCrory had just under $2 million, with Walker at just over $570,000. The three campaigns declined to provide up-to-date figures. 
Democrat Beasley had the biggest cash pile: $2.8 million. 
If Budd were to win the Republican nomination, some Republicans say Trump's endorsement could become a liability for him in a general election in a state Trump carried by only 1.3 percentage points in 2020.

Senator Thom Tillis won reelection in 2020 by 1.8% against Democrat Cal Cunningham, who had led the Republican incumbent until his candidacy was overtaken by news of an extramarital affair. 
""No one understands exactly what a Trump endorsement will feel like in November 2022,"" said Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson secured the support of two more Senate Republicans on Monday, as she cleared a procedural hurdle toward becoming the first Black woman to serve on the nation's top judicial body.
Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney joined Susan Collins in saying they would vote to confirm Jackson, 51, to a lifetime seat on the court later this week. They also supported a procedural 53-47 vote to bring her nomination to the Senate floor after the Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked 11-11 along party lines on whether to advance the nomination.
Murkowski and Romney, who do not serve on the Judiciary Committee, announced their backing of Jackson as the Senate began voting to ""discharge"" the nomination from the panel, propelling it to the full Senate.
Their endorsement came after Collins last week became the first Republican senator to announce her support for Jackson.
Jackson is expected to win the backing of all 48 Democrats and two independents, giving her a majority of support in the 100-member chamber.
Her confirmation would not change the court's current 6-3 conservative majority, as she would fill the seat of liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring.
""After multiple in-depth conversations with Judge Jackson and deliberative review of her record and recent hearings, I will support her historic nomination to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Murkowski said in a statement.
The three Republicans voiced concern over the increasing partisanship of the Supreme Court confirmation process.
""While I do not expect to agree with every decision she may make on the Court, I believe that she more than meets the standard of excellence and integrity,"" Romney said.
Earlier, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said he will ""set in motion"" the process that will lead to a final Senate vote later this week to confirm Jackson, a federal appellate court judge, to the lifetime post.
The committee vote followed confirmation hearings last month that again exposed a stark partisan divide toward Supreme Court nominees. Democrats praised Jackson's qualifications and record while hailing the history-making aspect of her nomination. Republicans often pursued hostile lines of questioning and tried to paint Jackson as a dangerous liberal activist.
THREE PRIOR CONFIRMATIONS
Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, noted on Monday that the panel had voted to confirm Jackson to three previous posts, and he lamented what he called baseless attacks by some Republicans.
""They repeatedly interrupted and badgered Judge Jackson and accused her of vile things in front of her parents, her husband and her children. There was table-pounding - some literal - from a few of my colleagues. They repeated discredited claims about Judge Jackson's character,"" Durbin said.
Several Republican senators accused her of being lenient on child pornography offenders during her time as a federal trial court judge. Jackson defended her record, saying she did her ""duty to hold the defendants accountable."" Sentencing experts called the penalties she imposed within the mainstream among federal judges, while American Bar Association witnesses rejected claims that Jackson was ""soft on crime.""
During her confirmation hearings, Jackson pledged independence if confirmed and embraced a limited role for jurists. She also reflected on opportunities she has had that her parents, who grew up in an era of racial segregation in the South, did not.

Senator Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Graham (NYSE:GHM), the committee's sole Republican to vote to confirm Jackson last June for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, helped seal the committee's deadlock by deciding to vote no this time.
A final confirmation vote on Jackson was expected for Thursday or Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Monday touted the importance of the U.S. trucking industry especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as the administration has worked to boost the number of truck drivers by drawing in more women and veterans.
The White House touted the surge in hiring of truck drivers and commercial driver licenses issued. It said 100 major employers in recent months have launched apprentice programs to help train new drivers. 
Biden said U.S. agencies and companies are doing more to draw women drivers, but said more needs to be done to improve trucking jobs.
Biden called for changes ""so we can draw more Americans to work jobs with increased wages, reduced wait times and improved safety and so much more.""
The White House touted actions underway to make it easier to be a truck driver, including making it easier to find a place to park and doing more to strengthen workplace safety and workers' rights for drivers.
Biden was joined by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in outlining efforts to remedy long-standing weaknesses stemming from workforce challenges in the trucking industry.
The moves are part of a year-long drive to stiffen U.S. supply chains against climate shocks and geopolitical tension, so as to ensure that China or other nations cannot weaponize the supply of goods.
Biden has focused on rebuilding U.S. supply chains after acute shortages of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a dearth of semiconductors that made cars costlier and helped push inflation to 40-year highs.
Biden, speaking in front of three large trucks on the White House lawn, noted truckers move about 70% of all goods in the United States. He noted that average trucker wages have dropped nearly 30% in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1978. 
""In this iconic American industry it's getting harder and harder to raise a family with dignity and pride,"" Biden said.
Some carriers must replace 90% of their workers each year, White House figures showed. ""It's no surprise that so many drivers left their jobs,"" Biden said.

The American Trucking Associations said last week that weekly driver earnings were up more than 25% for long-haul, truckload drivers since the beginning of 2019.
The plan to boost the numbers of truck drivers, launched in 2021, has swelled hiring, with more commercial driver licenses available in the first two months of this year versus last year's corresponding period, the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's deputy chief of staff Michael Fuchs is leaving the administration, the latest top aide from her office to announce a departure, according to an internal staff memo seen by Reuters.
Fuchs, who served as a foreign policy advisor to former President Bill Clinton and worked in senior roles at the U.S. State Department under former President Barack Obama's administration, advised Harris on domestic and international issues, helped manage staff and often accompanied her on foreign trips.
He will remain in his current role until early May to ""ensure a smooth transition"" and will announce his next steps at a later date, according to the memo to staff.
""Fifteen months later, it's almost difficult to recall the magnitude of the challenges we faced when we came in, from an unprecedented pandemic to historically difficult economic circumstances,"" Fuchs wrote. Work done by the Biden administration has turned things around, he wrote.
Fuchs' announcement follows a series of exits from Harris's team. On March 21, Harris's National Security Adviser Nancy McEldowney said she is stepping down from her role. The White House said she will be succeeded by her deputy, Philip Gordon.
Harris's communications team, which had a turbulent first year marked by several messaging failures, has also had several high profile departures.
Jamal Simmons, the vice president's communications director, said Harris ""is grateful for Michael's tireless work, leadership and the many miles he traveled domestically and internationally ... our entire team will miss Michael as he begins this next chapter."" Simmons did not comment on staff departures.
Staff shake-ups after the first year of any presidential administration are not unusual, and other areas of the White House are experiencing turnover.
Press Secretary Jen Psaki is preparing to leave the White House in coming weeks, even as the Biden administration has yet to pick her replacement, two sources briefed on the situation said on Friday.
Others such as Jeff Zients, President Biden's coronavirus response coordinator, will be leaving the White House after 14 months on the job this month while Emily Horne, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, left her position on March 25.
""This period before the midterms is a common time for officials to depart,"" said a White House official, who did not wish to be named.

Harris is also hiring a new chief speechwriter, Meghan Groob. She most recently worked as an editorial director at Gates Ventures, where she was a speechwriter to Bill Gates, according to a separate memo sent to staff seen by Reuters. She was previously a senior speechwriter in the Obama administration.
Groob will replace Kate Childs Graham (NYSE:GHM), Harris's director of speechwriting, who left at the end of February.

""The hearings should be in early May. That's what I'm hoping for. Obviously we're up against a lot of obstruction,"" said Raskin, a member of the House Select Committee on Jan. 6. 
The Select Committee has conducted hundreds of interviews in its investigation of the attack, which came as lawmakers inside the Capitol were poised to certify the Republican Trump's defeat in the November 2020 presidential election.
""What we're looking for is the connections between the inside political coup and the violent insurrection. And I do feel confident we're going to be able to tell that story,"" Raskin said.
Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, testified to the committee on Thursday. The panel also expects to speak to Ivanka Trump, Kushner's wife and Trump's older daughter.
The panel voted unanimously Monday to seek ""contempt of Congress"" charges against Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser to Trump, and Daniel Scavino, who was a Trump deputy chief of staff. 
Raskin said the committee continues to scrutinize a seven-hour gap in White House records of Trump's phone calls the day of the deadly attack.

""We have no comprehensive fine-grained portrait of what was going on during that period and that's obviously of intense interest to us,"" Raskin said, adding that witness testimony has given the panel insight into conversations that took place during that time period. ""It does seem like the gaps are suspiciously tailored to the heart of the events.""
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy last year described talking to Trump during the riot, saying he urged the president to call off his supporters and accept his defeat.

(Reuters) - Sarah Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, announced her run for Alaska's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday.
It would be Palin's first run for public office since serving as John McCain's running mate in a campaign that saw Democrat Barack Obama elected president in November 2008.
""America is at a tipping point,"" Palin said in a statement released on her Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account announcing her candidacy. ""As I've watched the far left destroy the country, I knew I had to step up and join the fight.""
""At this critical time in our nation's history, we need leaders who will combat the left's socialist, big-government, America-last agenda,"" she said.
Such fiery, anti-establishment rhetoric came to define Palin's vice-presidential campaign in 2008 and served as a precursor to the rise of Republican former President Donald Trump and the modern Republican Party.

Alaska's House seat became vacant after Republican Don Young died suddenly last month at age 88 after serving for more than four decades.
A website, http://www.sarahforalaska.com, was set up as of Friday evening for Palin's campaign. The home page of the site says, ""Sarah Palin is running for Congress!"" and seeks donations.

Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House's deputy press secretary, and John Kirby (NYSE:KEX), the Department of Defense spokesman, who is well-respected in Washington but does not have a long history with Biden, have long been considered top candidates to succeed Psaki, multiple sources inside and outside the White House told Reuters. The sources declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.
Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, who recently made her debut in the briefing room, and has quickly impressed many in Washington with her confidence answering questions, is also under consideration, the two sources said.
Bedingfield, who was President Joe Biden's spokesperson when he was vice president and an early presidential campaign hire, has not expressed interest in the job during this administration, though she has talked about the press secretary role in the past, one of the sources said.
Psaki is expected to stay in the job through the White House Correspondents' dinner at the end of this month, one source told Reuters. She plans to join television network MSNBC, Axios reported on Friday, citing an unnamed source close to the matter. 
Asked about the reports at the White House Friday, Psaki said ""Well you can’t get rid of me yet."" She added she had nothing to confirm about future plans and was happy to be back in the press room after quarantining following a positive COVID-19 test. 
Quizzed whether she could brief reporters fairly if she was having conversations with a media outlet, Psaki said ""I have always gone over and above the stringent ethical and legal requirements of the Biden administration and I take that very seriously.”
Psaki said in January of 2021 she planned to remain in the job for just a year. In June, she said during a conference that she had the flexibility to stay on longer if needed. 
Psaki's brisk, detail-dense press briefings, occasionally marked by warm regards or withering exchanges with reporters, helped define the early Biden presidency. They served a sharp contrast to the president's less precise elocution, and to the previous Trump administration's combative approach to the press. 

The decision to replace Psaki is likely to be made by Biden personally, in consultation with his chief of staff Ron Klain and other top advisers. 
""Jen is here and working hard every day on behalf of the president to get you the answers to the questions that you have, and that's where her focus is,"" the White House official said.

GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (Reuters) - A half-dozen mostly young Republican activists stood gamely outside of a  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) station at a busy Southern California intersection, jumping up and down and holding a big sign reading, ""Gas too high? Register Republican.""
The demonstration in Garden Grove, Orange County this week drew beeps of support, and was successful in getting a few motorists to pull over to talk about gas prices.
The Republican Party says the Southern California voter registration effort is one of many it is holding outside gas stations across the country to woo frustrated independents and voters who supported President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the 2020 elections.
Republicans are widely expected to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and perhaps even in the Senate in midterm congressional elections in November. Voter displeasure at high gas prices might help get them there.
In addition to turning out its deeply conservative base, the party wants to win back moderates who fled the dramatic turns and right-wing nationalism of former President Donald Trump, as well as gain new supporters.
But the response at the busy intersection in Garden Grove, which is in a highly competitive Republican-leaning congressional district, shows it is not an easy trick to pull off.
Four people stopped to fill out forms at the group's table. One said he was homeless but could use his parents' address. Three were already registered as Republicans, while one was an independent. 
""The gas is so high because of Biden and the Biden administration,"" said Ernie Nueva, 69, who pulled over when he saw the group.
Nueva says it now costs $100 to fill the tank on his Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Titan V8 truck - up from $60 before the latest spike drove fuel prices to nearly $7 per gallon in parts of California. A lifelong Democrat, he voted twice for Trump and last year changed his voter registration to Republican.
David Wakefield also blames Biden for high gas prices, saying that the United States needs to become more self-sufficient, producing more fuel. He is considering canceling a planned driving vacation later this month to see friends and family in Northern California, Idaho and Utah. 
But he also is already a reliable Republican voter.
""It's a great issue in the short run, but it's not clear how it's going to hold up in November,"" said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at the California State University, Los Angeles.
In recent years, U.S. voters have been driven to the polls more by cultural and social division, rather than other public policy issues, Sonenshein said. While the high gas prices are certainly not good for Democrats, they may not prove powerful enough to drive turnout or lead voters to switch parties. 
The cost of fuel might also come back down before the election, weakening Republicans' argument, he said.
Economists say prices started to rise as travel and economic activity picked up after pandemic lockdowns eased, both in the United States and worldwide - leading to fears of tighter global oil supply.
Those trends worsened when Russia's invasion of Ukraine shook world petroleum markets. But the party in power generally is blamed for economic woes, and Biden and the Democrats are already becoming the focus of anger by some consumers.
`IT'S COMPLICATED` 
The RNC has conducted similar registration drives at service stations in California and other states, including Arizona, North Carolina and Florida.
RNC spokesperson Mike Joyce said the registration drives at gas stations had been successful, drawing in voters of all political stripes who are angry about gasoline prices.
The RNC did not give data showing how many new voters had signed up during these events, except to say that the number was in the thousands.""Majorities are won in the margins and with every new voter registered, we are one step closer to finally retiring Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for good,” said RNC Spokesperson Emma Vaughn, referring to the Democratic U.S. House speaker and Senate majority leader.
At the Chevron in Orange County, scores of motorists loudly honked their support for the tiny group during the nearly four-hour demonstration.
David Duprat, 38, a passenger in a car that was gassing up, feels every penny of the increase in gas prices. He drives to the construction sites where he works and lives on a tight budget while also trying to help his mother. 
He doesn't blame Biden for high gas prices, but overall, he feels that Democratic policies have contributed to the high cost of living in California. He has never voted before, but plans to do so in November - as a Republican.
""I really, really want to make sure my voice is heard,"" he said.
Motorist Benjamin Kohn, a liberal Democrat, is also feeling the rise in gas prices. But he thinks both parties are pushing black-and-white interpretations of events that are more nuanced.

He has no intention of switching sides over gas prices, and on his way out of the Chevron he honked his horn like many of the other passing motorists. Then he stuck his head out the window of his minivan.
""It's complicated,"" he yelled, and drove away.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected former congressman Devin Nunes' effort to revive a $250 million lawsuit accusing the Washington Post of defamation for implying that he lied to former President Donald Trump, a close ally.
In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., said Nunes ""does not point to a single statement"" that was false or defamatory on its face in the February 2020 article about Russia's desire for Trump to win a second White House term.
Nunes ""failed to plausibly allege a claim of defamation,"" the court said.
A lawyer for Nunes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the Post did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The article, ""Senior Intelligence Official Told Lawmakers That Russia Wants to See Trump Reelected,"" said intelligence official Shelby Pierson told members of the House Intelligence Committee, where Nunes was the top Republican, that Russia had ""developed a preference"" for Trump.
It said Trump was ""furious"" after learning about Pierson's remarks from Nunes and replaced Pierson's boss Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, viewing Maguire and his staff as disloyal for speaking to Congress.
Nunes claimed that the Post defamed him by implying that he misled Trump about who attended Pierson's briefing, and ruined Maguire's chance to become permanent intelligence chief.
But the appeals court found nothing to suggest the Post intended either implication.
It said the article merely stated in a ""matter-of-fact"" manner that Trump erroneously believed that Pierson gave her assessment exclusively to Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, who chaired the intelligence committee, and changed his opinion of Maguire after learning about Pierson's assessment from Nunes.
Friday's decision upheld a December 2020 dismissal by a lower court judge. The Post is owned by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.

Nunes has filed several defamation lawsuits in recent years, including against CNN, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), MSNBC parent NBCUniversal, and the publisher of Esquire magazine.
He left Congress in December to become chief executive of the social media venture Trump Media & Technology Group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An Alabama man found with a ""small armory"" of guns, ammunition and Molotov cocktails in his pickup truck ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot was sentenced to almost four years in prison, one of the stiffest sentences so far handed down.
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the 46-month sentence reflected the seriousness of the charges against Lonnie Coffman, 72, who had pleaded guilty to possessing unregistered firearms.
Coffman's sentence is the third-longest for a Capitol riot defendant, after sentences of 63 months and 51 months to people who attacked police officers during the assault on Congress by former President Donald Trump's supporters.
Of the more than 100 defendants who have been sentenced so far, most have received probationary sentences or short jail sentences of less than two months. 
""He had a small armory in his truck, ready to do battle,"" Kollar-Kotelly said during a sentencing hearing. ""I still can't get over why he had this.""
Coffman has been in custody since his arrest on Jan. 6, 2021, and will get credit for time served.
Coffman's lawyer argued that further incarceration was not warranted in light of his age, health, Vietnam War veteran status, remorse and acceptance of responsibility.
Police officers arrested Coffman near the Capitol after noticing the handle of a gun in his pickup truck while they were responding to pipe bombs left outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, both of which are near the Capitol.
Inside Coffman's truck, officers found an AR-15-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow, several machetes, smoke grenades and 11 Molotov cocktails. They also found a note with the name of at least one member of Congress and a judge, alongside the notation ""bad guy.""

Prosecutors said at the time that the combination of weapons and political messages “suggest that these weapons were intended to be used in an effort to violently attack our elected representatives.""
About 800 people face criminal charges relating to the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters, which forced lawmakers to go into hiding during the certification over President Joe Biden's election victory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed former Pentagon official Alan Estevez to serve as under secretary of commerce for industry and security, overseeing restrictions on exports to countries like Russia and China.
Estevez will take the helm of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which is wielding export controls to keep goods and technology from Russia's military and industry in response to its war against Ukraine. 
Officials at the bureau helped bring together an unprecedented coalition of 33 countries restricting exports to Russia to hamper the war effort and punish the invaders. It also has been at the center of the U.S.-China tech battle.
“Commerce is at the forefront of the Biden-Harris Administration’s response to Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine and many other critical national security priorities, and I appreciate the Senate’s action,"" Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement on Estevez's confirmation. ""We look forward to him getting to work.”
Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Estevez, an executive with Deloitte Consulting, spent 36 years at the Department of Defense. During the Obama administration, he represented the department on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews investments for national security. 
Estevez had been viewed a safe bet for the Commerce Department post when President Joe Biden nominated him in July, in part because of a limited track record on China. The bureau has power over Chinese companies dependent on U.S. technology. 
But his confirmation was held up by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez. 
Cotton dropped his opposition in November after Estevez said he would ""aggressively"" police tech exports to China.
But Menendez held up the confirmation until Thursday over a matter involving oversight of U.S. firearms exports, according to a person familiar with the matter. He gave the go-ahead after making progress on the matter.
“Secretary Raimondo and her team at the Commerce Department have engaged constructively on the critical issues that I raised,"" Menendez said in a statement.

Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official once viewed as a likely candidate for the under secretary post, hailed the confirmation.
""More is being expected of the Commerce Department's export control authorities than ever before,"" Wolf said. ""Having an undersecretary in place to lead it is critical.""

(Reuters) -A federal judge in Florida on Thursday invalidated several of the state's new Republican-backed voting restrictions, ruling that they violate minority voters' constitutional rights.
U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee blocked the state from enforcing provisions aimed at reducing the use of drop boxes for ballots, making it more difficult for third-party organizations to collect voter registration forms, and banning groups from offering food, water and other aid to people waiting in line to vote.
Governor Ron DeSantis, who is running for reelection and is also considered a top Republican contender for the 2024 presidential election, signed the bill into law last year.
The legislation is among several sweeping voting restrictions passed by Republican-controlled states following Republican former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.
In a 288-page opinion that followed a trial early this year, Walker said the legislation, known as Senate Bill 90, built upon two decades of discriminatory voting laws from the Florida legislature aimed at strengthening Republican power.
""For the past 20 years, the majority in the Florida Legislature has attacked the voting rights of its Black constituents,"" Walker wrote.
In response, state Senate President Wilton Simpson called the ruling ""highly unprofessional, inaccurate and unbecoming of an officer of the court.""
The Republican speaker of the state House of Representatives, Chris Sprowls, criticized Walker for making ""unsupported inferences"" and characterized the opinion as ""a predetermined outcome in search of an overlong and poorly reasoned rationale.""
A spokesperson for DeSantis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ruling is likely to be appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is widely seen as a more conservative court. Walker was appointed to the bench by Democratic then-President Barack Obama. 
Walker also criticized the U.S. Supreme Court for its 2013 decision weakening the Voting Rights Act (VRA), the federal civil rights legislation that protects minority voters from discrimination. That ruling struck down a key provision, known as preclearance, that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination to get federal approval to change voting laws.
As part of his decision, Walker said he would require preclearance for the next 10 years for any new law governing third-party voter registration groups, drop boxes or aid to voters waiting in line.

""This Court recognizes that the right to vote, and the VRA particularly, are under siege,"" Walker wrote.
The decision resolved four separate lawsuits filed by numerous civil rights and voting rights groups. Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who specializes in election cases, led the chief case, while the national Republican Party intervened as a third party.

Reporters asked White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield about the former president's comments on the ""Just the News"" TV program that raised unsubstantiated questions about Hunter Biden's former business dealings in Russia. Trump said, ""I think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.""
His comment came as Western nations are trying to persuade Putin to end his five-week-long assault on Ukraine, the biggest European war since World War Two. Russia calls its actions there a ""special military operation.""
""What kind of American, let alone an ex-president, thinks that this is the right time to enter into a scheme with Vladimir Putin and brag about his connections to Vladimir Putin? There is only one, and it's Donald Trump,"" Bedingfield said.
Trump's remarks came the week that a federal judge ruled he ""more likely than not"" committed a felony by trying to overturn his election defeat on Jan. 6, 2021, and as his business remains under investigation.
During the military buildup preceding the invasion of Ukraine, Trump praised Putin as a ""genius."" Once the attack had commenced, he condemned it as ""appalling.""

Trump's long-running search for information on Hunter Biden that could be politically damaging to Joe Biden led to the first of his two impeachments, over what presidential aides said was an effort to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House visit unless Ukrainian officials announced investigations into Biden.
During his 2016 presidential campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the Republican publicly suggested Russian hackers could help find Clinton emails, saying, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden rolled up his sleeve for a second COVID-19 booster shot on Wednesday as his administration rolled out efforts to help Americans live with the coronavirus, including a new website and a renewed push for vaccinations and funding. 
""If we fail to invest, we leave ourselves vulnerable if another wave hits,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House to launch COVID.gov, a clearinghouse of information aimed at helping people manage the virus as they seek a return to normalcy.
On Tuesday, U.S. health officials authorized a second booster shot for Americans age 50 and older and those who are immunocompromised, two years after the start of the pandemic.
Biden, 79, received his fourth dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE vaccine. A second booster of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's shot also was authorized.
Several drugstore chains, including CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), said they would start offering second booster doses.
Nearly 982,000 people in the United States have died from COVID since early 2020 over several waves of the disease, according to a Reuters analysis of local data. 
Although vaccines and increasingly available therapies for COVID-19 have reduced severe illness and deaths, public health officials are monitoring BA.2, an Omicron subvariant that now accounts for more than half of all U.S. cases. 
U.S. officials have said they do not expect another major surge, but noted COVID cases could rise from BA.2 or a subsequent variant, reflecting the administration's position that the country must learn to live with and adapt to some level of this coronavirus. 
Biden has asked Congress for another tranche of funding to pay for current vaccinations and treatments, as well as to shore up the nation's preparedness for future outbreaks. 
""We need to secure additional supply now,"" he said on Wednesday, warning free COVID vaccines may not be available this autumn without more funds, especially if a new vaccine is needed. ""Congress, please act... immediately. The consequences of inaction are severe.""
Biden, who had sought $22.5 billion, this month warned the U.S. government would run out of funding for supplies without more support.
Lawmakers lowered the amount before dropping it altogether from the most recent government funding bill, with congressional Democrats saying they will take up COVID funding separately. 
No. 2 House Democrat Representative Steny Hoyer told reporters that he hopes the chamber can vote on a separate COVID measure next week if the Senate can reach an agreement. 

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky and other senior Biden administration health officials are scheduled to update lawmakers at a U.S. House hearing on Wednesday afternoon.

Collins, considered a moderate Republican, disclosed her intention to vote in the Senate to confirm the federal appellate judge in a statement released by her office.
The senator said she reviewed Jackson's record, watched her testify during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing last week and met her twice in person, and concluded the judge possesses the ""experience, qualifications and integrity"" to serve in the lifetime post.
Collins lamented what she called a disturbing trend of politicizing the judicial nomination process.
""No matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum, anyone who has watched several of the last Supreme Court confirmation hearings would reach the conclusion that the process is broken,"" she said.
""In my view, the role the Constitution clearly assigns to the Senate is to examine the experience, qualifications, and integrity of the nominee. It is not to assess whether a nominee reflects the ideology of an individual Senator or would rule exactly as an individual Senator would want,"" Collins added.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said last week the chamber was ""on track"" to confirm Jackson to the lifetime job before its expected break for Easter on April 8. Senator Joe Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, announced last Friday that he would vote to confirm her, signaling that she will have the votes to overcome widespread Republican opposition. 
With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, Jackson will get the job if Democrats remain united regardless of how the Republicans vote. 

Her confirmation would not alter the court's ideological balance - it has a 6-3 conservative majority - but would let Biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51-year-old jurist young enough to serve for decades. The Democratic president nominated Jackson last month to the lifetime post to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.
During her confirmation hearing, several Republican senators accused Jackson of being lenient when she served as a trial court judge on sentencing child pornography offenders. Jackson defended her sentencing record, and American Bar Association witnesses rejected the allegations that she was ""soft on crime.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law the first federal legislation to make lynching a hate crime, addressing a history of racist killings in the United States, after the Senate passed the bill earlier this month.
The law is named for Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955. The bill makes it possible to prosecute as a lynching any conspiracy to commit a hate crime that results in death or serious bodily injury.
Till's death, and an all-white jury's dismissal of charges against two white men who later confessed to his killing, drew national attention to the atrocities and violence that African Americans face in the United States and became a civil rights rallying cry.
With the bill signing, the president was addressing both ""unfinished business"" and ""horror"" in America's history, Vice President Kamala Harris said from the White House Rose Garden after the bill signing. 
Harris, the country's first Black and Asian American vice president, co-sponsored the bill while serving as a U.S. senator from California.
""Lynching is not a relic of the past. Racial acts of terror still occur in our nation. And when they do, we must all have the courage to name them and hold the perpetrators to account,” she said.
In August, the FBI said the number of hate crimes in the United States had risen the previous year to the highest level in more than a decade, driven by a rise in assaults against Black victims and victims of Asian descent.
Biden, whose support from Black voters helped propel him to the presidency, said the law was not just about addressing crimes of the past.

""It's about the present and our future as well,"" he said, mentioning a rally of white nationalists in Virginia in 2017. ""Racial hate isn't an old problem. It's a persistent problem.""
The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House of Representatives by a vote of 422-3.

 Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) have declined to attend an April 5 hearing, according to Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona who chairs the Natural Resources Committee and has been critical of the industry. 
The three companies combined hold some 4,000 leases that cover roughly 1.5 million acres (607,000 hectares) of public land, and more than 2,800 unused drilling permits, Grijalva said in a statement.
The Biden administration has called on energy companies to increase production in a bid to lower gasoline prices, which hit record levels this year following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The hearing was to ask why the companies have not done more to halt the rise in oil and gas prices, despite record profits, Grijalva said.
As prices rose, he said the companies had started pushing for a ""drilling free for all"", but it was clear their calls for looser regulations were simply a push to boost profits.
EOG declined to comment and Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Devon Energy said it planned to attend a separate hearing a day later that will cover some of the same issues. That hearing, before a House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee, will include more companies. EOG and Occidental were not called to testify at that hearing.
Energy and Commerce Committee chair Frank Pallone earlier this month expressed concerns that oil firms were keeping oil prices high to boost profit. He also questioned the more than 9,000 unused drilling permits held by oil and gas companies on federal lands. 

 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are set to attend that April 6 hearing. BP confirmed it would attend virtually, while others did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Natural Resources Committee was not sure if it would subpoena the companies. ""We're doing our due legal diligence before we make any further decisions,"" Grijalva said.

76,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 06:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House records show an unexplained gap of more than seven hours in the record of former President Donald Trump's telephone calls the day of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Washington Post and CBS reported on Tuesday.
Logs turned over to the House of Representatives panel investigating the attack showed no calls placed to or by Trump between 11:17 a.m. and 6:54 p.m. while his supporters violently rioted at the Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify Trump's 2020 election loss, the news outlets reported.
The 11 pages of records turned over to lawmakers showed Trump talked to at least eight people by phone before the gap and 11 afterward, the Post and CBS said. 
A spokesman for the House Select Committee investigating the Capitol riot declined comment. A spokesperson for Trump said Trump had nothing to do with the records, and assumed any and all of his phone calls were recorded and preserved.
Extensive public reporting also cites multiple conversations held by Trump on Jan. 6 with allies and lawmakers. That prompted investigators to probe whether he communicated that day through unofficial back channels or a disposable phone known as a ""burner phone,"" the report said, citing two people familiar with the congressional investigation. 
In a statement, Trump said, ""I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term.""
At least seven deaths have been connected to the assault on the seat of the U.S. government by thousands of Trump supporters, interrupting certification of the result of the November 2020 presidential election.
They marched on the Capitol after the ex-president's fiery speech at a rally repeating his unfounded claim that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of fraud. 

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy last year described talking to his fellow Republican during the rioting, saying he urged the president to call off his supporters and accept his defeat.
The House panel on Monday voted unanimously to seek ""contempt of Congress"" charges against Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser to Trump, and Daniel Scavino, who was a Trump deputy chief of staff.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators scrambled on Tuesday to reach a compromise to avoid further delays before passing legislation revoking ""most favored"" trade status for Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, after Republican lawmakers blocked efforts to pass it quickly.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and Republican Senator Rand Paul were trying to reach a compromise that would let the measure pass quickly, rather than through ""regular order,"" a process that could take weeks.
The bill stalled in the Senate despite lawmakers' insistence that they want to show a united front in supporting the government in Kyiv, more than a month into the Russian invasion.
Under U.S. law, Congress must approve the change in trade status. 
The legislation has strong bipartisan support, having passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming 424-8 earlier this month.
But in the Senate, it got ensnared in partisan fighting, first over Russian oil imports and more recently over abortion rights. 
The measure passed by the House also reauthorizes the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, authored by Cardin, which allows the imposition of sanctions over human rights violations.
But the reauthorization has a slight change in wording. It now addresses ""serious"" human rights violations, having previously addressed ""gross"" ones.

The new Magnitsky language came from a 2017 executive order from former Republican President Donald Trump. But Paul argued that the new language in the bill gives too much power to a president to impose sanctions over human rights abuses, including that it could be used to sanction anyone who denied a woman access to an abortion. 
Backers of the legislation dispute this.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top two U.S. Justice Department officials in the waning days of Donald Trump's presidency are cooperating with a Washington legal body's ethics probe of their former colleague Jeffrey Bossert Clark, who tried to help Trump overturn his 2020 election loss, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Jeffrey Rosen, who served as acting attorney general, and Richard Donoghue, his former acting deputy, each have given voluntary interviews in recent months to the District of Columbia Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which is investigating Clark for possible misconduct, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Rosen and Donoghue received Justice Department approval beforehand, the source said.
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel is part of the D.C. Bar, which was created as an official arm of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to govern and set rules for lawyers licensed to practice in the U.S. capital. It investigates possible misconduct by Washington lawyers and has the power to pursue disciplinary charges against attorneys found to have engaged in unethical conduct. In more serious cases, such charges can lead to the suspension of a license to practice law or disbarment.
The office is examining whether Clark violated ethics rules that prohibit lawyers from engaging in ""dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation"" when he urged Rosen and Donoghue to send officials in states pivotal to the 2020 election outcome a letter that contained false statements, the source said.
Trump, a Republican, has made false claims that the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was stolen through widespread voting fraud.
Rosen and Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. 
Clark separately faces investigations from the Justice Department's internal watchdog and a House of Representatives committee that is looking into last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who sought to block formal congressional certification of his election loss.
Clark and his attorney Harry MacDougald did not respond to questions sent by Reuters.
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigation could complicate Clark's efforts to revive his career as a corporate attorney as well as any possible return to government service. Reuters first reported the investigation in December. 
The office makes the findings of its investigations public only if it decides to pursue disciplinary action. To date, no public action has been filed against Clark.
Hamilton ""Phil"" Fox, who leads the office, said it does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation. The office received 1,400 complaints about the conduct of lawyers in 2020 and 1,200 in 2021, Fox said. As of the end of 2021, it had 224 active cases under investigation, Fox added.
According to a report by U.S. Senate Democrats, Clark unsuccessfully tried to get Trump to fire Rosen and install him as attorney general after Rosen blocked his attempt to enlist the Justice Department in Trump's efforts to overturn his election defeat. At the time, Clark was serving as the acting head of the department's Civil Division and led its environmental and natural resources unit.
After issuing the report last October, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, asked the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to investigate Clark's conduct.
GEORGIA LETTER
The office's investigation is primarily focused on Clark's efforts to pressure Donoghue and Rosen to send a letter to lawmakers in Georgia falsely claiming that the Justice Department had ""significant concerns"" about the legitimacy of Biden's victory in the state and echoing Trump's false claims of voting fraud, according to the source and ethics complaints that were filed against Clark and seen by Reuters. 
Clark also pressed Donoghue and Rosen to send a similar letter to other states that were crucial in Biden's victory, according to testimony that Rosen and Donoghue provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Rosen declined to send the letter. Trump ultimately decided not to fire Rosen and install Clark after department leadership threatened to resign en masse.

The Office of Disciplinary Counsel is also investigating Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani for statements he made about the 2020 presidential election, Giuliani's attorneys said last year.
Clark has said little publicly about his actions during the final weeks of Trump's presidency. Using a new Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account he created this month, Clark has called himself ""one of the top targets of the politically motivated J6 committee,"" a reference to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

(Reuters) - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday vetoed new congressional maps drawn by his fellow Republicans in the state legislature and called a special legislative session in mid-April to redraw the lines.
The eventual outcome in Florida, which will add a 28th district this year based on population growth, could have a significant impact on the battle for control of Congress in November's midterm elections.
Republicans need to flip only five seats to win a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and enable the party to block much of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
Florida is one of five states that have not completed their once-a-decade congressional redistricting. In most states, lawmakers control the process, which frequently leads to partisan gerrymandering, in which district boundaries are manipulated to give one party an advantage in elections.
Democrats could end up gaining one to two seats across the country through redistricting, according to Dave Wasserman, a redistricting expert at Cook Political Report. Initial expectations have been that Republicans would use their control of key states to lock in a national advantage.
Democrats have benefited from favorable court rulings in states such as North Carolina and Pennsylvania that rejected Republican-backed maps. The party has implemented aggressive gerrymanders of its own in states such as New York and Illinois.
But Democrats remain underdogs to maintain a House majority given Biden's mediocre approval ratings and the fact that the president's party typically loses seats in midterm elections.
DeSantis, who is running for re-election this year and is widely seen as a top White House contender in 2024, had previously taken the unusual step of proposing his own congressional map as an alternative to those under consideration by lawmakers.
His plan would eliminate a Black-majority district - currently held by Democratic U.S. Representative Al Lawson - that stretches from Tallahassee to Jacksonville. The governor and civil rights groups have clashed over whether state and federal law requires any map to preserve, or dismantle, that district.
""We have a responsibility to produce maps for our citizens that do not contain unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,"" DeSantis said in a statement on Tuesday.

Charlie Crist, the Florida Democratic congressman who is seeking to challenge DeSantis this fall, tweeted that DeSantis' veto is an ""authoritarian play to rig our democracy.""
DeSantis' map would give Republicans control of as many as 20 of the state's districts, up from the current 16-11 split, Wasserman said. Florida has the third-most congressional districts in the country, after California and Texas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday said Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from any cases about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump's followers.
Schumer became the most high-ranking Democrat to make that request of the conservative justice after the Washington Post and CBS News reported on text messages showing that Thomas's wife Virginia Thomas, a conservative activist who goes by Ginni, urged Mark Meadows, Trump's then-chief of staff, to work to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election win.
""I do think he should recuse himself,"" Schumer said of Thomas. ""The information we have right now raises serious questions about how close Justice Thomas and his wife were to the planning and execution of the insurrection.""
Thousands of supporters of then-President Trump stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the election, which Trump in a speech that morning falsely claimed was the result of widespread fraud.
The House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6 may seek to interview Ginni Thomas, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Neither Thomas could be reached for immediate comment on Tuesday.
Ginni Thomas has previously denied any conflict of interest between her work as a conservative activist and her husband's as a judge.
Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenting voice in January when the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, rejected Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the committee. 

On Monday, 24 Democrats from both the Senate and the House of Representatives sent a letter to John Roberts, chief justice of the United States, asking that Thomas recuse himself.
The committee has made more than 80 subpoenas public, including many issued to top Trump aides and allies, and interviewed more than 560 witnesses. The texts were given to the committee as part of Meadows' testimony.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday advanced President Joe Biden's nomination of economist Lisa Cook to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, clearing a key procedural hurdle after the Senate Banking Committee had deadlocked over her appointment.
The vote to discharge Cook's nomination from the hands of the Senate panel now allows a final confirmation vote to occur in the evenly divided Senate. The resolution passed on a 50-49 party-line vote, with Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, not appearing in the chamber to cast a ballot.
It was not immediately clear when the Senate would proceed to a final vote on Cook, who would become the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor. The Senate must also vote on three other nominees to the Fed, a slate that includes Jerome Powell for a second term as central bank chair.
The two others under consideration include Fed Governor Lael Brainard, whom Biden has sought to promote to be the Fed's vice chair, and Philip Jefferson, an economist and the dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina, for a vacant seat on the seven-member Board of Governors.
Earlier this month, Republicans on the Senate banking panel refused to endorse Cook, an economics professor at Michigan State University, but the Democratic leadership in the chamber invoked a little-used parliamentary maneuver to advance her nomination.

The banking committee had voted in favor of the other three with substantial bi-partisan majorities. 
Biden's nominee to be the Fed's vice chair for supervision, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew her name from consideration after Republicans on the banking committee blocked a vote on her appointment and a key Senate Democrat signaled he would not support her. The White House has not yet nominated a replacement for that position, the country's most powerful bank regulator.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The body of U.S. Representative Don Young of Alaska, who was the longest-serving Republican member of Congress of any era when he died this month, lay in state in the Capitol's Statuary Hall on Tuesday, where his fellow lawmakers paid tribute.
""His reverence and devotion to the House shone through in everything that he did,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement after his death was announced. ""For five decades, he was an institution in the hallowed halls of Congress.""
Young, the only member in the House representing the state of Alaska, was first elected in 1973 and died on March 18 at age 88 on a flight home to Alaska. 
Young, who worked as a tugboat captain in the state in his youth, was described as ornery, temperamental, salty tongued and acerbic. During one campaign debate he conceded that he could be both arrogant and a bully in his defense of Alaska's interests.
Shortly arriving in the House in 1973, he helped win federal approval of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, which has carried an average of 1.8 million barrels of oil daily. He also was a longtime supporter of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling.
Nearly two decades ago, Young helped win approval of a massive transportation bill that funded two Alaska bridges later nicknamed ""bridges to nowhere.""

A formal ceremony was held on Tuesday morning, which was attended by Young's family and guests and included remarks from Alaska's U.S. senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan. 
While Young's near half century in office made him the longest-serving member in the current House, he was not the all-time record holder. That record is held by the late Democratic Representative John Dingell Jr., who served 59 years before retiring in 2015. Dingell died in 2019.

The U.S. House of Representatives' Select Committee has conducted hundreds of interviews in its investigation of the attack on the Capitol last year by supporters of former President Donald Trump as lawmakers were poised to certify the 2020 election.
The January 6 committee met behind closed doors on Monday night to discuss whether to invite Thomas to testify. Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the January 6 committee told reporters after the meeting that the panel had not made a decision on whether to ask her to testify.
Several media outlets, including CNN on Monday, have reported the committee's possible interest in hearing from Virginia Thomas since her texts with Trump's then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, were made public last week in a Washington Post/CBS report. 
Virginia Thomas, who goes by Ginni, is active in conservative circles and earlier this month said in a separate media interview that she had attended Trump's rally hours before the Capitol riot.
In a series of 29 messages to Meadows following Trump's loss, Thomas repeatedly asked Meadows to work to overturn the election results. Meadows was found in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate fully with the Jan. 6 probe.

Representatives for Ginni Thomas could not immediately be reached for comment. Representatives for Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court also could not immediately be reached. 
Thomas, who the court said was hospitalized last week for an infection, was the lone dissenting voice in January when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the congressional panel.

(Reuters) -Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a Republican-backed bill that bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for many young students, drawing swift criticism from companies, Democrats and advocacy groups.
The legislation, referred to by its opponents as the ""don't say gay"" bill, has stirred national controversy and got attention during Sunday's Oscars telecast amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender.
Formally called the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, the Florida measure bars classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade, or from about ages 5-9, in public schools.
It also prohibits such teaching that ""is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate"" for students in other grades.
Under the law, which takes effect on July 1, parents will be allowed to sue school districts they believe to be in violation.
""We will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida, parents have a fundamental role in the education, healthcare and well being of their children,"" DeSantis told reporters on Monday. ""I don't care what big corporations say, here I stand. I'm not backing down.""
DeSantis, who is seeking re-election this year and is widely considered to be running for president in 2024, has joined other Republicans nationwide in calling for parents to have more control of what young children learn in school.
The Republican governor signed the bill into law at a charter school in Spring Hill, north of Tampa, surrounded by young school children and parents who shared personal stories they said showed the new law is needed.
Students across Florida have protested the measure, and President Joe Biden previously called it ""hateful."" 
The hosts of the Oscars ceremony referenced the bill, while best actress winner Jessica Chastain in her acceptance speech denounced ""discriminatory and bigoted"" legislation sweeping the country. 
After DeSantis signed the bill on Monday, a Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co spokesperson said the legislation ""should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.""
Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, is the company’s largest theme park. Its sprawling businesses also include movie studios, broadcast and cable television networks, streaming services, cruise lines and retail products.
Civil rights group Lambda Legal said it would challenge the law in court. ""Our young people are not political pawns,"" Chief Executive Kevin Jennings said in a statement. 

The legislation has been criticized for the vagueness and complexity of some of its language. For example, it says that even discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation is prohibited ""in certain grade levels or in a specified manner.""
The Florida Education Association, a teachers union, called the law a ""political stunt"" vulnerable to legal challenges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden, his aides and Western allies are scrambling to explain his remark that Russian leader Vladimir Putin could not remain in power because they do not want to escalate conflict between Washington and Moscow, officials said.
The nine-word line, at the end of a 27-minute speech in Warsaw on Saturday, has distracted from what some observers regard as the best piece of rhetoric of Biden's presidency. It made foreign allies uneasy at the end of an otherwise successful trip aimed at uniting allies against Russia, and has raised fresh questions about the United States' long-term strategy for its former Cold War foe. 
""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said in the Polish capital after condemning Putin's month-long war in Ukraine at length.
A White House official told Reuters the comment about Putin was not in the scripted speech. Asked whether the sentiment reflected Biden's true feelings, the official didn't answer directly but noted that the U.S. president has not shied away from calling his Russian counterpart a ""butcher"" and ""war criminal.""
In his political career, Biden has made some notable verbal missteps during freewheeling sessions with reporters or other spontaneous events. On his recent European trip, Biden said the United States would respond ""in kind"" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine and suggested that U.S. troops would go to the frontlines, neither of which represent U.S. policy. 
But Saturday's remark wasn't one of those situations - he was speaking to an audience from a teleprompter. In the minutes before he called for Putin's departure from power, the crowd of roughly 1,000 people was clearly feeding off Biden's remarks, clapping, waving flags and even starting a chant.
Biden's emotional declaration gave voice to the frustration that many Western countries - and many U.S. voters - feel about the invasion of Ukraine, one ally to the Democratic president said.
It came, officials explained, after a day that included Biden meeting with Ukrainian refugees uprooted by war and government officials in Ukraine trying to respond to Russian bombing campaigns that have ravaged cities and, according to the United Nations human rights office, killed at least 1,119 civilians.
Nonetheless, the remark echoes long-standing accusations from Russia and other nations that the United States seeks an imperialistic role in world conflicts, and escalates tensions as the West tries to manage an increasingly unpredictable Putin.
The clean-up effort was swift and widespread, reflecting a strong desire inside the administration to avoid escalation with Russia, even it if dinged Biden's reputation.
The U.S. secretary of state, White House press office, U.S. ambassador to NATO, and German chancellor all shot the idea of regime change down within a day, capped by Biden himself who bluntly said ""No,"" when asked by reporters in Washington if he is calling for regime change.
On Monday, Biden explained to reporters at the White House that his remark reflected his own ""moral outrage"" about Putin's actions, rather than any policy change. Still he added, if the Russian leader ""continues on the course that he's on, he's going to become a pariah worldwide and who knows what he becomes at home in terms of support.""
Officials in the Biden administration have said in recent weeks that they have grown increasingly concerned about Putin's decision-making and his country's more casual invocation of the threat of nuclear weapons, a posture that made Biden's statement even more surprising.
WHAT IS THE END GAME? 
In recent weeks, the Biden administration has distanced itself from suggestions, including by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), that the solution to the crisis in Ukraine is Putin's forcible removal.
But it has described actions against Russian companies, banks, government officials and oligarchs as directly aimed at Putin, an attempt to alienate him from supporters domestically and on the foreign stage.
Putin is now more ""isolated from the world than he has ever been,"" Biden said during his State of the Union address to Congress on March 1; a week later he announced plans to ""squeeze"" Putin further.
Despite engaging directly with Putin, Biden was unsuccessful in coaxing him into not invading Ukraine in the first place. Since the invasion began on Feb. 24, Biden has attempted to speak directly to the Russians instead. ""You, the Russian people, are not our enemy,"" the U.S. president said in Warsaw.
Biden officials have not answered questions about what ""end game"" scenarios the White House envisions around the Ukraine invasion, or how they think Putin might deescalate the conflict.
Last week, one of Putin's closest allies, Dmitry Medvedev, warned the United States that the Russian president's departure from power could create an unstable leadership in Moscow ""with a maximum number of nuclear weapons aimed at targets in the United States and Europe.""
Asked about Biden's comment in Warsaw, which received little coverage on Russian state television, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This is a statement that is certainly alarming.""

Andrew Lohsen, an expert on the conflict and a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank, warned: ""This is going to be part and parcel of Russian disinformation campaigns to malign the motivations of the United States.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol voted unanimously on Monday to seek ""contempt of Congress"" charges against Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser to ex-President Donald Trump, and Daniel Scavino, who was a Trump deputy chief of staff.
The seven Democratic and two Republican members of the House of Representatives Select Committee approved a report recommending the criminal charge against Navarro and Scavino by a 9-0 vote. There was no immediate word on when the full, Democratic-led House would vote to approve the resolution.
That would pave the way for potential criminal charges by the U.S. Department of Justice.
The committee won a victory in federal court on Monday when a judge ruled that Trump ""more likely than not"" committed a felony by trying to pressure his vice president, Mike Pence, to obstruct Congress and overturn his election defeat. [nL2N2VV1K1
Navarro and Scavino have disregarded repeated calls to appear before the committee or provide information to the panel about events surrounding the attack.
""They are obligated to comply with our investigation. They have refused to do so. And that's a crime,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's Democratic chair, said as he urged a vote in favor of contempt.
Trump repeated his false claim at a rally on Jan. 6, 2021, that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of widespread fraud, and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol.
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer who fought with rioters died the next day. Hundreds of police were injured during the onslaught.
Four officers have since taken their own lives.
Trump has urged associates not to cooperate with the committee, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
Biden's administration has denied executive privilege to the former Trump aides, saying it was not in the national interest.
Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the Select Committee's vice chair, noted that more than a dozen former Trump White House officials have been among the hundreds of witnesses who have testified to the committee. 
The committee said on Feb. 9 that it had subpoenaed Navarro, a key player in Trump's effort to overturn his election defeat.
Navarro has said in media interviews and in his book that he helped coordinate an effort to halt certification of Biden's victory and keep Trump in power.
Scavino was subpoenaed in September. The committee said he was a witness to Trump's activities on the day of the assault.
""These men, Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro, are in contempt of Congress. I encourage my colleagues to support adoption of this report. I'm confident the House will adopt a resolution citing them for this crime. And I hope the Justice Department will move swiftly to hold them accountable,"" Thompson said.
The House has already approved criminal referrals for two others who defied the panel's subpoenas - Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, and Mark Meadows, who was one of Trump's White House chiefs of staff.
Bannon faces federal charges for refusing to cooperate with the committee and declining to produce documents. He is scheduled for trial in July.

The House voted on Meadows in December, but the Justice Department has not yet said whether it will take action.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S President Joe Biden on Monday said his remark that Russian President Vladimir Putin should not remain in power reflected his own moral outrage at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not a U.S. policy shift. 
Biden faced pressure to speak about the comment after it generated a flood of questions as to whether the United States had changed to a policy seeking regime change in Moscow.
""I wasn't then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt, and I make no apologies,"" he told reporters at the White House.
He said his outburst, made at the end of a major address about Ukraine in Warsaw on Saturday, had been prompted by an emotional visit he had with families displaced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
At the end of his speech in the Polish capital, Biden added an unscripted line, saying that Putin ""cannot remain in power."" Administration officials rushed to clarify afterward that the White House was not advocating for regime change in Russia. 
Biden on Monday said that he was ""not walking anything back"" by clarifying the remark. Asked whether the remark would spur a negative response from Putin, Biden said, ""I don’t care what he thinks. ... He’s going to do what he’s going to do."" 
But Biden once again suggested Putin should not be leading Russia. If Putin ""continues on the course that he’s on, he’s going to become a pariah worldwide and who knows what he becomes at home in terms of support,"" Biden said.
However, Biden did not rule out meeting with Putin, saying ""it depends"" on what he wants to talk about.

Biden earlier this month described Putin as a ""war criminal"" for his role in a conflict in which many Ukrainian civilians have been killed. 
He said his remark on Saturday about Putin was intended for a Russian audience. ""The last part of the speech was talking to Russian people,"" Biden said. ""I was communicating this to not only the Russian people, but the whole world. This is just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable.""

""The Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,"" Carter said in a written decision, adding: ""The illegality of the plan was obvious.""
Trump's representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
Carter's (NYSE:CRI) findings marked a breakthrough for the Democratic-led Jan. 6 Select Committee, which earlier this month said it believed Trump might have committed multiple felonies. The panel is expected to make a formal request to the U.S. Justice Department that it consider charging Trump.
“The Court’s ruling today is a victory for the rule of law and clears the way for the Select Committee to obtain materials important to our investigation,"" the committee's chairman, Democrat Bennie Thompson of Missouri and vice chair, Republican Lynne Cheney of Wyoming, said in a joint statement.
Both Carter and the committee lack the power to bring criminal charges against Trump. That decision would need to be made by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.
Eastman will comply with the court order even though he disagrees with it, his attorney Charles Burnham said. Eastman has a professional duty to protect the confidences of his clients, Burnham said. 
""Dr. Eastman’s case against the January 6 committee seeks to fulfill this responsibility,"" Burnham said in a statement. ""It is not an attempt to 'hide' documents or 'obstruct' congressional investigations, as the January 6th committee falsely claims.""
The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on Carter's decision. 
""While the evidence continues to mount that Trump and many around him attempted a self-coup, it's still stunning to see a federal judge come to that conclusion in writing,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who is not involved in the case.
The Capitol riot occurred as then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of both chambers of Congress were meeting to certify Biden as the election winner.

""Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,"" Carter wrote. ""Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower - it was a coup in search of a legal theory.""
Before a mob of thousands stormed the Capitol, Trump gave a fiery speech in which he falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A man accused of attacking at least three police officers with a chemical irritant during the riot at the Capitol last year asked a judge on Monday to postpone his June trial, signaling he was in talks about settling the case.
In a court filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, attorneys for Julian Khater wrote they have recently had ""meaningful discussions with the government about a potential resolution of this matter"" and felt hopeful this would ""obviate the need for a trial.""
The filing did not provide further details nor explicitly say that Khater might be willing to plead guilty to some of the charges.
Khater and George Pierre Tanios are facing multiple counts, including assaulting police with a deadly weapon. Investigators said they sprayed at least three U.S. Capitol and Washington, D.C. police officers with an unidentified but powerful chemical agent as President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.
One of those officers, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, was later rushed to a hospital and died the next day.
Washington, D.C.'s chief medical examiner has since ruled that Sicknick died of natural causes following multiple strokes the day after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack.

Sicknick was sprayed by rioters with a chemical substance around 2:20 p.m. on Jan. 6, and collapsed around 10 p.m. He died the following day at a local hospital.
Khater and Tanios are tentatively slated to go to trial on June 6.

The proposed budget for the 2023 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1, lays out Biden administration priorities such as campaign promises to make the wealthy and companies pay more taxes that lawmakers on Capitol Hill will consider as they craft spending legislation.
""The White House budget request that President Biden published today offers the clearest possible reminder that the Biden administration’s far-left values are fundamentally disconnected from what American families actually need,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. 
""First and foremost, at a dangerous time, the president's budget falls woefully short on defense spending,"" he said.
House of Representatives Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, a Democrat, challenged McConnell's expertise in military affairs during a press briefing, saying, ""Tell me one source that he has for that...have him find me somebody in the Pentagon who says the same thing he does.""
Biden's record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion includes a 4.6% pay raise for troops and the largest research and development budget in history, as Russian aggression in Ukraine spurs demands among lawmakers for more military spending. 

The increase is about 1.5% above inflation, the Pentagon's financial chief Mike McCord told reporters on Monday.
McConnell, who previously demanded a 5% defense spending increase above inflation, said that the Biden budget could lead to an effective cutback for U.S. armed forces if inflation proved more stubborn than envisioned.

It would increase the federal civilian workforce by 2.7%, to 2,848,783 - partially offset by a 1.6% decline in military employment to 1,421,174 - and provide a 4.6% pay raise to civilian and military employees, subject to changes by Congress.
The following are some of the biggest hiring proposals:
VETERANS CARE
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides medical care to military veterans, would expand by 29,000 workers, a 7.1% increase over current staffing levels.
TAX ENFORCEMENT
The Internal Revenue Service, which Republicans have targeted for steep budget cuts over the past decade, would get thousands more workers. The agency's enforcement division would grow by 3,771 employees, an 11% increase, while the taxpayer services division would add 2,521 workers, an 8% jump.
FOREST FIRES
The National Forest Service would get 3,586 more workers, a 25% boost, to oversee the nation's 193 million acres (78,104,329 hectares) of protected forests and grassland - in particular to fight illegal marijuana growing operations. The service would also get 3,253 more employees to fight forest fires, a 24% increase.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The Environmental Protection Agency would add 1,700 more workers, an 11.2% increase, as the Biden administration prioritizes cleaning up air and water for low-income communities.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
The U.S. Justice Department would add 6,600 employees, an increase of 5.6% as the agency looks to ramp up antitrust enforcement, among other areas. The FBI would add 1,412 employees, a 4% bump, with large increases to its antitrust division.

Cecilia Rouse, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the $5.79 trillion budget plan for fiscal 2023 released by the White House on Monday was based on assumptions locked in on Nov. 10, well before the invasion, but the economy was generally stronger than expected then.
""There's tremendous uncertainty, but we and other external forecasters expect that inflation will ease over the coming year,"" Rouse told reporters as the White House released the budget proposal, which must now be considered and enacted by a deeply divided Congress.
Rouse said the White House would revise its economic assumptions later in the year, incorporating the war in Ukraine and its impact on inflation.
As locked in last November, the budget proposal assumed real expansion of the U.S. gross domestic product of 2.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to 4.2% in fiscal 2022 and 5.5% in fiscal 2021.
It assumed a 2.3% increase in the consumer price index in fiscal 2023, down from a 4.7% increase in fiscal 2022 and a 4.6% increase in fiscal 2021.
In November, Rouse told reporters, the White House had forecast that inflationary pressures would ease as the economy started to normalize with a lessening of supply chain pressures, rolling back of fiscal support for the economy, and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Russia's invasion would ""create additional price pressures over the coming year"" but the fundamental factors underpinning the economy should continue to improve, she said.
Rouse gave no specific forecast for the impact of the war or how much it could increase the rate of inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden clarified on Sunday that the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, after his declaration that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power.""
Biden's comments in Poland on Saturday also included calling Putin a ""butcher"" and appeared to be a sharp escalation of the U.S. approach to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
Top American diplomats on Sunday had played down his declaration, and Biden, asked by a reporter as he departed a church service in Washington if he was calling for regime change in Russia, gave a one-word reply: ""No.""
Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, earlier sought to contextualize Biden's remarks, saying they followed a day of speaking with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw. Russia's month-old invasion has driven a quarter of Ukraine's population of 44 million from their homes.
""In the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day,"" Smith told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program before adding: ""The U.S. does not have a policy of regime change in Russia. Full stop.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a news conference in Jerusalem that Biden was making the point that Putin couldn't be empowered to wage war. But Blinken said any decision on Russia's future leadership would be ""up to the Russian people.""
Republicans flatly said Biden's remarks amounted to an unfortunate blunder.
Senator James Risch, the top Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Biden's remarks a ""horrendous gaffe"" and said he wished the president would have stayed on script. 
""Most people who don't deal in the lane of foreign relations don't realize those nine words that he uttered would cause the kind of eruption that they did,"" he told CNN. 
""It's going to cause a huge problem,"" he said, referring to Biden's statement in Warsaw: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" 
Senator Rob Portman, who is also on the committee, lamented the public misstep in wartime.
""It plays into the hands of the Russian propagandists and plays into the hands of Vladimir Putin. So it was a mistake,"" Portman told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program.
UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE
The United States has sought to strike a balance during the conflict in Ukraine to avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia, speeding weapons deliveries to Kyiv to help its military fight but ruling out sending troops into the country or imposing a no-fly zone.
That support has bolstered fiercer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, and Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city after more than four weeks of fighting.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to give Ukraine tanks, planes and missiles to help fend off Russian forces.

The conflict has killed thousands of people, sent nearly 3.8 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine's children from their homes, according to the United Nations.
Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarizing and ""denazifying"" its neighbor. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

(Reuters) -In a test of his enduring influence over the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump returned to Georgia on Saturday to stump for allies who support his ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him - starting with Georgia.
At a rally in Commerce, a small city northeast of Atlanta, Trump spent the first 20 minutes of his speech repeating falsehoods about the outcome, calling Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, a ""turncoat"" and ""coward"" for failing to reverse the results.
Trump has invested significant political capital in the state, endorsing a slate of statewide candidates in an effort to oust Kemp and his allies. The May 24 primary election will provide perhaps the clearest assessment yet of Trump's ability to play kingmaker in the 2022 elections.
It will also offer an early measure of how Republican candidates attempt to strike a balance between Trump's obsession with the 2020 election and national Republican leaders' preference to focus on President Joe Biden's record in office.
""This is a really hard test for him – and a crucial one,"" said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Trump is still well liked by Republican voters, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to base their choice in a primary on his endorsement.""
Polls have shown Kemp holding a comfortable lead over Trump's preferred candidate, former U.S. Senator David Perdue, despite Trump's frequent criticisms of the incumbent governor.
In addition to Perdue, Trump has endorsed U.S. Representative Jody Hice, who is challenging Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Raffensperger rejected Trump's demand that he alter the outcome and declared the 2020 election fair and accurate after a series of audits and reviews.
Trump also endorsed down-ballot challengers for attorney general, lieutenant governor and even insurance commissioner, in each case siding with candidates taking on officials he blames for not fighting harder to substantiate his fraud claims.
Biden won Georgia by less than a quarter of a percentage point, becoming the first Democrat to win the state in nearly 30 years.
""What we're starting to see is that his endorsement does not appear so far to be giving the type of automatic bump to candidates that we've seen in the past,"" said Amy Steigerwalt, a political science professor at Georgia State University.
A spokesperson for Perdue said his support would only grow as more voters become aware of Trump's endorsement. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.
TRUMP STILL PUSHING ELECTION FALSEHOODS
Republicans worry that a split in the ranks could open the door for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist who narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018, to win November's rematch. 
Some Republicans already believe Trump's rhetoric following the November 2020 election helped cost the party twin Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January 2021, handing Democrats control of the chamber.
A spokesperson for Kemp's campaign, Tate Mitchell, said, ""Governor Kemp is focused on winning the endorsement of Georgia Republicans on May 24th and making sure Stacey Abrams is never our governor.""
Trump remains the party's leading figure, and Republican candidates from across the country continue to seek his support. But he has made clear he expects his allies to commit to his false assertion that Biden's victory in 2020 was illegitimate, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by courts, vote audits and election officials.
Earlier this week, Trump rescinded his endorsement of U.S. Representative Mo Brooks for a Senate race in Alabama after Brooks told voters it was time to move on from the 2020 election.
Perdue, who lost his Senate seat in 2020, echoed Trump's claims during remarks at Saturday's rally, telling the crowd that both their elections were ""stolen"" and vowing that those responsible would ""go to jail.""
Some Republicans, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, have urged the party to put 2020 behind it and focus on Biden's performance. Historically, the party that occupies the White House has lost seats in Congress during a president's first midterm election.

Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, a Republican who is not running for reelection, founded a group, GOP 2.0, aimed at moving the party beyond Trump.
The organization released an advertisement this week attacking Trump and Perdue for preferring to talk about ""conspiracy theories and past losses"" rather than offering a vision for the future.

In a statement, Fortenberry said he would be resigning shortly because of difficulties in his ""current circumstances.""
Prosecutors had accused Fortenberry of lying to investigators during two interviews in 2019 about $30,000 in campaign contributions he received in 2016 from Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury.
Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from donating to federal election campaigns.
Fortenberry's lawyers said he did not mean to mislead FBI agents but was caught off-guard by their interview request and suffered from a faulty memory.

WARSAW (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said that Russia's leader Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" in Poland Saturday, remarks a White House official said later were meant to prepare the world's democracies for extended conflict over Ukraine, not back regime change in Russia.
Biden's comments on Saturday, including a statement earlier in the day calling Putin a ""butcher,"" were a sharp escalation of the U.S. approach to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
In a major address delivered at Warsaw's Royal Castle, Biden evoked Poland's four decades behind the Iron Curtain in an effort to build a case that the world's democracies must urgently confront an autocratic Russia as a threat to global security and freedom.
But a remark at the end of the speech raised the spectre of an escalation by Washington, which has avoided direct military involvement in Ukraine, and has specifically said it does not back regime change.
""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden told a crowd in Warsaw after condemning Putin's month-long war in Ukraine.
A White House official said Biden's remarks did not represent a shift in Washington's policy.
""The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change.""
Asked about Biden's comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters: ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians."" 
Calling the fight against Putin a ""new battle for freedom,"" Biden said Putin's desire for ""absolute power"" was a strategic failure for Russia and a direct challenge to a European peace that has largely prevailed since World War Two.
""The West is now stronger, more united than it has ever been,"" Biden said. ""This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.""
The speech came after three days of meetings in Europe with the G7, European Council and NATO allies, and took place roughly at the same time as rockets rained down on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, just 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the Polish border.
""Their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for essential democratic principles that unite all free people,"" Biden said. ""We stand with you. Period.""
In his speech, Biden said NATO is a defensive security alliance which never sought Russia's demise and he reiterated that the West has no desire to harm Russia's people even as its sanctions threaten to cripple their economy.
Poland was under communist rule for four decades until 1989 and was a member of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact security alliance. It is now part of the European Union and NATO. 
The rise of right-wing populism in Poland in recent years has put it in conflict with the EU and Washington, but fears of Russia pressing beyond its borders has drawn Poland closer to its Western allies.
Speaking to a crowd holding U.S., Polish and Ukrainian flags, Biden said the West is acting in unison because of the ""gravity of the threat"" to global peace.
""The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War,"" Biden said. ""Over the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe.""
Reaction was mixed in Warsaw. Mykyta Hubo, a Ukrainian from Dnipro who has been living in Poland for several years called the speech ""ordinary"": ""Lots of talk, little action,"" he said.
Pawel Sterninski, who traveled nearly three hours to Warsaw from elsewhere in Poland to hear Biden, came wrapped in a U.S. flag.
""The U.S. can't really engage militarily because that could result in a third world war. Putin is unpredictable. If you're threatening with nuclear weapons, it takes just a moment to turn into a global conflict.""
Earlier in the day, Biden dropped in on a meeting with Ukraine's foreign and defense ministers and made additional, unspecified security pledges on developing defence cooperation, according to Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

In Warsaw, Biden also visited a refugee reception centre at the national stadium. More than 2 million people have fled the war to Poland. Altogether, about 3.8 million have left Ukraine since fighting began.
Putin calls Russia's military actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.

DENVER (Reuters) -A federal court jury on Friday awarded $14 million to a dozen activists who sued Denver police, claiming excessive force was used against peaceful protesters during racial injustice demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in 2020.
The city of Denver has previously settled several civil complaints stemming from the police response to the Floyd protests, but the lawsuit decided Friday was the first such case in the nation to go to trial, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several of the plaintiffs. 
The verdict, delivered after about three hours of jury deliberations, capped a three-week trial in U.S. District Court in Denver.
The lawsuit, filed in June 2020, led a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction barring police in Denver from using tear gas, plastic bullets, flash-bang grenades and other ""less-than-lethal"" force unless approved by a senior officer in response to specific acts of violence.
The death of Floyd, an unarmed Black man, during his arrest in Minneapolis by a white officer kneeling on his neck, ignited a wave of protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the summer of 2020 in cities across the country, including Denver.
While the lawsuit brought by Denver activists acknowledged that some protesters engaged in lawless behavior, it said the vast majority were peaceful and accused police of engaging in heavy-handed riot-control tactics without issuing clear warnings and orders to disperse.
The largest individual award, $3 million, went to Zachary Packard, who was struck in the head by a projectile fired from a police shotgun. He suffered a broken jaw and skull, two fractured spinal discs and bleeding in his brain, the lawsuit said.
""There is a widespread custom and practice of violence and aggression against protesters,"" plaintiffs’ lawyer Tim Macdonald told jurors.
A lawyer defending the city, Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Jordan, argued that police had to make split-second decisions in a chaotic situation. Some protesters, Jordan said, started fires and broke windows in the state Supreme Court building and a nearby museum.
""When justifiable anger turns to violence and destruction, it's the responsibility of police to intervene as a matter of public safety,"" she said.
In a statement issued following the verdict, the city’s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the police department, said officers had made mistakes, but the protests were ""unprecedented"" in scope.

""The city had never seen that level of sustained violence and destruction before,"" the statement said.
The city has already implemented policy changes in the aftermath of the protests, the department said, including enhanced officer training for crowd management, eliminating the use of some ""less-than-lethal"" weapons and new guidelines for the use of pepper spray.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said it would allow former President Donald Trump's company to sell the rights to a luxury hotel in Washington to a Hilton affiliate, clearing the way for Trump's name to come down off a building that served as a flashpoint during his presidency.
The U.S. General Services Administration, which acts as the federal government's landlord, said it approved the deal between the Trump Organization and CGI Merchant Group, a Miami investment firm that plans to operate the building as a Waldorf Astoria hotel.
Located in the historic Old Post Office Building four blocks from the White House, the Trump International Hotel served as a gathering point for his supporters and some foreign government officials during his presidency, and a sticking point for critics who said it violated ethics laws.
Trump's company reached a deal to sell his rights to the property for a reported $375 million, which could net him a $100 million profit. 

Democrats in Congress had urged GSA to cancel the lease before Trump could sell it, arguing that he may have provided a misleading picture of his finances when the government leased the property to him in 2013, before he ran for president.
The Trump Organization and CGI Merchant Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - A Maryland judge on Friday threw out the state's new Democratic-backed congressional map, ruling the district lines overwhelmingly favored the party in violation of the state constitution, and ordered lawmakers to draw a new plan.
The decision was a blow to Democrats, who are already facing an uphill battle to hold their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in November's midterm elections.
The map, which passed almost entirely along party lines in Maryland's Democratic-controlled legislature last December, gave Democrats seven safe seats while endangering the state's lone Republican congressmember, Representative Andy Harris, by redrawing his district's borders.
Anne Arundel County Senior Judge Lynne Battaglia agreed with Republican arguments that the map violated the state constitution's equal protection guarantee, among other provisions, by diluting Republican voters' electoral power.
""The 2021 plan is an outlier and a product of extreme partisan gerrymandering,"" she wrote in a 94-page opinion.
She gave the legislature until Wednesday to draw a new map. The state's high court has already moved the primary election from June 28 to July 19 as part of separate litigation by Republicans challenging the legality of the state's new legislative maps.
A spokesperson for the office of state Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said it was reviewing the decision and had not yet determined whether it would appeal.
Under the U.S. Constitution, states must redraw their congressional districts every 10 years based on population changes. In most states, lawmakers oversee redistricting, which offers an opportunity to manipulate maps for partisan advantage, a practice known as gerrymandering.

Friday's decision is the latest in a series of rulings from state courts challenging lawmakers' unfettered authority to draw partisan maps, after the U.S. Supreme Court said in 2019 that federal courts could not adjudicate such disputes.
Unlike in Maryland, Democrats have mostly been the beneficiaries in court cases this cycle. Judges in Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have blocked Republican efforts to install more favorable congressional maps in those states.

Manchin's announcement is further evidence that Democrats are united on supporting President Joe Biden's nominee to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, Jackson would get the job even if no Republicans vote for her.

""Her wide array of experiences in varying sectors of our judicial system have provided Judge Jackson a unique perspective that will serve her well on our nation’s highest court,"" he added.

Biden in February nominated Jackson to replace liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who intends to retire at the end of June. The committee is likely to vote on April 4 on sending her nomination to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote.
Jackson faced two days of hostile questioning from Republicans during her confirmation hearing earlier this week, with several accusing her of being lenient in her previous role as a federal trial court judge in sentencing child pornography offenders. Sentencing experts said her approach was similar to most federal judges.

The messages were handed over to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to the Post and CBS, who said, without elaborating, that they had obtained copies of the messages.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports.
A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee declined to comment.
Reuters sought comment from Meadows at the Conservative Partnership Institute, an organization that helps elect conservatives to office where Meadows now serves as partner, but was unable to immediately reach him. An attorney for Meadows did not return a request for comment.
The messages do not directly reference Thomas's husband or the Supreme Court, according to the Post.

Trump's campaign distanced itself from Powell after she claimed without evidence at a Nov. 19, 2020 news conference that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.
The news comes almost a week after Justice Thomas was admitted to a Washington hospital. The status of Thomas's health was not immediately clear.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Almost three-quarters of the U.N. General Assembly demanded aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine on Thursday, and criticized Russia for creating a ""dire"" humanitarian situation after Moscow invaded its neighbor one month ago. 
It is the second time the 193-member General Assembly has overwhelmingly isolated Russia over what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" that is says aims to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has blasted Russia's ""absurd war."" Thousands of people have been killed in Ukraine, millions made refugees, and cities pulverized in the past month. 
The resolution adopted on Thursday, which was drafted by Ukraine and allies, received 140 votes in favor and five votes against - Russia, Syria, North Korean, Eritrea and Belarus - while 38 countries, including China, abstained. 
General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, but they carry political weight. There was a round of applause in the hall after the adoption on Thursday.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the resolution adopted on Thursday as a ""pseudo humanitarian draft"" that took a ""one-sided view of the situation."" He again accused Western countries of a campaign of ""unprecedented pressure"" to win votes, a claim that the United States has rejected.
Ukraine and its allies had been looking to match or improve on support received for a March 2 General Assembly resolution that deplored Russia's ""aggression"" and demanded it withdraw its troops. That received 141 yes votes, the same five no votes, while 35 states - including China - abstained. 
'ASTOUNDING SUCCESS'
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield described the vote on Thursday as an ""astounding success,"" telling reporters: ""There's really no difference between 141 and 140.""
The resolution adopted on Thursday demands the protection of civilians, medical personnel, aid workers, journalists, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. It also demands an end to the siege of cities, in particular Mariupol.
Ukraine and Western allies have accused Moscow of attacking civilians indiscriminately. Moscow denies attacking civilians.
The resolution echoes the March 2 General Assembly text by again demanding that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. 
South Africa had proposed a rival draft resolution that focused on the humanitarian situation and did not mention Russia. Russia appealed for countries to support that text.
The General Assembly decided not to act on the South African draft after Ukraine called a vote under a rule covering draft resolutions on the same issue.

The General Assembly vote came one day after a Russian-drafted resolution calling for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine - and not mentioning Moscow's role - failed at the U.N. Security Council, with only Russia and China voting yes and the remaining 13 members abstaining.
The Russian Security Council draft was very similar to the text put forward in the General Assembly by South Africa.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday filed a lawsuit accusing a Texas county of adopting an electoral map that discriminates against Black and Hispanic voters.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Texas, seeks to block implementation of Galveston County's 2021 redistricting plan for its governing body, the Commissioners Court.
The Justice Department alleged the map was adopted ""for a discriminatory purpose"" and ""results in Black and Hispanic citizens not having an equal opportunity to participate in the political process.""
The Justice Department contended officials in the heavily Republican county deliberately redrew an electoral map to eliminate the only precinct that was previously made up of a majority of Black and Hispanic residents.
A Galveston County spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit marks the third time in recent months that the Biden administration has challenged voting procedures adopted by Texas Republicans.
In November, the Justice Department sued Texas officials over a state law known as Texas Senate Bill 1 that places strict curbs on voting by mail. That lawsuit remains pending.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has defended the law, saying it is aimed at clamping down on voter fraud. 
Republican lawmakers in a number of politically significant states have passed a wave of new voting requirements and limits, saying the measures are needed to curb voter fraud, despite scant evidence of it in the United States.

Backers of the measures cite Republican former President Donald Trump’s baseless claim that fraud underlay his presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Democrats and voting rights advocates have sued state officials over the laws, denouncing the efforts as partisan power grabs that will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Thursday moved closer to securing Senate confirmation in the next two weeks, while experts from the nation's leading lawyers' group dismissed Republican claims that she was ""soft on crime"" including child pornography.
As the Senate Judiciary Committee completed the fourth and final day of Jackson's confirmation hearing, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the chamber was ""on track"" to confirm the federal appellate judge to the lifetime job before its expected break for Easter on April 8.
There is no sign that the Republican attacks mounted this week are likely to derail Jackson's confirmation, with Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly controlling the Senate. With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, she would get the job if Democrats remain united regardless of how the Republicans vote.
Following liberal Justice Stephen Breyer's January announcement of his plan to return, Biden nominated Jackson in February to become the first Black woman to serve on the nation's top judicial body. The committee is likely vote on April 4 on sending her nomination to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote.
Schumer described the Republican attacks as an attempt by ""just a handful"" of senators to ""smear"" Jackson with misleading and false accusations.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced that he will vote against confirmation. McConnell criticized Jackson in a speech on the Senate floor, accusing her of deflecting basic questions about her judicial philosophy and declining to answer legitimate questions about her own rulings. 
McConnell also faulted Jackson after she refused to weigh in on proposals from the left to expand the number of justices to erase the court's current 6-3 conservative majority. Jackson said it is a matter for Congress to decide. Justice Amy Coney Barrett took a similar stance in her 2020 confirmation hearing.
""Judge Jackson refuses to reject the fringe position that Democrats should try to pack the Supreme Court,"" McConnell said.
It is possible Jackson could attract a small number of Republican votes, most likely Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins.
Jackson concluded two days of marathon testimony on Wednesday night, facing repeated attacks by Republicans who accused her of being lenient in her previous role as a federal trial court judge in sentencing child pornography offenders.
""Some of the attacks on this judge were unfair, unrelenting and beneath the dignity of the United States Senate,"" said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman. 
""My lasting impression,"" Durbin added, ""is of a judge who sat there through it all, head held high, with dignity and determination and strength."" 
The most hostile questioning came from Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Marsha Blackburn and Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM). 
Jackson's confirmation would not change the court's ideological balance but would let Biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51-year-old jurist young enough to serve for decades.
'WELL QUALIFIED'
The committee on Thursday heard from outside witnesses testifying about Jackson's record and qualifications, including members of the American Bar Association, which has evaluated Jackson as ""well qualified"" - its highest rating - for the job. 
Durbin asked retired federal judge Ann Claire Williams, one of the bar association witnesses, whether in the group's examination of Jackson's record any evidence emerged that she was ""soft on crime.""
""None whatsoever,"" Williams said.
Williams said that in interviews with 250 lawyers and judges who had first-hand knowledge of Jackson's career, none of them brought up issues involving her sentencing of child pornography defendants.
Another bar association witness, trial attorney Joseph Drayton, said he had specifically talked to prosecutors and defense lawyers about the issue, adding: ""None of them felt that she demonstrated bias in any way.""
The bar association witnesses were members of its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.

Jackson since last year has served as a federal appeals court judge after eight years as a federal district judge.
If confirmed, Jackson would be the 116th justice to serve on the high court, the sixth woman and the third Black person. With Jackson on the bench, the court for the first time would have four women and two Black justices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump's lawyers brought his years-long battle to keep his tax returns out of the public eye to a U.S. appeals court on Thursday, where a congressional committee argued it had the right to force their release.
The tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee asserted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that it has the power to obtain the former president's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, part of the Treasury Department.
Senior Judge David Sentelle, a conservative jurist, expressed skepticism's of Trump's arguments during the hearing.
Trump lawyer Cameron Norris argued that there is no legitimate reason for the Ways and Means Committee to see the tax returns. Sentelle indicated he disagreed with that claim, saying it is possible the committee has both legitimate legislative reasons for wanting the tax returns and illegitimate political motivations.
""You're pleading may not carry the ball for you because there may be a legislative actor who has two purposes,"" Sentelle said. ""You allege they have one. And I'm asking you: why isn't it possible they have two?""
A ruling for the committee could lead to Trump's financial dealings being revealed ahead of the 2024 presidential election. It could be months before the intermediate appeals court issues a ruling, which would likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson questioned on Thursday whether the case should be sent back to a lower court so a legal different framework could be applied — a move that would further delay resolution of the case.
Trump is appealing a lower court decision from December 2021 that determined the Democratic-led committee chairman has broad authority to obtain a former president's tax returns.
Trump was the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.
A federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to request any person’s tax returns from the IRS.
Invoking that statute, the committee sued in 2019 to force disclosure of Trump's tax returns.
House Democrats have said they need Trump's tax returns to see if the IRS is properly auditing presidential returns and to assess whether new legislation is needed.
Trump's lawyers have called that explanation ""pretextual"" and ""disingenuous,"" saying the real aim is to unearth politically damaging information about Trump.
Norris said the Ways and Means Committee has not promised to keep Trump's tax returns private if it obtains them.
""Instead we have alleged, plausibly, that the goal here is to immediately publicly expose and release President Trump’s tax returns,"" Norris said during the hearing.
In 2019, while Trump was in office, the U.S. Justice Department issued a legal memo supporting his arguments.
But in July 2021, after Trump lost his reelection campaign, the Justice Department reversed course and said the House committee had offered ""sufficient reasons"" for seeing the tax returns.
The Justice Department memo prompted Trump to file counterclaims against the Ways and Means Committee, seeking a judicial declaration that the committee had exceeded its constitutional authority. 

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, sided with Congress in December. McFadden said Trump was ""wrong on the law"" in seeking to block the Ways and Means Committee from obtaining his tax returns.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year cleared the way for a Manhattan prosecutor to obtain Trump's tax returns from his accounting firm, but that ruling did not directly affect the Ways and Means Committee's case.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans on Wednesday pressed their attacks on a range of issues against Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee to become the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, as she inched closer to the end of an intense two days of questioning with Democrats coming to her defense.
Jackson, who had remained even-tempered throughout marathon questioning during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, showed impatience over repeated questions posed by Republicans who accused her of being too lenient as a judge in sentencing child pornography offenders.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley again pressed her on one child pornography case involving an 18-year-old defendant in which Jackson imposed a three-month sentence. He asked her if she regretted the sentence.
""Senator, what I regret is that during a hearing about my qualifications to be a justice on the Supreme Court we've spent a lot of time focusing on this small subset of my sentences,"" Jackson responded. 
Jackson since last year has served as a federal appellate judge after eight years as a federal district judge. She noted that she had sentenced more than 100 people as a judge.
Democrats and sentencing experts have said Jackson's approach to child pornography sentencing was similar to the vast majority of federal judges.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), who repeatedly interrupted Jackson as she was trying to answer his questions, told her that ""every judge who does what you're doing is making it easier for these children to be exploited.""
""I know how serious these crimes are,"" Jackson said in her defense, adding that her approach was to ensure ""the most serious offenders get the longest time.""
Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman, pushed back on Republican requests for more information on Jackson's child pornography cases, saying the issue had already been debated in detail over two days.
""There is an absurdity to this that is almost comical if it was not so dangerous,"" Democratic Senator Cory Booker said of the Republican attacks.
""You have earned this spot. You are worthy. You are a great American,"" Booker told Jackson, who could be seen wiping a tear from her eye.
So far, there is no sign that the Republican attacks are likely to derail Jackson's confirmation, with Democrats narrowly controlling the Senate. With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, she would get the job if Democrats remain united regardless of how the Republicans vote.
HARVARD CASE
Under questioning from her former Harvard Law School classmate Senator Ted Cruz, Jackson said that if confirmed to the lifetime job she planned not to participate in a major Supreme Court case involving the university because she serves on its board of overseers.
The case, to be heard in the court's next term that begins in October, involves a challenge to the affirmative action admissions policy Harvard uses to increase its number of Black and Hispanic students.
Her confirmation would not change the court's ideological balance - it has a 6-3 conservative majority - but would let Biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51-year-old jurist young enough to serve for decades. The Democratic president nominated Jackson last month to the lifetime post to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. 
Facing more long hours of often-antagonistic questioning during the hearing's third day, she remained mostly unflappable, beginning most responses with a polite, ""Thank you, Senator.""
Durbin praised Jackson for her poise and said some Republicans had used the hearing as ""an opportunity to showcase talking points for the November election"" when control of Congress is up for grabs, including the argument that Democrats are ""soft on crime.""
""Well, you have made a mess of their stereotype,"" Durbin said, pointing to the fact that she has been endorsed by various law enforcement groups. 
Republicans also have criticized her legal representation earlier in her career of some detainees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and tried to link Jackson to activist groups on the left and to ""critical race theory,"" which argues American history and institutions are infused with racial bias.
There are signs that not all Republican senators agree with targeting Jackson's record on sentencing. Republican Senator Thom Tillis said during the hearing he was ""sympathetic to some of it, not necessarily all of it"" when describing claims made his colleagues. Republican Senator Mitt Romney told the Washington Post the attacks on Jackson were ""off course.""

Jackson's testimony is due to end on Wednesday, with outside experts scheduled for Thursday's final day of the hearing.
If confirmed, Jackson would be the 116th justice to serve on the high court, the sixth woman and the third Black person. With Jackson on the bench, the court for the first time would have four women and two Black justices.

Mark Pomerantz, who resigned on Feb. 23 after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had indicated to him he had doubts about pursuing a case against Trump, also said it was ""a grave failure of justice"" not to hold Trump accountable, according to the Times.
""The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes - he did,"" Pomerantz wrote, according to the Times, which published what it said was the letter.
In the United States, criminal defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance had said in court filings that the office was investigating “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at the Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
Pomerantz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for Trump, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither the Trump Organization nor its lawyer Alan Futerfas immediately responded to requests for comment.
The Times quoted Fischetti as saying charges against Trump were not warranted and applauding Bragg for not pursuing the case.
Another prosecutor, Carey Dunne, resigned on the same day as Pomerantz. Bragg, who took office on Jan. 1, was not confident the prosecutors could demonstrate Trump had intended to inflate the value of his real estate, the Times reported.
A spokeswoman for Bragg, Danielle Filson, told the Times the investigation was continuing. 

A civil investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization is being conducted by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Trump has previously denied wrongdoing and said the state and city investigations were politically motivated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Madeleine Albright, who fled the Nazis as a child in her native Czechoslovakia during World War Two then rose to become the first female U.S. secretary of state and, in her later years, a pop culture feminist icon, died on Wednesday at the age of 84.
Her family announced her death on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and said she had died of cancer. Leaders, diplomats and academics remembered her as a trailblazer on the world stage.
Albright served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1993-1997 in U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration. He then nominated her to become the first female secretary of state and she served in that role from 1997-2001.
""Madeleine Albright was a force. She defied convention and broke barriers again and again,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said. He directed U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at the White House and government buildings, including embassies, until March 27.
She was a tough-talking diplomat in an administration that hesitated to involve itself in the two biggest foreign policy crises of the 1990s - the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
She once upset a Pentagon chief by asking why the military maintained more than 1 million men and women under arms if they never used them.
The plain-spoken Albright took a tough line on a 1996 incident where Cuban jet fighters downed two unarmed U.S.-based planes, saying: ""This is not cojones, this is cowardice,"" using a Spanish vulgarity meaning ""testicles."" 
While at the United Nations, where Security Council members stood in silence on Wednesday to honor her memory, she pressed for a tougher line against the Serbs in Bosnia after Bosnian Serb military forces laid siege to the capital Sarajevo. 
During Clinton's first term, many of his administration's top foreign policy experts did not want to get involved because they vividly remembered how the United States became bogged down in Vietnam.
In 1995, Bosnian Serb soldiers overran three Moslem enclaves, Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa, and massacred more than 8,000 people. 
The United States responded by working with NATO on airstrikes that forced an end to the war but only after it had been going on for three years.
Albright's experience as a refugee prompted her to push for the United States to use its superpower clout. She wanted a ""muscular internationalism,"" said James O'Brien, a senior adviser to Albright during the Bosnian war.
Early in the Clinton administration, while she unsuccessfully advocated for a quicker, stronger response in Bosnia, Albright backed a U.N. war crimes tribunal that eventually put the architects of that war, including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, in jail, O'Brien said. 
The painful lessons learned in Rwanda and Bosnia served the United States well in Kosovo, when Washington saw the more powerful Serbs begin a program of ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians. NATO responded with an 11-week campaign of air strikes in 1999 that extended to Belgrade.
Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani said on Wednesday she was “deeply shocked by the loss of Kosovo's great friend,” adding that the intervention ""gave us hope, when we did not have it.""
During efforts to press North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program, which were eventually unsuccessful, Albright traveled to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, becoming the highest ranking U.S. official to visit the secretive Communist-run country at the time.
FEMINIST HEROINE
Once the Clinton years and the 1990s were over, Albright became an icon to a generation of young women looking for inspiration in their quest for opportunity and respect in the workplace. Albright was fond of saying: ""There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.""
Albright was a marked contrast to her predecessors and male colleagues in uniform suits. She used clothes and jewelry to send tart, political messages. One favorite was a snake brooch, a reference to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein calling her an ""unparalleled serpent.""
She wrote a book about her signature jewelry, one of several bestsellers, explaining that the pins were a diplomatic tool. Balloons or flower pins would indicate she felt optimistic, while a crab or turtle would indicate frustration.
Born Marie Jana Korbelova in Prague on May 15, 1937, her family fled in 1939 to London when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia. She attended school in Switzerland at age 10 and adopted the name Madeleine. 
She was raised a Roman Catholic but after she became secretary of state, the Washington Post dug up documentation showing that her family was Jewish and relatives, including three grandparents, died in the Holocaust. Her parents likely converted to Catholicism from Judaism to avoid persecution as Nazism gained strength in Europe, the paper reported.
After the war, the family left London and returned to Czechoslovakia, then in the throes of a communist takeover. 
Her father, a diplomat and academic who opposed communism, moved the family to the United States where he taught international studies at the University of Denver. One of his favorite students was Condoleezza Rice, who would become the second female secretary of state in 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush.
""It is quite remarkable that this Czech émigré professor has trained two secretaries of state,"" Albright told the New York Times in 2006.
Albright attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and got a doctorate from Columbia University. She became fluent or close to it in six languages including Czech, French, Polish and Russian as well as English.
In 1959, she married newspaper heir Joseph Medill Patterson Albright, whom she met while working at the Denver Post, and they had three daughters. They divorced in 1982.
She followed her father into academia but also became involved in Democratic Party politics. Albright joined the staff of Senator Edmund Muskie, a Maine Democrat, in 1976 and two years later became a member of President Jimmy Carter's (NYSE:CRI) National Security Council staff.
Since leaving the Clinton administration, she has written a series of books. One, ""Hell and Other Destinations,"" was published in April 2020. Others include her autobiography, ""Madam Secretary: A Memoir"" (2003) and ""Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat’s Jewel Box"" (2009).
The plain-spoken Albright made forays into popular culture. ""Parks and Recreation"" star Amy Poehler's character had a picture of Albright in her office.

In 2005, the ""Gilmore Girls"" television series the character Rory dreamt that Albright, wearing a red suit and an eagle pin, was her mother.
In 2018, she and fellow former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton briefed a fictional secretary of state in ""Madam Secretary,"" a TV drama where she spoke passionately about the dangers of abusive nationalism.

(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson on Wednesday said that if confirmed to the lifetime job she would recuse herself from a major upcoming case challenging the race-conscious admissions policy Harvard University uses to increase its number of Black and Hispanic students.
Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee to become the first Black woman to serve on the high court, made the comment during the third day of her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Jackson is a Harvard graduate and a current member of the Ivy League school's Board of Overseers.
""If you're confirmed, do you intend to recuse from this lawsuit?"" asked Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who attended Harvard Law School at the same time as Jackson.
""That is my plan, senator,"" Jackson responded.
The justices in January agreed to hear that case and a related one involving the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, giving the court's 6-3 conservative majority a chance to end affirmative action policies used for decades in student admissions to try to achieve diverse student enrollment.
The dispute will be heard in the court's next term, which begins in October.
The justices agreed to hear appeals by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, of lower court rulings that upheld the race-conscious admissions policies of both schools.
The lawsuit against Harvard accused it of discriminating against Asian-American undergraduate applicants.
Jackson during her Senate testimony did not mention the North Carolina case, leaving the door open to her possible participation in that case. UNC is a public university that Blum's group has accused of discriminating against white and Asian American applicants.

Jackson earned both her undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. Her term on Harvard's Board of Overseers is set to end in late May.
Blum and a Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on Jackson's recusal.

(Reuters) -The United States must increase food aid to prevent millions of people starving as Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens global grain supplies, members of the U.S. Senate's bipartisan hunger caucus said. 
Congress passed $13 billion in aid for Ukraine on March 9, but the $2.65 billion earmarked in the package for food and other humanitarian aid does not go far enough to address food shortages globally, the Senators said. 
They will seek billions more dollars as part of any future COVID-19 or Ukraine relief bill, a Congressional staffer with knowledge of the plans said.
“Democrats and Republicans in Congress need to quickly come together and approve emergency global food aid in order to prevent tens of millions of people, including millions of children, from dying of starvation,” Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, told Reuters. 
The United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) has said it faces a $9 billion funding shortfall. Before the invasion, 44 million people in 38 countries were on the brink of famine, according to the agency.
Now, the flood of refugees from Ukraine and disruptions to the country’s spring planting season threaten to drive worldwide hunger to “catastrophic” levels, WFP executive director David Beasley said.
Russia and Ukraine together account for about 25% of the world’s wheat exports, and WFP gets about 50% of its commodities from Ukraine. 
“This is unprecedented,” Beasley said.
In addition to legislation, lawmakers are looking to the Bill Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Humanitarian Trust, a $260 million fund for international food aid managed by USDA and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on March 3 urging him to draw on the funds.
“It is critical to utilize every tool at your disposal to meet these challenges,” Moran wrote of hunger crises in Afghanistan and Ukraine.

Moran has not heard from USDA or USAID on this proposal, a staffer told Reuters. 
USDA referred questions about the trust to USAID. A USAID spokesperson said the agency is considering all available funding resources, including potentially drawing on the trust.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of U.S. Senate Republican hopeful Mo Brooks' struggling campaign on Wednesday, dealing a crippling blow to the ambitions of one of his staunchest allies in the U.S. Congress.
In a statement underscoring the loyalty Trump demands, the Republican castigated Brooks - a hardline firebrand in the House of Representatives - for telling voters in Alabama that it was time to move on from the 2020 presidential election and Trump's false claims that it was stolen from him.
""Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went 'woke' and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, 'Put that behind you, put that behind you',"" Trump said in a statement. ""Since he decided to go in another direction, so have I, and I am hereby withdrawing my Endorsement.""
Brooks responded by accusing Trump of making unconstitutional demands to rescind the 2020 election results following their certification on Jan. 6, 2021, remove President Joe Biden and return Trump to the White House.
""I've told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement. But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath,"" Brooks said. 
Brooks also showed no sign of withdrawing from the race, describing himself as ""the only proven America First candidate"" and predicting ""the people of Alabama will see that on Election Day"".Trump has endorsed dozens of candidates in 2022, in races ranging from state legislatures to the U.S. Senate, a list that has included both veteran officials and political newcomers.
He has endorsed primary challengers to nine incumbent congressional Republicans who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, or to convict him on that charge in a Senate trial that ultimately ended in his acquittal.
But Trump has had a mixed record. In Ohio, his endorsement of a primary challenger to U.S. Representative Anthony Gonzalez led the congressman to end his re-election bid.
Another endorsee, Republican Sean Parnell, suspended his Pennsylvania U.S. Senate campaign after losing a battle over the custody of his three children amid allegations of physical and verbal abuse of his estranged wife. The Army veteran was vying for the seat held by conservative Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who is retiring.
Trump issued no new endorsement on Wednesday but promised to do so ""in the near future.""
Brooks, who has made Trump's endorsement the linchpin of his campaign messaging, is locked in a three-way race to replace retiring Republican Senator Richard Shelby. His main opponents in the party's May 24 primary are Katie Britt, a former Shelby aide, and Michael Durant, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot.
Trump has met with both Durant and Britt in recent days, according to a Trump adviser.
Republicans are favored to capture control of at least one chamber of Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm election, which would give them the power to block Biden's legislative agenda ahead of the 2024 presidential campaign.
After being an early front-runner to replace Shelby, Brooks slipped in the polls and trails his Republican rivals in fundraising. A recent poll showed him running a distant third to Durant and Britt. 

Trump pulled his endorsement two days after Brooks pledged his allegiance to the former president in his running war of words against Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a favorite target for Trump's invective.
A Britt campaign spokesman dismissed the Brooks pledge as an act of desperation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the use of a map configuring Wisconsin's congressional districts for this year's elections drawn by Democratic Governor Tony Evers, giving a boost to efforts by President Joe Biden's party to retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The justices turned away a Republican bid to block the map drafted by Evers and approved by the Wisconsin Supreme Court setting boundaries for the state's eight U.S. House districts after the governor vetoed one made by the Republican-controlled legislature he deemed unfairly skewed against Democrats. The emergency request to the justices was made by five Republican U.S. House members.
The court also granted a Republican request to block new maps for Wisconsin's state legislature, which were also drawn by Evers and had increased the number of state Assembly districts with a majority of Black voters from six to seven. The court sent that case back to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and ordered it to adopt new maps laying out the various districts. Two liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented from that decision. 
Wisconsin party primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 9, with the general election on Nov. 8. 
The Supreme Court on March 7 rejected similar efforts by Republicans to block U.S. House district maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. 
At the national level, Republicans are seeking to erase the slim majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress held by Biden's fellow Democrats. Even with the Wisconsin decision, Democrats face a strong risk of losing their House majority considering Biden's slumping popularity in opinion polls and the large number of retirements by incumbent Democrats.
Democrats and other critics have accused Wisconsin Republicans of abusing their control over the state legislature to manipulate electoral maps to maximize the number of districts in which Republicans have a majority voters. 
The Wisconsin electorate is closely divided between the two parties. Election experts consider Wisconsin's electoral maps among the country's most heavily gerrymandered, or designed to give one party an electoral advantage.
In the congressional case, Republican lawmakers challenged part of a March 3 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that adopted a map proposed by Evers within constraints set by an earlier ruling. The map drawn by Evers still favors Republicans, although not as much as maps proposed by Republican state legislators. Among Wisconsin's House districts, Republicans currently hold five and Democrats three.
In the dispute over districts in the state Assembly, the lower house of the bicameral legislature, Wisconsin's high court concluded that a seventh majority-Black district would be permissible under the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting and diluting the electoral clout of racial minorities. 
The Wisconsin legislature appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court alongside four voters represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative advocacy group. 
The justices faulted the Wisconsin court for improperly analyzing whether the new state Assembly districts would unlawfully sort voters on the basis of race in violation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law.

Sotomayor, in her dissent, criticized the court majority for issuing such a decision on a preliminary ""emergency"" basis instead of following full litigation over the issue. 
""This court's intervention today is not only extraordinary but also unnecessary,"" Sotomayor said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation removing ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia over the invasion of Ukraine hit a roadblock in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, as Democrats and Republicans disagreed about whether it should also include a ban on energy imports.
Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for unanimous consent to quickly approve the measure overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill would remove Permanent Normal trade Relations (PNTR) status for Russia and its ally Belarus, paving the way for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries.
""We should move the House bill ASAP,"" Schumer said.
Republican Senator Mike Crapo objected, arguing that the Senate should not pass the trade bill without also approving a ban on energy imports from Russia that the House passed earlier this month.
Some Republicans also object to a reauthorization of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law that makes it easier to impose sanctions on Russian officials for human rights violations, saying it would give too much power to the president.

Democrats said President Joe Biden had already issued an executive order covering the energy imports, so adding it would delay passage of the bill for a week or more.
Schumer said he planned to continue talking in order to resolve the issue and pass the legislation as quickly as possible.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin called on the judge who oversaw her unsuccessful defamation case against the New York Times to disqualify himself, and said his series of errors tainted the outcome and required a new trial.
In a late Tuesday night filing in federal court in Manhattan, lawyers for the former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor said U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff set too high a bar for her to prove the Times acted maliciously.
The lawyers also faulted Rakoff's unusual decision to dismiss Palin's case while jurors were deliberating.
They said this ""contaminated"" jurors' Feb. 15 verdict against Palin, citing several jurors who later admitted to the judge's clerk that they learned through ""push"" notifications to their cellphones about Rakoff's decision a day earlier.
""A reasonable person fully informed of the facts would question the court's impartiality and predisposition,"" Palin's lawyers wrote.
Palin, 58, is appealing the verdict and Rakoff's dismissal.
Rakoff's chambers did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment.
Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said: ""We remain confident that the judge and jury decided the case fairly and correctly.""
Palin sued the Times and its editorial page editor at the time, James Bennet, over a June 14, 2017, Times editorial that addressed gun control and lamented the rise of inflammatory political rhetoric.
It followed a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, where Republican U.S. congressman Steve Scalise was among the wounded.
The editorial incorrectly linked Palin's rhetoric to a 2011 Arizona mass shooting where Democratic then-congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was seriously wounded. The piece was corrected the next morning.
'FUNDAMENTAL, PREJUDICIAL ERRORS'
In a March 1 written opinion, Rakoff said Palin ""wholly failed to prove"" that the Times or Bennet acted with ""actual malice,"" a stringent standard, in publishing the editorial.
He said it was ""unfortunate"" that jurors learned about his planned dismissal, but said they maintained it did not affect their deliberations.
Palin's lawyers nonetheless said the outcome stemmed from ""several fundamental, prejudicial errors"" by the judge,
The lawyers said Rakoff's usual speedy jury selection meant jurors weren't properly screened for bias, a necessity for a case involving ""a major media defendant, polarizing parties and political issues, and extensive press coverage.""
They also said Rakoff's decision to talk to a reporter about the push notifications ran afoul of a federal rule governing judicial conduct, and could be seen as an ""attempt to bolster the court's rulings.""
The difficulty of proving defamation has prompted some calls to reconsider a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision, New York Times v. Sullivan, broadly protecting journalists.
That decision requires public figures alleging defamation to show that news media acted with actual malice, meaning they knowingly published false information or had reckless disregard for the truth.
The Times is scheduled to reply to Palin's arguments by April 12.

Palin was the late Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election, and Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.
She told the right-wing network Newsmax on Monday she was open to filling the U.S. House of Representatives seat left vacant by longtime Alaska congressman Don Young, who died on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Many Democrats thought their control of the White House and Congress would provide an opportunity to rein in U.S. military spending, which had leaped 140% since 2000, and to beef up social programs they felt had been neglected.
Then Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, bringing intense pressure to boost the Pentagon's budget significantly, and not just for the coming year.
""The world did not cooperate,"" said Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.
Congress this month passed an increase in defense spending of nearly 6%, a total expected to keep rising despite President Joe Biden's withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August after 20 years of war. Kaine said Russia and China were both concerns.
""The switch of the primary threat from non-state terrorist organizations to nation-states - and two big ones - that's going to require significant investment, and some retooling of investment,"" Kaine told Reuters.
Defense cuts have always been a tough sell in Congress. Support for a powerful military is a traditional area of bipartisan agreement, while defense contractors exert strong influence as a leading-edge industry, major employers and campaign donors.
In his first year in office, Biden submitted a budget keeping Department of Defense spending basically flat. Congress backed an increase even before Russian President Vladimir Putin's government invaded neighboring Ukraine last month.
Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, had hoped to tamp down what he saw as a bloated Pentagon budget. But he said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute this month that had changed.
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine fundamentally altered what our national security posture and what our defense posture needs to be. It made it more complicated, and it made it more expensive,"" he said.
Analysts, lawmakers and congressional aides said higher spending would likely continue even after the most urgent fears about Russian ambitions wear off.
""Never waste a crisis,"" said Valerie Shen, director of the National Security program at Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington. ""Use it as an argument to get the policy position you always wanted anyway,"" she said.
'PERMANENT INCREASE'
NATO allies like Germany have increased their military spending in the past month. Washington is expected to keep spending more, to support any ongoing Ukrainian resistance and back up allies most exposed to Russian threats.
""I could see the United States increasing its presence in Europe. It could be a permanent increase in defense posture"" or temporary deployments, said Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Biden is expected to announce his fiscal 2023 budget request on March 28. 
Harrison speculated that Congress - which controls federal spending - could add $20 billion to $30 billion to whatever the Democratic president requests.
The 2023 total U.S. national defense budget will top $800 billion, giving U.S. arms makers a revenue tailwind after the COVID-19 pandemic choked supply chains for aerospace and microchips and hampered sales.
Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said it was too early to know the overall dollar amount Congress might settle upon for the military, especially given the fluid situation in Ukraine.
""We should never turn our back on people fighting for freedom,"" he told Reuters in a hallway interview.
The Dow Jones U.S. Defense Index, which tracks shares of defense contractors, is up nearly 14% since Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
The largest U.S.-based defense contractors are  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Northrup Grumman and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)..
For the last year, progressive Democrats had been pressuring party leaders to push for more spending on non-defense priorities such as battling climate change; helping lower-income families with childcare; and expanding healthcare for the elderly.
Lawmakers who want to tamp down military spending increases said they would not stop trying, although they were not optimistic.

Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee and a member of the Progressive Caucus, said he supported Ukraine but not an endlessly expanding military budget. 
""I would encourage us to take a more critical look at Pentagon spending in general. I think that's separate and apart from what's happening there (Ukraine),"" he said as he left a speech to Congress last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose appeal for more help left some lawmakers in tears.

Biden is expected to announce his budget next week.
""As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 budget for submission to Congress, we strongly encourage you to reject the approach you took last year when you proposed to cut defense spending below the rate of inflation,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, made public on Wednesday.
In his first year in office, Biden submitted a budget keeping Department of Defense spending basically flat, as he and many of his fellow Democrats sought to rein in the Department of Defense budget, which has risen to more than $750 billion. 
""Unprecedented Chinese military modernization has left us behind in key areas in the Western Pacific, and each day the Chinese Communist Party more clearly shows us that its interests are diametrically opposed to ours,"" the lawmakers said in the letter.

""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression against Ukraine has already left us and our NATO allies less secure, and his appetite and erratic behavior is likely to grow,"" they said.
The letter's signatories were led by Representative Mike Rogers (NYSE:ROG), the top Republican on House Armed Services, and Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on Senate Armed Services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Tuesday defended her past legal representation of Guantanamo Bay detainees and rejected Republican accusations that she had been lenient as a judge in child pornography cases.
On a contentious second day of her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing that lasted about 13 hours, Jackson pledged to be an independent jurist who would not inject her own views into rulings as Democratic senators rallied to her defense.
Several Republican senators focused their queries on child pornography, accusing Jackson of giving lenient sentences to offenders. Jackson rejected this, saying that in most of these cases she delivered sentences consistent with or higher than the recommendations of probation officers. In each such case, she said, ""I did my duty to hold the defendants accountable.""
Jackson said that as a mother herself, she has found the cases involving sexual crimes against children particularly harrowing. ""These are the cases that wake you up at night because you're seeing the worst of humanity,"" Jackson said.
Jackson also said her past legal representation of detainees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was consistent with American values of fairness.
Nominated by Biden in February to become the first Black woman to serve on the nation's top judicial body, Jackson has served since last year as a federal appellate judge after eight years as a federal district court judge.
Her confirmation would not change the court's ideological balance - a 6-3 conservative majority - but would let Biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51-year-old justice who could serve for decades in the lifetime post. Biden nominated Jackson to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.
With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, she would get the job if Democrats remain united in the vote.
FOCUS ON SENTENCING
Republican Senators Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Tom Cotton and Marsha Blackburn asked questions focusing on child pornography and sexual predators. They said Jackson as a trial judge in child pornography cases delivered sentences below recommendations in federal sentencing guidelines. 
""I'm questioning how you used your discretion in these cases,"" Hawley told Jackson.
Federal judges routinely impose penalties below advisory guidelines in cases involving defendants who do not themselves produce child pornography, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which has urged Congress to address inconsistencies resulting in penalties sometimes too lenient and sometimes too severe.
Sentencing experts in a March 20 letter to the committee deemed Jackson's sentencing in such cases ""squarely within the mainstream of federal district court judges nationally.""
Cruz also accused Jackson of ""a record of activism and advocacy as it concerns sexual predators"" dating back to her time in law school in 1996 when she wrote a paper discussing sexual offender registries. Jackson pushed back, saying ""those are not the sentiments I expressed.""
Pedophilia has become a theme among far-right activists on social media and of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory, whose followers cast elite liberals and Democrats as a cabal of Satanist child-sexual predators. 
Cotton also blasted Jackson for reducing the sentence of a drug trafficker she had previously sent to prison for 20 years, based on a criminal justice reform law signed by former President Donald Trump in 2018.
Jackson explained that the man would not have received such a long prison term if he had been sentenced under the new law.
Cotton countered that Congress did not make the law retroactive. ""You twisted the law...so you could cut the sentence of a drug kingpin,"" he said.
In response, Jackson said she disagreed with Cotton's assessment.
Jackson worked from 2005 to 2007 as a court-appointed lawyer paid by the government to represent criminal defendants who could not afford counsel, including four Guantanamo detainees. She later continued representing one of the detainees in private practice.
Jackson called the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States tragic but defended her representation of detainees captured afterward, saying: ""We couldn't let the terrorists win by changing who we were fundamentally.""
Republican senators also sought to tie Jackson to ""critical race theory"", which argues American history and institutions are infused with racial bias. Cruz tried to link Jackson to certain books available to students at Georgetown Day School, a private school in Washington where Jackson serves on the board. Jackson said the theory does not come up in her work as a judge.

Jackson declined to weigh in on calls from some on the left to expand the court's number of justices to erase its current conservative majority, calling it ""a policy question for Congress."" 
If confirmed, Jackson would be the 116th justice to serve on the high court, the sixth woman and the third Black person. The court also would have for the first time four women and two Black justices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump's Save America group has quickly become one of the top Republican fundraising organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 congressional elections. 
But so far it has been stingy with its spending on Republican efforts to win in November compared to the expenditures of other groups, according to a Reuters analysis of financial disclosures made to the Federal Election Commission.
Trump has already drawn attention for giving only small amounts to Republican candidates, but the findings of the Reuters analysis showing the sharp contrast in spending have not been previously reported.
Since Trump founded Save America in November 2020, the group has raised $124 million -- the largest war chest ever built by an ex-president -- but spent only about $14 million, or around 11%. Much of that has gone to funding rallies and ads that ostensibly promote Republicans running for Congress but focus more on Trump himself. 
By comparison, his party's main fund for supporting Senate candidates has spent about 80% of the $135 million it raised since the start of 2021, while its main fund for House of Representatives candidates spent more than half of the $162 million it raised in the same period, FEC filings show. 
Save America's limited spending has raised questions among campaign finance experts and political observers, who say it might signal that he is reserving cash for a presidential run. 
    Taylor Budowich, the director of communications for both Save America and Trump, said the former president was supporting candidates through direct contributions, rallies, and joint fundraisers.
   ""Save America will not be telegraphing specific tactics or expenditures through the press,"" Budowich said in a statement to Reuters. ""Every dollar raised will go to ensuring President Trump's America First agenda is advanced through his endorsed candidates and causes."" 
Trump registered Save America as a leadership PAC, or political action committee. Under election laws, it can only spend on election campaigns of people other than Trump but campaign finance experts said there may be ways of tapping into the PAC's war chest if Trump makes another bid for the White House.
Trump has not announced his candidacy for 2024, which would require him to set up a separate fundraising account for his campaign, but he regularly hints at his political rallies that he intends to run for president again.
ODD SPENDING PATTERN 
It is still early in the election cycle and Trump could ramp up his spending between now and November to support his Republican Party, which hopes to win control of Congress. 
But at this point in a midterm election year, leadership PACs are typically already spending generously on candidates, said Michael Beckel, research director at Issue One, a nonpartisan group that advocates for campaign finance reform. 
""It's atypical for someone to amass such a large political war chest in their leadership PAC and not be spending very much directly on elections,"" Beckel said. 
Justin Sayfie of Ballard Partners, a Florida-based lobbying firm with ties to Trump, said it was smart to hold off on spending now so Trump could have a bigger impact closer to election day.
""I would determine which 30 seats are the best pickup opportunities for Republicans once the primaries are over,"" said Sayfie. ""And then pour all my money into those races from August to Election Day.""
CONSULTING, ADS AND HOTELS
Trump's biggest outlays have been to pay for his rallies, which many political observers see as potential preparation for 2024 as he connects with crowds and collects data about attendees. 
Save America spent more than $3 million on events through February, according to FEC financial disclosures filed ahead of a March 20 reporting deadline.
Save America also spent more than $2 million on consulting services, close to $300,000 on ads and about $200,000 in contributions to Republican congressional candidates. At least $170,000 has been spent at hotels owned by Trump, covering Save America expenses on lodging, meals and the renting of hotel facilities.
The Republican Party's main congressional funds gave about $300,000 to congressional candidates but they spent massive sums elsewhere, including more than $20 million on ads and more than $25 million on text messaging and access to voter lists, which they use to target voters for political mailings and door-knocking campaigns.
""TWO WORDS"" 
Trump has used his rallies to urge supporters to vote for Republican congressional candidates but they mainly focus on him.
At a frigid gathering in a South Carolina airport on March 12, Trump paused his remarks so that Russell Fry, a state representative endorsed by Trump to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Tom Rice, could speak. 
""Why don't you just say two words and we'll then get the hell out of here because it's cold,"" Trump said. 
After Fry spoke briefly, Trump continued for about 20 minutes, describing how his agenda would transform the country after the next presidential election. ""In 2024 we are going to take back that beautiful White House,"" he said. ""I wonder who will do that. I wonder, I wonder.""
A Democratic fundraising group filed a complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission alleging Save America's spending on rallies amounted to presidential campaigning, a violation of election laws. 
The FEC is unlikely to crack down on Trump, even if he announces a presidential run and tries to channel Save America money to his campaign, according to Beckel and other campaign finance experts.
The FEC's leadership is split evenly between commissioners aligned with Republicans and Democrats and has deadlocked on most contentious issues in recent years. 
""It's a free for all,"" said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who was a commissioner at the FEC from 2013 to 2017.

Trump spokesperson Budowich said complaints raised by Democrats were ""frivolous"" and had ""zero merit."" 
One legal strategy Trump could employ to use Save America money on a presidential campaign would be to sever his formal ties with the group, Ravel and other experts said. Trump could also transfer Save America funds to an allied group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and his European counterparts will announce new sanctions against Russia and new measures to tighten existing sanctions during his trip to Brussels this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday.
Biden also will discuss longer-term adjustments to NATO force posture and contingencies in the case of nuclear weapons use, Sullivan said. Biden also will announce ""joint action"" on enhancing energy security in Europe, which is highly reliant on Russian gas.
The United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia as punishment for invading Ukraine and supplied billions of dollars in weapons and aid for Ukraine's defense. Biden has pledged not to send U.S. soldiers into Ukraine, but promised to keep Washington's commitment to defend NATO members if they were attacked.
Biden leaves on Wednesday for Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based, for meetings on Thursday with fellow leaders. He will attend an emergency NATO summit, meet with G7 leaders, and address European Union leaders at a meeting of the European Council, Sullivan said.
""He will have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine. He will join our partners in imposing further sanctions on Russia and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and to ensure robust enforcement,"" Sullivan told reporters.
Asked about the use of nuclear weapons, Sullivan said Russian President Vladimir Putin had raised the specter of their deployment, but the United States had not changed its nuclear posture to date.
Three days into what Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine, Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert in the face of Western reprisals. On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN that Russia's security policy dictates that the country would only use nuclear weapons if its very existence were threatened.
Sullivan said the United States was monitoring the issue.
""But we are constantly monitoring for that potential contingency and of course we take it as seriously as one could possibly take it,"" Sullivan said. ""We will be consulting with allies and partners on that potential contingency ... and discussing what our potential response are.""
Sullivan said the new sanctions would be rolled out on Thursday and focus on enforcing previous penalties.
Biden will also announce further U.S. contributions to ease humanitarian conditions for refugees and civilians inside Ukraine, many of whom are trapped in besieged cities.
After Brussels, Biden will travel to Warsaw in a show of support for an ally that shares a border with Ukraine. While in Poland he will ""engage with U.S. troops who are now helping to defend NATO territory"" and meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response to the war, Sullivan said. The U.S. president will also meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda.
The Duda government has suggested Poland replace Russia in the G20 group of large economies. 

Sullivan said the United States wanted to consult with its allies about Russia's G20 membership. ""We believe that it cannot be business as usual in international institutions and in the international community,"" Sullivan said.
Sullivan said Biden was going to Europe ""to ensure we stay united, to cement our collective resolve, to send a powerful message that we are prepared and committed to this for as long as it takes.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell to a new low of 40% this week, a clear warning sign for his Democratic Party as it seeks to retain control of Congress in the Nov. 8 election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.
The national poll, conducted on March 21 and 22, found that 54% of Americans disapprove of his job performance as the country struggles with high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed geopolitical concerns to the fore. 
Biden's approval rating, down three percentage points from the prior week, mirrors that which his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, received at this point in his presidency, as both stood at 40% in mid-March in their second year in office. 
Trump's approval rating sank as low as 33% in December 2017.
Poll respondents cited the economy as their top concern, followed by war and foreign conflicts.
Biden's popularity began dropping in mid-August as COVID-19 deaths began to rise and the U.S. military faced a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Biden has sought to lower the political temperature following Trump's divisive presidency. 
But Americans remain polarized under his presidency. While 77% of self-identified Democrats said they approved of his job performance, only 10% of self-identified Republicans and 27% of independents gave him a positive rating.

Democrats hold razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate. The loss of either could grind Biden's legislative agenda to a halt.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,005 adults, including 432 Democrats and 366 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of 4 percentage points.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden rejected Couy Griffin's argument that he was not guilty of entering a restricted area protected by the Secret Service because he could not have known of the special protections around the Capitol while then-Vice President Mike Pence was present to preside over the presidential election certification process.
McFadden said Griffin crossed over three walls, needing a help from others to get over them.
""All of this would suggest to a normal person that perhaps you should not be entering the area,"" McFadden said following a two-day trial.
Griffin had opted to have a judge, rather than a jury, decide his case.
McFadden's ruling bolsters a key theory from prosecutors in hundreds of riot cases. They argued that the Capitol grounds were strictly off-limits on Jan. 6, 2021, and that should have been apparent to the thousands of Donald Trump supporters who breached them that day in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's election win.
McFadden cleared Griffin of a second misdemeanor charge, disorderly conduct, because he never tried to rile up the crowd at the Capitol or engage in violence.
McFadden scheduled a June sentencing hearing for Griffin, who faces up to one year behind bars.
Griffin told reporters outside the courtroom that he was being prosecuted for free speech and that he did not think a jail sentence would be appropriate.
""One year would be a long time to spend in jail,"" Griffin said. ""I hope that I don't.""
Before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump gave a fiery speech in which he falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
About 800 people face criminal charges relating to the riot, which sent Pence and members of Congress running for their lives. Some 200 have already pleaded guilty.

Griffin's bench trial is seen as an important test case as the Justice Department attempts to secure convictions of the hundreds of defendants who have not taken plea deals.
The first jury trial for a Jan. 6 defendant ended in a decisive victory for prosecutors earlier this month. After a quick deliberation, a jury unanimously found a Texas man guilty on all five of the felony charges he faced, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee to become the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, stressed her patriotism and Christian faith on Monday while Republicans asked whether she has a hidden agenda that favors criminals.
In her opening statement during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Jackson said she was blessed to be ""born in this great nation"" and added: ""I must also pause to reaffirm my thanks to God, for it is faith that sustains me at this moment."" Jackson, 51, pledged independence if confirmed by the Senate to the nation's top judicial body and embraced a limited role for jurists.
Jackson, who has served since last year as a federal appellate judge after eight years as a federal district court judge, also reflected on opportunities she had that her parents, who grew up in era of racial segregation in the South, did not.
""My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be,"" Jackson said.
In opening statements by committee members, Democrats hailed the historic nature of Jackson's selection for the lifetime post and praised her judicial record. Republicans took aim at her record and tried to link her to advocacy groups on the left, while some tried to paint Jackson as ""soft on crime.""
The harshest attacks came from Senators Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn. Hawley has suggested Jackson was overly lenient toward certain child pornography defendants when sentencing them to prison terms - claims that sentencing experts have called misleading. 
""I can only wonder: what's your hidden agenda?"" Blackburn asked. ""Is it to let violent criminals, cop killers and child predators back to the streets?""
As the hearing unfolded, Biden touted Jackson on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as ""a brilliant legal mind."" Biden, who as a candidate in 2020 pledged to appoint a Black woman to the court, last month nominated Jackson to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, 83.
""Members of this committee: If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years,"" Jackson said.
""I have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously. I decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me, without fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath,"" she added.
Her confirmation would not change the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which includes three conservative justices appointed by Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump. But it would let Biden freshen the court's liberal bloc with a justice young enough to serve for decades. 
'NOT EASY'
If confirmed, she would be the 116th justice to serve on the high court, the sixth woman and the third Black person. With Jackson on the bench, the court for the first time would have four women and two Black justices.
""It's not easy being the first. You have to be the best and in some ways the brightest,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman, told her. 
Durbin said attacks on Jackson's approach to criminal justice issues are baseless and her judicial record showed she would not be a ""rubber stamp"" for Biden. Durbin noted that law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police have endorsed Jackson's nomination.
Jackson faces questions from senators on Tuesday and Wednesday. Republicans said among other things they would ask her whether she supports efforts on the left to expand the Supreme Court to erase its current 6-3 conservative majority.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz sought to tie Jackson to Democratic criminal justice reform proposals pursued following the 2020 George Floyd killing in Minneapolis - efforts Republicans suggest caused a rise in violent crime.
Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), one of three Republicans who voted to confirm Jackson to her current position, said Black and Hispanic Republican judicial nominees have been asked tough questions by Democrats in prior confirmation hearings but Republicans would be called racists if they do the same.
""It's about 'we're all racists if we ask hard questions.' That's not gonna fly with us. We're used to it by now,"" Graham said.
Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control the Senate, which has the authority under the U.S. Constitution to confirm a president's judicial appointments. A simple majority vote is needed for confirmation, meaning Jackson would get the job if all Democrats are united regardless of what Republicans do in a Senate divided 50-50 between the two parties.

The Senate previously confirmed Jackson to three posts including last year, when Biden nominated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Jackson was raised in Miami and attended Harvard Law School, later serving as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer. 
The two Black justices previously confirmed by the Senate were: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. Thomas, 73, is currently hospitalized after experiencing flu-like symptoms, though he does not have COVID-19, according to a court spokesperson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A New Mexico county commissioner who founded a group called ""Cowboys for Trump"" faced trial on Monday on charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, in an important test for prosecutors that could affect other criminal cases.
A federal judge in the District of Columbia began the trial for Couy Griffin, who is charged with breaching a restricted area protected by the U.S. Secret Service and engaging in disorderly conduct in that area. The trial is expected to end Tuesday with closing arguments.
U.S. criminal defendants have a right to a jury trial, but Griffin opted to be tried by a judge instead.
Griffin, 48, was photographed at the Capitol during the riot, and does not deny that he entered a barricaded area.
But Griffin contends that under the law he is accused of violating, the government must prove that he knew then-Vice President Michael Pence was present at the Capitol building or grounds at the same time he was.
Prosecutors have interpreted the law more broadly, saying it only requires that Griffin breached a Secret Service-protected area that Pence was in or would have been returning to.
U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, the judge presiding over the case, will decide whether Griffin is guilty. It is unclear if McFadden will issue his ruling from the bench on Tuesday or in a later written decision.
Thousands of people stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after a fiery speech in which then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
About 800 people face criminal charges relating to the riot, which sent Pence and other lawmakers running for their lives, and some 200 have already pleaded guilty.

(Reuters) - The ex-wife of Eric Greitens, a former Missouri governor now mounting a run for U.S. Senate, accused the candidate in court papers made public on Monday of physical violence toward her and the couple's sons.
Greitens responded by posting a statement to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), calling Sheena Greitens' accusations ""lies"" peddled by political operatives and the media. 
""I will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations,"" Eric Greitens, a 47-year-old Republican, said in the statement.
""I am seeking full custody of my sons and for their sake, I will continue to pray for their mother and hope she gets the help that she needs,"" he said. The couple divorced in 2020.
Sheena Greitens said in court documents filed as part of the couple's child custody proceedings that during an argument at their home in 2018, Eric Greitens knocked her down and confiscated her phone, wallet and keys.
She said that Eric Greitens, who kept a firearm hidden in the house, took a photo that invaded her privacy and threatened to kill himself unless she supported him publicly during a separate political scandal.
Sheena Greitens said that her then-husband once ""cuffed"" their 3-year-old son. In November of 2019, one of her sons came home from a visit with his father with a swollen face, bleeding gums and a loose tooth, she said, and told her that his father had struck him.
Several candidates seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate against Greitens called for him to drop out They were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, Republican from Missouri.

""If you hit a woman or a child, you belong in handcuffs, not the United States Senate. It’s time for Eric Greitens to leave this race,"" Hawley said on Twitter.
Eric Greitens was elected governor of Missouri in 2017 but resigned in June 2018 as he faced accusations of sexual misconduct. The couple split up in 2018 after the resignation.

137,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 03:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republican hopeful Mo Brooks pledged on Monday to ""fire"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, days after former President Donald Trump told an interviewer that he could pull his endorsement of the Alabama congressman. 
""Today, I unveil my pledge to America, to fire Mitch McConnell. If elected to the Senate, I will not vote for Mitch McConnell for leader,"" Brooks said in a 90-second digital ad. 
""America can't afford a Senate leader who is a weak-kneed, debt-junkie, open-border RINO Republican, and who – worse yet – sells out America for special interest group cash,"" Brooks said, using one of Trump's favorite slurs for those in his party he disagrees with, which stands for ""Republican in name only.""
Brooks also urged fellow Republican Senate candidates across the country to make the same commitment, warning that McConnell and Trump were locked in ""a war for the heart and soul of the Republican Party.""
Brooks is the third Senate Republican hopeful to oppose McConnell's leadership, following Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska and Eric Greitens in Missouri. 
McConnell, an 80-year-old Kentucky Republican, is a favorite target of Trump, who has called repeatedly for his ouster as Senate party leader in a running war of words, as Republicans try to reclaim the Senate majority in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
A McConnell spokesman had no comment on the Brooks video. 
Brooks is locked in a tight three-way race to replace Senate Republican Richard Shelby, who is retiring. He is running in the party's May 24 primary against Katie Britt, a former Shelby aide, and Michael Durant, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot. 
After becoming an early front-runner last year when he won Trump's endorsement, Brooks has slipped in the polls and trails his rivals in campaign fundraising. 
Trump, who falsely claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, has also expressed disappointment since Brooks told voters that it was time to move on from 2020 and look to future elections. The former president told the Washington Examiner last week that he could change his endorsement.

A Britt campaign spokesman dismissed the Brooks video, saying in a statement: ""Mo Brooks has resorted to desperate gimmicks to try and win the people of Alabama's support."" 
The Durant campaign did not respond to a query seeking comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's National Security Adviser Nancy McEldowney is stepping down from her role and will be succeeded by her deputy Philip Gordon, according to an internal staff memo seen by Reuters.
Both McEldowney and Gordon have worked for Harris since she took office and have advised the vice president and President Joe Biden on topics such as Afghanistan, Iran, Ukraine, and cybersecurity.
They accompanied Harris on several foreign trips to Central America, Asia and Europe, and have played a key role in shaping her strategy outside the United States.
In the memo to staff, McEldowney said she is stepping down to ""focus on some pressing personal matters"" but will remain an ardent advocate for Harris and the Biden administration.  
""This was a difficult decision because I am so deeply committed to the work we do and the crucial national interest we serve. But after more than a year, this is the right decision for my family,"" she said. She also noted she's ""not rushing out the door"" but said the date of her last day was not immediately clear.
A senior administration official said no date has been set yet but it is likely to be at the end of the month.
In her 31-year career as a diplomat in the U.S. Foreign Service, McEldowney has held several roles including ambassador to Bulgaria, and deputy chief of mission in both Azerbaijan and Turkey.
Gordon, a veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations, currently serves as special assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser to the vice president. He has been involved in all interagency policy discussions, foreign leader meetings and trips, a senior administration official said.
McEldowney's departure comes at a critical time for Harris, who has taken a central role in rallying Western nations and other allies to act against Russia's attack on Ukraine and has increasingly found herself in the middle of high-stakes diplomacy with leaders around the world.
It also comes after a series of high profile exits from Harris's communications team, which had a turbulent first year marked by several messaging failures.
Harris told Reuters in a statement that McEldowney had provided ""invaluable counsel"" and that she is grateful for her ""service - her exceptional talent, deep expertise, and leadership navigating complex challenges.""
Gordon, Harris said in the statement, has been a trusted adviser since she took office and brings a wealth of foreign policy experience and knowledge to the role.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told Reuters in a statement that McEldowney ""has been a great partner to me and the National Security Council since we took office,"" and has helped strategize and execute policies around the world with clarity and devotion. Sullivan said he has worked closely with Gordon and knows he will be a ""thoughtful and dedicated advisor to the Vice President and all of us.""
In other changes to Harris's national security team, Dean Lieberman joined her office in early February as a special advisor for national security and her foreign policy speechwriter - a new role in her office.
He was previously a strategic communications director at the White House National Security Council and served as a spokesman on China, Asia, and Europe, and also supported Harris's foreign policy work.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If confirmed as its first Black woman justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson would add not only racial and gender diversity to the U.S. Supreme Court but would also bring a varied legal background including a stint representing low-income criminal defendants.
Jackson, 51, served early in her career as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement announced in January created a vacancy on the nation's top judicial body that President Joe Biden picked her to fill. Biden, a Democrat, last year appointed Jackson to an influential Washington-based appellate court after she served eight years as a federal district judge.
Jackson's four-day Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing starts on Monday. A simple majority vote in needed in the Senate to confirm Jackson to the lifetime post. She has won three prior Senate confirmation votes for other jobs.
Biden has sought to bring more women and minorities and a broader range of backgrounds to the federal judiciary. He pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court, which has had only two Black justices, both men: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. 
During her April 2021 confirmation hearing for her current judgeship, Jackson said her background - personal and professional - would ""bring value"" to the bench, but said race does not shape the way she does her job.
""I don't think that race plays a role in the kind of judge that I have been and that I would be,"" Jackson said in response to a question posed by Republican Senator John Cornyn.
""I'm doing a certain thing when I get my cases: I'm looking at the arguments, the facts and the law. I'm methodically and intentionally setting aside personal views, any other inappropriate considerations. And I would think that race would be the kind of thing that would be inappropriate to inject in my evaluation of a case,"" Jackson added.
Jackson would become the sixth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, joining current members Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the retired Sandra Day O'Connor and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
APPELLATE JUDGE
The Senate voted 53-44 last year to confirm Jackson as a member of the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she has authored two majority opinions including one favoring public sector unions that challenged a regulation issued under Republican former President Donald Trump that restricted their bargaining power.
She was part of a three-judge panel that ruled in December against Trump's bid to prevent White House records from being handed over to a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack by a mob of his supporters. The Supreme Court subsequently declined to block that decision. 
Jackson also was part of a three-judge panel that refused last August to block the Biden administration's COVID-19 pandemic-related residential eviction moratorium, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.
The Senate confirmed Jackson in 2013 after Democratic former President Barack Obama nominated her as a Washington-based federal district judge. In one of the high-profile cases she handled in that role, Jackson ruled that Trump's former chief White House lawyer, Donald McGahn, had to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony about Trump's potential obstruction of a special counsel investigation.
""The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,"" Jackson wrote. 
The ruling was appealed and, after Biden took office, a settlement was reached. McGahn testified behind closed doors. 
Jackson in 2019 blocked Trump's plan to expedite removal of certain immigrants and in 2018 ruled against his administration's proposal to make it easier to fire federal employees - decisions later reversed by the D.C. Circuit.
Jackson was raised in Miami and attended Harvard University, where she once shared a scene in a drama class with future Hollywood star Matt Damon, before graduating from Harvard Law School in 1996.
She worked from 2005 to 2007 as a court-appointed lawyer paid by the government to represent criminal defendants who could not afford counsel. Among her clients was Khi Ali Gul, an Afghan detainee at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The United States sent him back to Afghanistan in 2014 when she was no longer involved in the case.
Jackson worked from 2002 to 2004 for Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer known for overseeing compensation programs including one for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

She had two stints at the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which issues guidance to judges on criminal sentencing.
Jackson and husband Patrick Jackson, a surgeon, have two daughters.

Thomas, 73, was being treated with intravenous antibiotics, his symptoms were abating, and he expected to be released from the Sibley Memorial Hospital in a day or two, the court said in a statement.
The Supreme Court, which is set to be in session on Monday, said that Thomas will participate in the consideration of cases through briefs, transcripts, and audio of the oral arguments.
The court is set to hear four cases this week.
A court representative said earlier that all nine justices were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and had received booster doses.
A conservative and one of two Black men to have served on the Supreme Court, Thomas is the longest-serving of the current justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by President Joe Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump.
Thomas was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the retirement of liberal justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on the court.
Separately on Monday, hearings will begin for federal appellate judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's nominee, to become the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Biden has tapped her to replace Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring and is the oldest justice on the current court.

Thomas spoke on March 11 in Utah and raised concerns about calls to add additional members to the court, and discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the court to conduct arguments remotely.
""I didn’t like the free-for-all in oral arguments where we interacted and interrupted each other. It’s more productive now. The arguments are contributing to the process of deciding the case as opposed to what was happening, which was almost like a catfight,"" Thomas said, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress' probe of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol will reveal new details of that day's events and may recommend new criminal penalties for officials who fail to uphold their duties, Representative Liz Cheney said on Sunday.
""There will be legislative recommendations and there certainly will be information"" on the attack the public has not yet heard, Cheney told NBC-TV's ""Meet the Press.""
Cheney is one of two Republicans on the nine-person U.S. House of Representatives select committee that has been holding closed-door sessions over the past several months as it interviews witnesses about events leading up to and during the attack by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
The committee is expected to hold public hearings later this spring. Cheney said a top priority will be making recommendations, including possible ""additional enhanced criminal penalties.""
Such penalties, Cheney added, would be aimed at ""the kind of supreme dereliction of duty that you saw with former President Trump when he refused to tell the mob to go home after he provoked that attack on the Capitol.""
Cheney told NBC that her work on the committee has only raised her distress about what unfolded that day.
""I have not learned a single thing since I have been on this committee that has made me less concerned or less worried about the gravity of the situation and the actions that President Trump took and also refused to take while the attack was underway,"" she said.
Thousands of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, battling with police and sending lawmakers running for their lives after Trump in a fiery speech near the White House repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected that claim as untrue.
Trump has been openly flirting with the possibility of running again in 2024 at a series of rallies.

Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger, who also serves on the special committee, were among the only 10 Republicans who voted early last year to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack.
One police officer who battled rioters on Jan. 6 died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide. Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window. About 140 police officers were injured during the hours-long attack.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a bill banning race-based discrimination on hair, specifically textures or styles associated with a particular race or national origin such as dreadlocks, Afros and braids.
The bill, known as the CROWN Act, was co-sponsored by Democratic Representatives Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, among others, who cited research showing that Black students were significantly more likely to face school detention, often for dress code violations based on their hair.
""I want my two girls to grow up in a world where they know they will not be discriminated against because of their hair or the way they look,"" Omar said in a press release on Friday after the vote.
""Natural Black hair is often deemed 'unprofessional' simply because it does not conform to white beauty standards,"" Representative Watson Coleman, a co-sponsor, said. ""Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people.""

The legislation attracted derision from some Republicans, including Representative Lauren Boebert, who referred to it as ""the bad hair bill.""
The CROWN Act passed with some bipartisan support in the House and will now move to the Senate, where it is sponsored by Democratic Senator Cory Booker. It will need to secure 60 votes in the evenly divided chamber to pass.

But Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who hopes to become House speaker next year if Republicans retake the majority, said he was still backing Cawthorn in the Nov. 8 midterm election.
Cawthorn, a 26-year-old hard-line conservative and staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, is one of several Republicans who have come under fire since Russia's invasion of Ukraine for comments seen as supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin or attacking Ukraine.
""Madison is wrong. If there's any thug in this world, it's Putin,"" McCarthy said at a Friday news conference, adding that he had spoken to Cawthorn. 
""This is the aggressor,"" McCarthy said of Putin. ""This is the one that needs to end this war. This is the one that everybody should unite against.""
Asked if he still supported Cawthorn's reelection, McCarthy replied: ""Yes."" 
Cawthorn, who did not respond to a request for comment, is only the latest hard-line House conservative to cause McCarthy headaches. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar participated in a white nationalist conference last month where participants applauded Russia and chanted Putin's name. 
On Wednesday, Zelenskiy became the first wartime leader to deliver a virtual address to Congress, in a presentation that resonated strongly with U.S. lawmakers. 

In a video clip aired by WRAL-TV in Raleigh the week before Zelenskiy's address, Cawthron described the Ukrainian leader and his country in these terms: ""Remember that Zelenskiy is a thug. Remember the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.""
Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, lashed out at Cawthorn after U.S. media reported that the clip had been played repeatedly by Russian state television.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a bitterly divided Washington, Republicans and Democrats apparently agree on one thing: the twice-yearly ritual of changing clocks needs to end.
Even with that rare show of bipartisan consensus, it is less clear whether the county will be able to agree on a common time standard.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously approved legislation that would make daylight saving time (DST) permanent, which would eliminate the need to ""fall back"" or ""spring forward"", as the saying goes to help Americans remember which way to adjust their clocks.
""I wanna take 'setting clocks back' out in a field and beat it to death,"" tweeted Jason Kander, a Democrat who formerly served as Missouri Secretary of State. 
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to offer a view on the Senate bill. ""I don't have a specific position from the administration at this point in time,"" Psaki said Wednesday at a briefing.
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives, taken by surprise by the Senate's swift approval, promised they would tackle the issue as well.
""That was unexpected,"" said Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a member of House leadership. ""I think it's an important step that we should take.""
Opinion polls show Americans broadly dislike the annual shift between Standard Time, which aims to maximize daylight during winter mornings, and daylight saving time, which delays sunset by an hour during spring, summer and fall. Every U.S. state except Hawaii and Arizona toggles between both.
Researchers have found plenty of downsides as well, including a documented spike in heart attacks, strokes and sleep deprivation in the days after clocks are moved forward an hour every March.
There is less of a consensus over which standard Congress should make permanent. 
Advocates for daylight saving time say the extra hour of afternoon daylight generates more economic activity and reduces crime and traffic accidents in the evening rush hour, when children are more likely to be out playing and drivers more likely to have alcohol in their system.
""It is past time that we set our clocks forward forever,"" University of Washington law professor Steve Calandrillo said in congressional testimony last week.
Sleep researchers say standard time lines up with the human biological clock, which needs light to be fully alert.
A year-round daylight saving time, as the Senate bill calls for, would require children to go to school in the dark and make it more difficult for them to go to bed at an appropriate hour, Vanderbilt University neurologist Beth Malow told Congress last week.
Daylight saving time was first adopted in 1918 to conserve fuel during World War I. But studies have found little, if any, energy savings from the shift, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Congress tried year-round daylight saving time in 1974 when oil prices spiked, but dropped it that fall.
Support for a permanent standard has grown in recent years. Since 2018, 18 states have passed laws to provide for year-round DST if Congress takes action, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
""I'm hopeful that we can end the silliness of the current system soon,"" said Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, who chaired a hearing on the issue last week but has not decided which time to endorse.
Others said they do not want to switch to a standard that would lead to dark winter mornings.
""I would prefer permanent standard time (as would the research). But I will take anything if we can #LocktheClock<' Father Dan Beeman, a chaplain, tweeted. 
Some people questioned why the Senate, which has failed to address climate change, inflation, voting rights and other major issues, was wasting its time on time.

""This is stupid and shows how messed up our moral conscience is!"" Rev. William Barber II, a civil-rights leader, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Others turned to sarcasm. Geopolitical analyst Eric Garland tweeted: ""BREAKING: CONGRESS MAY DO SOMETHING AWESOME""

(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday that would enable the president to sanction foreign cryptocurrency firms doing business with sanctioned Russian entities and prevent them from transacting with U.S. customers.
The Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Act is led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and co-sponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Senators Mark Warner and Jon Tester.
While the bill is unlikely to become law anytime soon, it could ramp up pressure on cryptocurrency exchanges, which have been on the defensive amid concerns from some lawmakers like Warren that digital assets are being used to circumvent a slew of Western sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ""and his cronies can move, store and hide their wealth using cryptocurrencies, potentially allowing them to evade the historic economic sanctions the U.S. and its partners across the world have levied in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Warren said in a statement. 
Biden administration officials have said they do not believe Russia could use cryptocurrencies to completely evade sanctions, citing the lack of liquidity in crypto markets to facilitate high-volume transactions. Nevertheless, the Treasury Department has emphasized that digital asset firms are required to comply with the sanctions.

Warren’s bill would also allow the Treasury secretary to block digital asset platforms operating in the United States from transacting with any Russian crypto users, a step that major crypto exchanges like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Kraken have said they would not take without a legal requirement. 
The bill would also require the Treasury to publicly identify foreign crypto trading platforms deemed to be at high risk for sanctions evasion and money laundering, and would require U.S. taxpayers to report any offshore crypto transactions exceeding $10,000.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday said federal policy on autonomous vehicles will undergo ""meaningful"" developments in the coming years, saying policy frameworks had not fully caught up with technological developments.
Speaking at the South by Southwest music, technology and film festival (SXSW), Buttigieg said regulation had to set boundaries for self-driving without stifling innovation in an industry that ""is still largely in its infancy.""
""It's okay to allow that experimentation to flourish up until and unless we start seeing a real escalation of some of the safety concerns,"" Buttigieg said, adding that limitations on the amount of vehicles each company tests could function as ""speed breaks.""
""I think we're going to see very meaningful developments here in the 2020s,"" Buttigieg said.
Congressional efforts to regulate self-driving cars have been stalled for several years, but U.S. regulators last week eliminated the need for manufacturers to equip fully autonomous vehicles with driving controls like steering wheels and brake pedals.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has released pilot software for what it calls its ""Full Self-Driving"" system to tens of thousands of Tesla owners for use on public roads across the United States.
The system has faced scrutiny from U.S. regulators over deadly crashes and traffic law violations.
Other automakers are more cautious amid the nebulous regulatory terrain. 
Mercedes-Benz AG Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer told Reuters on Tuesday the carmaker ""absolutely"" wants a regulatory framework to protect the company before it releases its hands-free, semi-autonomous driving system in the United States to compete with Tesla's Autopilot.
Buttigieg on Wednesday also said he wanted to improve the U.S. public transit system and encourage Americans to buy electric vehicles through government tax incentives to reduce emissions. 

National U.S. transit use remains some 40% below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from mobility app Transit.
White House efforts to increase current $7,500 EV tax credits to up to $12,500 for union-made U.S. vehicles remain stalled in Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Park Police officer said he was demoted and then fired by the agency because he is Black. A Bureau of Land Management employee accused managers at the agency of hostile treatment because she is Black. A pharmacist at a Washington hospital claimed he was dismissed from his job because he is Black.
Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee to become the first Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, presided as a federal trial court judge in all three of these cases involving claims of racial discrimination. She ruled against all three plaintiffs.
During Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings last year after Biden nominated her to a federal appellate court, Jackson faced Republican questions about whether race plays a role in how she does her job as a judge. She said it does not, though the issue could arise again during her four-day confirmation hearing before the committee beginning on Monday.
Reuters reviewed 25 cases in which Jackson issued substantive rulings as a U.S. district court judge in Washington from 2013 to 2021 involving plaintiffs who made claims of racial discrimination, most involving the workplace. She ruled in favor of plaintiffs in only three of the cases.
Of the 25 cases, 22 were pursued by Black plaintiffs. Jackson ruled against 19 of the Black plaintiffs.
""Plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases lose a lot, so this strikes me as consistent with the pattern I would expect because they are notoriously hard to win,"" said employment law expert Kim Forde-Mazrui, director of the University of Virginia School of Law's Center for the Study of Race and Law. 
In two of the three cases that did not involve Black plaintiffs, Jackson ruled against a white man and an Asian man claiming workplace racial discrimination. 
In the third case, she rejected a challenge by a company that bids on military contracts to the constitutionality of a U.S. law that gives preference for awarding government contracts to small businesses owned by ""socially disadvantaged individuals,"" a category that includes racial minorities.
In one case, Jackson declined to certify racial discrimination claims brought by two Black workers against defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) as a class action that would have involved potentially more than 5,000 employees. Jackson also rejected a $22 million settlement fund that the workers had negotiated with Lockheed, saying it was unclear if the amount was fair to workers who were not involved in the litigation. The case was eventually settled in 2020.
""If people are afraid she is going to be siding with Black plaintiffs because of her race, there are plenty of cases in her record that show she is not unwilling to side against a Black plaintiff if the facts and the law require it,"" said Aron Zavaro, an employment lawyer in the Washington area who has represented plaintiffs in cases against government agencies. 
Zavaro said Jackson's rulings show that she followed Supreme Court precedent in how to analyze cases brought under the federal law that prohibits employment discrimination, a claim that can be difficult to prove because plaintiffs rarely have direct evidence of bias. 
AN EVENLY DIVIDED SENATE
Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate is given the job of confirming a president's judicial nominees. A simple majority vote would be needed for Jackson's confirmation to a lifetime post on America's top judicial body, replacing the retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. 
The Senate is divided 50-50 between the two parties, with Biden's fellow Democrats controlling it because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote. 
The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump, has flexed its muscles by taking up cases that could curb abortion rights, expand gun rights and end affirmative action policies used by universities to increase Black and Hispanic student admissions.
Biden's nomination of Jackson fulfilled his 2020 campaign promise to name the nation's first Black woman justice - a ""long overdue"" milestone, he said - though some Republicans accused him of discriminating against men and non-Black women by refusing to consider any of them for the job.
During an April 2021 confirmation hearing after Biden nominated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, some Republican senators confronted Jackson on race including whether she considers the U.S. justice system racist. 

Republican Senator John Cornyn asked her: ""What role does race play in the kind of judge you have been and the kind of judge you will be?"" 
""I don't think race plays a role in the kind of judge I have been and would be,"" Jackson replied, adding that race ""would be inappropriate to inject"" into her consideration of a case.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had settled the 40 civil cases arising out of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, for $127.5 million.
""This settlement resolves all of the cases,"" the Justice Department said in a statement.
The U.S. government reached the settlement in November with the families of students and faculty who were killed and injured during the shooting, a source told Reuters at the time.
The massacre - the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history - left 17 students and staff members dead.
The accused gunman, former Parkland student Nikolas Cruz, pleaded guilty in a Florida courtroom in October to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Cruz was 19 and an expelled student at the time of the shooting.

Parents of Parkland victims alleged in a 2018 lawsuit that FBI tip line employees acted negligently in their handling of tips regarding Cruz's stated desire to carry out a school shooting and his growing collection of assault-style rifles and ammunition.
Some survivors of the shooting formed a gun safety organization that advocated for stricter firearm controls, including stronger background checks and a ban on the type of assault-style rifle that Cruz had legally purchased.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is a war criminal"" for attacking Ukraine and announced an additional $800 million in security assistance including weapons to take down Russian planes and tanks.
In an exchange with a reporter at the White House, Biden said, ""Oh I think he is a war criminal,"" after initially responding with a ""no"" to a question about whether he was ready to call Putin that. 
That is the first time Biden has publicly branded Putin with that phrase. Last week, during a trip to Poland, Vice President Harris said Russia should ""absolutely"" be investigated for potential war crimes.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart, noting there is a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes, and that that process currently is underway at the State Department. 
Earlier in the day, Biden said the United States has offered Ukraine $1 billion in security aid, addressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's urgent appeal to the U.S. Congress for military help to fend off the Russian invasion. The U.S. will continue to give Ukraine weapons to fight and defend themselves, offer humanitarian relief and support Ukraine's economy with additional financial assistance, he added.
""This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine, and includes 800 anti-aircraft systems,"" Biden said, to halt attacks on Ukrainians by Russian planes and helicopters.
At Zelenskiy's request, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems, Biden said. It will also supply 9,000 anti-armor systems, drones and 7,000 small arms such as machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers that will help civilians fighting to defend their country.
""More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,"" he said. 
The new funds will come from a spending bill Biden signed into law that includes $13.6 billion in new aid to Ukraine. 
In his address to Congress, Zelenskiy compared the attacks in Ukraine to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that pulled the United States into World War Two, and begged lawmakers, and Biden directly, for more help. 
""This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for our life, for an answer to this terror from the whole world. Is this a lot to ask for? To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people?"" Zelenskiy asked through an interpreter. 
""If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,"" he said. ""You know what kind of defense systems we need,"" adding that he knows the United States has them.
Biden has referred to the creation of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as ""World War Three,"" and the Pentagon has refused requests to send fighter jets to Ukraine. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Russia and Ukraine both emphasized newfound scope for compromise as peace talks were set to resume three weeks into a Russian assault that has so far failed to topple the Ukrainian government. 

On Tuesday, the White House said Biden will travel to Brussels for a March 24 NATO summit on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow terms a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.
Biden has ratcheted up sanctions imposed on Russia in recent days. He has called for a suspension of Russia's trading status that affords its exported products lower tariffs in the international arena and announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday said it is time to change the culture and not just U.S. law to stop violence against women as he celebrated expanded protections for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence.
A day earlier, Biden signed a spending bill that included a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which also provides more resources and training programs for law enforcement, among other steps.
Every month, an average of 70 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner in the United States, according to a new report https://everytownresearch.org/report/guns-and-violence-against-women-americas-uniquely-lethal-intimate-partner-violence-problem/#the-nexus-of-intimate-partner-violence-and-guns that claims intimate partner violence and gun violence in the U.S. are inextricably linked. 
Experts say stay-at-home orders linked to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak appear to have contributed to a spike in domestic violence.
""Change the culture, not just the law,"" Biden said at a White House event attended by advocates, survivors of abuse and lawmakers.
""It really wasn't so long ago this country didn't want to talk about violence against women, let alone it being a national epidemic - something government had to address. As a society, we literally looked away.""
Biden said the law will now do more for survivors in rural areas and in underserved communities. For example, tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-native perpetrators of sexual assault and sex trafficking, he said.

As a senator, Biden helped craft the bill, which was originally signed into law in 1994. It expired under then-President Donald Trump in 2019. 
In 2018, the United States was named as the only Western nation among the 10 most dangerous countries for women in a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation survey of global experts, after the #MeToo campaign triggered a flood of complaints about sexual harassment and assault.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the Justice Department to provide former President Donald Trump's adviser Steve Bannon access to certain sensitive internal legal opinions or other related records that could potentially help bolster his defense against criminal contempt of Congress charges.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols told prosecutors they must produce ""statements or writings reflecting official DOJ policy,"" including nonpublic opinions, that relate to ""the department's policy on prosecuting or not prosecuting government or former government officials raising executive privilege claims or defenses of immunity.""
Bannon, a prominent adviser to Trump, is facing criminal charges for defying a subpoena issued by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. His trial is tentatively set to begin on July 18.
He has refused to provide testimony or documents, citing Trump's insistence that the material is protected under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.
As part of his defense, his attorneys hope to argue that Bannon relied on legal advice from his lawyer Robert Costello.
Costello previously advised Bannon that he could not testify or produce records to the House of Representatives Select Committee unless it brokered a deal with Trump or got a federal court to agree to waive executive privilege.
As part of his reasoning, Costello cited a number of prior legal opinions published publicly by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which found that current and former executive branch officials were immune from congressional subpoenas.
During a roughly two-hour hearing on Wednesday, Nichols asked prosecutors skeptical questions about how they were able to rationalize charging Bannon with contempt, given the department had still never withdrawn its public OLC opinions.
""How are those consistent positions?,"" Nichols asked. ""In other words, how can the department ... simultaneously say someone in that position has absolute immunity from showing up and can be prosecuted for failing to show up?""
Amanda Vaughan, one of the prosecutors in the case, said the department's prior OLC opinions are not relevant or analogous to the judge's example.

Although Nichols agreed to grant Bannon's team access to some internal DOJ records, he said he would deny its other requests to access sensitive materials such as testimony that the government provided to the grand jury.
Releasing such records, he said, would be a ""serious step"" and he did not think Bannon's lawyers made a strong argument for why it would be material to their defense.

(Reuters) -U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke on Wednesday with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, warning him of the consequences ""of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"".
A White House statement after the call, the first high-level contact publicly disclosed between the two countries since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, did not specify what those consequences would be.
Washington and its allies have accused Russia of spreading an unproven claim that Ukraine had a biological weapons program as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks.
Russia's defence ministry Tuesday accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in its three-week-old conflict with Ukraine.
""We know for certain that, with the support of Western countries, the SBU (Ukrainian Security Service) is preparing a provocation using poisonous substances against civilians in order to accuse Russia of using chemical weapons against the Ukrainian population,"" the ministry said in a statement carried by the RIA news agency.
Sullivan told Patrushev that if Russia was serious about diplomacy, it should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns, the White House said in the statement.
Sullivan reiterated U.S. opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and told Patrushev that the U.S. would impose costs on Russia for it, the White House said.
Western countries have been swiftly moving to isolate Russia from world trade and the global financial system after its invasion of Ukraine that began in late February. It is Europe's biggest invasion since World War Two and has destroyed some Ukrainian cities and sent more than 3 million refugees fleeing abroad. Moscow has characterized its actions as a ""special military operation.""

The U.S. national security adviser, who was among American officials put on a ""stop list"" on Tuesday that bars them from entering Russia, also mentioned U.S. commitment to reinforce NATO's eastern flank, the White House added.
Earlier in the day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged American lawmakers to do more to protect his country from Russia's invasion in an address before the U.S. Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.
The Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign.
The White House has not said whether Biden supports it. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to say if she supports the measure but said she was reviewing it closely.
Senator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said supporters agreed the change would not take place until November 2023 after input from airlines and broadcasters.
The change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.
""I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,"" Rubio said. ""If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore.""
""Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come,"" he added.
The National Association of Convenience Stores opposes the change, telling Congress this month ""we should not have kids going to school in the dark.""
On Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.
Since 2015, about 30 states have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same. 
The House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue last week, where Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said, ""The loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.""
Pallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.
At the hearing, Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division, argued daylight savings time makes it harder to be alert in the morning, saying it ""is like living in the wrong time zone for almost eight months out of the year.""
Pallone cited a 2019 poll that found 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.
Supporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change. They argue the measure could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.
""It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,"" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.

Daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was used during World War Two and adopted again in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.
The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, dozens of companies said they would suspend political donations to Republican lawmakers who had backed then-President Donald Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election.
More than one year later, Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to challenge the election results have so far collected about half as much corporate cash as they did at this point in the previous election cycle, a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records shows.
By contrast, corporate donations are up about 10% to House Republicans who voted to certify President Joe Biden's victory over Trump.
The results indicate that the corporate boycott is not just limited to the dozens of companies that announced a halt to donations after the attack. Hundreds more have also scaled back their support, the Reuters analysis shows. 
The shift illustrates the growing gulf between business interests and the right wing of the Republican Party, which under Trump's presidency grew more anti-establishment and more open to curbs on global trade and technology that would have been anathema in previous years.
""You've got members that are increasingly unmoored from commercial corporate interests and are more responsive to either a small number of very wealthy, deep-pocketed donors, or a large number of culture war-activated base voters,"" said Jon Lieber, a former staffer for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell now at the Eurasia Group, an analysis firm.
The drop in corporate donations is unlikely to affect Republican prospects in the November congressional elections. The party is favored to win control of the House and possibly the Senate, in part due to Biden's sagging popularity, and because few Republican incumbents face competitive races of their own.
Reuters analyzed the 2021 campaign finance disclosures of 142 House Republicans who are running for re-election in November and were in office throughout the last election cycle. The analysis included both re-election funds and those raised by leadership committees, which lawmakers use to finance other political activities. The analysis focused on the House of Representatives where most Republicans voted against certifying Biden's victory, compared to only eight Republicans in the Senate.
Fundraising by the House Republicans remains robust - about $200 million in 2021. Both objectors and non-objectors to Biden's win brought in more money than in 2019.
Corporate dollars - which don't come directly from company coffers but are contributed by employees to fundraising groups controlled by the corporations - made up about a tenth of that 2021 amount. Their role in campaign finance has diminished over the last decade as the advent of online fundraising has made it easy to solicit donations from rank-and-file voters. 
Lawmakers who objected to Biden's 2020 victory raised around $9 million from corporate groups in 2021, less than half of the roughly $19 million raised in 2019. Corporate money raised by those who did not object rose to about $14 million last year from nearly $13 million in 2019.
NO REGRETS
Even before the Jan. 6 attack, many companies steered clear of some of the most confrontational partisans.
Representative Matt Gaetz, who frequently appeared on cable television to praise Trump, raised only about $30,000 from corporate sources in 2019, out of the $1 million he netted in total.
He took in no money from corporate political action committees (PACs) in 2021 after voting to challenge the election results - but he raised about $4 million overall. His office did not respond to a request for comment.
Others have taken a steeper hit. 
Representative Mike Kelly, a senior member of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, collected about $460,000 in corporate donations in 2019.
But after the Pennsylvania Republican launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn Biden's victory in his state and voted against certifying the election result on Jan. 6, he took in just over $110,000 in corporate donations last year - about 75% less. 
Melanie Brewer, Kelly's campaign manager, said he did not regret his vote.
""While fundraising was difficult for many Republicans in 2021, it was more important that he reflected the values and ideals of his district,"" she said.
The chamber's top two Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, also saw steep drops in their corporate donations after voting against the Jan. 6 results. Neither responded to a request for comment.
However, companies continue to give to Republican election accounts that will help the wider party, helping these accounts keep up with fundraising by Democrats. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $140 million overall in 2021, on par with the $146 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Both groups raised more in 2021 than in 2019.

The drop in corporate support for those who challenged the election masks significant differences among industries.
Eight of the largest corporate donors ahead of the 2020 election have cut off donations entirely to those who challenged the election results, records show. 
Those companies are all in technology, finance or consumer goods - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
All either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment. Most of them announced in early 2021 they were suspending contributions to those who challenged the election results.
Donating to those lawmakers ""could really incite a bunch of their key stakeholders - like employees, suppliers, customers and so on,"" said Russell Crook, an expert on corporate political activity at the University of Tennessee.
Some announced boycotts, only to abandon them.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which did not make any contributions in 2021 to the objectors, gave them $10,000 in January, split between McCarthy, Scalise and two others who voted against accepting the results.
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company changed its stance because it felt it could better advocate for its interests ""by engaging with policymakers from both parties.""
By contrast, many defense contractors, whose profits depend on spending decisions made in Congress, have continued their support of all Republicans, whether or not they challenged the election results. 
Two of them - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) PLC - actually increased their donations to those who voted to challenge the election.
Boeing did not respond to a request for comment and BAE declined to comment.
Rock Holdings Inc, the parent company of mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage, roughly doubled its contribution to objectors in 2021, to at least $97,000. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Boeing, BAE and Rock also increased donations to those who did not object to the election result.

Some Republican lawmakers reacted angrily last year when corporate representatives told them they would not get their support, according to a Republican strategist who directs business donations to lawmakers. 
But those tensions have eased in recent months as Republicans have grown more confident of victory and less interested in picking fights with possible allies, the strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

(Reuters) -Republican lawmakers in Georgia on Tuesday advanced a bill expanding law enforcement's power to investigate election fraud, adding to the push by U.S. conservatives for more restrictive voting laws after former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was rigged.
Georgia's House of Representatives approved the legislation on a largely party-line vote of 98-73, sending it to the state Senate, less than a week after Florida's Republican-controlled legislature passed a measure to create a first-of-its-kind election police force in that state.
Voting rights groups and Democrats in both states say the legislation is intended to appease Trump and his supporters despite the fact that election fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.
They also say the new laws will intimidate voters, particularly people of color, while providing a pretense for politicians to undermine confidence in election outcomes.
""It's just finding a new way to stop people from voting in the same way that has always been done in this country,"" said Stephanie Ali, policy director for the New Georgia Project Action Fund, a voting rights group.
A coalition of organizations, including Fair Fight Action, the voting group founded by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, announced a nearly $1.5 million campaign on Tuesday opposing the Georgia bill.
Georgia and Florida had already passed sweeping voting restrictions last year, part of a wave of such legislation among Republican-controlled states.
Georgia's new measure would grant the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) statutory authority, and subpoena power, to investigate election fraud. Under current law, claims of voting irregularities are initially investigated by the state elections board or the secretary of state's office.
Trump has attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Governor Brian Kemp, both Republicans, for failing to overturn the state's 2020 election results, which Trump falsely says were tainted by fraud. Both incumbents face Republican challengers endorsed by Trump as they seek re-election this year.
Senate approval of Georgia's House-passed bill - both chambers are majority-Republican - would send it to Kemp for his signature or veto. A spokesperson for Kemp said he does not comment on pending legislation.
The chief sponsor of the Georgia bill, Representative James Burchett, insisted the measure was designed mainly to bolster the ""chain of custody"" for ballots and codify safeguards already in place, thus strengthening election integrity.
He added that the GBI ""has been investigating elections for years,"" and that the bill merely allows the agency to open voter fraud inquiries on its own, without a request by the elections board or secretary of state.
OTHER STATES COULD FOLLOW
The new Florida bill creates an Office of Election Crimes and Security under the auspices of the Department of State, part of the executive branch of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis' administration.
In addition, the legislation calls for the governor to appoint sworn officers at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as special agents dedicated to investigating election crimes.
The measure would allow the department to examine a range of potential illegal activities, a Department of State spokesman said, including threats to election officials, forged signatures on petitions, fraudulent registration forms and misuse of mail ballots.
DeSantis, a Trump ally widely seen as a leading presidential contender in 2024, has said the bill would improve public trust in elections.
""Allocating sufficient resources to deter fraud and ensure our election laws are enforced should not be controversial or politicized,"" said DeSantis' press secretary Christina Pushaw. She said the governor plans to sign the bill.
Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley, the incoming president of the state's association of elections supervisors, said the legislation gives credence to the false notion that voter fraud is a serious problem.
""The context is clear – there's a massive disinformation campaign across the nation, and this bill plays right into that,"" Earley said.
Dozens of courts and election officials around the country have concluded that Trump's fraud allegations have no factual basis. But the former president continues to assert that President Joe Biden's 2020 victory was illegitimate, and polls show a significant number of Republicans believe him.
Lawmakers in a handful of other states also have introduced bills to increase investigations of alleged election fraud, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, though prospects for their passage is uncertain.

In Arizona, a Republican lawmaker's proposal to create an election crimes investigatory agency failed to win committee support in time for this year's legislative session.
Some states, such as Texas, have increased prosecution resources for election cases in the absence of new legislation, said Wendy Weiser, who directs the Brennan Center's democracy program.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, a rare show of unity in the deeply divided Congress.
The resolution, introduced by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) and backed by senators of both parties, encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague and other nations to target the Russian military in any investigation of war crimes committed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""All of us in this chamber joined together, with Democrats and Republicans, to say that Vladimir Putin cannot escape accountability for the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.

Russia calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Putin has also called the country a U.S. colony with a puppet regime and no tradition of independent statehood.
Moscow has not captured any of the 10 biggest cities in the country following its incursion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since 1945.

LVIV, Ukraine/KYIV (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will make his first visit to Europe since the invasion of Ukraine to discuss the crisis with NATO allies next week, the White House said on Tuesday as the refugee tally hit 3 million amid more Russian air strikes.
Moscow has not captured any of the 10 biggest cities in the country following its incursion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since 1945. 
Local authorities said Tuesday's bombardments on Kyiv killed at least five people as buildings were set ablaze and people were buried under rubble.
About 2,000 cars left the southern port city of Mariupol, location of the worst humanitarian crisis, the local council said.
Just over 3 million have now fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations, with over 1.8 million arriving in neighbouring Poland. Its prime minister and those of Slovenia and the Czech Republic were in Kyiv on Tuesday to show solidarity. 
NATO leaders will meet at the military alliance's headquarters in Brussels on March 24 to discuss the crisis that has prompted fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
""We will address Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO's deterrence & defence,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Biden will be in attendance, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. 
""His goal is to meet in person face-to-face and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict,"" she said. 
Asked if Biden would also visit Poland, do something tied to Ukrainian refugees or meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Psaki declined to comment, saying trip details were still being worked out.
Russia calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has also called its neighbour a U.S. colony with a puppet regime and no tradition of independent statehood.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine via a video link resumed on Tuesday. Ukrainian officials played up hopes the war could end sooner than expected, saying Moscow may be coming to terms with its failure to impose a new government by force.
In a hint of a possible compromise, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was prepared to accept security guarantees from the West that stop short of its long-term objective of joining NATO. Moscow sees any future Ukraine membership of the Western alliance as a threat and has demanded guarantees it will never join.
""If we cannot enter through open doors, then we must cooperate with the associations with which we can, which will help us, protect us ... and have separate guarantees,"" said Zelenskiy. 
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was too early to predict progress in the talks. ""The work is difficult, and in the current situation the very fact that (the talks) are continuing is probably positive,"" he said.
The crisis is being felt in the form of spiralling energy costs in many Western countries with some heavily reliant on exports from Russia and after a U.S. ban on imports of oil from the country. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits the Middle East on Wednesday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed in the United Arab Emirates before seeing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia in efforts to secure more oil flows. 
""We will work with them to ensure regional security, support the humanitarian relief effort and stabilise global energy markets for the longer term,"" said Johnson.
FORK IN THE ROAD?
In Kyiv, around half of the 3.4 million residents have fled and some spend nights sheltering in metro stations.
Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that 97 children had died so far in the invasion. Hundreds of civilians have been killed. 
On the Romanian border, a woman named Tanya said she had fled the southern frontline town of Mykolaiv to save her child. ""Because the people that are there now are Russians, Russian soldiers, and they kill children.""
A convoy with supplies for Mariupol, where residents have been sheltering from repeated Russian bombardments and are desperate for food and water, was stuck at nearby Berdyansk, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.
Fox News said a second journalist working for the cable network was killed in Ukraine in the same incident in which a Fox cameraman died when their vehicle was struck on Monday by incoming fire. 
But one of Zelenskiy's top aides predicted the war would be over by May or even within weeks as Russia had run out of fresh troops.
""We are at a fork in the road now,"" Oleksiy Arestovich said in a video. He said he expected either a peace deal within one or two weeks or another Russian attempt with new reinforcements, which could prolong the conflict for another month.
At the United Nations, Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow would end what it calls its ""special military operation"" when its goals were achieved, including demilitarisation.
LUXURY SANCTIONS
In Rivne in western Ukraine, officials said 19 people had been killed in a Russian air strike on a TV tower. If confirmed it would be the worst attack on a civilian target so far in the northwest where Russian ground troops have yet to tread.
Russia denies targeting civilians.
More than 100 buses carrying a few thousand civilians left the besieged northeastern city of Sumy in a ""safe passage"" operation, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday. They were heading towards Lubny in central Ukraine after Russians gave a green light for the evacuation.
Russia said it now controlled the Kherson region in southern Ukraine. Reuters could not independently verify the report.
The conflict has brought economic isolation upon Russia.
The United States, the European Union and Britain announced further sanctions on Tuesday, while Moscow retaliated by putting Biden and other U.S. officials on a ""stop list"" that bars them from entering Russia.

The latest EU sanctions include bans on energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow, and imports of steel products from Russia.
They also freeze the assets of more business leaders believed to support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday announced moves to close gender and racial wage gaps, and boost pay equity for new federal workers and employees of federal contractors.
The White House made the announcements to mark Equal Pay Day, which draws attention to gender-based pay disparities.
""Gender equality is not a women's issue. It benefits everybody,"" Biden said in a room filled with nearly 400 women - the largest indoor gathering at the White House since he took office.
Among the steps taken was an executive order signed by Biden, which limits the use of salary history in employment decisions by federal contractors. The Office of Personnel Management also began work to address the use of salary history in the hiring and pay-setting process for federal employees.
On average, women who work full-time make just 83 cents for every dollar that a man makes, Vice President Harris said earlier in the day. The gap is even wider for women of color, she said. Over a 40-year career, a woman will lose out on about $400,000 and that wage gap is closer to $1 million for women of color, she added.
""Lower wages mean working women have less money - less money to save today. And lower wages mean they receive lower social security benefits in their senior years,"" Harris said.

Current and former members of the U.S. women's national soccer team, who reached a $24 million agreement last month on an equal pay dispute with U.S. Soccer, joined the president at the White House event on Tuesday.
The dispute, which dated back to a March 2019 gender-discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, was resolved with both parties agreeing to equal rates of pay for the women's and men's national teams.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate voted 57 to 40 on Tuesday to overturn a 13-month-old public health order requiring masks on airplanes and other forms of public transportation, drawing a quick veto threat from President Joe Biden.
Last week, the White House said it would extend the current COVID-19 mask requirements at airports, train stations, ride share vehicles and other transit modes through April 18 but pledged a new review. The order was set to expire on Friday.
The mandate has drawn significant opposition from Republicans who note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that 98% of Americans live in places where it is safe to ditch indoor masks.
Republican Senator Rand Paul, who led the repeal effort, said the vote ""sent a message to unelected government bureaucrats to stop the anti-science, nanny state requirement of travel mask mandates.""
The CDC order said the mask mandate could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in crowded transport settings.
The repeal vote fell shy of the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a Biden veto. The White House said Tuesday ""circumstances under which masks should be required in these settings should be guided by science, not politics.""
Eight Democrats joined all but one Republican - Senator Mitt Romney - in voting to reject the rule.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said the vote was dangerous because it would not only bar the existing CDC order but prevent the agency from imposing future mask rules.
He noted the COVID upsurge in China and parts of Europe and asked what happens if the United States faced a new variant. ""Wouldn't we want the CDC to have the power immediately upon an upsurge of COVID nationally to impose a mask requirement on transportation?"" Kaine asked.
Airlines and travel groups have called for a repeal.
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on U.S. airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,800 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules.

The CDC transit order has been in place since soon after Biden took office in January 2021. His predecessor Donald Trump had rejected it.
Last month, the CDC said it would no longer require masks on buses or vans operated by public or private school systems. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are allowed to remove masks briefly to eat or drink.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -With Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrawing her nomination to become the Federal Reserve's regulation chief on Tuesday, the White House may be forced to opt for a new moderate candidate or leave the post open for the foreseeable future.
Raskin told President Joe Biden in a letter that she no longer wanted to be considered for the role, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Her decision came one day after centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support her for the powerful role overseeing Wall Street banks due to worries she would discourage them from lending to oil and gas companies.
The announcement effectively ended her chances, amid unified Republican opposition to her nomination in the Senate, where each party holds 50 seats.
With Raskin out, Biden will have to find a pick palatable to both moderate Democrats and progressives, a tough task. 
""If the White House decides to find another nominee for the supervision post, we presume it will be someone who's viewed as more moderate,"" Ian Katz, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, wrote on Monday. 
Raskin, a former senior Fed and Treasury official, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. 
Other names for the role previously in the mix: Treasury Undersecretary Nellie Liang; Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic; Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu; and Richard Cordray, who was head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration and who now oversees student loans.
Mary Miller, a former Treasury undersecretary who until recently was an administrative official at Johns Hopkins University, is a new potential candidate, Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG, wrote in a note on Monday.
Bostic and Cordray did not immediately comment. Miller could not immediately be reached for comment. Spokespeople for Liang and Hsu declined to comment. 
SETBACKS FOR PROGRESSIVES
Raskin was backed by progressives eager for tougher Wall Street oversight, including Senator Elizabeth Warren. But the energy industry staunchly opposed the nomination based on comments Raskin had made suggesting financial regulators should more aggressively police financial institutions on climate change-related financial risk. 
Raskin's exit is a win for the oil and gas lobby, but it is unlikely to fundamentally alter the central bank's regulatory agenda with more Democrats poised to become Fed governors. Raskin's withdrawal should clear the way for two other Democrats, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, to be voted through.
""This should not change the risk that the big banks face from Team Biden taking control of the Federal Reserve ... The plan going forward is the same,"" wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, although others cautioned it would delay that agenda.
Biden also has nominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell to another four-year term as head of the central bank. Powell is widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate, where he has bipartisan support.
Raskin is the second Biden banking regulatory pick to falter in the Senate. Saule Omarova, an academic and progressive favorite tapped by Biden to become comptroller of the currency, withdrew last year after failing to win over moderate Democrats. 
Despite these defeats, it was unclear if progressives and moderates could unite behind any of the candidates in the mix. 
Another option for the White House would be to leave the seat open and have other Fed governors act as the de facto regulation lead, the approach adopted by former President Barack Obama's administration. 
Cook and Jefferson could become members of the Fed's Committee on Supervision and Regulation and lead it on an interim basis, Boltansky said. Others said Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a Democrat who Biden has nominated for the central bank's vice chair role, could informally lead the regulation file.

Some Republicans have said they may not back Brainard, although Democrats are united in their support of her.
""Brainard is experienced in these issues, which means her influence will be felt widely at the Fed,"" Seiberg wrote.

168,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 03:46PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday made light of Russia's retaliatory sanctions against U.S. officials, saying Moscow may have inadvertently sanctioned the deceased father of Joe Biden by omitting the suffix ""junior"" from the spelling of the U.S. president's name. 
Russia said on Tuesday it had placed Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA chief William Burns, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and a handful of other U.S. officials on a ""stop list"" that bars them from entering the country.
""President Biden is a junior so they may have sanctioned his dad, may he rest in peace"" Psaki said. ""None of us are planning tourist trips to Russia, none of us have bank accounts that we won't be able to access, so we will forge ahead,"" she added.

Aimed at retaliating against U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the move appeared largely symbolic, since Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was maintaining official relations and if necessary would make sure that high-level contacts with the listed individuals could take place.
""I think we are confident that if we need to have ... direct and indirect conversations with Russia we will be able to do that.""

MIAMI (Reuters) -A U.S. magistrate judge in Miami on Tuesday ordered former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio be detained while he awaits trial on charges stemming from the riots at the U.S. Capitol, a Justice Department spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington, D.C. confirmed.
The ruling came a day after federal prosecutors filed a motion asking the judge to detain Tarrio, saying he poses a flight risk and also a risk of obstructing justice in the case.
In a 21-page court filing on Monday, the Justice Department said it had damning encrypted messages between Tarrio and other Proud Boys who were invited to participate in a new chapter Tarrio created in December 2020 called the ""Ministry of Self Defense"" or ""MOSD.""
Following the hearing, Tarrio's attorney Nayib Hassan told reporters outside the courtroom that Tarrio left Washington, D.C. on Jan. 5, 2021 - a day before the attack on the Capitol.
""It's our estimation as far as what we have reviewed right now that the evidence is weak,"" Hassan said. 
Tarrio, 38, is among the most high-profile of more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the assault on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump in an effort to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory.
Police arrested Tarrio on Jan. 4, 2021, for burning a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic African-American church in December 2020, a charge for which he later served four months in jail.
Prosecutors said Tarrio maintained an active leadership role behind the scenes on Jan. 6, forcefully telling his followers on social media not to leave the Capitol, and later, in the encrypted chat, telling them: ""We did this.""
Hassan said more than nine Tarrio family members and friends were present at Tuesday's detention hearing in Miami, which was held in-person, to show their support for his client, and they also offered to put up bond to have him released.

He said that since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Tarrio has posed ""no danger to the community whatsoever,"" but the judge in Miami disagreed.
Hassan said Tarrio will appear in court again in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.

The White House will open for tours starting April 15 two days a week, it said in a statement, adding that masks are optional and those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus or are otherwise possibly ill should not attend. 
Congress is also weighing a phased reopening starting March 28 and moving toward a full reopening by Sept. 5, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed source.
The moves this spring come as U.S. COVID-19 cases continue to decline following the Omicron variant-driven spike, even as mounting cases in Europe and China have raised some concerns about the potential for another wave.
""The White House will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation with guidance based on recommendations from the CDC, and other public health officials and medical experts,"" and will ""adjust availability ... as necessary,"" it said.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Monday acknowledged likely ""fluctuation"" in U.S. cases, while the White House separately on Tuesday sought more U.S. funding to manage current cases and bolster the nation's long-term preparedness, including for future variants.
""We have made tremendous progress in our fight against COVID-19 but our work isn't done,"" Biden tweeted on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said on Tuesday that new requirements mandating broadcasters disclose when foreign governments or their representatives lease time on their airwaves take effect today.
The FCC unanimously adopted the new rules in April 2021. The commission said the new rules are effective immediately for new leasing agreements and need to be implemented within about six months for existing agreements. 
The rules require disclosure at the time of a broadcast if a foreign governmental entity paid a radio or television station, directly or indirectly, to air material. Prior rules do not specify when and how foreign government sponsorship should be publicly disclosed.
The issue has taken on new urgency in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said Tuesday that ""in light of recent events, this effort — which is all about transparency — has taken on new importance. It is essential that audiences know when a broadcast station has been compensated to air content coming from a foreign government.""
Last year, Rosenworcel said commission reports of foreign government-sponsored programming had multiplied in recent years.
""We know that foreign entities are purchasing time on broadcast stations in markets across the country, including Chinese government-sponsored programming and Russian government-sponsored programming right here in our nation's capital,"" she said in April 2021.

Russian media outlet RT America told employees this month it was ending production and laying off most staff, according to a memo reported by CNN. 
Earlier this month, DirecTV, the largest satellite provider in the United States, said it was planning to drop RT America in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the biggest Democratic Party fundraising groups on Monday said it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing Donald Trump of breaking campaign finance law by spending political donations on a 2024 U.S. presidential bid he has yet to formally launch.
The complaint by the American Bridge group says Trump's Save America fund is promoting him as if he were a candidate. 
As a leadership committee, the Save America fund can pay for such political activities as Trump's travel, hotel stays and contributions to political allies. But by law Trump's leadership committee is not allowed to fund his own election campaigns.
Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich called the American Bridge complaint ""frivolous"" and said it had ""zero merit.""
It was unclear whether the Federal Election Commission will do anything to hinder Trump's use of his Save America fund. The commission leadership includes three Republicans, two Democrats and an independent. It often deadlocks on contentious issues.
A spokesperson for the FEC said it cannot comment on a complaint until the matter is resolved or closed. 
The Republican Trump launched his Save America fund days after losing the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden. 

The group, which is a leading Republican fundraising organization with more than $100 million in the bank, has paid for rallies where Trump appears with candidates he has endorsed but also regularly hints at the possibility of running again.
""In 2024 we are going to take back that beautiful White House. I wonder who will do that. I wonder, I wonder,"" Trump said at a South Carolina rally on Saturday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Forty-nine of the 50 Republican U.S. senators said on Monday they will not back an emerging new nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, underscoring their party's opposition to attempts to revive a 2015 accord amid fears talks might collapse.
Citing press reports about a new deal, which has yet to be finalized and could be torpedoed by Russian opposition, the lawmakers said in a statement that Democratic President Joe Biden's administration might reach a deal to weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.
They pledged to do everything in their power to reverse an agreement that does not ""completely block"" Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon, constrain its ballistic missile program and ""confront Iran's support for terrorism."" 
Tehran denies it has ever sought atomic bombs.
Senator Rand Paul was the only Republican member of the Senate who did not sign Monday's statement. In an emailed statement, he said: “Condemning a deal that is not yet formulated is akin to condemning diplomacy itself, not a very thoughtful position.""
No congressional Republicans supported the 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and major powers, reached under Democratic President Barack Obama, which curbed Iran's uranium enrichment program in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran. A handful of Democrats also objected.
The 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) gives Congress the right to review an agreement, but lawmakers are unlikely to be able to kill a deal outright after failing to do so in 2015 when Republicans controlled Congress.
Democrats now hold slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate and are unlikely to turn against Biden in sufficient numbers to stop a major initiative like an Iran deal.
The 2015 accord made it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons. It fell apart after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018.
Talks resumed after Biden became president last year.

Attempts to clinch a new deal were left in limbo after a last-minute demand by Russia - at odds with the West over its invasion of Ukraine - forced the powers to pause talks in Vienna despite having a largely completed text.
A spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said on Monday that Washington needed to make a decision to wrap up a deal.

""The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin's cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine,"" they wrote on Monday.
Zelenskiy has sought to drum up support for Ukraine with video briefings of foreign audiences that have included the U.S. Congress and the British parliament. Zelenskiy will speak at 9 a.m (1300 GMT) on Wednesday to U.S. lawmakers.
More than 280 members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives took part in a video call with Zelenskiy on March 5 in which he is said to have made a ""desperate plea"" for aircraft to fight Russian invaders.
On Tuesday, he is scheduled to address the Canadian parliament and is also due to address Israel's parliament at some point.
The Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress approved $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine on Thursday as part of a $1.5 trillion spending bill that funds U.S. government operations through Sept. 30.

The United States, along with its allies, has imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. On Friday, President Joe Biden took more steps to punish Russia economically, targeting trade and shutting down development funds while also announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds.
Zelenskiy on Friday asked Biden in a phone call to broaden the U.S. economic campaign against Russia, telling him that more should be done to cut off Russia from international trade, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the call.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine has opened a new front in the U.S. Republican Party's civil war, with party primary candidates vying to run in the November midterm elections attacking each other for past comments praising Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In Senate and House of Representatives races in at least three states, Republican candidates have been put on the defensive over comments describing Putin as intelligent, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a ""thug"" and Ukraine as not worth defending. They now face criticism at a time when U.S. public opinion strongly supports Ukraine and its president.
Pat McCrory, a leading Republican Senate candidate in North Carolina's May 17 primary election, lashed out this week at his Trump-backed Republican rival, Representative Ted Budd, in his first TV ad. 
""While Ukrainians bled and died ... Congressman Budd excused their killer,"" McCrory says in the ad, which is interspersed with video clips from a TV interview showing Budd describing Putin as ""a very intelligent actor"" with ""strategic reasons"" for the invasion. 
The ad also accused Budd, who has described Putin as ""evil,"" of casting votes ""friendly"" to Russia. 
Budd's campaign dismissed the McCrory ad in a statement, saying, ""Ted Budd presented the sort of level-headed assessment of a foreign crisis you would expect from a U.S. Senator because he knows these are serious times that require strength and substance, not the empty soundbites.""
Before Russian forces moved on Ukraine on Feb. 24, some Republicans felt comfortable echoing former President Donald Trump's praise for Putin as a strong leader, while denouncing U.S. policy toward Moscow. 
Even after the invasion, two Trump allies in the House - Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar - participated in a white nationalist conference at which participants applauded Russia's move on Ukraine and chanted Putin's name.
Infighting over Putin and Ukraine has exacerbated existing divisions within the party over Trump's false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020, and a House investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by the former president's supporters. 
Trump has been widely criticized for describing Putin's actions toward Ukraine as ""genius"" and ""pretty savvy"" in a Feb. 22 interview. 
ATTACK AD
Also in North Carolina, Representative Madison Cawthorn came under fire from his Republican rivals over remarks at a town hall in which he criticized Zelenskiy and Ukraine. 
""Remember that Zelenskiy is a thug. Remember the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies,"" Cawthorn said in a video clip aired by WRAL-TV in Raleigh.
""ITS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS WOULD CALL UKRAINES PRESIDENT A THUG!"" tweeted Michele Woodhouse, who is challenging Cawthorn in the Republican primary.
Cawthorn's office did not respond to a Reuters query seeking comment.
The Republicans are vying to become candidates at the November midterm elections in which control of the U.S. Congress is at stake.
In Utah, independent Senate candidate Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer, attacked Republican Senator Mike Lee in an ad accusing the two-term incumbent of ""making us weak and unsafe"" in the midst of the current Ukraine crisis by opposing sanctions against Russia and visiting Moscow.

But the actions cited in the ad occurred years before the Ukraine invasion or were mischaracterized, according to the fact-checking website PolitiFact, which judged the ad ""mostly false."" 
Lee's office did not respond to a Reuters query seeking comment. But McMullin's campaign said it stood behind the ad and insisted that Lee has displayed a pattern of appeasing Putin.

(Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden said unaccompanied migrant children will continue to not be expelled from the United States under a border policy put in place by former President Donald Trump, in a bid to counter a court challenge to the current practice.
""The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) director is terminating with respect to unaccompanied noncitizen children an Order under Title 42 suspending the right to introduce certain persons into the United States"", the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said early on Saturday.
""In effect, this means that unaccompanied noncitizen children will not be expelled from the United States under CDC's order.""
The Title 42 order was issued by the CDC in March 2020 at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed U.S. authorities to rapidly expel migrant families caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without a chance to seek refuge in the United States. 
Since it went into effect, migrants have been turned away more than 1.6 million times under the policy, though some of those encounters were people crossing multiple times.
In a separate 21-page order justifying the decision to end Title 42 for unaccompanied children, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky cited the recent nationwide decrease in COVID-19 cases and increased vaccination rates in the United States and in the countries of migrants who journey to the southern border. 
Early in his presidency, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the expulsion policy, but a federal judge in Texas ruled on March 4 that minors could not be excluded in a case brought by the state of Texas against the administration.

The Texas ruling, which is at odds with another U.S. district court order in 2020 blocking expulsions of unaccompanied children, has put pressure on the administration to consider whether to roll back the order entirely.

The latest announcement comes a day after the Hollywood Reporter published a letter by LGBTQ+ employees and their allies within Disney TV Animation criticizing Chapek as ""tone-deaf"" for his initial messaging on the bill.
Disney has been under fire for failing to take a public stand against the measure, which opponents of the legislation say will harm the lesbian, gay, transgender and queer community. The company employs more than 65,000 people at the sprawling Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World resort in Orlando.
""Speaking to you, reading your messages, and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,"" Chapek wrote. ""It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights. You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.""
The Florida Senate passed the legislation Tuesday which would prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in the state's primary schools, but also prohibits teachings ""not age appropriate"" for other grades. 
The measure, which its opponents labeled the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, passed the state House last month and is headed to Governor Ron DeSantis for approval. DeSantis has indicated his support for the measure.
Employees joined with advocacy groups such as Color of Change in calling on Disney to withdraw funding from politicians who support the Florida bill. 
Chapek thanked the company's employees for ""sharing your pain, frustration and sadness"" over the company’s response. ""I missed the mark in this case,"" he wrote to employees. ""But am an ally you can count on — and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility, and opportunity you deserve.""
Disney pledged to increase support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states. It also is re-examining its political contributions.

Benjamin Siemon, a Disney animation writer who had publicly criticized the company's actions, applauded Chapek on Friday for responding to employee concerns.
""I want to thank Bob Chapek for taking this step,"" Siemon wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We have more to do as a company in helping make Disney a place the LGBTQIA+ community can be proud of again but it's a start.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Donald Trump cannot sue E. Jean Carroll, a writer who says he raped her in the mid-1990s, on the grounds that her defamation lawsuit against him violated a New York state law intended to protect free speech, a federal judge ruled on Friday.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan accused the former U.S. president of ""bad faith"" by needlessly delaying the former Elle magazine columnist's lawsuit, which began in November 2019 and could have ""long ago"" been decided.
""The defendant's litigation tactics, whatever their intent, have delayed the case to an extent that readily could have been far less,"" Kaplan wrote.
Letting Trump countersue ""would make a regrettable situation worse by opening new avenues for significant further delay,"" he added. Kaplan also said it would be ""futile"" for Trump to prove that his counterclaim belonged in federal court.
Alina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said: ""While we are disappointed with the court's decision today, we eagerly look forward to litigating this action and proving at trial that the plaintiff's claims have absolutely no basis in law or in fact.""
Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll and not related to the judge, said she and her client ""could not agree more"" that the case should be over by now.
Carroll, 78, accused Trump in a June 2019 book excerpt of raping her in late 1995 or early 1996 in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in midtown Manhattan.
She said Trump defamed her when he told a reporter he did not know Carroll, accused her of concocting the rape claim to sell her book and said, ""She's not my type."" 
'FUTILE' TO COUNTERSUE 
In seeking a dismissal and damages, Trump invoked New York's ""anti-SLAPP"" law, short for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation.""
The November 2020 law had been meant to protect journalists and others from deep-pocketed companies and people who file frivolous lawsuits designed to silence critics.
Trump said Carroll's lawsuit also violated that law because it was meant to harass him for speaking out.
But the judge said Trump offered ""no satisfactory justification"" for waiting 14 months after the law took effect to invoke it.
Trump is awaiting a decision from the federal appeals court in Manhattan on whether he is immune from Carroll's lawsuit under a law shielding federal employees from defamation claims, because he discussed her in his capacity as president.
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration sided with Trump in that appeal, despite what it called the Republican's ""crude and offensive comments"" over Carroll's ""very serious"" accusations.
Carroll's lawyers are hoping to compare Trump's DNA with a dress Carroll said she wore during the alleged rape. 

They also wanted to question Trump under oath, but citing Trump's delays, said last month this was no longer necessary.
The case is Carroll v Trump, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-07311.

The move impacts just a fraction of U.S. imports, but it targets iconic Russian goods including vodka and caviar. Biden also called on lawmakers to strip the country of its preferred trading status during Friday remarks at the White House.
The U.S. imports around $24.1 million in beverages, spirits and vinegar annually from Russia. Most Russian-branded vodkas are produced in other nations, including Latvian-made Stoli, which was rebranded from Stolichnaya earlier this month in response to the Ukraine invasion.
But the U.S. imported $1.2 billion in Russian seafood last year. The Kremlin has accused the U.S. and its allies of waging economic war against Russia.
The seafood and alcohol announcement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Here is a summary of the 2,700-page bill:
UKRAINE AID
The bill includes $13.6 billion for ammunition and other military supplies for Ukraine to fight the invasion by Russia, as well as humanitarian support.
NO COVID AID
The legislation does not include $15.6 billion requested by Biden to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as his fellow Democrats could not agree on how it would be distributed. Democrats are expected to continue efforts to approve this aid, which would be used for research and vaccine stockpiles.
INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY
The package includes spending increases for roads, bridges and other elements of Biden's signature $1 trillion infrastructure package. Congress approved the package back in November 2021, but much of the money could not actually go out the door until the broader spending bill was passed.
U.S. MILITARY 
The bill increases U.S. defense spending to $782 billion, a 5.6% increase over current levels.
DOMESTIC SPENDING
The bill boosts spending on nondefense programs by 6.7% to $730 billion. It includes substantial increases for scientific research into climate change and diseases like cancer and diabetes, as well as antipoverty food and housing programs. 
It also includes the largest increases in more than a decade for college tuition and aid to schools that serve low-income children, according to Democrats.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
The bill also includes a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which provides services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. 

VISA REFORM
The legislation resurrects the EB-5 visa program, which provides residency permits to foreigners who invest in high-poverty areas. The program expired last year amid concerns about fraud. It now includes reforms meant to prevent abuses.

Pagán, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico, spent almost three decades as a trade lawyer in the U.S. government and served as the deputy general counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative before her nomination.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said Pagán was well-suited for the role given her experience in trade.

(Reuters) - Black people, Latinos and Native Americans were undercounted during the 2020 national census, new U.S. Census Bureau data showed, potentially affecting political representation and federal funding for communities with significant minority populations.
The once-a-decade national population count is used to draw both U.S. congressional and state legislative seats in each state, as well as to help distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds for everything from public housing to Medicare to highway construction.
Thursday's report from the Census Bureau relied on statistical analyses to test the accuracy of the census results. The census has overcounted white people while undercounting people of color for decades, but those trends accelerated during the 2020 census, the report showed.
The net count of the Latino population was likely 5% too low, more than three times the undercount estimated for the 2010 census, the bureau said. Black people had a net undercount of more than 3%, while Native Americans and Native Alaskans on reservations were undercounted by more than 5%, both more than in 2010.
Non-Hispanic white people and Asians were overcounted, the bureau said.
Advocacy groups warned the undercounts would deprive disadvantaged communities of the resources they need most.
""Many of the federal programs are designed to help the most vulnerable populations - children, people who are low-income - and those are precisely the people the census bureau counted less well in 2020,"" said Arturo Vargas, chief executive of the NALEO Educational Fund, which promotes Latino political participation.
Robert Santos, the Census Bureau's director, acknowledged the undercounts at a news conference but said the overall data was ""consistent with recent censuses"" and could be relied upon for ""many uses.""
The analysis found the national count of 323.2 million was largely accurate.
The 2020 census faced several challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the bureau to suspend its door-to-door operations temporarily and may have made some households more reluctant to speak to interviewers.
Civil rights groups and demographics experts also said failed efforts by the Trump administration to ask census respondents whether they were U.S. citizens and to exclude illegal immigrants from census counts may have dissuaded Latino populations from responding.
""Overall, the numbers released today show that the 2020 census suffered from the same problems that previous censuses have,"" Kelly Percival, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said in an interview. ""You can't have an accurate census without having an equitable census.""

The census results published last year showed an increasingly diverse nation, with the non-Hispanic white population declining for the first time in history.
The data released on Thursday included only national estimates. A more detailed state-level analysis is expected this summer.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday offered U.S. support to calls for an international war crimes investigation into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, noting the United Nations had already started a process to review allegations.
""Absolutely there should be an investigation and we should all be watching and I have no question that the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities,"" Harris told a news conference in Warsaw after meeting Polish leaders to discuss next steps against Russia.
Harris cited examples including the bombing of a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol on Wednesday, and scenes of bloodied pregnant women being evacuated.
Russia, which calls its actions a special military operation to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls neo-Nazis, has denied targetting civilians. Russia on Thursday shifted its stance over the bombing of the hospital, with a mix of statements that veered between strong denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts.
Polish President Andrzej Duda, who spoke alongside Harris, labelled Russia's actions in Ukraine ""barbarism bearing the features of genocide."" 
Harris' visit came amid a rift between Washington and Warsaw over supplying warplanes to Ukraine.
The United States on Tuesday rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force.
The United States and its allies are eager to help Ukraine but are wary of any step that might draw them into direct conflict with Russia.
""We are ready to give our equipment for free, but we want the decision to be made by the alliance together,"" Duda said.
Duda also urged more help to house and feed Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, and said he had asked Harris that Washington speed up the process for refugees who sought to go to the United States and might have family there.
Around 1.43 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the invasion began on Feb. 24, the Polish Border Guard said on Thursday. In total, more than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine as of March 10, according to the U.N. migration agency IOM.

Harris met with seven refugees who have fled to Poland to hear about their experiences.
She also held talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and is due to meet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is also visiting Warsaw.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday said the Justice Department will not shy away from controversial or politically sensitive cases, apparently responding to critics who want criminal charges against former President Donald Trump and his allies.
Garland, a day before his first anniversary as the top U.S. law enforcement official, addressed the issue in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting with senior department officials.
""We do not shy from cases that are controversial, or sensitive or political,"" Garland said, without mentioning specific investigations. ""We treat like cases alike, without regard to the subject matter. What we will avoid and what we must avoid is any partisan element of our decision-making about cases.""
The House of Representatives select committee investigating last year's Capitol attack by Trump supporters seeking to block formal congressional certification of his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden accused the former president last week of illegal conduct. In what may be a prelude to formally asking the Justice Department to bring changes, the panel said in a court filing Trump potentially engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the United States and may have obstructed an official proceeding.
The Justice Department already has charged more than 775 people, including the leaders of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. 
None of Trump's close allies have been charged directly in connection with the attack, though his former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is facing misdemeanor charges of obstructing the committee's investigation by refusing to testify or provide records.

Garland also has confirmed that the National Archives has informed the department that Trump took classified materials with him down to his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House. Garland has stopped short of confirming whether the department will investigate the matter.
Some congressional Democrats have painted Garland as too timid. For instance, U.S. Representative Ruben Gallego in January called Garland ""extremely weak"" and said that more of the Jan. 6 organizers should be arrested.

Washington's Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board said in a letter on Monday that Jan. 6 was the ""sole and direct cause"" of Metropolitan police officer Jeffrey Smith's suicide, the newspaper reported. 
His widow Erin Smith fought for a year for the board to reverse an earlier decision denying her late husband's death was in the line of duty. 
The latest ruling allows her to receive a yearly annuity equal to her husband's salary. It also opens the possibility for a memorial service to be held for him at the Capitol Rotunda and other honors typically bestowed to officers who died while on duty, the Post reported.
Medical reports submitted to the board said Smith lost consciousness after he was struck in the head during the riot. He later exhibited ""mood and behavioral changes"" that led to his suicide, the newspaper reported, citing the reports. 
""Officer Jeffrey Smith would still be alive today if he hadn’t risked his life to defend all of us at the U.S. Capitol and our democracy itself on January 6th,"" U.S. Representative Don Beyer, who represents Smith’s district in Congress, said in a statement. 
Smith was one of four Metropolitan police officers who have died by suicide after guarding the building that day. 
Hundreds of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building that day in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election win.
Four people died on the day of the violence.

A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. More than 100 police officers were injured.
The mayhem led to Trump's second impeachment. More than 500 people have been arrested for their roles in the violence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to rush $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine as it battles invading Russian forces, along with $1.5 trillion to keep U.S. government programs operating through Sept. 30 and avoid agency shutdowns this weekend.
The House approved the wide-ranging appropriations in bipartisan votes, sending the legislation to the Senate which aims to act by a midnight Friday deadline when existing U.S. government funds expire.
The aid for Ukraine is intended to help bolster its military as it battles Russian forces and provide humanitarian assistance to citizens, including an estimated 1.5 million refugees already seeking safety abroad.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that the $13.6 billion is likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort.
""All of us will have to do more"" to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long-term to help it rebuild, Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference.
She was mainly referring to the United States and its NATO allies.
The House also passed legislation, by a vote of 414-17 to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil and other energy in response to its attack on Ukraine. Fifteen Republicans and two Democrats opposed the measure.
Passage of the bill came one day after President Joe Biden used his executive powers to impose such a ban. The House measure put lawmakers on record as firmly supporting the U.S. trade ban. It also calls for reviewing Russia's participation in some international trade programs, such as the World Trade Organization.
Lawmakers abandoned an effort to attach language revoking Russia's permanent normal trade relations status, which would have allowed the United States to raise tariffs on Russian imports above levels afforded all WTO members.
The U.S. government funding bill passed following a revolt from Pelosi's own Democrats who objected to a $15.6 billion COVID-19 aid initiative because of the way it would have parceled out money to individual states. The money was to be used for research and to stockpile vaccines for possible future spikes in COVID-19 infections.
Following hours of delay, Pelosi had the provision deleted to clear the way for quick passage of the Ukraine money and the ""omnibus"" $1.5 trillion in federal funding.
Democrats hope to revisit the COVID aid next week in separate legislation.
'DESPERATE HOUR'
The huge government spending bill is the first to reflect Democrats' spending priorities under President Joe Biden, following four years of the Trump administration.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro said it increases non-defense domestic spending by 6.7% over last year, the largest rise in four years.
The Ukraine aid package, DeLauro said, would ""help the Ukrainian people in their most desperate hour of need.""
Republicans also applauded the measure - a rare display of bipartisanship in the deeply divided Congress. 
""We must get this bill to the president's desk as soon as possible to respond to these acts of aggression,"" said Ken Calvert, the top Republican on the defense subcommittee of the appropriations panel. 
He was referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and specifically the bombing of a hospital earlier on Wednesday. Failure, he added, ""would undoubtedly demonstrate weakness on a global scale."" 
With money for the federal government due to run out at midnight on Friday, the Democratic-controlled House also unanimously approved a separate measure to keep the government funded through Tuesday.
This was seen mainly as a housekeeping step so that congressional clerks would have enough time to process the sprawling omnibus bill following House and Senate passage. That clerical work could extend beyond the midnight Friday deadline.
Acting White House budget director Shalanda Young urged Congress to promptly approve the Ukraine aid and government funding measure and send it to Biden for signing into law. 
""The bipartisan funding bill is proof that both parties can come together to deliver for the American people and advance critical national priorities,"" Young said in a statement. 
The omnibus spending plan will boost funding for domestic priorities, including money for infrastructure passed under an earlier bipartisan measure to revamp U.S. roads, bridges and broadband internet.
The plan includes $730 billion in non-defense funding and $782 billion for the U.S. military.

Amid fears that Russia and other ""bad actors"" could wage cyber attacks against U.S. infrastructure, the government funding bill increases the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency budget by $568.7 million for a total of $2.6 billion for this fiscal year.
In its continuing attempt to unravel the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" immigration policy, the bill provided no additional money for immigration hearing facilities that support the program, which forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico pending resolution of their U.S. asylum cases.

WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will meet Polish leaders in Warsaw on Thursday amid disagreements with the eastern European country over how to arm Ukraine with warplanes to fight Russia's invasion. 
The United States on Tuesday rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force.
Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said any supply of fighter jets to Ukraine must be done jointly https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-only-ready-act-jets-ukraine-within-nato-framework-presidential-adviser-2022-03-09 by NATO countries. However, U.S. officials said they were caught off guard by the proposal and the Pentagon quickly deemed it untenable.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading for NATO to impose a no-fly zone or provide it with fighter jets. The United States and its allies are eager to help Ukraine but are wary of any step that might draw them into direct conflict with Russia.
The U.S. decision not to go ahead with the transfer was criticized by many Republican lawmakers.
""The president should explain exactly why he vetoed fighter jets for Ukraine,"" Senator Ben Sasse said.
""Two days ago, the secretary of state gave a green light to MiG transfers but now the Department of Defense is raising red flags — what's going on?"" 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said U.S. ties with Poland remain strong and she doubted Harris would discuss the issue in a major way on her trip this week to Poland and Romania.
The countries, which are NATO's easternmost members, have been anxious about increasing Russian aggression in the region. They share a border with Ukraine and thousands of refugees are crossing it.
During her visit, Harris is expected to discuss ways NATO members can implement the economic sanctions put in place and how they can stay aligned. She will also meet Ukrainian refugees in Poland and discuss humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine and the region.

Poland has accepted https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/around-12-mln-ukrainians-have-fled-poland-since-invasion-border-guards-2022-03-08 more than 1.2 million people escaping Ukraine, while Romania has taken in https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-291000-ukrainians-fled-romania-since-russian-invasion-2022-03-08 about 291,081 people fleeing the Russian invasion.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for four men standing trial on charges they planned to break into Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's vacation home and kidnap her at gunpoint said their clients only engaged in idle talk and never conspired to abduct the governor over her COVID-19 mandates. 
""There was no agreement. There was no conspiracy to kidnap the governor of Michigan or any other governor,"" attorney Christopher Gibbons, representing Adam Fox, said in his opening statement.
Fox is standing trial in a Grand Rapids, Michigan, federal court along with Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris on charges of conspiring to kidnap the Democratic governor in 2020.
All the defendants except Caserta are also charged with knowingly conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property. If convicted by a 12-person jury, the men face the possibility of life in prison. 
In their opening statement, prosecutors told the jury they would offer evidence that would prove the men planned to break into Whitmer's vacation home, hog-tie her and take her away at gunpoint to stand trial on treason charges over her COVID-19 mandates. 
""To accomplish that, they would shoot, blow up and kill anybody who got in their way, in their own words, creating a war zone here in Michigan,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Roth said.
Prosecutors are expected to rely on the testimony of two witnesses, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks. Indicted along with the four defendants by a grand jury in December 2020, both struck plea deals with prosecutors and agreed to testify against the defendants. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks is awaiting sentencing.
A total of 13 men, some of whom prosecutors said were associated with an anti-government militia group known as Wolverine Watchmen, were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.
Julia Anne Kelly, an attorney for Harris, said the evidence would show her client was unaware of any plans to kidnap the governor. 
""He liked to talk about drinking and girls and guns,"" Kelly said. ""He was not perfect in the summer of 2020. But he's not done what the government has accused him of."" 
The FBI said it began tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments to end curbs on social and business activities imposed to control the coronavirus. 

The indictment accuses one or more of the defendants of discussing Whitmer's kidnapping and planning to meet in Wisconsin to train with assault rifles. The posts also discussed buying supplies to be used in the kidnapping and putting Whitmer's vacation home under surveillance.
Fox ordered $4,000 worth of explosives from an undercover FBI agent posing as a co-conspirator, the indictment said. It also said Fox and Harris made payments for the explosives in the following weeks.

196,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 11:54PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The House approved legislation barring U.S. imports of Russian oil as lawmakers of both parties demanded stronger punishment of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
The 414-17 vote came after President Joe Biden on Tuesday implemented a ban on imports of Russian crude oil and other fossil fuel products, a move made in part because of pressure from lawmakers. The House legislation also takes steps to review Russia’s access to the World Trade Organization and reauthorizes and strengthens the Magnitsky Act, which calls for sanctions on human rights offenders. 
The ban would go into effect 45 days after it is signed into law. It also has a provision allowing the president to importation of some products if it is “in the national interest,” subject to review by Congress.
“The Russian regime relies on energy sales to fund many of its offenses,” said Representative Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat. “This bill will cut off some of the revenue with a ban on the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States. The more economic pain we inflict” on Russian President Vladimir Putin, “the more pressure he will feel to finally feel to end this brutal campaign of terror on the Ukrainian people.”
The legislation doesn’t include a provision revoking permanent normal trade relations status for Russia, which key lawmakers in both parties supported. That provision, which would have allowed tariff increases on the full range of Russian exports and spelled out conditions for restoring Russia’s status, was removed after a request from the White House, a person familiar with the discussion said.
It wasn’t clear, however, whether the legislation would be considered in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Biden’s action to ban Russian energy imports but so far has made no commitment to having his chamber take up separate legislation. 
“We’ll first have to see what the House passes and then we’ll discuss things with the administration and find the best way to make sure that the oil export ban is tight and tough,” Schumer said on Tuesday.
Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to enact a ban on Russian fossil fuels, told reporters he didn’t see the need for the legislation after Biden acted. Other Democrats said they wanted to leave the administration with some flexibility to act.
But late Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who leads the Senate committee overseeing trade, introduced legislation that would ban the import of Russian oil and other fossil fuel. The legislation, co-authored by Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, reflects a bipartisan agreement reached in both chambers earlier in the week. 
The White House had been reluctant to cut Russian oil imports, citing the effect on energy prices. But once it became clear that Congress was set to move, administration officials asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday to hold off on separate legislation to let the president take the initiative.
Even amid complaints about gasoline prices, the American public was shifting to support inflicting stronger punishment on Putin’s government. In a Quinnipiac University national poll released Monday, 71% of Americans said they supported prohibiting Russian oil even if that meant higher prices at the gas station.
The average retail price for a gallon of gasoline hit $4.173 on Monday, according to auto club AAA, a record without adjustment for inflation. 
When crude oil and all other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil that can be used to produce gasoline and diesel, Russia accounted for about 8% of 2021 U.S. oil imports, according to the Energy Information Administration.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden met with executives of chipmakers including Samsung (KS:005930), Micron and other companies on Wednesday as part of an effort to push the U.S. Congress to fund $52 billion in grants to chipmakers to ease the semiconductor crunch.
Biden, along with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, hosted the event with Dr. Siyoung Choi, president of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. Ltd's Device Division, joining remotely, and Sanjay Mehrota, president and chief executive of Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), to highlight the need for speedy action to increase the supply of scarce chips. 
Legislation on the issue has been stalled in Congress, although a Senate aide told Reuters on Wednesday that Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the leader of Senate Republicans, are negotiating a process to begin a conference on the bill during this work period. 
""Today I'm urging the House and the Senate to work out the differences between ... the two version of this bill. Get it to my desk as quickly as you can,"" Biden said on Wednesday.
The House of Representatives on Feb. 4 narrowly passed a bill aimed at increasing American competitiveness with China in part by allocating $52 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
In June the Senate voted 68-32 to pass its own bill, which includes $52 billion for chips and authorizes $190 billion for U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The funding includes $2 billion to incentivize production of ""mature node"" semiconductors used by the auto industry and in medical devices, agricultural machinery and some national defense applications.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
But progress has been scant towards hashing out differences in the two pieces of legislation. A bipartisan group of more than 140 U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday urged leaders in Congress to move forward on the funding.

Other participants in Wednesday's meeting included governors Eric Holcomb of Indiana and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as well as White House economic advisor Brian Deese.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed civil claims against Republican Representative Mo Brooks alleging he helped incite supporters of former President Donald Trump's to attack the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, saying Brooks' speech to the crowd was constitutionally protected free speech. 
The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta represents a setback for U.S. House of Representatives Democrats, including Eric Swalwell, who last year filed the lawsuit against Trump and his allies alleging they encouraged the crowd to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress met to formally certify Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.
Mehta in February had dismissed claims against several of Brooks' co-defendants, including former Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. But in that ruling, Mehta said he would allow the plaintiffs to continue to pursue their claims against the former president.

Trump, he determined, was not immune from the three lawsuits filed by Democratic members of Congress and two police officers over his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, because his fiery speech to supporters was not within the scope of his official presidential duties.
Trump, shortly before riots, repeated to the crowd of supporters his false claim that the 2020 election had been stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, telling them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas legal regulators have asked a judge to discipline attorney Sidney Powell for filing lawsuits they say were frivolous in support of former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.
The disciplinary action is a major development in what has become a nationwide effort to punish pro-Trump lawyers who tried to overturn the November 2020 presidential election result, but is not a final finding of wrongdoing. 
A Texas state court judge will hear the complaint and decide whether to impose a sanction and what that might be.
In the complaint made public on Tuesday, the State Bar of Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline said Powell ""had no reasonable basis"" for filing lawsuits challenging President Joe Biden's victories in key battleground states.
""Respondent (Powell) had no reasonable basis to believe the lawsuits she filed were not frivolous,"" the complaint stated and called the suits a violation of a federal ethics rule requiring an attorney's due diligence before asserting claims in court.
Powell said in a statement that she looked forward to presenting evidence to clear her name.
""The Texas bar decision was totally expected,  but it is an unfortunate and poor decision by the Bar,"" Powell said. ""No lawyer could practice law under the rule they would set for me."" 
Powell represented Trump's campaign when he sought to overturn the election result. His campaign distanced itself from Powell after she claimed without evidence at a Nov. 19 news conference that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.
In August, a federal judge in Michigan said an election lawsuit Powell filed in that state was frivolous.

""This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,"" U.S. District Judge Linda Parker said in her decision, adding that the case ""was never about fraud - it was about undermining the people's faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so.""
Powell and lawyers with whom she worked have appealed that ruling, saying her conduct was ethical.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will collaborate with Poland and Romania on next steps to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and reassure them of Washington's support during her meetings with leaders of both countries starting Thursday.
The countries have been increasingly anxious about Russia's aggression in the region and are NATO's easternmost members. They share a border with Ukraine, where thousands of refugees are flooding in. 
Harris will focus on ways NATO members can implement the economic sanctions put in place and how they can stay aligned and move forward together, senior administration officials said. 
She will also engage with Ukrainian refugees in Poland, discuss continuing humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine and the region, they said. The number of refugees created by the invasion has surpassed 2 million.
The vice president will discuss the issues in Warsaw with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is also visiting the region, they said.
""A lot of our discussions in these two capitals will be about establishing next steps... and how we move the ball forward,"" said one of the officials.
The Eastern Europe visit comes on the heels of Harris' trip to Germany for a security conference, where she met U.S. allies and partners including Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in an effort to keep European allies unified as the Russian invasion of Ukraine became imminent.
The trip is a sign of President Joe Biden's increasing faith in Harris's skills to carry out high-stakes diplomacy. It is also an effort by the administration to manage nervous allies, continue its campaign to isolate Moscow internationally even as the US tries to avoid direct conflict with Russia. 
On Tuesday, the United States rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany as a way to replenish Ukraine's air force in its defense against invading Russian forces.
The U.S. administration officials said a dialogue on how best to provide security assistance to Ukraine will continue but did not offer details on how the vice president plans to address the situation with Poland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to provide the long loss-making Postal Service (USPS) with about $50 billion in financial relief over a decade and require its future retirees to enroll in a government health insurance plan.
In a rare display of bipartisanship for a narrowly divided Congress, the 79-19 vote follows approval by the U.S. House of Representatives in early February and sends the bill to President Joe Biden for his signature.
Struggling with diminishing mail volumes despite having to deliver to a growing number of addresses, USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. Last month, it booked a quarterly net loss of $1.5 billion.
The bill will ensure ""this essential public service"" is ""set on a path to long-term financial sustainability,"" said Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat who chairs the committee overseeing USPS and is a lead sponsor of the bill.
AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler, whose union represents postal workers, said the bill was the culmination of ""15 years of efforts to fund and strengthen USPS."" 
In addition to the postal unions, the bill also has the support of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Greeting Card Association and Hallmark.
The legislation combined with operational reforms will mean ""we will be able to self-fund our operations and continue to deliver to 161 million addresses six days per-week for many decades to come,"" said Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.
Dejoy proposed some of the financial reforms in the legislation. The legislative financial changes are a key part of his March 2021 reform plan, which he has said could eliminate $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade.
As part of the plan, USPS adopted new delivery standards in October that slow some first-class mail deliveries, a move that allowed it to shift significant deliveries from air to surface transportation, cutting costs.
One reason for the large losses is 2006 legislation mandating USPS pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities.
The new bill eliminates requirements USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a requirement no business or other federal entity faces. USPS projects it would sharply reduce its pre-funding liability and save it roughly $27 billion over 10 years.

It requires future retirees to enroll in Medicare. About 25% of postal retirees do not enroll in Medicare even though they are eligible, which results in USPS paying higher premiums than other employers. USPS estimates the change could save it about $22.6 billion over 10 years.
USPS will also be required to maintain six-day a week mail deliveries and develop an online weekly performance data dashboard by ZIP code, as well as expand special rates for local newspaper distribution.

FORT WORTH (Reuters) -President Joe Biden visited Texas on Tuesday to highlight the exposure of U.S. service members to toxins in war zones that can lead to serious health problems like the cancer that killed his son, which Biden blames on burn pits in Iraq.
In remarks to a group of veterans in Fort Worth, Texas, Biden urged them to come forward to tell officials what they need in terms of treatment and assistance.
""You don’t think you have the right to ask,"" he said. ""We're asking you to tell us... what your needs are. Don't be ashamed. It's something to be proud of. We owe you.""
Accompanied by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, Biden visited a clinic for veterans and received a briefing from staff on services for vets and challenges they face.
In his speech, Biden discussed a proposed rule that would add certain rare cancers to the list of those presumed to be connected to military service. He urged Congress to help veterans facing those difficulties. 
Biden, in his State of the Union speech last week, cited his late son, Major Beau Biden, as possibly a victim of burn pits he was exposed to during his service in Iraq. Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general, died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.

The U.S. military used burn pits near bases during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to dispose of various types of trash and military waste, using jet fuel to ignite them and spewing toxic smoke and fumes often unavoidable by the troops.
The latest proposal is not the only effort inspired by Beau's illness. In February, Biden announced plans to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years, part of an effort to revive the ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative to speed research and make more treatments available.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prosecutors can expect a wave of guilty pleas from some of the hundreds of people charged with joining the assault on the U.S. Capitol, after the first criminal trial related to the riot ended in a lightning-quick guilty verdict on Tuesday, legal experts said.
A Washington, D.C, jury deliberated just two hours before finding Guy Reffitt of Texas guilty on all five charges he faced for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, violence by Donald Trump's supporters, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
""This is a big win for prosecutors,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""Get ready for a flood of plea deals from other Jan. 6 defendants.""
The U.S. Justice Department picked up momentum over the past week in its cases against participants in the largest assault on the seat of Congress since the War of 1812, an attempt to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.
Reffitt's guilty verdict came the same day prosecutors charged Enrique Tarrio, the former chairman of the right-wing Proud Boys, on conspiracy charges for allegedly helping plan and direct the assault, though he was not present at the Capitol that day. 
Also during Reffitt's week-long trial, Joshua James, one of the 11 people affiliated with the right-wing Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged role in the attack, pleaded guilty to criminal charges. 
Almost 800 people face criminal charges relating to the Jan. 6. More than 200 have already pleaded guilty rather than invoke their constitutional right to a jury trial — a common move in the U.S. legal system that typically results in a lighter punishment.
Reffitt was the first Jan. 6 defendant to roll the dice on a trial. Legal experts said the strategy was risky because prosecutors have a wealth of video evidence and because jurors in the District of Columbia are unlikely to be sympathetic to Jan. 6 defendants.
""If there were other Jan. 6 rioters who were on the fence about whether to roll the dice and go to trial, this verdict sends them an unmistakable message about the government's ability to prosecute these cases quickly and effectively,"" said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor now at the George Washington University Law School. 
""I expect this will lead additional defendants to decide to plead guilty and cooperate with the government.""
DEFENDANT'S HELMET-CAM
The Capitol attack has been called the most documented crime in history, thanks both to the large number of news media at the scene and the many participants who took photos and videos of their actions that they shared online.
Reffitt, 49, roamed the Capitol grounds with a camera mounted to his helmet, and prosecutors showed jurors video footage taken by that camera.
In one clip, Reffitt repeatedly urged rioters to drag House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers out of the Capitol building.
""I didn't come here to play — I'm taking the Capitol,"" the video showed Reffitt saying at one point. ""I just want to see Pelosi's head hitting every stair on the way out.""
Reffitt's lawyer, William Welch, argued that Reffitt is only guilty of entering a restricted area and should be cleared of more serious charges.
""This case has been a rush to judgment, most of it based on bragging and a lot of hype,"" Welch told jurors.
While defendants who plead guilty typically get a shorter prison sentences, Reffitt was still looking at years behind bars if he pleaded guilty. People facing criminal charges all have different risk tolerance, and Reffitt may have decided the chance of a victory at trial was worth chasing, said Jeffrey Cohen, a former federal prosecutor in Boston. 
Reffitt is a member of a far-right militia group called the Texas Three Percenters. While Reffitt has not made clear his thought process, it is possible he refused a plea deal because he remains convinced that his actions were justified, said Cohen, now a professor at Boston College Law School.
Some defendants may be holding off on pleading guilty because of an ongoing debate among judges. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled that prosecutors cannot charge Jan. 6 defendants with obstructing an official proceeding unless they tampered with official documents or records during the Capitol breach. Several judges have disagreed with Nichols's interpretation of the law, and the issue will likely be resolved by an appeals court this year.

But a slew of plea deals could follow Reffitt's verdict nonetheless, experts said.
""This verdict might wake up other defendants to the reality that jurors won't see things their way,"" said Cohen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. congressional negotiators on Monday were nearing a deal on a bill to provide Ukraine with billions of dollars in emergency aid, as well as fund the U.S. government through Sept. 30 and provide money to address COVID-19.
Lawmakers were racing against a midnight Friday deadline for passing such a sweeping bill, before existing funds are exhausted. Failure to meet the deadline would either require another stop-gap funding bill or force partial government shutdowns during a time of international crisis.
Congressional sources with knowledge of the negotiations said Democratic and Republican leaders were hoping to unveil the legislation as early as Tuesday but stressed that talks were not complete. Republicans said they were concerned about spending new money on the COVID-19 pandemic, insisting that billions of dollars allocated last year remained unspent. 
""It's coming together. A lot will depend on how they deal with the COVID aid,"" Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, told reporters. Thune said he expected any stop-gap bill needed to meet the Friday deadline to be for ""a very short amount of time."" 
Lawmakers acknowledged that a floor schedule truncated by a Wednesday retreat for Democratic lawmakers could pose a hurdle. ""That makes the timetable a little tougher,"" Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, told reporters. 
Congressman Steny Hoyer, the no. 2 House Democrat, told reporters that he expected the chamber's Rules Committee to meet on Tuesday and for a vote on the House floor to take place no later than Wednesday. 
The White House had requested $10 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine, which is trying to fend off an invasion by Russia. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a ""desperate plea"" for help directly to members of the U.S. Congress.
Democrats were also seeking funding to bolster the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic -- an expenditure some Republicans questioned.
The third prong of the potential funding bill is thought to appropriate around $1.5 trillion for Washington to run defense and non-defense discretionary spending, which must be renewed each year. The current fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
Democrats hoped to use strong public support for helping Ukraine to pressure Republicans into passing the sweeping ""omnibus"" bill funding the government, after four bills this fiscal year that extended the previous year's funding levels temporarily.
Congressional Democrats also were trying to start salvaging the unfinished parts of U.S. President Joe Biden's domestic agenda and respond to voters' demands to address inflation while also bolstering high-tech jobs to compete with China.
Last month the government pegged the U.S. inflation rate at 7.5%, a 40-year high far above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Prices for everything from rents to gasoline and food have risen at a time when Democrats are trying to improve their standing with voters in the run-up to Nov. 8 congressional elections that will determine whether they can hold onto thin majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.
Biden, in his State of the Union address last week, sketched out a more moderate path following a year of aggressive spending of around $3 trillion to tame the COVID-19 pandemic and invest in infrastructure improvements.

It is up to the president and his fellow Democrats in Congress to figure out how to unite warring progressive and centrist wings of the party on a narrower series of domestic investments now that his $1.75 billion ""Build Back Better"" initiative is in ruins.
Senate Republicans, however, could stand in the way of some of these initiatives, citing rising budget deficits. That could prompt Democrats to revisit using a special procedure known as ""reconciliation"" to pass some legislation without Republican support.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Congress on Tuesday appeared to be on the cusp of an agreement to allocate billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine, fund the federal government through Sept. 30, and provide resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Sweeping legislation, awaiting final approval from Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, was expected to provide $1.5 trillion for defense and nondefense discretionary spending, as much as $14 billion to help Ukraine respond to Russia's invasion and about $15 billion for COVID.
""Republicans and Democrats are very, very close to finalizing the agreement. I expect there will be text released in a few hours,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at a midafternoon news conference.
Schumer's Republican counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he expects $14 billion in humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine to include loan guarantees to help NATO allies including Poland purchase U.S. warplanes to replace warplanes transferred to Ukraine.
""We need to provide them loan guarantees and assurance that they will be able to get a way to backfill the loss of those MiGs for their own security,"" McConnell told reporters. 
There appeared to be a disagreement over the sum of Ukraine aid. Schumer said it would amount to less than $14 billion. But either way, the figures represent an increase from last week's $10 billion request from the White House. 
Congress faces a midnight Friday deadline for passing the legislation.
House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters earlier Tuesday that his chamber is aiming to debate and pass legislation to fund the government through Sept. 30 on Wednesday. But he left open the possibility of a short-term stop-gap bill being needed if legislation providing full government funding is not completed in time.
If Democrats fail to release the legislation on Tuesday, the task of enacting it ahead of the Friday deadline would become more complicated, though not impossible, according to a source familiar with negotiations.

This week's floor schedule has already been truncated by a planned Wednesday retreat for Democrats. And Republicans, who have demanded time to review the mammoth legislation before voting, could resist any attempt to act immediately after the bill's release.
Democrats hoped to use strong public support for helping Ukraine to pressure Republicans into passing the sweeping ""omnibus"" bill funding the government, after four bills this fiscal year that extended the previous year's funding levels temporarily.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden's administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland and other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The White House said it did not oppose planes being sent to Ukraine but saw logistical challenges to it. 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin calling for Washington to commit to replace any donated jets with upgraded Western aircraft, including through concessionary financing and loans as well as subsidized pricing.
He also said NATO should redeploy fighter aircraft to any base where donated aircraft had been stationed.
Zelenskiy made a ""desperate plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes"" for Ukraine's fight against Russian invaders during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers, participants in the call said.
Many air forces in Eastern Europe fly Russian-made warplanes, and transferring such aircraft to Ukraine would mean Ukrainians could pilot the planes without additional training.
""I will support efforts in the Senate to implement measures to compensate our allies that provide their aircraft for Ukraine's defense,"" Menendez wrote.
Members of the U.S. Senate who attened a briefing on Ukraine by State Department officials on Monday evening said they did not believe Poland yet made up its mind about whether to send the aircraft. Some said other countries might also send planes, but declined to identify any.
A State Department spokesperson said the department was working with Poland and consulting with other NATO allies.
""This is Poland's sovereign decision to make. We have in no way opposed Poland transferring planes to Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said in an email.
Administration officials said there were logistical challenges both in moving aircraft into Ukraine, and providing replacement U.S. planes.
""It is not as easy as just moving planes around,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.

Many lawmakers - both Biden's fellow Democrats and Republicans - have appealed for Washington to do all it can to get aircraft to Ukraine, including by letting countries that send Russian-made MiGs ""jump the line"" to quickly obtain U.S.-made F-16s - made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) - to replace them.
Russia describes its actions as ""a special military operation"" whose aim is to disarm Ukraine, counter what it views as NATO aggression and capture Ukrainian leaders it calls neo-Nazis.

217,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 07:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The Milwaukee County district attorney's office said on Monday it would not charge members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, rejecting a sheriff's call to prosecute them for how they advised clerks ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
In declining to file charges, the office of Milwaukee's top prosecutor was the first of four county district attorneys who had received criminal referrals from Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling to declare its stance on the issue.
In a letter to Schmaling, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Westphal said there was ""insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed"" by the election commission's members in the run-up to the 2020 vote.
Schmaling, a Republican, had called for five of the state's six appointed elections commissioners to be criminally charged for telling election officials to keep Special Voting Deputies - who by law are required to help nursing home residents vote - from entering such facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The move by Schmaling has been one flashpoint in the ongoing battle in the state between Democrats and Republicans, many of whom refuse to accept that President Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in the battleground state by nearly 21,000 votes, despite multiple recounts and a state audit affirming the result.
Last week, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice who led a Republican review of the 2020 election called on Wisconsin lawmakers to dissolve the bipartisan elections commission, while also suggesting they consider decertifying the results - a move many legal scholars said was not feasible.
The former justice, Michael Gableman, focused much of the report he released on the alleged problems with voting in nursing homes that had been highlighted in Schmaling's investigation, which had been triggered by a complaint. Gableman said absentee ballots cast by incapacitated elderly residents of the facilities had created doubts about the 2020 election.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has called Schmaling's investigation a ""publicity stunt"" and declined to bring charges.
Racine County District Attorney Tricia Hanson, a Republican, also reviewed the evidence and said while she believes a crime occurred she lacked jurisdiction. That prompted Schmaling to refer the case to the counties where the commissioners live.
The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office, led by a Democrat, had only looked at potential charges against commissioners Ann Jacobs and Mark Thomsen because they live in the county. Prosecutors in Green Lake, Sheboygan and St. Croix counties, who are reviewing referrals against commissioners Marge Bostelmann, Julie M. Glancey, and Dean Knudson, have yet to say if they intend to bring charges.
In his letter, Milwaukee County's Westphal said the commissioners' guidance was ""not inconsistent"" with their duties to administer elections and said it was aimed at addressing a ""global pandemic and a vulnerable community that may have been unable to exercise their constitutional right to vote.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let North Carolina and Pennsylvania use electoral maps approved by state courts to replace ones deemed to have given Republicans unfair advantages, improving Democratic chances of retaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November.
The justices denied Republican requests to put on hold lower court rulings that adopted court-drawn boundaries for North Carolina's 14 House districts and Pennsylvania's 17 House districts to replace electoral maps devised by Republican-controlled legislatures in the two states.
Republicans are seeking to regain control of the House, narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats, in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Party primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina are set for May 17. 
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the action concerning North Carolina.
The North Carolina and Pennsylvania disputes are among the numerous court battles nationwide over the composition of electoral districts, which are redrawn each decade to reflect population changes measured in a national census, last taken in 2020.
In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain. The Supreme Court in 2019 barred federal judges from curbing the practice, called partisan gerrymandering. 
LEGAL DOCTRINE
The cases touch upon a once-marginal legal theory called the ""independent state legislature doctrine"" that is gaining traction in conservative legal circles and, if accepted, would vastly increase the power of politicians over elections. Under that doctrine, the U.S. Constitution gives legislatures, not state courts or other entities, authority over election rules including the drawing of electoral districts. 
The North Carolina Republican lawmakers challenging the court-drawn map placed the theory front and center, writing in a court filing: ""The North Carolina courts have usurped (the legislature's) constitutional authority.""
Alito said the justices should have blocked the court-drawn map. 
""This case presents an exceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law, namely, the extent of a state court's authority to reject rules adopted by a state legislature for use in conducting federal elections,"" Alito wrote.
The doctrine is based in part on language in the Constitution stating that the ""times, places and manner"" of federal elections ""shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.""
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated sympathy toward the views of the dissenters but said it was too close to the election to block the maps. But Kavanaugh added that the court should take up the underlying legal issue in due course.
The opinions by Kavanaugh and Alito indicated that the court has the four votes needed to take up the doctrine and issue a ruling potentially limiting state court authority to review federal election rules set by state legislatures ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. 
It remains unclear if a majority of the justices would embrace such a ruling.
""Today's orders are temporary good news, but statements from four of the justices are ominous for the ability of state courts to uphold the right to vote under state constitutions,"" voting rights expert Josh Douglas of the University of Kentucky Rosenberg College of Law, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group defending the state's new districts, called Monday's action a victory. 
""We're pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the legislative defendants' shameless attempt to impose their gerrymandered congressional map upon North Carolina,"" Phillips said. 
The North Carolina Supreme Court, acting after Democratic voters and an environmental group challenged the Republican-drawn map, struck it down, concluding it was intentionally biased against Democrats, diluting their ""fundamental right to equal voting power"" in violation of the state constitution's free elections and freedom of assembly provisions, among others. 
A lower state court then rejected a redrawn map submitted by the legislature, instead adopting a new map drawn by a bipartisan group of experts. According to some redistricting analysts, the court-approved map includes seven districts likely to favor Republicans, six likely to favor Democrats and one competitive seat.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf vetoed a map approved by the legislature, saying the configuration of House districts gave Republicans an unfair advantage. 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, acting on a lawsuit filed by Democratic voters, approved a new map that eliminated one Republican-leaning district approved by the legislature and, Republicans have argued, created a statewide map advantageous to Democrats.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A federal prosecutor accused a Texas man of being ""a leader"" of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump supporters as she wrapped up arguments on Monday in the first criminal trial of someone accused of joining the riot.
Guy Reffitt of Texas, is the first of some 750 people charged with joining in the riot to face trial in Washington.
""Every mob needs leaders, and this defendant was a leader that day,"" Justice Department lawyer Risa Berkower told jurors. ""When the defendant stepped to the front of the crowd, he forced the Capitol Police into an impossible last stand to protect the people inside.""
Reffitt's lawyer, William Welch, argued that Reffitt is only guilty of entering a restricted area and should be cleared of more serious charges.
""As soon as he was pepper-sprayed, that was the end of it,"" Welch said of his client, adding that Reffitt embellished his own role to seem important.
""This case has been a rush to judgment, most of it based on bragging and a lot of hype,"" Welch told jurors. ""Be the grown-ups in the courtroom. Separate the fact from the hype.""
The jury is scheduled to begin deliberating on Tuesday.
Reffitt faces five felony charges, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding.
Reffitt's estranged son Jackson, now 19, turned him into the FBI and testified against him last week.
If convicted of the most serious charges against him, Reffitt faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though defendants rarely receive maximum penalties.
Thousands of people stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after a fiery speech in which Trump falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
Reffitt never entered the Capitol, but video showed him egging on the crowd and leading other rioters up some outdoor stairs.
Reffitt, who wore a bulletproof vest and a helmet, persisted up the staircase even as police officers pelted him with pepper balls and doused him with chemical spray.
In a video clip played for jurors, Reffitt repeatedly urged rioters to drag House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers out of the Capitol.

""I didn't come here to play — I'm taking the Capitol,"" Reffitt said. ""I just want to see Pelosi's head hitting every stair on the way out.""
Some 200 defendants have already pleaded guilty to charges relating to the attack, which sent lawmakers running for their lives. Reffitt's trial is an important test case as prosecutors attempt to secure convictions from the hundreds who have not taken plea deals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan trio of U.S. congressmen on Monday unveiled new legislation that would permanently ban illicit versions of fentanyl, the powerful synthetic painkiller that has helped fuel the nation's opioid epidemic and death toll. 
The proposed bill, introduced by Democrat Chris Pappas and Republicans Dan Newhouse and Ted Budd, comes days before a temporary ban on chemical copycats of fentanyl known as analogues expires on Friday.
For years, the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been trying to crack down on the proliferation of chemical look-alikes of fentanyl, which are often manufactured in China and shipped into the United States from Mexico.
Fentanyl, which is 100 times more potent than morphine, is classified as a Schedule II drug, meaning it is highly addictive but has a medicinal purpose, typically to treat intense cancer pain.
But chemists largely based in China have created numerous slightly altered versions of the drug, which along with actual fentanyl have flooded U.S. streets and contributed to nearly 500,000 U.S. opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
To combat these illicit versions, the DEA previously clamped down by individually placing each illicit new fentanyl analogue into Schedule 1, the same legal category for drugs like heroin which are deemed to have no medical use.
In 2018, the DEA came up with a new approach, using its emergency powers to schedule all copycat illicit versions of fentanyl broadly into Schedule 1 as a single class, effectively banning them.
That authority has remained in place, thanks to repeated temporary extensions from Congress, which has yet to act on a long-term solution over concerns that a permanent ban could stifle scientific research into fentanyl analogues.
""This bill looks to close an important loophole,"" Pappas said in a phone interview. ""We've got to make sure that we're staying ahead of the cartels.""
Pappas added that his proposed bill contains provisions that he hopes will address researchers' concerns by making it ""less onerous and more streamlined"" for scientists.

The new legislation introduced on Monday is not expected to pass before the DEA's latest temporary emergency scheduling of fentanyl analogues expires.
However, Pappas told Reuters that lawmakers are looking into another temporary extension as part of a broader spending bill until a permanent solution is reached.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. lawmakers on trade matters on Monday announced a plan for legislation to ban the import of Russian energy products and suspend normal trade relations with Russia, according to a statement from the bipartisan group.
""Taking these actions will send a clear message to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that his war is unacceptable and the United States stands firmly with our NATO allies,"" the lawmakers said.
The statement was issued by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, both Democrats, and their Republican counterparts, Representative Kevin Brady and Senator Mike Crapo.

They said the legislation would provide U.S. President Joe Biden the authority to increase tariffs on goods from Russia and Belarus and would require U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to seek suspension of Russia's participation in the World Trade Organization. Tai also would be required to push for a halt to Belarus' proposed accession to the WTO.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration has delivered White House visitor logs from former President Donald Trump's administration to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the committee said on Friday.
NARA also turned over records from former Vice President Mike Pence, meeting a March 3 deadline.
""Yesterday, the Select Committee received additional production of records from the National Archives,"" a House of Representatives Select Committee aide said. ""This included records that the former President attempted to keep hidden behind claims of privilege.""
Trump had tried to block the release of the visitor logs, but President Joe Biden rejected his claim that they were subject to executive privilege, ""in light of the urgency"" of the committee's work and Congress' ""compelling need.""
Several courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have also ruled against the Republican ex-president's efforts to block the release of various records to the committee.
So far, more than 725 people have been charged with playing a role in the attack on the Capitol by mobs of Trump supporters, which left five people dead and more than 100 police officers injured. Another four police officers involved in defending the Capitol later committed suicide.

The Jan. 6 committee has been investigating the events surrounding the attack - and the former president's role in it - for more than seven months. It has made more than 80 subpoenas public, including many issued to top Trump aides and allies, and interviewed more than 560 witnesses.
It has also gathered records from social media and other telecommunications firms.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in Havana announced on Thursday it would increase staffing and resume some visa processing in Cuba several years after the Trump administration slashed personnel at the facility following a spate of unexplained health incidents.
The top U.S. diplomat in Havana, Timothy Zuniga-Brown, made the announcement at a news conference, confirming a Reuters report from Monday.
Following the drawdown of staff in Havana in 2017, the Trump administration required Cubans to apply for visas in the U.S. embassy in Guyana, a costly trip that few on the island could afford. 
Zuniga-Brown's announcement stressed a ""limited resumption of some immigrant visa services"" in Havana. It added that Cuban immigrant visas will still be processed primarily in Guyana, while Havana offices will focus on other consular services and ""limited emergency non-immigrant visa processing.""
The eventual deployment of additional consular officers to Havana, a result of President Joe Biden's ongoing review of Cuba policy, will begin to address a more than four-year backlog of requests for immigration visas by Cubans with family in the United States.
It also marks a rare step by the Biden administration to ease restrictions on communist-led Cuba imposed by former Republican President Donald Trump, who rolled back the historic rapprochement overseen by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
Just prior to the announcement, the Cuban government issued a statement to Reuters slamming the Trump-era policy as unjustified and harmful to U.S-Cuba ties.
""Over five years, that decision has had very damaging consequences for the entire Cuban population, as well as for Americans,"" said the statement signed by Ines Fors, head of U.S.-Cuba bilateral relations for Cuba's Foreign Ministry.
The Cuban statement did not directly address the staffing announcement, and Zuniga-Brown did not provide a timeline or numbers for the increase in personnel.
Havana resident Maria de Lourdes Galban, a 35-year old doctor hoping to reunite her two young children with their father in the United States, said she had hoped for more.
""I expected a broader opening and it hurts me because I know that there are thousands of Cubans who are in the same situation and we have been waiting for many years,"" she said.
Trump scaled back embassy staff and cut down on visa processing in 2017 after some embassy personnel in Havana became ill with what has become known as ""Havana syndrome."" The unexplained illnesses first affected U.S. employees in the Cuban capital but later cropped up in other parts of the world.
The Cuban government has long denied any involvement or knowledge of the incidents.
POLITICAL FALLOUT
In addition to slashing visa processing, Trump restricted remittances to Cuba, scaled back flights to the island and increased hurtles for U.S. citizens seeking to travel to Cuba for anything other than family visits.
The U.S. Embassy on Thursday did not address those issues.
Biden, who served as Obama's vice president, had promised during the 2020 election campaign against Trump to re-engage with Cuba's government, and many in both countries expected he would roll back Trump-era restrictions.
The Biden administration instead slapped fresh sanctions on Cuban officials in response to Havana's crackdown on protesters following widespread marches on the island in July.
Biden officials are mindful that any easing of restrictions on Cuba could lead to political fallout from conservative Cuban Americans, a key voting bloc in south Florida.
But the resumption of visa processing at the embassy is less likely to spur a serious political backlash since a number of Cuban-American lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have backed the idea.

Olga Lidia Pérez, a 67-year old retired doctor in Havana who has waited four years to reunite with her daughters in Florida, said she was left with more questions than answers following the embassy's announcement this week.
""I still don't know whether to believe it or not because between Cuba and the United States you never know,"" she said. ""There is always uncertainty.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol issued a subpoena on Thursday to Kimberly Guilfoyle, a U.S. television personality who is engaged to be married to Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of the former president.
Guilfoyle, who worked on Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, abruptly ended an interview with the Select Committee on Feb. 25, criticizing House of Representatives members who were present.
Her attorney issued a statement afterward saying Guilfoyle had agreed to meet only with attorneys for the Democratic-led House committee, not with members of Congress. 
As a result, the committee said it would issue a subpoena to compel Guilfoyle's cooperation. The panel asked Guilfoyle to appear for a deposition on March 15.
""Guilfoyle met with (former President) Donald Trump inside the White House, spoke at the rally that took place before the riot on January 6th, and apparently played a key role organizing and raising funds for that event,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, committee chairman, said in a statement.
In a statement, Guilfoyle's attorney Joe Tacopina accused the committee of ""an attempt to smear"" Trump, his family and supporters. ""She had done nothing wrong,"" he said.
The Select Committee is trying to establish the actions of Trump and associates before and during the assault on the Capitol by thousands of his supporters. The mobs attacked police, vandalized the building, and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives as they gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory over Trump, a Republican.

The Select Committee has so far interviewed more than 560 witnesses and issued more than 80 subpoenas as it probes the causes of the attack and the role played by Trump, who continues to push false claims that his election defeat by Biden was the result of fraud.
Earlier on Thursday, the panel interviewed Judd Deere (NYSE:DE), a former White House spokesman who is now a Republican congressional aide.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden will grant temporary deportation relief and work permits to tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are already in the United States but unable to return to Ukraine due to the military conflict with Russia, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Thursday.
The move will allow Ukrainians in the United States as of March 1 to remain and work legally for a period of 18 months, DHS said, after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in one of the biggest attacks on a European state since World War Two. An estimated 75,000 Ukrainians would be eligible to apply for the program, DHS said. 
Biden assailed Russian President Vladimir Putin, barred Russian flights from American airspace on Tuesday in a State of the Union speech dominated by the crisis in Ukraine.
Ukrainians will be granted deportation relief and access to work permits under a program known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The program gives immigrants who cannot return to their countries safely due to extraordinary circumstances such as violent conflict or natural disasters the ability to stay and work in the United States legally for a defined period of time.
""Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,"" Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a written statement. 

Earlier in the day on Thursday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said that it had paused deportation flights to Ukraine due to the ""ongoing humanitarian crisis.""
More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled and started to arrive in neighboring central European countries since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special operation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump appears unlikely to face federal criminal charges for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss despite a U.S. congressional committee's court filing accusing him of illegal conduct, according to legal experts.
""I'm not sure the Justice Department is even investigating this criminally,"" said Ankush Khardori, a former trial lawyer for the Justice Department's anti-fraud unit. ""That's the open question.""
Republican businessman-turned-politican Trump may have committed multiple felonies in his effort to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, a House of Representatives investigative committee stated in a court filing on Wednesday. The Democratic-led committee was formed to investigate last year's Capitol attack by a mob of Trump supporters who tried to block formal congressional certification of Biden's victory.
The committee lacks the power to bring criminal charges on its own. But the filing suggests that later this year it will formally urge the Justice Department to carry out a criminal investigation of Trump - a step known as a ""criminal referral,"" said University of Minnesota law professor Alan Rozenshtein, a former Justice Department national security lawyer.
Rozenshtein called the filing ""a preview for a criminal referral,"" adding: ""It would be strange for the committee to take this step and then pull its punches.""
The committee said in the filing that Trump potentially engaged in conspiracy to defraud the United States and may have obstructed an official proceeding.
Trump in a statement on Thursday accused the committee of being politically motivated and trying to prevent him from running for president again.
Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The committee revealed the findings in a legal brief arguing that it should be allowed access to thousands of emails sent by John Eastman, a lawyer who advised Trump on a plan to try to invalidate election results in key states. Eastman sued the committee in December, seeking to block a subpoena requesting that he turn over the emails.
While the filing is a major development, Garland has long appeared hesitant to charge Trump, and the committee's latest revelations may not change the attorney general's thinking, Rozenshtein said.
'NIGHTMARE SCENARIO'
""We've seen Garland proceed very cautiously - to the chagrin of many Democrats,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
""It would be a monumental thing for our nation if the Justice Department charged a former president with a crime of undermining our democracy,"" Levinson added. ""There could be a lot of evidence, but the Justice Department is not going to do it unless they have crossed every 't' and dotted every 'i.'""
A ""nightmare scenario"" for Garland would be charging Trump and then failing to secure a conviction, Rozenshtein said.
""If you are going to prosecute a politician, especially someone like Trump, you want to do it on the strongest possible grounds,"" Rozenshtein said.
The Justice Department is investigating the Capitol riot and has charged about 750 people in connection with the violence.
""We will follows the facts wherever they lead,"" Garland said in a January speech marking the anniversary of the attack, adding that he ""remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law.""
Asked in February if the department had any concerns about bringing charges against a former president, Garland said he could not answer a hypothetical question and would not talk about whether or not it has ongoing investigations.  
There is little indication that the department is focusing on Trump's inner circle, Khardori said.
""All the public indicators suggest there is not a concerted investigation into this part of what went into January 6 - the non-violent machinations,"" Khardori added.
Trump and his allies have made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Khardori said it appears that the Justice Department is letting prosecutors at the state level and congressional investigators take the lead in investigating Trump's efforts to stay in power.

Under U.S. law, crimes such as fraud and conspiracy require proof of criminal intent - known as ""mens rea,"" or a guilty mind. Demonstrating that Trump had such intent may be difficult, according to Rozenshtein.
""That doesn't mean that Trump can't be held liable, but it does add an interesting wrinkle that any prosecutor would need to think through,"" Rozenshtein said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday vowed that Russia's Vladimir Putin will pay dearly over the long run for his invasion of Ukraine, even if his military campaign succeeds in the short term.
""While he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address. Straying from the prepared text, Biden added ""He has no idea what's coming."" He did not elaborate.
Biden spoke to Congress on the sixth day of Russia's invasion of its European neighbor and as Kyiv stared down a miles-long armored Russian column potentially preparing to take over the Ukrainian capital, and the U.S. and a growing group of allies tighten sanctions. 
In the prime time speech, Biden announced a new step banning Russian flights from using American airspace and a Justice Department effort to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin.
He also signaled steps to hobble Russia's military in the future, even as he acknowledged it could improve its position in Ukraine.
""We are choking off Russia's access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come,"" he said. 
""When the history of this era is written Putin's war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger,"" he said.
Biden, who spoke earlier in the day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has rejected direct U.S. military participation on the ground in Ukraine.

But the U.S. government has shared intelligence on Russia's operations and led the world in imposing a historic set of economic sanctions on Putin's government, allies and the country's largest banks, sending the currency into freefall.
Nearly a week since Russian troops poured over the border, they have not captured any major Ukrainian cities after running into fiercer resistance than they expected. 
 
",,,,,
230,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden is poised to impose sanctions on a number of Russian oligarchs and their families on Thursday, as the U.S. and its allies seek to exert further pressure on the wealthy businessmen around President Vladimir Putin in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
The sanctions will be in keeping with measures the European Union imposed on Feb. 28, according to people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified in advance of an announcement.
But the U.S. restrictions will be broader, prohibiting the tycoons’ travel to the U.S. and also targeting their families to prevent them from transferring assets to spouses or children, a tactic that’s been used in the past to evade sanctions. 
The specific targets of the U.S. sanctions are still under discussion, the people said, and they declined to identify any of them ahead of an official announcement. 
The moves are the latest effort by the administration to turn the screws on Putin and his inner circle following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week. On Wednesday, the U.S Justice Department announced a task force to enforce sanctions and export restrictions and to seize luxury assets belonging to Russia’s wealthiest citizens.
The administration believes that if the tycoons are put under financial strain, they may distance themselves from Putin and possibly pressure him to stop the war in Ukraine. A State Department spokesman declined to comment and spokespeople for the White House National Security Council didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
The Washington Post reported earlier that the U.S. was preparing sanctions on Russia’s wealthy elites.
Earlier this week, Europe announced sanctions on several wealthy Russians including metals tycoon Alisher Usmanov, Alfa Group owners Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, plus Alexey Mordashov, who controls a major steel company. Some had already been under sanction over Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014. 
German authorities have seized Usmanov’s superyacht, and French authorities said they stopped Rosneft chief executive officer Igor Sechin’s superyacht from leaving port on the Cote D’Azur on Thursday. Usmanov and others have lambasted the sanctions as unfair and illegal.
The U.S. on Feb. 24 announced sanctions against Putin, his foreign minister, some national security aides and top executives of some of Russia’s biggest banks and state-owned entities, as well as Sechin. But it had so far held off imposing sanctions on the broader circle of billionaires who accumulated vast wealth by snapping up privatized Russian companies for bottom-basement prices in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Many of those oligarchs had thrown in their lot with Putin in recent years. But several have offered hints in recent days that they’re looking to distance themselves from the war, though none have condemned Putin directly.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday let Kentucky's Republican attorney general seek to restore a restrictive abortion law after the state's Democratic governor dropped defense of the statute when lower courts struck it down. 
The justices ruled 8-1 in favor of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, the top legal officer in the state, in his appeal of a lower court's rejection of his request to intervene in the litigation. A federal appeals court had found that Cameron's request, in a bid to revive the law, came too late. 
The justices ruled that even though the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had already issued its decision in the case, it should have used its discretion to let the state's attorney general pursue a rehearing or an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The 6th Circuit ""failed to account for the strength of the Kentucky attorney general's interest in taking up the defense"" of the law, conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the ruling, joined by the other five conservative justices. 
Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented. 
Republican-backed abortion restrictions enacted by numerous U.S. states in recent years have continued to draw the attention of the nation's highest judicial body. 
Kentucky's Republican-backed 2018 law placed strict limits on the use of an abortion method called dilation and evacuation - the most common form of the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy during the second trimester. Abortion rights advocates have said the law would effectively ban the procedure, though its proponents denied that it was a ban.
Cameron said his office will now pursue further litigation at the 6th Circuit, adding that ""we will proudly continue to carry the mantle for this important pro-life law.""
EMW Women's Surgical Center, a Louisville abortion clinic, challenged Kentucky's law, arguing that Cameron should not be able to take the case further because the state attorney general's office previously agreed to be bound by the lower court's final judgment and then did not pursue an appeal. 
""Politicians in Kentucky are working overtime to force people to continue pregnancies against their will,"" said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented the clinic. ""But this fight is not over and we'll continue doing everything in our power to protect each person's ability to get an abortion, no matter where they live.""
The law was passed by Kentucky's legislature and signed by then-Governor Matt Bevin. Bevin, a Republican, subsequently lost his 2019 re-election bid to Democrat Andy Beshear.
The case heard by the Supreme Court did not involve the legality of the law, focusing instead on the narrow legal issue of Cameron's right to act when another state official declines.
The case highlights the sometimes-messy conflicts arising when a governor and a state's top legal officer differ in political views or party, sometimes leading to disagreements on whether to defend certain state laws in court. 
""I fear today's decision will open the floodgates for government officials to evade the consequences of litigation decisions made by their predecessors of different political parties,"" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Beshear's administration dropped the case after the 6th Circuit ruled that the law violated Supreme Court precedents holding that women have a right under the U.S. Constitution to obtain an abortion. Kentucky's health department had continued to defend the law in court after Beshear took office but opted not to pursue the matter further after the 6th Circuit's decision. Cameron then unsuccessfully sought to take over the defense. 

Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, will roll back abortion rights.
The justices heard arguments https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 in December over a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a case in which that state is asking them to overturn https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mississippi-asks-us-supreme-court-overturn-abortion-rights-landmark-2021-07-22 the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. Their ruling is due by the end of June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Hearings on federal appellate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's nominee, who would become the first Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, will begin on March 21, a first step before she can be voted on by the full chamber.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin revealed the timeline hours after Jackson arrived on Capitol Hill to visit Senate leaders of both parties, as lawmakers mulled her candidacy for the lifetime post.
Hearings will run until March 24 and include testimony from the American Bar Association and other outside witnesses, Durbin's statement said, as well as a standard closed session where the committee will discuss any matters relating to Jackson's FBI background check. 
""I look forward to Judge Jackson’s appearance before the Committee and to respectful and dignified hearings,"" Durbin said in a public letter to his Senate colleagues.
Jackson, 51, who was picked to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, began the formal task of seeking Senate confirmation during high-profile meetings on Wednesday with the chamber's top lawmakers.
Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer met with Jackson for about 40 minutes in an ornate Senate dining room and offered reporters wall-to-wall praise for qualifications and experience that he said should be applauded by Democrats and Republicans alike.
""She deserves support from the other side of the aisle, and I am hopeful that a good number of Republicans will vote for her, given who she is,"" the New York Democrat said.
Democrats hope to confirm her before the Easter recess starts on April 11.
If confirmed, Jackson would join the liberal bloc on an increasingly assertive court that has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Jackson has served since last year on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after eight years as a federal district judge in Washington and worked earlier as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer. She would become the sixth woman to ever serve on the nine-member court that now has three female justices.
But Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who met with her after Schumer, raised questions about Jackson's short record as an appellate judge, which includes only two opinions so far. 
""I am troubled by the combination of this slim appellate record and the intensity of Judge Jackson's far-left, dark-money fan club,"" said McConnell, who has already indicated he'd be inclined to block Biden nominees in 2023 and 2024 if Republicans win a majority in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.

Senator John Cornyn, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would be meeting with Jackson on March 10 but did not expect any surprises in her hearings, given that she has appeared before the committee several times already for judicial nominations.
""She's not new to us,"" he told reporters. ""Given the fact that she's not going to change the ideological balance on the court ... we all have a pretty good idea what the outcome is likely to be.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday said former President Donald Trump may have engaged in criminal conduct in his bid to overturn his election defeat.
In a court filing — one of the U.S. House of Represenative's Select Committee's most detailed releases of findings yet — the panel said Trump potentially engaged in conspiracy to defraud the United States and may have obstructed an official proceeding.
The Select Committee's members have previously said they will consider passing along evidence of criminal conduct by Trump to the U.S. Justice Department. Such a move, known as a criminal referral, would be largely symbolic but would increase political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge the former president and would thrust his department into a political firestorm.
"" (E)vidence and information available to the Committee establishes a good-faith belief that Mr. Trump and others may have engaged in criminal and/or fraudulent acts,"" the committee said in a court filing.
""The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,"" the filing said.
The court document was filed in federal court in Los Angeles as part of the Select Committee's dispute with John Eastman, a lawyer who advised Trump on a plan to invalidate election results in key battleground states.
Eastman sued the committee in December, seeking to block a congressional subpoena requesting that he turn over thousands of emails.
Charles Burnham, a lawyer for Eastman, said in a statement on Wednesday that Eastman is abiding by his ethical duty to protect client confidences.
""The Select Committee has responded to Dr. Eastman's efforts to discharge this responsibility by accusing him of criminal conduct,"" Burnham said. ""Because this is a civil matter, Dr. Eastman will not have the benefit of the Constitutional protections normally afforded to those accused by their government of criminal conduct. Nonetheless, we look forward to responding in due course.""
Representatives of Eastman and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has repeatedly called the Select Committee's inquiry a politically motivated investigation.
The court filing included emails obtained by the Select Committee from the day of the Jan. 6 attack, including one where a lawyer for then-Vice President Mike Pence said no judges would endorse Eastman's legal strategy for overturning Trump's election defeat.
“Thanks to your bullshit, we are now under siege,” the Pence lawyer, Greg Jacob, wrote to Eastman.
“The ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so the American people can see for themselves what happened,” Eastman replied.

The committee's leaders said in a statement that ""Eastman’s emails may show that he helped Donald Trump advance a corrupt scheme to obstruct the counting of electoral college ballots and a conspiracy to impede the transfer of power.""
Attorney regulators in California said Tuesday they have been investigating Eastman and whether he acted unethically in his work for Trump. The investigation could lead to disciplinary action against Eastman, such as suspension of his law license.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Texas man who is the first person to stand trial for joining the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol told a friend he wanted to drag Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of the building, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
Guy Reffitt of Wylie, Texas, is the first of some 750 people charged with joining the riot by former President Donald Trump's supporters to face trial in Washington. Reffitt has pleaded not guilty to five charges, including carrying a semi-automatic handgun while on Capitol grounds.
""The defendant was the tip of this mob's spear,"" federal prosecutor Jeffrey Nestler told jurors in his opening statement, saying Reffitt led a mob of rioters up the Capitol's stairs to ""overwhelm"" police and storm the building.
Nestler said Reffitt texted a friend about plans to drag Pelosi and other lawmakers from the building.
""I just want to see Pelosi's head hitting every fucking stair"" of the building, Reffitt told the friend, according to the prosecutor.
Reffitt's lawyer, William Welch, gave a brief opening statement, addressing jurors for only two minutes.
""He exaggerates and he rants,"" Welch said of his client. ""This trial will be about fact versus hype.""
Some 200 defendants have already pleaded guilty to joining the mob, which sent lawmakers running for their lives. Reffitt's trial is an important test case as the U.S. Justice Department attempts to secure convictions from the hundreds of defendants who have not taken plea deals.
They face charges ranging from unlawful picketing to seditious conspiracy, with which 11 people affiliated with the right-wing Oath Keepers were charged in January.
One of those 11 defendants, Joshua James, pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors on Wednesday. The deal was a notable victory for the Justice Department, which hopes to secure a similar conviction against Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and other defendants in the sedition case.
A guilty verdict for Reffitt could motivate defendants to accept plea deals offered by prosecutors. But a verdict in Reffitt's favor could encourage the hundreds of defendants who have not taken plea deals to roll the dice on a trial.
Reffitt also faces charges of obstruction for allegedly threatening his teenage children with harm if they turned him in to authorities.
Reffitt's estranged son Jackson, now 19, turned him in to the FBI. The son will testify against his father at trial, Nestler said.
Thousands of people stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 last year after a fiery speech in which Trump falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day.

Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than a hundred police officers were injured in the riot.
Two police officers who guarded the Capitol testified to the jury in Reffitt's case on Wednesday.

Taylor, who represents a northeast Texas district, last year voted for the creation of a special congressional panel to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, earning the ire of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters mounted the deadly attack.
Taylor's withdrawal came one day after he led a pack of five Republicans in a primary race with 48.7% of the vote, just shy of the 50% needed to win his party's nomination.

SUPERIOR, Wis. (Reuters) - Fresh from his State of the Union speech, U.S. President Joe Biden visited the battleground state of Wisconsin on Wednesday and reiterated his support for the Ukrainian people abroad while touting the billions of dollars in public infrastructure investments he helped secure at home. 
A day after delivering the State of the Union address, Biden trumpeted his infrastructure law and visited a bridge in Superior, Wisconsin. He called the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law secured last year one of the most sweeping in U.S. history that will create thousands of jobs rebuilding the nation's highways, bridges and airports. 
""We can't compete for jobs in the 21st century if we don't fix that,"" Biden said. 
On Tuesday night, he delivered his first State of the Union speech, focusing on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In his speech he assailed Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced a U.S. ban on Russian flights in American airspace and led Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a rare display of unity.
""Together, we send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people. We stand with them,"" Biden told a crowd gathered at the University of Wisconsin in Superior. 
Wisconsin, a hotly contested state politically because its population swings between supporting Democrats and Republicans, helped secure Biden's 2020 victory. First lady Jill Biden accompanied him on the trip. 
Other administration officials fanned out around the country to promote Biden's domestic agenda. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the swing state of North Carolina on Wednesday along with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, where they visited an apprentice training program for union electrical workers.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Chicago to promote Biden's economic agenda, including investments in child care and education.
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was going to Kentucky to tour a solar farm and participate in a roundtable discussion about clean energy investments. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan planned to push investments in water infrastructure during a trip to South Carolina.
The U.S. midterm elections take place in November and Democrats risk losing their narrow majorities in both houses of Congress. All 435 members of the House are up for re-election in 2022, as are one-third of the members of the U.S. Senate, including Democrats in competitive districts in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. 
Less than half of Americans approve of Biden, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The national opinion poll, conducted Feb. 28-March 1, found that 43% of U.S. adults approved of Biden's performance in office while 54% disapproved and the rest were not sure. The president's approval numbers have hovered below 50% since August.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that the United States and Western allies have immobilized half of the assets of the Russian central bank and will continue to impose ""severe consequences"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and the wealthy oligarchs who support him if he escalates his war in Ukraine.
Yellen, speaking in Chicago to promote President Joe Biden's economic agenda, said the Treasury has ""made it a priority to go after oligarchs or Russian elites who are key to President Putin's corrupt power"".
""We have sanctioned many of these individuals over the last few weeks and we are assembling a task force with Justice Department colleagues and our allies to uncover, freeze, and seize their wealth around the world.""
Yellen, who visited Chicago's Ukrainian Village neighborhood with Illinois Governor Jay Pritzker, said that the United States and allies around the world have worked together to isolate Russia, making it more much more difficult for Putin to finance Russian aggression against Ukraine. Eighty percent of Russia's banking system assets are now under restrictions, she said.

""Russia is increasingly on an economic island,"" she said. ""If President Putin continues this unprovoked invasion, President Biden and our allies and partners around the world will remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to impose severe consequences against Russia and hold President Putin accountable for his illegal and amoral actions.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Progressive Democrat Jessica Cisneros' primary challenge to U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas will go to a runoff in a show of strength by the party's left, while raising questions among some analysts about her ability to win the seat in November's general election if she secures the party nomination.
The liberal Cisneros, 28, won enough votes to force a May 24 runoff in her second challenge to Cuellar. He is in his 18th year representing a south Texas congressional district that is heavily Hispanic and runs along the Rio Grande River. 
Results from the Texas secretary of state had Cuellar with 49.98% of the vote, just below the 50% needed to win the Democratic Party nomination for the 28th district seat. Cisneros got 45.38%. A third candidate, Tannya Judith Benavides, was eliminated with 4.64% of the vote.
Cuellar, 66, arguably is the House of Representatives' most conservative Democrat, a leaning that served him well in his nine previous races.
This time, Cisneros attacked Cuellar's opposition to an abortion rights bill and legislation making it easier for workers to get union representation. She also accused Cuellar of collaborating with Republicans last year on ""anti-immigration"" bills.
Another Texas progressive, former Austin City Council member Greg Casar, easily won his Democratic primary race for the 35th congressional district covering San Antonio and parts of Austin.
He beat back three Democratic challengers and advanced to the Nov. 8 election, where he will face a Republican opponent. 
In mid-February, progressive U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought her star power to a San Antonio rally in to boost Casar and Cisneros, a lawyer and immigrant rights advocate.
The winner of the Cuellar-Cisneros runoff will face the winner of a Republican runoff, who is sure to cast the Democrat as being too liberal for the district that shares a long boundary with Mexico and has been seeing record numbers of illegal border crossings by immigrants.
Democrats currently hold a narrow 222-211 House majority.
With Democratic President Joe Biden's national approval holding at 43% in this week's Reuters/Ipsos poll and inflation raging amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic, Republicans are favored to win control of the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
The race for the 28th district seat is already shaping up to be a premier battleground, as both parties fight for independent and undecided voters.
PROGRESSIVES SEE A BELLWETHER
Progressives hope that Cisneros' performance in Texas, which is the first state to hold a primary contest this election cycle, will reverberate nationally.
""Coming out of the gate, Texas is going to set the tone for progressive wins across the nation,"" Adrienne Bell, executive director of progressive political action committee Brand New Congress, said in a telephone interview before Tuesday's primary.
It is unclear whether revelations late in the campaign that FBI agents searched Cuellar's home and campaign office was a contributing factor to Cisneros' gains. He has denied any wrongdoing, and the FBI has not released more information on the raid.
A slate of progressives are competing for House seats in primaries, including in New York, California and Washington state. Progressives also are on primary ballots for U.S. Senate races such as in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Ohio.
But for many Democrats, it is the 2018 midterms and its 41-seat pickup in the House that serves as a preferred guidepost for 2022. While progressive candidates were energized by a series of notable primary wins, it was Democratic moderates who resonated with voters in highly competitive races against Republicans in the November general elections that year.
The district Cuellar and Cisneros are contesting has 71.6% of the population identifying as Latino. It has a moderate-to-conservative streak that for many fit with Cuellar's anti-abortion, policing and oil and gas industry orientation.
Latinos in the district ""tend to be much more conservative than, say, the AOCs of the East Coast"" on such flashpoint issues, said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, referring to Ocasio-Cortez.
As a result, he said he would expect Republicans to ""make a major investment in the district"" between now and November.
Democrats won the last two presidential races in the district, but so did Republican George W. Bush in 2004.
Karlyn Bowman, public opinion analyst for the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, applauded Cuellar as ""someone who has paid attention to his district's needs.""
But progressives, she added, ""are not responding to their concerns about inflation and ... immigration tensions.""

In an interview with Reuters before Tuesday's primary, Cisneros pushed back on the suggestion that her election would make the district more competitive for Republicans.
""If we continue doing the organizing that we're doing right now, we're probably going to be what people generally consider a safe blue (Democratic) district.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans challenging court-drawn congressional district maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania have asked the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to embrace an esoteric legal theory that could give politicians far greater power over elections.
The cases, filed using the court's emergency ""shadow docket"" that can allow it to act quickly and without the public deliberation that is a staple of major cases, seek to advance the ""independent state legislature doctrine,"" a little-known legal theory that could limit the ability of state courts to impose new maps.
The 6-3 majority conservative court is considering the Republicans' emergency requests to block lower court decisions that approved electoral maps for U.S. House of Representatives races replacing ones drawn by the Republican-led legislatures in the two states, where primary elections take place on May 17. The court, which has been increasingly assertive in taking up contentious cases, could act within days.
In the North Carolina case in particular, the Republican challengers place front and center the theory that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures, and not other entities such as state courts, the power to set rules governing elections, including where district lines are drawn. 
""They're very aggressive because they are asserting that legislatures when they are engaged in congressional redistricting are essentially immune from all state law,"" said Paul Smith, the senior vice president at Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan voting rights organization.
Critics say the independent state legislature doctrine flouts democratic principles because it could limit the ability of courts to block electoral districts designed to entrench one political party in power, known as gerrymandering.
EMPOWERS PARTISANSHIP
The doctrine could also stymie challenges on issues such as voter identification, mail-in ballots and drop boxes, which Republicans have sought to restrict in a number of states, and factor into lawsuits that arise in the heat of an election.
""It's dangerous because state politicians are the people most interested in crafting the rules of the game to help themselves and their side continue to win,"" said Josh Douglas, a voting rights expert at the University of Kentucky Rosenberg College of Law. 
In most states, lawmakers control the process of redrawing their congressional maps every 10 years after the U.S. Census has been taken. The Supreme Court in 2019 said federal courts are powerless to intervene to prevent partisan gerrymandering.
Republicans need to flip only a handful of seats in November's midterm elections to recapture control of the U.S. House and hinder much of Democratic President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.
The doctrine, which is gaining traction in conservative legal circles, is based in part on language in the U.S. Constitution that the ""times, places and manner"" of federal elections ""shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.""
The Republican challengers are pressing the theory at a time when the Supreme Court seems more receptive to it. 
Four of the court's conservative justices appeared to lend weight to the argument during the flurry of litigation around the 2020 election, when Republican lawmakers or officials sought to block court decisions requiring changes to election deadlines and rules, to account for the coronavirus pandemic.
For instance, in a case from Wisconsin last October, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion that ""state courts do not have a blank check to rewrite state election laws for federal elections."" 
Kavanaugh is one of three conservative justices appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, who has continued to falsely claim that his election defeat to Biden was the result of fraud, inspiring a wave of new restrictions on voting in Republican-led states.
The dispute in North Carolina centers on a state supreme court ruling last month that struck down the Republican-dominated legislature's congressional map as a violation of the state's constitution. 
That ruling came in two lawsuits brought by plaintiffs including Democratic voters and an environmental group claiming that the map was biased toward Republicans. A lower court then adopted a remedial map drawn by a bipartisan panel of experts. 
Republican lawmakers in the state urged the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, saying the federal Constitution ""does not give the state courts, or any other organ of state government, the power to second-guess the legislature's determinations."" 
In Pennsylvania, the state supreme court last month approved a new congressional map after Democratic Governor Tom Wolf vetoed one drawn by the majority-Republican legislature, saying it gave an unfair advantage to Republicans. 
Republicans, including one who is running for office, then sued to block the new map and turned to the U.S. Supreme Court when their efforts failed, saying the state court had ""no authority to impose a congressional map"" unless the legislature authorized it.
Their lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, told Reuters his argument was not as broad as that made in the North Carolina case because he concedes that courts can intervene when a legislatively enacted map violates the state or federal Constitution. 

""The problem is that the [Pennsylvania] court acted to impose a map of its choosing, not to remedy a state or federal constitutional violation,"" he said.
In another redistricting case on a different legal question, the court last month allowed Alabama to use a Republican-backed map, signaling further weakening of the Voting Rights Act enacted to protect minority voters.

Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who chairs the panel, is working to schedule another round of votes as soon as possible and is encouraging Republicans to show up for the vote, according to the spokesperson.
The nominations have been caught up in a dispute over the choice of Sarah Bloom Raskin as vice chair of supervision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden assailed Russian President Vladimir Putin, barred Russian flights from American airspace and led Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a rare display of unity on Tuesday in a State of the Union speech dominated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
""Let each of us if you're able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world,"" Biden urged Democrats and Republicans 
Lawmakers who are deeply divided over taxes, voting rights and gun safety stood together to applaud Ukraine, many waving Ukrainian flags and cheering in the chamber of the House of Representatives. Several women members of Congress wore the flag's colors of yellow and blue.
In a deviation from his prepared remarks, Biden said of Putin: ""He has no idea what's coming.""
Biden was looking to reset his presidency after a first year in office marked by rapid economic growth and trillions of dollars in new programs, but beset by the highest inflation in 40 years and a lingering coronavirus pandemic.
The annual speech to Congress gave Biden a platform to highlight his agenda, reassure fretful Americans and seek to boost his sluggish poll numbers amid dire warnings his fellow Democrats could face losses in November congressional elections.
The ovation joined by both parties marked a return to tradition for Washington. Two years ago, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was so disgusted with then-President Donald Trump's claims to be protecting healthcare insurance in his speech that she ripped her copy into pieces behind his back.
""The State of the Union is strong — because you, the American people, are strong,"" Biden said. ""We are stronger today than we were a year ago.""
For the first time in months, members of Congress were not required to wear masks in the chambers to guard against the pandemic, a sight that could provide helpful optics for the president.
A CNN snap poll of speech watchers showed 41% reacting very positively, 29% somewhat positively and 29% negatively.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has tested Biden's ability to respond rapidly to events without sending American forces into battle, and lead the West's response to the most tense period in relations with Russia since the Cold War ended 30 years ago.
The United States and its allies have launched withering sanctions against Russia's economy and financial system, Putin himself and his inner circle of oligarchs. Biden announced the United States will join other nations in banning Russian flights from American airspace.
The crisis forced Biden, whose chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year drew wide criticism, to reshape the speech to focus on uniting Americans around a global effort to punish Moscow and support Kyiv.
TAKING AIM AT PUTIN
He took aim at Putin, saying the Kremlin leader had badly miscalculated how events would unfold and that now ""Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.""
""He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people,"" he said. ""From President Zelenskiy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.""
In a show of support for Ukraine, first lady Jill Biden had as her guest at the speech the Ukraine ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, who traveled in the Biden motorcade from the White House to Capitol Hill.
Biden is battling rising inflation exacerbated by the Russian crisis and has been assailed by Republicans who accused him of allowing it to get out of control. He called for companies to make more cars and semiconductors in the United States so Americans would be less reliant on imports.
The evening was not without its partisan moments. Two far-right Republican lawmakers, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, shouted ""build the wall"" to show their displeasure with Biden's immigration policy. ""Sit down,"" shouted a Democratic lawmaker in response.
Biden himself offered some criticism of progressive policies in his party critical of police killings of Black men, saying: ""The answer is not to defund the police. It's to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training...to protect the community.""
Meanwhile, Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat responsible for blocking Biden's Build Back Better spending plan, spent the entire speech seated with Republicans on their side of the chamber.
Biden had some progress to tout: The economy grew faster than it has since 1984 with 6.6 million jobs created, the government distributed hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccines, and he has nominated the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Biden and his fellow Democrats face the prospect of losing control of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate in Nov. 8 midterm elections. An uptick in Biden's approval ratings might help prevent that and strengthen his chances of making good on his agenda.
Americans' approval of Biden's response to the Russian invasion rose over the past week, with 43% saying they approve in a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday, up from 34% last week. Some 47% disapproved of Biden response's to the crisis, however, and his overall popularity has held near the low point of his presidency in recent weeks.

Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, in the Republican response to Biden's speech knocked his handling of the Ukraine crisis and inflation.
""Weakness on the world stage has a cost and the president's approach to foreign policy has consistently been too little, too late,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday vowed that Russia's Vladimir Putin will pay dearly over the long run even for his invasion of Ukraine, even if his military campaign succeeds in the short term.
""While he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address. Straying from the prepared text, Biden added ""He has no idea what's coming."" He did not elaborate.
Biden spoke to Congress on the sixth day of Russia's invasion of its European neighbor and as Kyiv stared down a miles-long armored Russian column potentially preparing to take over the Ukrainian capital, and the U.S. and a growing group of allies tighten sanctions. 
In the prime time speech, Biden announced a new step banning Russian flights from using American airspace and a Justice Department effort to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin.
He also signaled steps to hobble Russia's military in the future, even as he acknowledged it could improve its position in Ukraine.
""We are choking off Russia's access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come,"" he said. 
""When the history of this era is written Putin's war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger,"" he said.
Biden, who spoke earlier in the day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has rejected direct U.S. military participation on the ground in Ukraine.

But the U.S. government has shared intelligence on Russia's operations and led the world in imposing a historic set of economic sanctions on Putin's government, allies and the country's largest banks, sending the currency into freefall.
Nearly a week since Russian troops poured over the border, they have not captured any major Ukrainian cities after running into fiercer resistance than they expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden faced a formidable challenge in his first State of the Union speech, after a year in office buffeted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a jittery economy and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Biden served notice on Tuesday that much of the world is united against Russian aggression while also trying to seize the moment to make Americans feel optimistic about the days ahead.
Here are some takeaways from his speech:
UNITY ON RUSSIA
The conflict in Ukraine has given Biden some rare bipartisan support, and the American public is slowly warming to his handling of the crisis.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Biden at 43% approval for his response – a jump of nine points from last week. Even with the bump, Biden’s overall approval rating, however, remained underwater at 43%.
In his speech Biden stressed two points crucial to maintaining public support for his actions: He pledged to continue organizing a global coalition to place financial pressure on Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin, while at the same time ensuring that U.S. forces will not be involved in the fighting. For that he received sustained applause from Republicans in the chamber.
""He did a high-level job explaining to the American public why this matters,"" said Rodell Mollineau, a strategist and longtime Democratic Senate aide. 
Most significantly, Biden warned viewers at home there will be not be a quick resolution to the crisis and that some sacrifices – including higher energy prices – might have to be made.
Those were sobering words coming after two years of wrestling with the pandemic, societal upheaval and rampant inflation. “This is a real test,” Biden said. “It’s going to take time.”
A NEW PHASE OF COVID-19
The president sought to use his address to signal that the nation was entering a new phase of the pandemic, one where, as he put it, “COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.”
Aiding Biden's argument were the optics: There were few masks worn by members of Congress in attendance, and Biden himself wore no mask. All of it suggested that the country was in a different place than just a few months ago. 
""That was important for the public to see,"" said Mark Riddle, executive director of Future Majority, a moderate Democratic research firm. 
Republicans have used school closings in part to mount an all-out attack on Democrats on education issues and plan to continue that ahead of November's midterm elections, when control of Congress is at stake and Biden's Democrats are considered vulnerable. 
While Biden pledged that the nation would remain vigilant for new strains of the virus, he stressed that the era of business lockdowns and school closings was over. “Our kids need to be in school,” he said, earning applause from both Democrats and Republicans.
A LONG-TERM PLAN ON INFLATION
Biden spent much of the rest of his remarks advancing his largely stalled domestic agenda — and in doing so, also attempted to blunt Republican attacks this election cycle.
He sought to persuade Americans that the way to battle rising prices was to lower costs, either through manufacturing more goods in the country or through making drugs and childcare more affordable.
A problem for Biden and his party is that none of those solutions can happen quickly – certainly not in the time Democrats need to campaign before November.
""His plan, to fight inflation by lowering costs, not wages, and increasing productivity capacity could dampen inflation in the longer term but not in the near-term,"" David Chao, a global markets analyst with Invesco in Hong Kong, told Reuters.
Riddle said it was important for Biden to stress domestic manufacturing.
""It's critical to our success moving forward,"" he said. 
FIGHTING CRIME
Biden took on the issue of rising gun violence in the nation’s cities by explicitly pushing back against calls by progressives in his party to defund police departments.
“The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities,"" he said, a line that drew applause from some Republicans in the chamber.
At the same time, Biden called for increased community services and bans of high-powered assault weapons, an appeal to progressives. 

Biden's remarks on crime, inflation, education and, most of all, the pandemic, were meant to send a signal that he understands what Americans have been through during the past two years, Mollineau said.
""We are stronger today than we were a year ago,"" Biden said in concluding his speech. ""And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.""

(Reuters) - Greg Casar, a former Austin city councillor, has won the Democratic primary in a central Texas district, AP said on Tuesday, in a victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic party.
Casar will face off against a Republican opponent in November for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, although the district is considered safely Democratic.

252,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 12:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. President Joe Biden spoke about the need to support Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian invasion of their country, lawmakers and officials also showed their support for Ukraine through their attire.
Dozens of lawmakers, including Democratic lawmaker Lori Trahan and Republican congresswoman Victoria Spartz, who is Ukrainian-American and who was born in Ukraine, attended the speech wearing blue and yellow, the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Jill Biden, the first lady, also participated in the fashion diplomacy. She wore an embroidered applique of a sunflower, Ukraine's national flower, on her dress sleeve in a sign of support for the country's people, the White House said.
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, meanwhile, said in a tweet that she was wearing a scarf - which also had blue and yellow elements - given to her last year by Ukraine's foreign minister.
Other lawmakers carried miniature Ukrainian flags, at times waving them around to demonstrate support for the president's remarks.
Even Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who gave the Republican response to Biden's address outside her state's Capitol, got in on the action, sporting a pin that included the Ukrainian flag.
The speech itself was dominated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden assailed Russian President Vladimir Putin, barred Russian flights from American airspace and led Democratic and Republican lawmakers in a rare display of unity. 

Fashion at the State of the Union has garnered outsized attention at a president's annual speech before. In 2019, Democratic women lawmakers wore white to celebrate 100 years of women having the right to vote in the United States.
First-term Republican lawmaker Lauren Boebert, clad entirely in black, issued a different message on Tuesday with her clothes: ""Drill Baby Drill"" scrawled in gold across a black shawl, urging an increase in U.S. energy production.

255,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:23PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Here are highlights of President Joe Biden's first formal State of the Union address on Tuesday:
RUSSIA
""We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address.
""He has no idea what's coming.""
""While he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run,"" he said.
""We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come,"" he said. 
INFLATION
""We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I think I have a better idea to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America.""
""More jobs where you can earn a good living in America instead of relying on foreign supply chains let's make it in America."" 
INFRASTRUCTURE ""We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re going to have an infrastructure decade.""
""We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports and waterways all across America. 
And we’ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.""
""We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes — so every child — and every American — has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American — urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities.""
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING 
""The revitalization of American manufacturing: Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.""
""Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs are created in America last year alone.""
TAXES
""Let's make corporations and wealthy American start paying their fair share.""
""Last year 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes. It's not fair. ""
""That's why I proposed the 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.""
COVID-19 
""For more than two years COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of this nation. And I know you're tired and frustrated and exhausted that don't even count close to a million people who sit at the dining room table or kitchen table looking at an empty chair because they lost somebody.""
""Tonight I can say we're moving forward safely back to a more normal routines.""
""We never will just accept living with COVID-19 will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard.""

""We'll never give up on vaccinating more Americans""
""Now I know parents of kids under five are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children. Scientists are working hard to get that done and we'll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do. We're already we are also ready with antiviral treatments.""

However, Biden's overall approval numbers remained virtually unchanged, with 43% of Americans supporting the way the president has handled his job, in a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday. More than half - 54% - said they disapproved of Biden's performance, with 61% of respondents saying the country was on the wrong track.
A strong majority - 71% - of respondents to the poll on Ukraine said they believed the United States should provide it with weapons to respond to attacks that have seen Russians bomb urban areas as a six-day assault on its neighbor stalls. Some 77% said the United States should impose additional sanctions on Russia as a result. Support was bipartisan, with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents backing those moves.
A majority of respondents, 58%, said paying more for fuel and gas because of the crisis was worthwhile to defend another democratic country. That was up from 49% who agreed with that statement in a poll taken on Feb. 23 and 24. Democrats were more likely to agree strongly or somewhat with that stance than Republicans and independents.
Some 75% of respondents said they believed that doing nothing in Ukraine would embolden Russia to take further military action elsewhere in Europe, up from 71% a week earlier. Among Democrats, 77% said they believed that, as well as 78% of Republicans, while 68% of independents agreed with that belief.
However, some 47% disapproved of Biden's response to the crisis, more than the 43% who approved of it. Biden's overall popularity has held near the low point of his presidency in recent weeks.

He will have another chance to reach out to Americans on Tuesday night, when he gives his State of the Union address. Biden intends to use the annual speech both to stress the importance of countering Russian President Vladimir Putin and to push his domestic economic agenda, administration officials said.
The poll on Ukraine was conducted online and in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,005 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3.8 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Republicans largely support President Joe Biden's actions toward Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but that lawmakers have hit a snag in efforts to agree on aid to Kyiv.
""I think there's broad support for the president in what he's doing now. Our biggest complaint is, what took him so long?"" McConnell told a press conference after the Biden administration ratcheted up sanctions against Russia and its central bank. 
""Much of this might have deterred the aggression in advance. But, yes, we're all together behind the Ukrainian people. We're thrilled at the changes that have occurred within NATO, and I think I've seen our country pretty unified. As a matter of fact, the whole world seems to be unified,"" McConnell said.
The White House is seeking $6.4 billion in humanitarian and security aid from Congress for Ukraine. Democrats intend to include the funding in an omnibus spending bill that lawmakers in the House of Representatives expect to vote on next week.
But McConnell said talks have bogged down over the defense segment of the Ukraine aid package, which he said Democrats wanted to fund from a defense spending level agreed to before the invasion.
""We're not going to do that,"" McConnell told reporters, adding that in an emergency, the process should be different.
""We’ve hit a snag,"" he said.
Before Russian forces invaded Ukraine last week, McConnell was among a chorus of Republicans calling on Biden to impose sanctions against Moscow in hopes of dissuading aggression by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Other Republicans continue to blast Biden for what they claim to be weak leadership and have used the Ukraine crisis to stump for longstanding Republican policies that include reducing environmental regulation and boosting fossil fuel production.

McConnell also rejected former President Donald Trump's characterization of Putin's actions in Ukraine as ""genius"" and ""pretty savvy.""
""What President Putin is, is a ruthless thug who's just invaded another sovereign country and killed thousands of innocent people. That's what President Putin is,"" McConnell said when asked about Trump's remarks.

""The Select Committee is seeking information about attempts to disrupt or delay the certification of electoral votes and any efforts to corruptly change the outcome of the 2020 election,"" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, said in a statement.
""The six individuals we've subpoenaed today all have knowledge related to those matters and will help the Select Committee better understand all the various strategies employed to potentially affect the outcome of the election,"" Thompson said. 

The committee is trying to establish the actions of Trump and his inner circle during the assault on the Capitol by thousands of his supporters. They attacked police, vandalized the Capitol and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives as they gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory over Trump.
The Select Committee has so far interviewed more than 560 witnesses, issued more than 80 subpoenas and obtained more than 50,000 pages of records as it probes the causes of the assault on the Capitol, and the role played by Trump, who continues to push false claims that his election defeat by Biden was the result of fraud.

262,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 04:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A judge in Michigan on Tuesday denied an entrapment motion made by defense lawyers for three men accused of conspiring to kidnap the state's governor, according to local media reports, meaning their trials may proceed.
Jackson County Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson's ruling will allow terrorism, gang affiliation and firearm charges to move forward against defendants Paul Bellar, Joseph Morrison and Pete Musico, the Detroit Free Press reported.
They are among 13 men facing federal and criminal charges stemming from a plot to abduct Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, threaten law enforcement and attack the state legislature. The alleged plot was motivated by opposition to state coronavirus restrictions and the 2020 presidential election in 2020.
The court did not immediately respond to a request for more information from Reuters.
Defense attorneys filed the entrapment motion in an effort to get Wilson to throw out the charges. Attorneys sought to weaken the state's case against the defendants following testimony by an FBI informant on Monday, according to the Free Press.
An entrapment defense claims that a defendant only committed a crime due to coercion by a government actor.
The FBI said it uncovered the conspiracy by members of a militia group, which led to the charges in state and federal court.
In October 2020, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel unveiled state charges against seven men affiliated with the Wolverine Watchmen and accused of violating the state’s anti-terrorism act by conspiring to kidnap the governor and propagate violence. A total of 19 felony charges were filed.
The Wolverine Watchmen group had used social media to recruit members, and trained with firearms to prepare for the “boogaloo,” a term used in the militia movement for an uprising against the government or impending civil war, according to affidavits in support of the state charges.

In February, Kaleb Franks became the second person facing federal charges to agree to plead guilty. He is set to testify in a trial later this month.
Ty Garbin, who previously pleaded guilty to charges related to the plot, in August received a sentence of just over six years in prison after testifying against others associated with the Wolverine Watchmen militia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Senate Republican and the architect of the party caucus's campaign strategy were at odds on Tuesday over a controversial legislative plan intended to tell voters what to expect if Republicans capture control of the chamber in the November midterm elections. 
The 11-point ""Rescue America"" plan proposed by Senator Rick Scott had already rankled many Republicans with proposals that would impose income taxes on Americans who currently earn too little to pay taxes and require all legislation enacted by Congress to sunset after five years. 
But on Tuesday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell made it clear that initiatives of the kind proposed by Scott would be out of the question.
""If we're fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I'll be the majority leader. I'll decide, in consultation with my members, what to put on the floor,"" McConnell said at a Republican leadership news conference that Scott also attended. 
""Let me tell you what will not be a part of our agenda. We will not have, as part of our agenda, a bill that raises taxes on half of the American people and that sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. That will not be part the Republican Senate majority agenda,"" he said. 
Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee that oversees the Senate Republican campaign effort, had walked away before McConnell began speaking. 
On Saturday, Scott told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, that Republicans would not deserve to govern if they won back the Senate majority and failed to pursue the policies put forward in his plan.

The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democrats in control because Vice President Kamala Harris wields a tie-breaking vote. To retake the majority, Republicans would need support from independent voters, who party strategists fear could be put off by the Scott proposal. 
A Scott spokesman said the senator proposed the framework on his own, not as the Senate Republican campaign chairman.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will tell a U.S Senate committee on Wednesday that the Biden administration recognizes the role of states in deciding how to prioritize using federal highway funds.
Many Senate Republicans have criticized a December memo from the Federal Highway Administration that deemphasizes projects that increase highway capacity.
""Different states and communities have different needs when it comes to transportation assets that have to be reconfigured and modernized, expanded and added, or retired and replaced, as appropriate,"" Buttigieg said in his written testimony, which was seen by Reuters. ""I want to make clear that we recognize and value the role of the states in deciding how to prioritize the use of formula dollars, as laid out in the law.""
The $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law in November provides an additional $110 billion in funding over five years to repair roads and bridges and support transformational projects.
The December memo says the money in most cases ""should be used to repair and maintain existing transportation infrastructure before making new investments in highway expansions for additional general purpose capacity.""
Buttigieg will tell the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee that ""maintaining and improving our existing infrastructure is critical to building a better, cleaner, more modern transportation system.""
Some climate activists want the Biden administration to slow or halt expansion of highways, arguing that more highways and capacity will boost vehicle use - and instead should do more to boost the use of buses, trains and other mass transit.

The infrastructure legislation, which was passed in Congress with bipartisan support, distributes 90% of federal-aid highway funding to states via a formula and largely retains the existing formula program structure, Senate Republicans said.
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Environment and Public Works panel, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a Feb. 9 letter https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/c/8c3b1b65-550b-493b-b6cd-33b108e53eac/B44AC4860614C4E3FD4712AAB8652E9C.2022-02-07-general-iija-governors-letter.pdf that the December memo seeks to ""implement a wish list of policies not reflected"" in the infrastructure law, arguing that the U.S. Transportation Department cannot ""dictate how states should use their federal formula funding.""

U.S. lawmakers last month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-aims-prompt-passage-stop-gap-bill-avert-government-shutdown-2022-02-17 had approved a stopgap funding bill to fund federal agencies through March 11.

He added that he had urged the chair of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, Rosa DeLauro, to work on getting a bill together that could go to the House floor ""hopefully as early as Tuesday.""
The government has been operating on temporary spending extensions since Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, as Republicans and Democrats have struggled to agree on funding levels.

268,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Monday it is denying executive privilege to advisers of former President Donald Trump, whose testimony is being sought by a congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. 
In letters dated Feb. 28, a White House lawyer explained to former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro and to a lawyer for Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, that President Joe Biden had determined that executive privilege ""is not in the national interest, and therefore is not justified"" in certain matters before the committee.
Deputy White House counsel Jonathan C. Su wrote in separate letters regarding the two cases that the subjects where executive privilege did not apply included ""events within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.""
Navarro said he emailed Su, arguing it is ""fanciful and dangerous"" for a sitting president to be able to revoke his predecessor's executive privilege. ""See you at the Supreme Court,"" he added in the email to Su, which Navarro shared with Reuters. 
In a separate letter to Su that was also shared with Reuters, Flynn attorney David Warrington said ""at no time has executive privilege been asserted by us or our client,"" in connection with the committee subpoena, adding that Flynn had not refused to appear for any depositions.
News of the letters was first reported by Axios.
Trump has urged his associates not to cooperate with the committee, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
On Jan. 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 presidential election loss to Biden. Shortly before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through fraud and urging them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"".
The committee issued a subpoena to Flynn in November, seeking testimony and documents about a ""command center"" at Washington's Willard Hotel set up to steer efforts to deny Biden victory.
In the weeks after the election, Flynn urged Trump to deploy the military to overturn the results and gave speeches sowing doubts about the vote. In December, Flynn sued the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack in hopes of blocking it from obtaining his phone records. 

The committee announced this month that it had subpoenaed Navarro, a key player in Trump's effort to overturn his election defeat.
The House of Representatives committee said it is seeking records and deposition testimony from Navarro, who was involved in efforts to delay Congress' certification of the 2020 election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Congress held a hearing on Tuesday to examine U.S. arms export policy after years of permissive exports under then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
The hearing came amid pressure on President Joe Biden's administration and allies to supply anti-tank and antiaircraft weapons to Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion.
During a U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee hearing, Jessica Lewis, the State Department's assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, who oversees weapons deals, said the Biden administration's philosophy is to lead with diplomacy, but nevertheless provide ""urgently needed ammunition and Javelin anti-tank missiles"" to Ukraine while simultaneously authorizing transfers of U.S.-origin military technology from NATO allies.
Javelin anti-tank missiles are made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp.
Over the weekend, Biden's administration approved up to $350 million worth of additional weapons transfers from U.S. stocks to Ukraine, including antiaircraft systems, anti-armor munitions, small arms, body armor and various munitions. Over the past year, the United States has committed more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. 
At the hearing Mike Rogers (NYSE:ROG), the top Republican on the committee, criticized the Biden administration's arms transfers as ""too little, too late."" 

Biden's administration overhauled the U.S. arms export policy last year to increase an emphasis on human rights when evaluating deals. When the new conventional arms transfer policy is made public, it will formalize the departure from Trump's prioritization of the economic benefits of arms sales. 
Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments fell 21% to $138 billion in fiscal 2021, according to State Department figures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bill to protect the right to have an abortion in the United States died in the Senate on Monday after it failed to garner enough Republican support to pass a procedural vote. 
While the Women's Health Protection Act was expected to fail, Democratic leaders were under pressure from constituents to put it to a vote anyway in a show of support for federal abortion rights, as the U.S. Supreme Court could soon upend those rights. 
Reproductive rights advocates see federal legislation as possibly the best chance to codify the right to terminate pregnancy in the United States, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative justices signaled they could soon cut constitutional protections.
The bill would have needed several Republicans' support to reach the necessary 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. It received 46 yeas and 48 nays. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, voted against the bill, as did Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, moderate Republicans who have supported limited abortion rights. 
""Abortion is a fundamental right and women's decisions over women's healthcare belong to women, not to extremist right-wing legislators,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of Monday's vote. 
Abortion opponents characterized the bill as radical and said it would nullify state laws that have been passed to restrict abortions.
""It's extreme. It's an egregious violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, and that is the right to life,"" Republican Senator Steve Daines of Montana said of the bill in debate on Monday.
ON THE RECORD
The Women's Health Protection Act, co-sponsored by 48 Senate Democrats, stated that healthcare providers should be able to provide abortions without a number of barriers - including restrictions on abortions prior to fetal viability, which many states currently have in place. It proposed that the U.S. attorney general could sue any state or government official who violated its terms.
Abortion rights advocates said the fact that the Senate was holding the vote at all was a victory, since it forced senators to go on the record for their constituents to judge. 
Abortion is poised to be a key campaign issue for members of Congress running for re-election in 2022.
""Every American deserves to know where their senator stands on an issue as important as the right to choose,"" Schumer told reporters. 
The right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability, typically around 23 or 24 weeks, has been protected under the Constitution since the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. 

In December, the Supreme Court signaled its willingness to undermine Roe v. Wade and permit a Mississippi ban on abortion after 15 weeks. The court's decision in that case is expected in late spring.
Some 26 states would move to immediately ban abortion if Roe is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy research group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke out on Monday against two Republican members of Congress who appeared at a white nationalist conference last week, making him the latest prominent Republican to rule out any role for racist politics in the party.
""There's no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism,"" McConnell said in a statement, after being asked by a reporter about appearances by Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar at a meeting of the America First Political Action Conference.
The conference was organized by white nationalist activist Nicholas Fuentes, who has a history of making anti-Semitic statements. 
The controversy underscores the political infighting between establishment Republicans and right-wing conservatives that has wracked the Republican Party, as it attempts to retake majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in November's midterm elections. 
Fuentes, who introduced Greene at the conference, asked his audience for a round of applause for Russia as Russian forces attacked Ukraine. 
Greene and Gosar have come under fire in recent days from Republican Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, as well as McConnell. It was not clear how much weight their criticism carries. 
McConnell, Romney and Cheney are establishment Republicans often targeted for criticism by former President Donald Trump. Cheney was censured by the Republican National Committee this month for joining the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot by Trump supporters. 
Greene and Gosar, both staunch Trump allies, have already been stripped of their House committee assignments by Democrats: Greene for incendiary remarks including support for violence against Democrats, and Gosar for an anime video that depicted him killing Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Greene was characteristically defiant in the face of criticism after her appearance at the conference.
""I am not going to play the guilt by association game in which you demand every conservative should justify anything ever said by anyone they've ever shared a room with,"" the Georgia Republican wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) over the weekend.

""I'm also not going to turn down the opportunity to speak to 1,200 young America First patriots because of a few off-color remarks by another speaker, even if I find those remarks unsavory,"" Greene said.
In June, Greene publicly apologized after being criticized for remarks comparing COVID-19 mask requirements and vaccinations to the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared skeptical of the federal government's authority to issue sweeping regulations to reduce carbon emissions from power plants in a case that could undermine President Joe Biden's plans to tackle climate change. 
The court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has shown wariness toward broad federal agency actions, was weighing the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal- and gas-fired power plants under the landmark Clean Air Act.
Although some justices questioned the EPA's power in an abstract sense, it remained unclear how they would rule, as lawyers representing the EPA and power companies pushed back against a decision that would prevent the agency from issuing any regulation that went ""outside the fenceline"" - meaning beyond restrictions on individual plants.
An eventual ruling restricting the EPA's authority could hamstring the administration's ability to curb the power sector's emissions - representing about a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gases. The United States, behind only China in greenhouse gas emissions, is a pivotal player in efforts to combat climate change on a global basis.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito indicated that any broad assertion of authority sought by the EPA would constitute a ""major question"" that under court precedent requires Congress to have expressly authorized it.
""You are claiming that the interpretation gives you the authority to set industrial policy and energy policy and balance such things as jobs, economic impact, the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change as well as costs,"" Alito told U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing Biden's administration.
The Supreme Court is reviewing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's 2021 decision striking down Republican former President Donald Trump's Affordable Clean Energy rule. That regulation would have imposed limits on a Clean Air Act provision called Section 111 that provides the EPA authority to regulate emissions from existing power plants.
The United Nations earlier in the day released a 3,675-page report https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/un-climate-report-urges-world-adapt-now-or-suffer-later-2022-02-28 urging global action to combat climate change. Outside the Supreme Court, a small group of demonstrators carried signs reading ""Protect the Clean Air Act.""
The case was pursued by Republican-led states led by coal producer West Virginia. Other challengers include coal companies and coal-friendly industry groups. Coal is among the most greenhouse gas-intensive fuels.
Democratic-led states and major power companies https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-utilities-side-with-environment-agency-supreme-court-climate-case-2022-01-27 including Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED),  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) and PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp sided with Biden's administration, as did the Edison Electric Institute, an investor-owned utility trade group.
During the argument, their lawyer Beth Brinkmann, stressed the value of flexibility that would allow for some ""outside the fenceline"" regulation, including authorization of emissions trading between plants. 
That argument seemed to draw some interest from the bench, including conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.
""I don't know how you can draw such clean distinctions,"" Thomas told Yaakov Roth, a lawyer representing coal companies.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said that ""inside the fenceline"" regulations can be just as onerous on coal plants as a more industry-wide rule.
""Reform can be very small or can be catastrophic. There are 'inside the fence' technological fixes that could drive the entire coal industry out of business tomorrow, and an 'outside the fence' rule could be very small, or it could be very large,"" Kagan said.
The rule proposed by Trump, a supporter of the U.S. coal industry who also questioned climate change science, was meant to supplant Democratic former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan mandating major reductions in carbon emissions from the power industry. 
The Supreme Court blocked https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-carbon/supreme-court-blocks-obama-carbon-emissions-plan-idUSKCN0VI2A0 Clean Power Plan implementation in 2016 without ruling on its lawfulness.
Coal-aligned groups want the justices to rule that Biden's administration cannot take a sweeping approach to regulating carbon emissions under Section 111. Such a decision would prevent the EPA from enforcing industry-wide changes, limiting it to actions targeting individual plants.

That would be a blow for the administration, which wants the U.S. power sector decarbonized by 2035. If Biden's administration loses the case, Congress would need to pass new legislation for the government to impose sweeping climate-related regulations - unlikely given congressional divisions.
Prelogar said the EPA will unveil a proposed new regulation by the end of the year, which would likely come after the Supreme Court's ruling - expected by the end of June.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - At a large weekend gathering of conservatives in Florida, attendees browsed a sea of merchandise emblazoned with ""Trump"": Pink cowboy hats, sparkly purses, and T-shirts touting him as the 2024 presidential candidate. 
But buried within the brassy rows of Trump merchandise at The MAGA Mall store were hats touting another figure: Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seen as a potential 2024 rival to former President Donald Trump, who has hinted repeatedly that he wants to run again. 
DeSantis is the only governor for whom Ronald Solomon, owner of The MAGA Mall, says he sells merchandise. Yet, if the store's sales are predictive of political wins, Trump need not fret. For every DeSantis hat sold, Solomon said he sells around 50 featuring Trump. 
""It's Trump's party,"" Solomon said of the Republican Party as he attended to a group of young women at his stall at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a get-together of American right-wing notables, in Orlando, more famous as the home of the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) World theme park.
That was unquestionably the maxim at the four-day CPAC gathering that ended on Sunday, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republican voters, right-wing media figures and conservative pundits who professed support for the former president.
Trump spoke to a rapturous crowd on Saturday, underlining his hold over the Republican base ahead of November's congressional elections. 
Slightly improving his results from last year's poll at the Orlando gathering, Trump received 59% of support in a straw poll on possible 2024 White House contenders.
CPAC tends to draw from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, and its polls are not necessarily a reliable predictor of the eventual nominee. 
Trump has not confirmed another run for the White House, but has hinted at it heavily - calling himself the ""45th and 47th"" president of the United States in a recent social media video. He alluded to it again in his speech on Saturday, saying ""we're going to be doing it again, a third time.""
Still, Trump's laser fixation on falsely claiming he was the victim of fraud in the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, has some establishment Republicans worried he is more interested in nursing grievances than charting the party's future. 
But Trump's pull with the base - his frequent rallies attract big crowds and many congressional candidates crave his endorsement - means establishment worries could ultimately be immaterial. 
""We will make America proud again! We will make America safe again! And we will make America great again!"" Trump said as he wrapped up Saturday night's speech to deafening cheers. 
CPAC, which touts itself as the ""largest and most influential"" worldwide gathering of conservatives, gives potential candidates nationwide media exposure and a chance to generate buzz. 
Given Trump's dominance, only the congressional, criminal and civil investigations into Trump seem to have the potential to derail the 75-year-old former real estate magnate from running, said Doug Heye, a former Republican aide.
Trump is dealing with a New York state civil inquiry into his family business and a congressional panel looking into the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters seeking to overturn the election results.
""It's not just that it can knock him off the pedestal,"" said Heye. ""It could cause him to remove himself from the pedestal."" 
'WE LISTEN TO TRUMP' 
At The MAGA Mall, retiree and Republican activist Nicole Bommarito, 49, already decked out in a T-shirt insulting Vice-President Kamala Harris, bought a ""TRUMP WON"" cowboy hat. 
""Trump is the person we listen to,"" said Bommarito, who moved to Florida from New York last year because she felt the state better reflected her values. Still, her alternative 2024 candidate reflected Solomon's inventory: ""If Donald Trump doesn't run, DeSantis is our first pick."" 
She is not alone: When asked at CPAC for whom they would vote if Trump doesn't throw his hat in, 61% chose DeSantis. 
The MAGA Mall's owner, Solomon, who criss-crosses the country to sell merchandise at Trump rallies, was certain that Trump, who has endorsed dozens of midterm candidates and publishes near-daily statements attacking Biden, would run.
""He's not going to hand this off to somebody else. It would be like him building a building in New York and giving it to Seymour Durst,"" said Solomon, referring to the late real estate mogul.
Many CPAC attendees said DeSantis, a 43-year-old former lawyer with three young children and a wife who has been battling breast cancer, could easily wait and run for president in 2028. 
DeSantis did not give any hints about his plans during his CPAC speech, which made no mention of Trump or 2024. Instead, DeSantis touted himself as a principled fighter keeping Florida open for business in the face of hysteria over COVID-19.

While his speech was well-received, DeSantis was given a speaking slot on Thursday, the more thinly attended first day of the conference. Buzz around him had largely waned by the weekend. 
Back at The MAGA Mall, Bommarito decided not to buy any DeSantis merchandise. ""I'll get it tomorrow,"" she said.

The White House summit, part of U.S. efforts to step up engagement with a region Washington sees as critical to its efforts to push back against China's growing power, had been expected earlier in the year, but scheduling was delayed by COVID-19 concerns.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian leaders (ASEAN) will commemorate 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations. 
""It is a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration to serve as a strong, reliable partner and to strengthen an empowered and unified ASEAN to address the challenges of our time,"" she said in announcing the summit.
On a visit to Malaysia in December, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the 10-member ASEAN bloc was ""essential to the architecture of the Indo-Pacific region.""
He said the summit was expected to discuss the crisis caused by last year's military takeover in Myanmar and issues such as pandemic recovery, climate change, investment and infrastructure. 
The Biden administration has declared the Indo-Pacific and competition with China its principal foreign policy focus, which it is keen to maintain despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Biden joined ASEAN leaders in a virtual summit in October, the first time in four years Washington had engaged at top level with the bloc.
He pledged to stand with ASEAN in defending freedom of the seas and democracy, and said Washington would start talks on developing a regional economic framework, something critics say U.S. Asia strategy has lacked since his predecessor Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact.

The Biden administration announced a 12-page strategy for the Indo-Pacific in early February, in which it vowed to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the region to counter what its sees as China's bid to create a regional sphere of influence and become the world's most influential power.
The document reiterated U.S. plans to launch a regional economic framework in early 2022, but few details of that have emerged and the Biden administration has been reluctant to offer the increased market access Asian countries desire, seeing this as threatening American jobs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and NATO on Sunday condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's order to put his nuclear forces on high alert as dangerous and unacceptable, while the White House said it has not ruled out imposing new sanctions on Russia's energy sector.
In issuing the order to prepare Russia's nuclear weapons for increased readiness for launch, Putin cited ""aggressive statements"" from NATO allies and widespread sanctions imposed by Western nations.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" program that Putin's actions have escalated the conflict and were ""unacceptable.""
Thomas-Greenfield said the United States was ""continuing to look at new and even harsher measures against the Russians."" 
At the Pentagon, a senior U.S. defense official also described Putin's nuclear order as an escalation and said it was ""putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous."" 
The United States is trying to determine what Putin's order means ""in tangible terms,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
On CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called Putin's nuclear order ""aggressive"" and ""irresponsible.""
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Putin was responding to an imaginary threat.
""We've seen him do this time and time again. At no point has Russia been under threat from NATO, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine,"" Psaki said on ABC's ""This Week"" program.
U.S. APPEALS TO CHINA
The United States has not taken sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector off the table, Psaki said.
""But we also want to do that and make sure we're minimizing the impact on the global marketplace and do it in a united way,"" she added.
The Biden administration has worried that its sanctions could raise already-high gas and energy prices in the United States and has taken steps to mitigate that. When it issued sanctions targeting major Russian banks on Thursday, it allowed an exception for energy-related transactions.
In the administration's most urgent public appeal yet to China, Psaki urged the Communist state to issue a formal condemnation of Russia's invasion. 
""This is not a time to stand on the sidelines,"" Psaki said on MSNBC. ""This is a time to be vocal and condemn the actions of President Putin and Russia invading a sovereign country."" 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday that China respects countries' sovereignty, including Ukraine's, but that Russia's concerns about NATO's eastward expansion should be properly addressed.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continued to take an increasingly sharp tone toward Putin, showing that for now both parties are largely backing the Biden administration's efforts. 
Representative Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, told the Fox News Channel following the Russian president's nuclear order that ""no country in the world should stand with Putin.""
On CNN, Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, called Putin ""a small, evil feral-eyed man who is trying to shape the world in the image where once again Russia would be an empire - and that's not going to happen."" 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday announced $54 million in new humanitarian aid for Ukrainians affected by the invasion, which was in addition to the $350 million sent by the United States last week.

""This includes the provision of food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, winterization, and protection,"" Blinken said in a statement.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate's majority leader, said the White House's request for an additional $6.4 billion in aid would be taken up by the Senate in the coming days.

Authorities were taking the step to protect President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech scheduled for Tuesday and to ""prevent any disruption to the important work of Congress,"" U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said.
The fencing was previously installed after supporters of former President Donald Trump rampaged through the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed effort to block Congress from formally certifying his 2020 election loss to Biden. It was removed last July.
A group of American truckers began a cross-country trip from California to Washington last week, inspired by Canadian protests against COVID-19 restrictions that paralyzed Ottawa for three weeks.

More than two dozen 18-wheeler trucks, along with about 50 pickups and recreational vehicles, left Adelanto, California, about 80 miles (130 km) northeast of Los Angeles, last Wednesday. This self-styled ""People's Convoy"" is bound for the Beltway, a major highway encircling the U.S. capital, to demand an end to COVID-19 vaccine and mask requirements.
The Pentagon previously said it approved hundreds of National Guard troops and tactical vehicles to help at traffic posts in light of the protest.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -Some 59% of attendees at the CPAC conservative conference in Florida want former Republican President Donald Trump to be the party's 2024 presidential candidate, according to a straw poll released on Sunday. 
Underscoring the unparalleled sway Trump enjoys over the Republican base, his closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, garnered 28% of votes at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Orlando. 
CPAC tends to draw from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, and its polls are not necessarily a reliable predictor of the eventual nominee. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for instance, beat out rivals in its 2016 straw poll but Trump ended up clinching the nomination. 
Last year in Orlando, Trump reportedly garnered 55% of votes, more than twice as many as DeSantis, who was also a featured speaker. Trump then reportedly received 70% of votes at CPAC's summer gathering in Dallas last July.
Trump has yet to say whether he will run in 2024, although he has heavily hinted that he will and is already an important political force ahead of November's congressional elections.
Still, he is facing multiple legal investigations that could complicate a potential presidential run. 
In a straw poll question that omitted Trump, DeSantis garnered 61% of votes. 

Many CPAC attendees said DeSantis, a 43-year old former lawyer with three young children and a wife who has been battling breast cancer, could easily wait and run for president in 2028.
""DeSantis, we'd like to keep him as governor here. I want Trump to run and win,"" said CPAC attendee Tom Freeman, 66, who works at a retail company in Florida.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are gearing up to spend record sums on lawyers, advertising and other protect-the-vote efforts before the 2022 midterm elections, hoping to stave off Republican efforts they believe will choke off access to the ballot box.
Worried that a spate of more restrictive voting laws adopted by Republican-controlled states will keep Democrats from registering their votes, donors big and small are filling their party's coffers. 
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) took in $157 million last year, the most for a year without a presidential election, and added $10 million more in January. More than half of Democrats' national funding is coming from people donating less than $200, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks political spending.
The party and allies have been setting aside a larger share of cash to fight fires in the relatively few competitive local jurisdictions where small changes can mean the difference between Republican and Democratic victories.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), charged with holding the party's House of Representatives majority during the Nov. 8 election, will commit at least $10 million to voting rights litigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.
That eight-figure budget, which has not previously been reported and is expected to at least match the DCCC's record spending in 2020, comes on top of a $30 million commitment by the DNC for voter-registration and litigation efforts as well as $10 million from the Senate campaign. A person familiar with the operation said Democrats expect the largest spending in history on such efforts.
The party-wide effort, still in its early stages, includes both litigation to challenge laws like voter roll purges coupled with targeted outreach on digital platforms to register new voters and counter misinformation about voting as well as an effort to elect Democrats to often-overlooked election administration positions like secretaries of state.
""This is an all-hands-on-deck effort to ensure that every ballot is counted,"" said Representative Nikema Williams, a Democrat from Georgia spearheading the DCCC effort, adding that the investments were necessary to counter a ""decades-long crusade"" by Republicans to ""suppress the vote.""
That official effort is being paired by additional spending from outside political groups, such as Priorities USA and American Bridge 21st Century, that were traditionally focused on political ad spending. American Bridge this month committed at least $10 million to efforts including recruiting Democrats to run for office as elected voting officials and fighting attempts to overturn future elections.
""Democrats have a pretty expansive voter-protection operation,"" said Amir Badat, voting special counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a nonpartisan group that also engages in significant voting rights litigation. 
Still, Badat said he expects new challenges this year.
He is concerned efforts by vigilantes who threatened voters and election officials in 2020 will expand, especially given new laws making it easier for poll watchers to observe voters. He sees the midterms as a dry run for the next presidential election.
""A lot of the things that happen in 2022 are going to be an experiment for what can be done in 2024, mostly from the point of what suppressive tactics can work,"" he said.
REPUBLICANS MATCH EFFORTS 
Democratic efforts are also being countered by an equally energized and well-funded Republican effort.
A person familiar with the Republican National Committee's spending said the party would budget ""millions more"" on voting issues and that ensuring that ""the 2022 and 2024 elections proceed in a free, fair, and transparent fashion is one of our top priorities."" The party is hiring lawyers in 17 target states and is already engaged in over 30 related lawsuits, the person said.
So far, before the campaign season even kicks off, Democrats and Republicans are running about neck-and-neck in legal and related spending at $52 million apiece ahead of the election for control of Congress, according to OpenSecrets.
Democrats and Republicans each spent about $120 million on legal fees during the 2020 showdown between Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump, the data showed.
In Texas, for instance, home to the opening House party primary contests on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers instituted more stringent identification requirements for people who vote by mail.
Local election officials in Texas' largest counties say early evidence shows that a significant share of mailed-in ballots arriving for the election don't meet new requirements for reasons as simple as the voter used an ID card different from the one they provided when they registered.
After the last election, Trump allies blitzed courts with lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the election.
But the Republican effort to challenge the election was telegraphed early by Trump and failed in courts. Democrats also succeeded in convincing courts to expand options like vote-by-mail during the pandemic. A record 155 million people voted in the 2020 election won by Biden.
Republicans have fought back to tighten access to the polls. And conservative courts have since dealt some setbacks to efforts to expand access.
Lawyers are expecting to be busier than ever. Last year, mega-lawyer Marc Elias, who works for the Democrats, split with Perkins Coie LLP to found his own 65-counselor firm in Washington focused on the litigation effort.
The party expects a spate of issues like the Texas restrictions, which it hopes can be corrected with aggressive legal action and quick-footed organizing.
Legislators in 27 states are considering over 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, as of January, compared to 75 bills a year ago, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, an advocacy group. 

Civil rights activists argue the measures have a disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities, who vote in larger measure for Democrats.
""It's going to be an uphill battle,"" said Aneesa McMillan, deputy executive director of Priorities USA, which budgeted at least $20 million for its voting rights efforts. ""It's a coordinated attack on marginalized communities.""

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump condemned on Saturday Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said he was praying for Ukrainians, switching tone from his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week. 
Trump's remarks at the CPAC conservative gathering in Florida came hours after the United States and allies announced sweeping new sanctions that would kick some Russian banks off the main global payments systems and limit the ability of Russia's central bank to support the rouble.
Addressing an adoring crowd at an event that touts itself as the world's largest conservative gathering, Trump used his speech to bash Democratic President Joe Biden and again hint at a possible run for president in 2024.
Trump had irked some Republican party members by describing Putin's actions in Ukraine, where cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles, as ""genius"" and ""pretty savvy.""
Trump expressed empathy for Ukrainians and this time praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling him ""brave"" as he stays in Kyiv, the capital.
""The Russian attack on Ukraine is appalling. We are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all,"" Trump said. 
Trump said that Putin took advantage of Biden's being ""weak"" to attack Ukraine. He also linked the invasion to the U.S. 2020 presidential election, a fixation of his, again falsely saying that fraud was to blame for Biden's victory. 
""As everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was the president,"" he said, to which a woman in the packed audience responded: ""You are the president!""
Trump has not confirmed whether he will run for president again in 2024, but has hinted at it heavily recently and did so again on Saturday. 
""On November 2024, they (Democrats) will find out like never before. We did it twice, and we'll do it again. We're going to be doing it again, a third time,"" Trump said. 
Democratic lawyer Marc Elias tweeted that Trump's words should trigger a ""series of legal requirements related to his spend and disclosures.""
Trump's fundraising operations have raised a cash pile of more than $100 million and he is criss-crossing the country holding rallies.
TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN, WORLD LEADERS 
Trump also cited Russia's invasion of Georgia under George W. Bush and Crimea under Barack Obama before declaring: ""I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country.""
Trump did address his past praise of Putin, saying he was correct that Putin was smart because he was outfoxing world leaders and NATO. ""The real problem is that our leaders are dumb, dumb. So dumb,"" he said. 
The Democratic National Committee criticized Trump's comments. ""The defeated former president took the stage at CPAC to double down on his shameless praise for Putin,"" it said in a statement. 
In an interview released earlier on Saturday, Biden mocked Trump's comment that Putin was a ""genius."" 
""I put as much stock in Trump saying that Putin is a genius than when he called himself a stable genius,"" Biden said.
Conservatives at the CPAC conference in Orlando, Florida, which ends on Sunday, have repeated the line that Putin decided to invade Ukraine because he knew Biden was ""weak.""
Republican politicians have broadly steered clear of lauding Putin, however, and hot-button domestic issues, such as mask mandates, have featured far more heavily than foreign policy. 

Earlier on Saturday, J.D. Vance, a Republican candidate for an Ohio U.S. Senate seat, said the American political class was fixated on the Ukraine conflict to the detriment of problems closer to home, such as record crossings at the Mexican border. 
""I'm sick of being told that we have to care more about people 6,000 miles away than we do people like my mom, and my grandparents, and all the kids who are affected by this crisis,"" said Vance, a venture capitalist and author.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A prominent Senate Republican said on Saturday that his party would not deserve to govern after November's midterm elections unless it was willing to adopt his controversial agenda that has rankled some Republicans and drawn attacks from Democrats.
Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told an audience of conservatives in Orlando, Florida, that his 11-point ""Rescue America"" plan is needed to preserve the country against what he described as an onslaught of ""woke"" policies from the left. 
The plan, which Scott launched earlier this week, includes proposals that would impose income taxes on Americans who currently pay none and require all federal legislation to sunset after five years.
""If the Republicans return to Washington's business as usual, if we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to America's collapse, we actually don't deserve to govern,"" Scott told the Conservative Political Action Conference.
His plan is ""going to be ridiculed by the left, mocked by Washington insiders and strike fear in the heart of some Republicans,"" Scott said. ""This is not the time to be timid. This is the time to be bold."" 
The initiative puts him at odds with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has avoided issuing a legislative plan in an effort to focus Republicans on criticism of President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies. 

The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democrats in control because Vice President Kamala Harris wields a tie-breaking vote. To retake the majority, Republicans would need support from independent voters, who party strategists fear could be put off by the Scott proposal. 
Scott spokesman Chris Hartline said the senator is pushing the plan on his own, not as head of the Senate Republican campaign arm.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden instructed the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks to Ukraine on Friday as it struggles to repulse a Russian invasion.
In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350 million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine's defense.
Ukraine has been asking for Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.
On Saturday, Blinken said in a statement that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine was ""unprecedented."" 
The Pentagon said the weapons included anti-armor, small arms, body armor and various munitions in support of Ukraine's front-line defenders. In addition, a State Department spokesperson said the materiel included anti-aircraft systems.
The United States drew from U.S. weapons stocks to supply Ukraine in the fall of 2021 and then again in December. Over the past year the United States has committed more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, Blinken said.
Other nations have pledged military materiel to Kyiv as Ukraine's military fights against an invading Russian force. Russian troops started advancing into Ukraine again on Saturday after President Vladimir Putin paused the offensive a day earlier in anticipation of talks with Kyiv that never happened, the Kremlin said.
The Netherlands will supply 200 Stinger air defense rockets to Ukraine as quickly as possible, the Dutch government said in a letter to parliament on Saturday.
Belgium has pledged 2,000 machine guns and 3,800 tons of fuel.

Germany, which had a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, approved the delivery of 400 rocket propelled grenades from the Netherlands to Ukraine, the defense ministry in Berlin said, confirming a shift in policy after it faced criticism for refusing to send weapons to Kyiv, unlike other Western allies.
France has decided to send defensive military equipment to Ukraine to support the country against Russia's invasion, a French army spokesman said on Saturday, adding that the issue of sending offensive arms was still under consideration

(Reuters) -The U.S. government on Friday joined European countries in slapping sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as Western nations sought to increase pressure on Moscow to halt its invasion of Ukraine.
The rare but not unprecedented U.S. imposition of sanctions on a head of state came just a day after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, assaulting by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
""President Putin and Minister Lavrov are directly responsible for Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful further invasion of Ukraine, a democratic sovereign state,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement late on Friday announcing the sanctions.
It said sanctions against a head of state were ""exceedingly rare,"" and put Putin on a short list that included the leaders of North Korea, Syria and Belarus. Further actions could follow. 
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that President Joe Biden decided to target Putin, Lavrov and other officials after speaking by phone with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier on Friday.
Treasury said the moves built on a raft of other sanctions imposed this week that targeted Russian banks and rich oligarchs, cut Russia off from access to critical technologies, and restricted its ability to raise capital.
Earlier on Friday, EU states and Britain agreed to freeze any European assets of Putin and Lavrov, as Ukraine's leader pleaded for faster and more forceful sanctions to punish Russia's invasion of his country.
The imposition of sanctions against Putin and Lavrov reflect the West's ""absolute impotence"" when it comes to foreign policy, RIA news agency cited a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying on Friday.
Edward Fishman, an Atlantic Council fellow who worked on Russia sanctions at the State Department during the Obama administration, said that while the sanctions on Putin are largely symbolic, targeting the Russian leader was a reasonable step for the United States and its partners to take.
""It certainly sends a very strong message of solidarity with Ukrainians who are under fire right now,"" Fishman said.
The U.S. government also sanctioned two other senior Russian officials, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said.
Psaki said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the Treasury Department would also impose sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which she described as a ""state owned financial entity that functions as a sovereign wealth fund, which is supposed to attract capital into the Russian economy in high-growth sectors.""
A Treasury spokesperson said the action against the Russian Direct Investment Fund would be in the coming days.
""We are united with our international allies and partners to ensure Russia pays a severe economic and diplomatic price for its further invasion of Ukraine,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in statement. ""If necessary, we are prepared to impose further costs on Russia for its appalling behavior on the world stage."" 
Treasury, which has already designated 11 members of the Russian Security Council, said it would continue to target Russian elites for ""their role in bankrolling Russia's further aggression against Ukraine, empowering Putin or participating in Russia's kleptocracy.""
Putin urged Ukraine's military to overthrow its political leaders and negotiate peace on Friday, as authorities in Kyiv called on citizens to help defend the capital from a Russian assault that its mayor said had already begun.
The sanctions targeting Putin are the latest punitive action from Washington over Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
The United States this week imposed sanctions on Russian banks, members of the elite, and the company in charge of building the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany.

Responding to reports that the U.S. government had ordered officials to stop most contacts with Russia, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the invasion of Ukraine had ""fundamentally changed"" Moscow's relationship with Washington and other nations.
Price told reporters that U.S. officials will continue to engage with their Russian counterparts on important national security issues, including the talks to return to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new prosecutor has been chosen to lead a criminal probe into former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Manhattan district attorney's office said on Friday, after the departures of two top lawyers threw the investigation's future into question.
Susan Hoffinger will now lead the probe into Trump and the practices of his family business, the Trump Organization, according to Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.
This week Special Counsel Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz - who had been leading the probe begun by former District Attorney Cyrus Vance - resigned. The New York Times reported they left after Bragg indicated to them he had doubts about pursuing a case against Trump.
Reuters has not been able to reach Dunne or Pomerantz for comment. Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hoffinger's appointment. On Wednesday, Fischetti said the departures indicated ""the case is over"" and that Bragg would not bring charges against Trump.
Both Bragg's probe and a separate civil investigation by New York State Attorney General Letitia James focus on whether Trump misrepresented the value of his real estate properties. Investigators are looking into whether values were inflated to obtain bank loans and reduced to lower tax bills.
Trump, a Republican who left office in January 2021, has previously denied wrongdoing and said both the state and city investigations were politically motivated. He has not ruled out seeking the presidency again in 2024. 
Both Bragg and James are Democrats, as is Vance, who did not seek re-election.
The criminal probe resulted last July in tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Both Weisselberg and the company pleaded not guilty.
Neither the Trump Organization nor its lawyer Alan Futerfas immediately responded to requests for comment.
Last week, a state judge overseeing James' probe directed Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, to answer questions under oath in depositions. The Trump family will appeal that ruling, their lawyer said.
James said on Friday that the appeal would not affect her team's investigation.

""Make no mistake: My office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor because no one is above the law,"" James said in a statement. 
Hoffinger worked at a private law firm focusing on criminal defense before joining Bragg's office as executive assistant district attorney and chief of investigations in February, according to her LinkedIn profile. She had previously served in the Manhattan District Attorney's office in the 1990s.

Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Biden announced Thursday wider sanctions aimed to further cripple Russia's economy and its access to key technology imports after Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale military invasion on Ukraine.
""Today I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia,"" Biden said. ""This is going to impose severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.""
Putin announced a ""special military operation"" to “denazification” Ukraine. The order to invade Ukraine comes as efforts to find diplomatic solution to deescalate tensions ran out of road.
The sanctions will block four more major banks including VTB, freezing Russian assets in America, and also restrict Russia's ability to import key technology needed to upgrade their military and industrial capacity.
""As we squeezed Russians access to finances and technology for strategic sectors of its economy can degrade its industrial capacity for years to come,""  ""We estimate [the sanctions] the will cut off more than half of Russia's high tech imports ... [limiting] their ability to continue to modernize their military,"" Biden added.
Biden also said that the U.S. was prepared to respond in-kind to any cyber attacks from Russia on U.S. companies.   
Earlier this week the U.S. announced a first trance of sanctions aimed at two Russia banks and elites individuals who were backing the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Biden followed up those measures with sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company tasked with of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. 
The sanctions are expected to take time to have the desired impact, Biden added.
As the waiting game on the impact of sanctions unfolds,  geopolitical tensions will remain elevated and may prove the final headwind that tips the broader market over the edge into bear market territory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -He threatened to impose the harshest sanctions ever on Russia. He worked to galvanize U.S. allies into a united front. He supplied Ukraine with more weapons than any American president before him. And he beefed up U.S. forces on NATO's eastern flank as reassurance of his commitment.
     Despite U.S. President Joe Biden's efforts to head off a Russian attack against Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin was undeterred as his forces invaded on Thursday in a mass assault by land, air and sea. After weeks of fruitless diplomacy, Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities and troops poured across the border from Russia and Belarus.
How Biden deals with the unfolding crisis, which Western officials fear could spiral into the bloodiest European conflict since World War Two, is expected to have profound implications for his political fortunes and U.S. relations with the world.
Biden vowed the United States and its allies would respond decisively to Russia's ""unprovoked and unjustified attack.""
    But his handling of the biggest international crisis of his presidency has been deemed something of a mixed bag so far.
Biden was always going to be limited because his administration made clear it would do whatever it could to help Ukraine defend itself but was not going to put troops on the ground. 
His preference for diplomacy and sanctions reflects the scant appetite Americans have for intervention after the Afghanistan and Iraq quagmires.
Putin had the advantage of knowing Biden was not going to war against another nuclear power to protect a country that shared a long border with Russia -- and with which Washington had no defense agreement.
FOCUS ON NATO'S EASTERN FLANK
Biden focused instead on coordinating with NATO allies, especially those in the east worried about the spillover from Russia's buildup of 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders.
Washington spearheaded an initial round of sanctions after Putin ordered troops into two separatist-controlled breakaway regions after recognizing them as independent on Feb. 21. It was a warning shot that failed to ward off Thursday's action.
In the prelude, Biden's messaging strategy was to issue dire predictions of an imminent invasion to show he knew what Putin was up to -- even if he couldn't stop him.
A key result has been to re-energize a Western military alliance that had fallen into disrepair under Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, who had questioned the value of NATO.
A senior European diplomat described Biden's consultations with allies as “exemplary,” a contrast to how many partners viewed last year’s chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Some analysts questioned, however, whether deploying a few thousand additional U.S. troops to Germany, Poland and Romania was sufficient, and suggested Biden could have done more to maintain a credible military option.
“One of the shortcomings is the deterrence package that we've developed is kind of asymmetrical in that it's mostly economic and we're facing a military threat,” said Ian Kelly, a former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and Georgia.
Kelly said Biden could have sought activation of the NATO Response Force and sent it into Poland and the Baltic states, with the message: ""You have massed troops on your border. We're massing troops on our border; we'll withdraw when you withdraw.""
PRAISE FOR ALLIANCE BUILDING
    Analysts credit Biden with working with allies to prepare sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy and hitting Putin's inner circle. He persuaded Germany, long considered the weak link, to freeze approvals for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Next steps could include an attempt to sever Russia's links to the global financial system.
Some U.S. lawmakers contended it would have been more effective to slap sanctions on Russia earlier, but Biden officials insisted that would have diminished their impact now.
    U.S. officials have acknowledged that sanctions could spur higher oil prices, adding to Biden's challenge of fighting inflation.
It remains to be seen whether sanctions will get Putin to back down.
Biden's decision to declassify intelligence about what it alleged were Russian plots to fabricate pretexts for a Ukraine invasion was also praised for countering Putin’s misinformation.
Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington, said this ""kept Putin in the hot seat.”
But the administration drew criticism for refusing to offer concrete evidence. Some commentators recalled intelligence claims used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion of a renewed nuclear program that proved not to exist.
NATO'S 'OPEN DOOR'
    Biden was also hailed by Western governments for sticking to NATO’s “open door” for aspiring members. But some critics said Biden should have been more explicit about how far away Ukraine was from entry, given that one of Putin's chief demands was to eschew further expansion eastward of the security pact.
Biden's response could also have repercussions for U.S.-China relations. There is concern if Biden appears too soft on Moscow, China could take it as acquiescence to act against self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.
As the crisis unfolded, Biden spoke regularly to world leaders, including Putin himself, taking a forceful stand with the former KGB officer, to whom Trump had shown deference.
Behind closed doors, a cross-government “Tiger Team” conducted tabletop exercises gaming out every possible scenario.

Putin's defiance could give Republicans a cudgel to use against Biden and his fellow Democrats in the November midterm congressional elections, which will decide the balance of power in Washington.
And Biden’s strategy leading up to the Russian attack will come under closer scrutiny as he charts the path forward.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's climate-related agenda, already under threat due to congressional failure to pass key legislation, now faces the prospect of a hostile reception at the U.S. Supreme Court that could have lasting consequences on the use of federal power to tackle environmental issues.
The court's 6-3 conservative majority, suspicious of broad federal agency power, will weigh at oral arguments next Monday the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal- and gas-fired power plants under the landmark Clean Air Act.
An eventual ruling restricting EPA authority could hobble the administration's ability to curb the power sector's emissions - representing about a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gases. 
""Could it be damaging? If it's an adverse decision, of course it could be,"" John Kerry, the Biden administration's special envoy on climate change, told Reuters.
The United States, trailing only China in greenhouse gas emissions, is a crucial player in global efforts to combat climate change.
The case before the Supreme Court was brought by Republican-led states led by coal producer West Virginia. Other challengers include coal companies and coal-friendly industry groups. Coal is among the most greenhouse gas-intensive fuels.
Democratic-led states and major power companies https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-utilities-side-with-environment-agency-supreme-court-climate-case-2022-01-27 including Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED),  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) and PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp sided with Biden's administration, as did the Edison Electric Institute, an investor-owned utility trade group. The utility industry believes regulatory certainty will help companies devise investment plans.
The justices will review the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's 2021 ruling striking down Republican former President Donald Trump's Affordable Clean Energy rule. That regulation would have imposed limits on a Clean Air Act provision called Section 111 that gives the EPA authority to regulate emissions from existing power plants.
The rule proposed by Trump, a supporter of the U.S. coal industry who also questioned climate change science, was meant to replace Democratic former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan requiring big cuts in carbon emissions from the power industry. 
The Supreme Court blocked implementation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-carbon/supreme-court-blocks-obama-carbon-emissions-plan-idUSKCN0VI2A0 of the Clean Power Plan in 2016 without ruling on its lawfulness.
Coal-aligned groups now want the justices to rule that Biden's administration cannot take a sweeping approach to regulating carbon emissions under Section 111. Such a decision would prevent the EPA from enforcing industry-wide changes, confining it to measures targeting individual plants.
That would be a huge blow for Biden's administration, which has a goal of decarbonizing the U.S. power sector by 2035. The White House's incentive-base proposal to achieve that goal was rejected in Congress during budget and infrastructure legislation negotiations.
INDIRECT CURBS?
The Supreme Court already has shown hostility to broad agency actions, most recently on Jan. 13 by blocking Biden's COVID-19 vaccine-or-test mandate https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-blocks-biden-vaccine-or-test-policy-large-businesses-2022-01-13 for large employers. The court said congressional authorization was required for any policy imposing ""a significant encroachment on the lives - and health - of a vast number of employees."" 
The court previously has cited what is called the ""major questions"" doctrine in blocking other government actions, including a 2014 ruling limiting an earlier EPA regulation aimed at reducing carbon emissions from new plants.
The challengers in the latest case are making similar arguments that Congress did not explicitly empower the EPA to issue sweeping regulations under Section 111.
""Major policy choices affecting the national economy should not be made by unelected agency officials,"" lawyers for the North American Coal Corporation, one of the challengers, wrote in court papers.
The court could stop short of a ""serious check"" on the power of the EPA and other federal agencies while reaching ""a more technical result that says something along the lines of 'you can't do ambitious climate policy under Section 111,'"" said University of South Carolina law professor Nathan Richardson.
The justices also could dismiss the appeal altogether if they conclude the challengers lack proper legal standing considering there is no regulation currently on the books.
If Biden's administration loses the case, Congress would need to pass new legislation for the government to impose sweeping climate-related regulations - an unlikely prospect in the near-term given the deep divisions among lawmakers.
Climate experts have said the EPA meanwhile could attempt to regulate carbon emissions from power plants indirectly by ramping up efforts to curb other air pollutants like soot that tend to rise and fall with carbon dioxide, or by requiring efficiency upgrades. 
Biden's administration also could seek action from other agencies and departments like fast-tracking electric transmission projects that could connect far-flung solar and wind farms to consumers.
""A number of different agencies have pieces of the decarbonization puzzle,"" said Kyle Danish, a lawyer who represents companies on environmental issues.
Such efforts on their own are insufficient to reach the administration's emission-reduction targets, which is why broad EPA authority to regulate power plants remains important, said David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups that challenged Trump's rule.

""The target that they set is not going to be achieved by a silver bullet,"" Doniger said. ""It's going to be a lot of silver buckshot.""

(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 22 governors Thursday urged leaders in Congress to move quickly to finalize $52 billion in government funding to subsidize the production of semiconductor chips.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, in particular, forcing some firms to scale back production.
""We can all point to industries in our states that have been impacted – from auto manufacturing to consumer electronics, home appliances, medical devices, agriculture, defense and more,"" the governors wrote in a letter.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, led the letter, including the governors of California, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New Jersey, Nevada, North Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Idaho, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Washington.
The U.S. House on Feb. 4 narrowly passed a bill aimed at increasing American competitiveness with China and $52 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
The bill's passage sets up negotiations with the Senate on compromise legislation, which must pass both chambers before it can be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden's signature. 
The Senate voted 68-32 to pass its own bill - the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act - in June, which includes $52 billion for chips and authorizes $190 billion for U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
""We urge you to take swift bipartisan action to reconcile the two bills to get to the president’s desk for signature. Now is the time for a comprehensive solution to this national 
security and economic crisis,"" the governors wrote, saying the $52 billion ""will help the United States regain our leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.""

The funding includes $2 billion to incentivize production of ""mature node"" semiconductors used by the auto industry and in medical devices, agricultural machinery and some national defense applications.
Whitmer said in a statement that chips funding is needed because ""thousands of jobs up and down the auto supply chain and across multiple industries are at risk.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and its allies will impose ""severe sanctions"" on Russia after its military forces launched an attack on Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said after blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and other cities.
Biden said he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and briefed him on the steps Washington was taking to rally international condemnation of Russia, including at a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
""Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the leaders of the G7, and the United States and our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia,"" Biden said in a statement.
Washington would continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and its people, he added, but gave no details.
Earlier, Biden condemned the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told state television shortly before the onslaught that he had authorized a ""special military operation"" in eastern Ukraine.
""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" Biden said in a statement late on Wednesday.
""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring. The world will hold Russia accountable.""
The White House said Biden would speak in the early afternoon.
Biden said he would monitor the situation from the White House before meeting online with his counterparts from the Group of Seven advanced economies early on Thursday.
Then, he said, he would ""speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.""
Biden said Washington would also coordinate with NATO allies ""to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the alliance.""
Biden, who orchestrated an initial round of Western sanctions this week against Russian oligarchs, financial institutions and exports, had made clear that Moscow would pay a steeper price for continued aggression. 
Next steps are likely to include sanctions against more Russian banks, such as Sberbank and VTB, steps to bar U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, and export controls on U.S. and foreign-made goods.
Such items range from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

On Wednesday, Washington had already stepped up pressure on Putin with sanctions on the firm building the $11-billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and its corporate officers, a move that Biden had waived for months.
Germany froze approvals on Tuesday for the pipeline, which has been built but is not yet in operation, amid concerns it could allow Moscow to weaponize energy supplies to Europe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than two-thirds of Americans think the United States should impose additional sanctions against Russia as it masses its forces along the border with Ukraine, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Wednesday.
Nearly half of respondents to the poll disapproved of President Joe Biden's handling of the crisis, in keeping with his low overall job approval ratings, with 48% saying Ukraine's problems are not America's business.
Biden has vowed Russia will pay a steep price for launching an invasion of Ukraine but he has pledged to keep U.S. troops out of the conflict.
The poll, conducted online on Tuesday and Wednesday, found some 69% of Americans - majorities of Republicans and Democrats - support additional sanctions on Russia.
The president on Tuesday toughened measures against Russian companies and individuals, effectively kicking two Russian banks out of the U.S. banking system
The poll found 62% oppose sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine against a Russian invasion, with opposition strongest among Republicans. A majority also opposed air strikes.
Republican lawmakers, who are seeking to win control of the U.S. Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm election, have criticized Biden's response to Russian President Vladimir Putin as too little, too late. 
The poll found that just 12% of Republicans approved of Biden's handling of the crisis, compared with 58% of Democrats.
Still, relatively few Americans blame Biden for the crisis.
According to the poll, about half the country, including a majority of Democrats and nearly half of Republicans, blame Putin, who on Tuesday ordered Russian troops to enter Ukrainian territory claimed by ethnic Russian separatists. Only 25% of Republicans polled said Biden was to blame.

Despite broad support for sanctions, only about half of Americans said sanctions were worthwhile if they increased fuel and gas prices, according to the poll. Russia is a major oil and natural gas producer and worries over the conflict have pushed prices for some oil contracts to their highest levels since 2014. 
The poll was conducted online and in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,004 adults including 420 Democrats, 394 Republicans and 131 independents. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

Cruz has delayed the Senate's confirmation of dozens of Biden's nominees under a Senate rule that requires every senator's approval for quick votes. By denying unanimous consent, any senator can force the Senate to devote hours of floor time to approve even the least controversial nominees.
The Biden administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company in charge of building the Russian pipeline, and its chief executive, expanding penalties on Moscow after it recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine amid fears of war.

Cruz issued a statement after Biden's announcement saying he would lift his holds on ""certain"" nominees. Aides did not immediately respond to a request for more details.
“President Biden made the right decision today. Allowing (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's Nord Stream 2 to come online would have created multiple, cascading, and acute security crises for the United States and our European allies for generations to come,"" Cruz said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden wanted to spend 2022 building bridges, literally and metaphorically, in the United States. Instead, he faces being dragged into a crisis sparked by Russian President Vladimir Putin that could reshape Europe. 
Aides say Biden, who just a month ago laid out a plan to fight his lagging polls in a U.S. midterm election year by getting out of the White House to ""look people in the eye"" across America, is now deeply immersed in the details of the Russia-Ukraine foreign policy challenge, and not the election cycle, aides say. 
""He's not talking about the politics,"" said a senior administration official. ""He's very focused on his call with foreign leaders, or who he's going to talk to next, or says 'I need to get the joint chiefs (of staff) on the phone, or call Tony (Blinken, the secretary of state) and tell him what to say.' He's extremely involved in directing every detail here.""
In an election year when the party that controls the White House typically loses seats in Congress, the shadow of politics is there, whether the White House wants it or not, strategists from both parties say. 
Biden has said that U.S. soldiers won't go into Ukraine, and American voters do not normally cast their ballots based on events overseas. But an interruption in the supply of energy from Russia to Europe could cause gasoline prices to skyrocket in the United States, adding to the pain Americans are already feeling from the highest inflation rate in 40 years. 
""If Russia invades and it’s a quick invasion and it's just a matter of days, then obviously that is lot better than a prolonged effort because oil prices won’t be out of whack for an extended period of time,"" said Democratic strategist Bud Jackson.
Biden has portrayed the Ukraine tension as part of a global fight between autocracy and democracy. If the United States and Western allies can rebuff Putin and shore up an independent Ukraine, while keeping U.S. forces out of combat, it will likely improve his popularity, said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf.
""If he shows strength and competence, that hopefully will improve his numbers - and what is most important for Democrats in November is that he has better numbers,"" said Elmendorf. But Elmendorf said he believes much of the country's mood will depend less on Ukraine and more on whether people feel they are rebounding from the COVID-19 crisis.
Putin's seeming determination to dominate an independent Ukraine means the crisis could drag on for weeks, or months, or longer. If Biden is perceived as stumbling in his handling of the issue, Republicans who have focused on obstructing Biden's COVID policies and legislative agenda amid their own party in-fighting, are likely to double down on their attempts to paint the president as feeble and too passive to counter Putin. 
""This Ukraine situation has become a real distraction for Biden,"" said Republican strategist Scott Reed. ""It has taken him away from the issues that voters care about: inflation, gas prices, the border.""
INFLATION IS 'HUGE' 
Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, is hovering around $100 a barrel, the highest since September 2014. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and the United States and a significant supplier to Europe.
The Biden administration is not expected to target Russia's oil and gas sector due to concerns about inflation and the harm it could do to its European allies, according to interviews with experts and administration officials.
""Inflation is a huge concern. You have a region in Europe that is an inflation crisis and you want to make it worse,"" said Sarah Emerson (NYSE:EMR), president of Energy Security Analysis, Inc, a global consulting firm. 
Biden has been careful to include warnings to Americans about the possibility of higher energy prices added to a speech he delivered on Tuesday, to ensure Americans understand how the conflict might affect them, aides noted.
His team of veterans of then-President Barack Obama’s experience with Russia and Ukraine in 2014, including White House officials Jake Sullivan and Jon Finer, Eric Green and Amanda Sloat and press secretary Jen Psaki in the West Wing, and the two top national security aides for Vice President Kamala Harris, Nancy McEldowney and Phil Gordon, believe they learned from mistakes. 

A former senior aide to Obama said the current response is stronger than what Obama did in 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea despite U.S. warnings.
""It definitely seems more intense,"" said the aide who asked not to be identified to speak freely. That's ""because we learned, we the country, and a lot of the folks who are involved now were involved then,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would unleash the first tranche of sanctions on Russia and individuals after President Vladimir Putin moved to carve out a bigger chunk of Eastern Ukraine.      
""I'm announcing the first tranche of sanctions to impose costs on Russia and respond to their actions yesterday,"" Biden said. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia had recognized the expanded borders of Luhansk and Donetsk after initially indicating that Moscow would recognize only the two separatist-held areas in Eastern Ukraine. This has stoked fears that Putin plans to launch a further invasion of Ukraine. 
""We're implementing full blocking sanctions to large Russian financial institutions, VEB, and their military bank,"" Biden said. These sanctions would cut off Russia's government from Western financing.
""Russia can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets ,"" the president said, adding that individuals in Russia, who benefit from Moscow's actions, would also face sanctions.    
""We will also impose sanctions on Russia's elites and their family members [who] share the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and have to share in the pain as well,"" Biden said.

If Russia chooses to expand its invasion, the U.S. and its allies are prepared to implement additional sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday took up a major new legal fight pitting religious beliefs against LGBT rights, agreeing to hear an evangelical Christian web designer's free speech claim that she cannot be forced under a Colorado anti-discrimination law to produce websites for same-sex marriages.
The justices agreed to hear Denver-area business owner Lorie Smith's appeal of a lower court's ruling rejecting her bid for an exemption from a Colorado law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation and certain other factors. The case follows the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling in favor of a Christian Denver-area baker who refused on religious grounds to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.
Smith's case gives the justices an opportunity to answer a question that has been raised in other disputes including the baker case but never definitively resolved: can people refuse service to customers in violation of public accommodation laws based on the idea that fulfilling a creative act such as designing a website or baking a cake is a form of free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 
""The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that anti-discrimination laws, like Colorado's, apply to all businesses selling goods and services. Companies cannot turn away LGBT customers just because of who they are,"" said Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat.
Colorado's anti-discrimination law bars anyone from refusing ""goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations"" based among other things on sexual orientation, age, race, gender and religion. Colorado is among 21 U.S. states that have measures explicitly barring discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations.
These laws pose ""a clear and present danger to every American's constitutionally protected freedoms and the very existence of a diverse and free nation,"" said Kristen Waggoner, general counsel of the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith.
""Colorado has weaponized its law to silence speech it disagrees with, to compel speech it approves of, and to punish anyone who dares to dissent,"" Waggoner added. 
The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has become increasingly supportive of religious rights and related free speech claims in recent years even as it has backed LGBT rights in other cases. 
The justices declined to take up a separate question concerning whether Smith has a religious rights claim, also under the First Amendment. Smith had asked the court to overturn its important 1990 ruling that limited the ability of people to cite their religious beliefs in seeking exemptions from laws that apply to everyone.
VIEWS ON GAY MARRIAGE
Smith runs a web design business called 303 Creative that she wants to operate in accordance with her Christian faith. She believes that marriage should be limited to opposite-sex couples, a view shared by many conservative Christians. 
Before adding wedding websites to the services she offered customers, Smith sued Colorado's civil rights commission and other officials in 2016 because of her concern she would be punished under the anti-discrimination law. 
Smith's lawyers have said that any state action punishing her for refusing to design websites for gay weddings violates her right to religious expression and her free speech rights. 
Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, said the Supreme Court should ""reaffirm and apply longstanding constitutional precedent that our freedoms of religion and speech are not a license to discriminate when operating a business.""
Colorado officials have said they never investigated Smith's company and saw no evidence that anyone ever actually asked her to design a website for a same-sex wedding. Lower courts backed Colorado, including the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a July 2021 ruling.
The justices are set to hear oral arguments and decide the case in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2023.
The Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015 and in 2020 expanded protections for LGBT workers under federal law. The Supreme Court has struggled to resolve cases in which conservative religious opposition to LGBT rights has clashed with situations in which LGBT people are seeking to exercise their own rights.

Smith's appeal arises from a dispute similar to the one that prompted the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling on narrow legal grounds siding with a Colorado baker named Jack Phillips. The court said in that case that Colorado's civil rights commission, which imposed sanctions on Phillips for discrimination, was motivated by anti-religious bias.
Similar legal fights involving other small business including a wedding photographer and a calligrapher owners have been waged in other states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday brought a formal end to former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.
The court's decision to formally reject Trump's appeal follows its Jan. 19 order that led to the documents being handed over to the House of Representatives investigative committee by the federal agency that stores government and historical records.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 upheld a lower court ruling that Trump had no basis to challenge President Joe Biden's decision to allow the records to be handed over to the House of Representatives select committee. Trump then appealed to the Supreme Court
Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle with the House select committee seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke a legal principle known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, a stance rejected by lower courts.
The House committee has said it needed the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.

The committee asked the National Archives to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers.
Biden, who took office two weeks after the riot, previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege.

(Reuters) - The leading photo on the website of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual get-together of American rightwing notables, is of a grinning Donald Trump. 
When the conference kicks off in Orlando, Florida, this week, the former president will be counting on an adoring crowd to cement his dominance of the Republican Party ahead of November's congressional elections - as well as a potential presidential run in 2024. 
The photo next to Trump's on the speakers' list is of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, whose rising national profile is driving speculation that the 43-year-old former federal prosecutor is also eyeing a run for the White House. 
The juxtaposition is symbolic of the Republican Party's looming choice: Does it coalesce around a fresh face or Trump, who would be 78 in 2024 and whose presidency was marked by turmoil?
""I'm sure Trump will be received as a hero,"" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist. ""The question will be: Are there any cracks in that armor?"" 
If in his Saturday speech Trump belabors false assertions that election fraud was to blame for his loss against Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020, it will reinforce party fears that he is backwards-looking, DuHaime added.
While polls show a significant percentage of Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen, half of Republicans also said it was time to ""move on"" from Trump's 2020 fraud claims, according to a Politico-Morning Consult survey conducted Feb. 12-13.
Trump's fixation on 2020 has fanned concerns among establishment Republicans that he is putting personal revenge above party success by endorsing challengers running against incumbent Republicans who have crossed him. 
But given Trump's pull with voters, concerns among Washington, D.C., insiders may not carry that much weight: Trump's rallies attract large crowds, congressional candidates covet his endorsement, and his fundraising operations have left him with over $100 million in cash. He is widely considered the 2024 frontrunner, should he throw his hat in. 
Even so, Trump's presidential aspirations could yet be stymied by several investigations involving him, including a New York state civil probe into his family business and a congressional panel looking into the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
DeSantis, meanwhile, has earned conservative plaudits for opposing COVID-19 mask mandates and being on the forefront of ""culture war"" issues like abortion and how much say parents should have over their children's education.
While neither man has said he is running for the White House in 2024, attending the Feb. 24-27 CPAC meeting, which touts itself as the ""largest and most influential"" worldwide gathering of conservatives, will be important for both of them.
It will give DeSantis access to national media coverage and exposure to conservatives from across the country. For Trump, ""it's a chance to see if his base is still solid or showing cracks,"" DuHaime said.
Representatives for Trump and DeSantis did not respond to requests for comment. 
CPAC will hold a straw poll of who should run for president. Last year in Orlando, Trump reportedly garnered 55% of votes, more than twice as many as DeSantis, who was also a featured speaker. Trump then reportedly received 70% of votes at CPAC's summer gathering in Dallas last July. 
A NEW 'TRUMPISM'? 
Trump last month slammed ""gutless"" politicians who don't disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status, in what was seen as a dig at DeSantis, who has not revealed whether he has received a booster shot. Trump later said reports of a rift with DeSantis were ""fake news.""
Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor and the CEO of oilfield services company Canary, LLC, said any more verbal broadsides at CPAC would be a sign of how ""seriously"" the former president takes DeSantis as a challenger. 
Eberhart said he supports both men. But, he added: ""DeSantis would present Trumpism with a newer, less divisive gloss.""
Some Trump supporters, like political strategist Roger Stone, stress that DeSantis owes Trump for his 2018 endorsement that helped propel the then-low-profile U.S. congressman to Florida's top office. 

""Therefore I would hope that Governor DeSantis gives the president wide berth,"" Stone, who has openly criticized DeSantis and called on him to endorse Trump in 2024, said in an interview. Stone, a former Trump adviser, does not currently have a role in Trump's operation. Trump pardoned Stone in December 2020, sweeping away the most important convictions under the long-running Russia election probe.
DeSantis' camp is seeking to tone down talk of tension and keep the focus on Florida.

(Reuters) -The founder of the Oath Keepers militia, Stewart Rhodes, will remain in jail until his seditious conspiracy trial for allegedly helping plot the assault on the U.S. Capitol, a U.S. judge said, calling him a ""clear and convincing danger.""
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said during a Friday court hearing that Rhodes spent thousands of dollars on weapons and other equipment ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters and also made ""substantial purchases"" of weapons afterwards.
""He presents a clear and convincing danger, in my view,"" Mehta said.
Rhodes's lawyers had proposed he be released into the custody of relatives in California, where he would stay in a separate residence on their property without access to the internet.
Mehta said he was not satisfied with that arrangement, stating that Rhodes ""has been extremely sophisticated with his ability to communicate."" 
Criminal defendants are often released pending trial, since they are presumed innocent until convicted, but can be held if they are deemed dangerous or likely to flee the country.
Rhodes, 56, is the most high-profile defendant of the more than 725 people charged with playing a role in the attack by then-President Trump's supporters. His lawyer said there is no evidence that Rhodes conspired to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election.
He is one of 11 members or associates of the Oath Keepers facing a seditious conspiracy charge.

Rhodes is accused of spearheading a conspiracy to block the certification of the presidential election by recruiting others and even stationing armed ""quick reaction force"" units outside of Washington to be ready to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
A U.S. magistrate judge in Texas last month ruled Rhodes should be detained, after hearing testimony from an FBI agent as well as Rhodes' ex-wife who expressed concerns for her safety. Rhodes appealed that decision to Mehta.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Congress on Thursday gave final approval of legislation funding the government through March 11, avoiding the embarrassing spectacle of federal agencies having to shut many of their operations amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
The Senate acted as a midnight Friday deadline loomed, when existing funds were set to expire for operating most of the federal government.
The temporary funding bill passed in a bipartisan vote of 65-27 and now goes to President Joe Biden for signing into law.
It was needed because Congress so far has failed to pass any of the one-dozen regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
""A government shutdown would be useless, senseless. Can you imagine how that would look to the Russians?"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said during brief debate of the legislation.
This third stop-gap measure since last September, which the House of Representatives passed on Feb. 8, would give congressional Democrats and Republicans until March 11 to reach a deal on a massive spending bill to keep Washington humming through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.
The prolonged uncertainty over Washington's finances for operations including many military programs comes at a time when Russia has amassed around 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, stoking fears of a looming invasion that has rattled NATO nations and financial markets.
House-Senate negotiations on a spending deal likely would appropriate around $1.5 trillion in ""discretionary"" funds for an array of government programs, including those administered by the Pentagon, the Environmental Protection Agency, Health and Human Services and other Cabinet-level departments.
Failure to reach a deal by March 11 would leave Congress with three options: simply passing a bill extending current funding at levels approved by the former President Donald Trump's administration for the remainder of this fiscal year; approving a fourth temporary funding bill in the hope that a grand deal still can be negotiated, or letting funding lapse. The latter would trigger widespread furloughs of federal workers, shuttering many programs.
A long-term extension of current funding would cause some Pentagon layoffs, for example, and freeze National Institutes of Health funding for medical research at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.
The last time Congress failed to fund the government was in December 2018, when Democrats balked at funding then-President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico ""border wall.""
Following a record 35-day impasse, Trump found ways to partially circumvent Congress, but the so-called wall never was completed amid skepticism over its effectiveness.

This time around, Republicans are insisting that overall spending be split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. Democrats who narrowly control Congress have been seeking slightly more spending in the non-defense arena.
But if that top-line number is set, many disagreements would still have to be ironed out over individual programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The full U.S. Congress will be invited to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on March 1, a year after the invitation list to his address to Congress was radically cut back to 200 due to the pandemic, officials said on Thursday.
The White House hopes the sight of a packed House of Representatives chamber, also filled with Senate members and other officials, will help project a return to normalcy. Biden's handling of the lingering COVID-19 pandemic has dragged heavily on his popularity for months.
Individual members of Congress will not be able to bring guests as they had previously, according to the Capitol's sergeant at arms. Everyone will be expected to wear a mask.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had previously not committed to whether the full membership of Congress would be invited due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Biden's management of the coronavirus health crisis has the approval of 47% of Americans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted Jan 31-Feb 7. That is down from 52% approval in a mid-December poll.
The State of the Union speech is a constitutionally mandated executive update to both chambers of Congress, a vehicle for presidential priorities, pomp and partisan posturing. 

In 2020, a bitter feud between the Republican then-President Donald Trump and Speaker Pelosi boiled over with Trump denying her a handshake and Pelosi ripping apart a copy of his remarks behind his back.
In 2009, Republican Representative Joe Wilson shouted, ""You lie!"" at then-President Barack Obama during a speech to a joint session of Congress to pitch for the Obamacare healthcare bill. Wilson was widely condemned for the breach of protocol by both Republicans and Democrats. He apologized publicly to the president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government should consider canceling former President Donald Trump's lease of a historic Washington building he made into a luxury hotel before he sells it, a U.S. congressional committee said on Thursday.
The committee in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives said recent developments indicated his Trump Organization may have filed inaccurate financial statements when the government leased the property to him before he ran for president.
Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Gerald Connolly, the two leading Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform Committee, wrote to ask the U.S. General Services Administration, the federal property manager, to consider terminating the lease, rather than allowing him to sell it for profit. 
""No one should be rewarded for providing false or misleading information to the federal government or for seeking to profit off the presidency,"" they wrote.
The hotel, at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, became a gathering point for Trump supporters and some foreign government officials during his presidency, and a sticking point for critics who said it violated ethics laws. 
Trump's company reached a deal last year to sell the money-losing hotel to Miami investment firm CGI Merchant Group for $375 million, which could net him a $100 million profit, according to media reports. 
New York Attorney General Letitia James accuses Trump and his family of misrepresenting their real estate assets in order to obtain bank loans and lower tax bills. Trump, a Republican, accuses James, a Democrat, of a political witch hunt.

Trump's former accounting firm, Mazars USA, said this month it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements and said it was dropping the Trump Organization as a client. 
The committee said those developments cast doubt on the accuracy of financial statements the Trump Organization submitted in 2010 when it applied for the lease and in 2013 when it applied for a construction loan.

(Reuters) - From voter ID requirements to laws giving partisan entities such as state legislatures more control over election management, U.S. states enacted more than 30 new voting restrictions in 2021, adding fuel to a national debate over whether such changes hinder voters' access or preserve election integrity.
The measures have raised tensions between the Republican and Democratic parties ahead of congressional elections in November that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, which are currently narrowly held by the Democrats. Most of the measures were backed by Republican state legislators and opposed by Democrats, but the divide is not purely red and blue. And the debate over each law sometimes comes down to the fine print.
VOTER ID
Seven of the 50 U.S. states imposed stricter voter identification requirements last year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks voting legislation across the country.
Opponents of voter ID measures do not object to the requirement that voters verify their identity when voting -- which is already standard in every state -- but rather the means used to verify them.
Unlike many European democracies, where government-issued IDs are more ubiquitous, studies have found that millions of U.S. voters lack photo ID.
Two of the most controversial 2021 laws changed the ID rules for absentee or mail-in ballots.
Georgia now requires voters who lack driver’s licenses or state ID cards to include in their absentee ballot application a photocopy of another government-issued ID such as a passport, which many voters may not be able to easily produce. Previously, absentee voters’ identities were verified by matching signatures.
Texas’ law permits voters to use a broader set of IDs when applying for and casting mail-in ballots. But it automatically rejects them if the voter uses a different ID number than what they provided when registering to vote.
Harris County, which contains Houston, reported in February that because of the law it had rejected more than one-third of all mail-in ballot applications -- an abnormally high rate.
Advocates of the Georgia and Texas measures say they are needed to ensure that voters are who they claim to be, and cite studies that show some voter ID laws have not depressed turnout. Opponents say there is no need for stricter ID rules because voter fraud is already vanishingly rare, and point to studies demonstrating that voter ID laws in states such as North Carolina reduced turnout by voters of color.
MAIL-IN VOTING
Mail-in voting laws are especially complex in the United States. Only 11 countries in the world do not require voters to provide a reason to vote by mail, according to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
Two-thirds of American states are in this category. But in 2021, 14 states passed laws making it harder for voters to apply for, receive, or cast mail-in ballots, while 16 states made it easier, according to the Brennan Center.
Some states' laws restricted mail-in voting one way while easing it other ways. For example, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a law allowing voters to fix absentee ballots if they made errors, but also limiting the application period for the ballots.
Proponents of limiting mail-in voting say the process adds to the cost of running elections and creates more opportunities for ballots to be intercepted by unintended recipients who might fraudulently cast them. Advocates of expanding mail-in voting say limiting it hinders voters who cannot go to a polling place.
VOTER LIST MAINTENANCE
Unlike many democratic countries, the United States does not have compulsory voter registration through a centralized system. As a result, states must periodically review their lists of registered voters to ensure they are up-to-date.
In 2021, seven states enacted laws that facilitated the delisting of voters. Advocates of the laws say they are necessary for ensuring only eligible voters are kept on the list. But opponents say the laws make it harder for voters to know they have been removed or remedy wrongful removals.
The Democratic Party sued Arizona after its legislature passed a law giving itself the power to appoint third parties to review the state’s voter rolls for ineligible voters. The law mandated that any voters deemed ineligible be removed, but did not require those voters to be notified: a provision that Democrats said violated Arizonans’ constitutional rights.
PARTISAN VS. NONPARTISAN ELECTION ADMINISTRATION
The United States has one of the world's most fractured election administration systems. In most states, elections are overseen by elected or appointed state officials. Within each county in a state, elections are run by local officials such as clerks and judges, sometimes in conjunction with nonpartisan or bipartisan election boards.
Few state-level voting laws sought to change election management authority before the hotly contested 2020 election, in which Republican former President Donald Trump falsely blamed his loss on voter fraud.

But last year, 16 states enacted laws that shifted power away from traditional election managers and in many cases ceded control to partisan actors such as state lawmakers, according to Voting Rights Lab, a U.S. voting advocacy group. Advocates of the laws, who were overwhelmingly Republican, argued they would bolster oversight of local election officials.
Such laws are unusual in other democracies. The Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, adopted guidelines in 2010 calling for high-level positions within election-management bodies to be “dispersed among parties” to ensure balance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite threats from nearly three dozen Republican senators to thwart a revived Iran nuclear deal and the misgivings of some top Democrats, there is little chance the U.S. Congress can block a new accord if one comes to fruition.
Lawmakers, congressional aides and former officials noted that Congress failed to quash the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the pact is titled, in 2015 when Republicans controlled both the House of Representatives and Senate.
That is even less likely now that U.S. President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats control both chambers, albeit by tight margins.
Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat who backed the JCPOA seven years ago, said it was not clear if Biden would have to bring a deal to Congress if he simply re-entered the previous pact. But even if the president did, Kaine saw no chance of lawmakers blocking it.
""They didn't have votes to overturn a diplomatic deal (in 2015) and I don't think they'd have votes to overturn a diplomatic deal now,"" Kaine said.
Talks resumed in Vienna last week about getting both sides to resume compliance with the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear program to make it harder to get a bomb - an ambition Tehran denies - in return for relief from economic sanctions.
As the talks near their endgame, a simmering U.S. debate has flared anew over reviving the deal, which then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. He began a ""maximum pressure"" campaign reimposing U.S. sanctions and prompting Iran to start violating its nuclear limits about a year later.
France's foreign minister on Wednesday said a decision on salvaging the deal was just days away and other sources said the next couple of days were crucial.
CONCERNS ON BOTH SIDES
Among the sticking points are Iranian concerns that a new U.S. president could abandon the deal as Trump did.
Speaking to the Financial Times this week, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian suggested Western ""parliaments or parliament speakers, including the U.S. Congress,"" issue a political statement of their commitment to the agreement.
Two sources tracking the talks said his call is likely to fall on deaf ears in Congress, where hostility to Iran and skepticism about any agreement run deep. 
Senate Republicans unanimously opposed the 2015 accord reached by then-Democratic President Barack Obama. Last week, 33 wrote Biden warning they would thwart implementation of any pact if Congress was not allowed to review and vote on it under the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA).
Some of the handful of Democrats who opposed the 2015 pact have also expressed doubts.
Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an opponent of the 2015 deal, gave a fiery speech last week saying: ""At this point, we seriously have to ask what exactly are we trying to salvage?""
While arguing Trump's decision to abandon the deal let Tehran make significant nuclear advances, Menendez also held out the possibility of a broader agreement in which more Iranian nuclear restrictions could be met by greater sanctions relief.
Former officials also saw little chance the Senate would kill an agreement, either one that closely hewed to the original's terms or one that made material changes.
""They were unhappy with the agreement in 2015 and they have no reason to be happier now, but I would assume most Democrats would go for a party-line vote,"" said Elliott Abrams, Trump's last special representative for Iran.
Under INARA, the executive branch must give Congress the text of any accord with Iran about its nuclear program within five days, opening a window for legislators to review and vote on it if they wish.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson did not address whether it would submit a deal that strictly revived the 2015 accord to Congress, but said Biden believed a bipartisan approach to Iran was best and was committed to meeting INARA'S requirements.
If both houses of Congress voted against such a deal in a joint resolution of disapproval, and the president vetoed that, it would require two-thirds majorities in both chambers to overturn the veto and kill the agreement.
In the Senate, 17 Democrats would have to break with Biden if every Republican opposed a deal. An override would also need more than 75 Democrats to vote against Biden if every Republican in the House opposed the deal.
""It is, I think, extremely unlikely you could get to 67 votes to kill it,"" said Tess Bridgeman, who was deputy legal adviser to the National Security Council during the Obama administration and is now co-editor in chief of Just Security.
In a 2015 procedural vote, only four Democratic senators - Ben Cardin, Joe Manchin, Menendez and Chuck Schumer - joined 54 Republicans in opposing the deal, failing to get the 60 votes needed to actually vote on the accord, let alone 67 to kill it.

Cardin said he would have to see what was in any new deal before deciding how to vote.
""It was disastrous to get out of the agreement,"" Cardin told Reuters. ""We are in much worse shape.""

(Reuters) - New York's attorney general on Wednesday pounced on former President Donald Trump's defense of company's financial statements, saying the five-page statement Trump issued a day earlier contradicted a court filing by his attorneys.
""It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,"" the attorney general's office wrote in a letter filed in New York state court. ""But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading -- let alone one day after the pleading was filed."" 
Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a probe into whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. 
Trump's attorneys repeatedly stated that he did not know enough to respond to allegations of inaccurate valuations. But the former president's five-page statement got into detail about possible discrepancies, implying that he had more knowledge than his lawyers said.
On Monday, the attorney general's office made public a Feb. 9 letter from Trump's longtime accountant, Mazars, which said the Trump Organization's financial statements for 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied on and that it would no longer do work for the former president's New York-based real estate business.
On Tuesday, Trump issued a five-page statement disparaging the attorney general and other New York officials, calling the investigation a political and racist attack, claiming Mazars had essentially been forced to resign, and defending the financial statements. 
""Remember when the attorney general and or District Attorney say they think my financial statements may be high, I don't even include these branding numbers in them, which is far more than any discrepancy they may have,"" Trump wrote.
Instead of the ""sham investigation"" of his business, Trump said in another part of the five-page diatribe, law enforcement and the ""fake news media"" should look into former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as well as ""murderers, drug dealers and rapists."" 
In a court filing on Monday in response to the attorney general's allegations of misleading financial statements, Trump, through his attorneys, repeatedly denied he had knowledge or information to form a belief as to the claims. 
The attorney general is seeking testimony from Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as part of her civil probe of the company's business practices.

Justice Arthur Engoron in New York state court in Manhattan will hear arguments on Thursday on whether subpoenas for the testimony should be enforced.
A separate but overlapping criminal case involving the company's business practices is being conducted by the Manhattan District Attorney, which the attorney general joined in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration on Wednesday over a government mandate requiring that masks be worn at U.S. airports and on airplanes and other transit modes.
Paxton and U.S. Representative Beth Van Duyne, a Texas Republican, jointly filed a lawsuit challenging the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) transit mask rules, which have been in place since February 2021, the month after U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office. 
The current mask requirements are set to expire on March 18, though they previously have been extended several times.
A group representing major U.S. airlines declined to comment. The White House and CDC did not immediately comment.
The CDC order requires masks be worn by all travelers at least two years old on planes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares and at transportation hubs such as airports, bus and ferry terminals, train and subway stations, and seaports.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday the agency is weighing new COVID-19 guidance, including on when to wear face masks. The CDC expects many of the revised guidelines to be issued in late February or early March.
The suit names as defendants the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is the CDC's parent department, Walensky, CDC chief of staff Sherri Berger, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and the U.S. government as a whole.
Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, who like Paxton is a Republican, rejected requests from the CDC to impose mask requirements in transit - even though airlines and some other transportation modes had earlier required masks.
Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to end the mandate. The mask requirements have been the source of friction, especially aboard U.S. airlines, where some travelers have refused to wear masks.

The Federal Aviation Administration says of about 6,400 complaints of unruly passengers received since the start of 2021, about 4,500 involve passengers not wearing masks.
In some U.S. states, transportation hubs are among the only places where masks are still required.

Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown of Ohio said the panel plans to keep holding meetings to vote on the nominees in the hopes Republicans will take part. He said Biden is backing the strategy.
“I spoke to the president today,” he said. “He’s concerned but standing strong with us. They’re going to eventually show up. We’re going to keep scheduling meetings until they show up.”
Brown’s comments came one day after Banking Committee Republicans boycotted a meeting, forcing Democrats to shelve plans to vote on all five of Biden’s Fed nominees because there wasn’t a required quorum. 
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the committee’s top Republican, reiterated Wednesday that Raskin, the nominee for vice chair of supervision, must provide more answers about her involvement in fintech company Reserve Trust getting a valuable Federal Reserve master account while she was a director. 
Raskin has said she doesn’t recall helping the company on that issue. If she did, she said, it would have been done properly. The White House said she did nothing wrong, and that Reserve Trust received an account only after complying with applicable rules and regulations.
Toomey reiterated that Republicans are willing to have votes on the other four nominees -- Jerome Powell as chair, Lael Brainard as vice chair, and Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson for the board of governors. In the meantime, he said, the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy won’t be affected.
“The Fed is able to fully function,” Toomey said at a Wednesday event with the group No Labels, noting that Powell remains the acting chairman and Brainard is already on the board.
Brown, who said he hadn’t spoken to Toomey yet on Wednesday, said again that he won’t move forward with the other nominees while Toomey holds up Raskin. Doing so, he said, would cede power to the minority over who gets votes and who doesn’t.
“They think they’re calling the shots here, with a Democratic majority? Sorry,” he said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden “absolutely” agrees with Brown’s refusal to split up the nominations.
“We believe Republicans need to do their jobs and show up to vote for these nominees,” she said.
Brown said it’s not clear whether Democrats have any procedural path to moving forward without Republicans providing a quorum in the committee.
“I’m still trying to explore this,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden has rejected former President Donald Trump's executive privilege claims and ordered White House visitor logs to be released to the panel investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 attack, according to a letter released on Wednesday.
In a letter to the National Archives, Biden's White House counsel granted congressional investigators access to the data given the urgency of their work probing Trump supporters' violent siege at the U.S. Capitol last year, and ordered the agency to turn over the logs within 15 days.
""The President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified, as to these records and portions of records,"" Biden counsel Dana Remus wrote in the letter dated Feb. 15.
Representatives for Trump, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Biden, a Democrat, last year also rejected Trump's bid to block the U.S. House of Representatives Jan. 6 committee from accessing batches of documents from the former president's time at the White House. Federal courts also rejected Trump's lawsuit seeking to withhold the records. 
Remus in the letter said the logs of those who visited the White House before Trump left on Jan. 20, 2021, should be handed over quickly ""in light of the urgency"" of the committee's work and Congress' ""compelling need."" 
""Constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield, from Congress or the public, information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself,"" Remus wrote. 
Representatives for the White House did not respond to a request for any additional comment beyond the letter.
The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) told Trump in a letter on Wednesday that unless a court intervenes it would turn over the logs on March 3, the same day it is scheduled to provide former Vice President Mike Pence's records.

So far, more than 725 people have been charged with playing a role in the attack that left five people dead and more than 100 police officers injured. Another four police officers involved in defending the Capitol later committed suicide.
The Jan. 6 committee has made 81 subpoenas public, including those issued to top Trump aides and allies, and interviewed more than 560 witnesses. It has also sought records from social media and other telecommunications firms. 
On Tuesday, it subpoenaed six people who had knowledge of or participated in unsuccessful efforts to send false ""alternate electors"" to Washington for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. 
Trump has repeatedly blasted the committee's investigation and decried the November 2020 election, which he lost to Biden by more than 7 million ballots and by 74 votes in the Electoral College.

Trump, who has teased a potential presidential run in 2024 but not formally declared his candidacy, could again file suit seeking to block the release of the visitor logs, which he sought to block in a Jan. 31 letter to the Archives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sarah Palin faces a narrow path ahead if she wants to use her defamation case against the New York Times as a vehicle to challenge broad U.S. legal protections for news organizations, media lawyers said.
After losing a jury trial on Tuesday, the prominent Republican is likely to appeal and ultimately to ask the Supreme Court to revisit a landmark ruling called New York Times v. Sullivan, experts said. 
Palin said this month that she would consider such a challenge, but has yet to disclose her planned strategy.
The 1964 decision, which made it difficult for public figures like Palin to win defamation cases, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years and looks more vulnerable to reversal than at any time in the past.
U.S. protections against defamation challenges are generally stronger than they are in other countries, and some critics have said this framework provides too much license for error, especially in the internet age. Defenders of the standard say it has been essential to safeguarding a free press.
But even if the high court is interested in reconsidering the Sullivan case — which is far from clear — Palin's lawsuit may not present the ideal opportunity for doing so, in part because both a judge and jury have now forcefully ruled against her, media law experts said.
""This case is not the right vehicle for the Supreme Court to revisit Sullivan,"" said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. ""I think this is just a really uphill road for the Palin side.""
Because the Times acknowledged errors in the editorial about Palin, her case has always hinged on whether the newspaper acted with ""actual malice,"" the legal standard set forth in the Sullivan case for defamation lawsuits brought by public figures. It requires proof by ""clear and convincing evidence"" that a publisher either knowingly disseminated false information or showed a reckless disregard for the truth. 
A nine-person federal jury in Manhattan unanimously concluded on Tuesday that the New York Times did not defame Palin, a former vice presidential candidate, in a 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked her rhetoric to a mass shooting years earlier. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff announced on Monday, outside the presence of the jury, that he would rule for the Times regardless of what the jury decided.
""The fact that the judge and jury found no actual malice may be a cautionary light for her (Palin's) lawyers about whether to take this case further,"" said David Logan, a Roger Williams University law professor. ""Now the odds look a bit bleaker.""
NEXT STEPS
The next stop for the case would be the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But appeals courts are reluctant to second-guess determinations reached by jurors, since they are the ones who hear testimony firsthand and make credibility judgments, said Ryan Cummings, a media lawyer at Hodgson Russ.
If Palin does appeal and the intermediate court rules against her, Palin could then seek review by the high court. 
Two Supreme Court justices, conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, made clear in an unrelated case last year they want to revisit the media-friendly standard. Four justices are needed to hear a case, and only a majority of the nine-member court can make new law.
In their dissenting opinions, Thomas and Gorsuch said the ""actual malice"" standard appears outdated and, in the internet age, allows falsehoods to spread rapidly with little accountability.
""Not only has the doctrine evolved into a subsidy for published falsehoods on a scale no one could have foreseen, it has come to leave far more people without redress than anyone could have predicted,"" Gorsuch wrote.
It is unclear whether Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, relative newcomers appointed by former President Donald Trump, are eager to revisit the ""actual malice"" standard, said Hans, the Vanderbilt law professor. 
Defamation cases rarely make it to trial, so Kavanaugh and Barrett did not weigh in on the Sullivan case when they were judges on lower courts, Hans said.
Even if justices besides Thomas and Gorsuch are eager to revisit the actual malice framework, the Palin case would also be an unlikely candidate for review because it involves a New York state law, said Benjamin Zipursky, a Fordham University law professor.
In 2020, New York's state legislature passed a law codifying the actual malice standard. Rakoff ruled that law applied to her case. That means Palin would need to show actual malice even if New York Times v. Sullivan were overruled.
The Supreme Court does not generally take cases that rest on state law or whose outcome would not be determined by the high court's ruling, Zipursky said.

Hans said there is another case that could be used to challenge New York Times v. Sullivan, involving a Florida megachurch that says a nonprofit falsely labeled it a hate group. In November, the church, Coral Ridge Ministries Media Inc., asked the Supreme Court to review its case after an appeals court upheld a lower court's dismissal of its lawsuit. Unlike New York, Florida does not have a statute that independently makes ""actual malice"" the standard in that state.
""It could be that case is more appealing,"" Hans said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Raging inflation in the United States took center-stage in the Senate on Tuesday, as Democrats focused on legislative efforts to ease the problem and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the matter.
With public opinion polls highlighting Americans' discontent over rising consumer prices for everything from groceries to gasoline, Senate Democrats met in private to discuss an array of possible moves to address inflation.
""You're going to see a lot of activity in March from us on that issue,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters following a closed-door meeting Democrats held to discuss possible legislative fixes.
Meanwhile, Powell visited with McConnell in the Capitol for about 30 minutes in a meeting the Republican leader said would focus on inflation and the U.S. economy. Powell declined to comment to reporters as he exited. A McConnell aide had no comment on the meeting.
Schumer ticked off several pockets of the economy that could be targeted in legislation, some of which already have been included as parts of other pending Democratic bills.
He said those include lowering the cost of prescription drugs and foods, easing a shortage of semiconductor chips that has contributed to higher prices of automobiles and suspending a federal tax on gasoline.
Democrats said they were seeking bipartisan solutions, but it was not clear which of the proposals under consideration could gain traction.
Congress can do ""very little"" about inflation in the short run, University of California, Berkeley, economics professor Yuriy Gorodnichenko said. Gas prices are driven more by market swings like what might be precipitated by a Russia-Ukraine conflict than by the size of a gas tax, he said in a phone interview. 
""I'm not sure there's much Congress can do about it,"" he said, adding that most Americans experience inflation across a broad spectrum of items, from bread to cars to clothing, over which lawmakers have little sway.
In a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, broad consensus would be needed and already there were red flags being raised to some of the ideas.
""They (oil companies) are experts in ... screwing consumers and in corrupting Congress and in polluting our world. So, I want to be very careful about what I give them,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told reporters when asked about legislation to suspend the gasoline tax through the rest of 2022.
No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune, in a Senate speech, said doing so would blow a ""huge hole"" in federal funds for maintaining and upgrading highways.
Throughout Joe Biden's year-old presidency, McConnell and his fellow Republicans have blasted Democrats for policies they say stoked inflation.
Schumer countered on Tuesday, saying, ""They (Republicans) just attack"" without offering remedies.
An inflation rate that hit a 40-year high in January is promising to become a central issue in the midterm election campaigns for Congress that will culminate with Nov. 8 elections. Republicans are vying to regain control of the Senate and House of Representatives where Democrats currently hold narrow majorities.

In the 12 months through January, the Consumer Price Index rose 7.5%.
Early suggestions by the Biden administration that inflation would be fleeting appeared to have caught Democrats flat-footed, as they now scramble to address it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol on Tuesday said it had issued subpoenas to six people who had knowledge of or participated in efforts to send false ""alternate electors"" to Washington for former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. 
The committee said it issued subpoenas seeking documents and testimony to Michael Roman and Gary Michael Brown, who served as director and deputy director, respectively, for Trump's re-election campaign.
It also issued them to four officials in states carried by President Joe Biden as he defeated Republican Trump's bid for re-election: Douglas Mastriano, a state senator in Pennsylvania; Laura Cox, a former member of the Michigan House of Representatives and chair of the state Republican party; Mark Finchem, an Arizona state senator; and Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator and chair of the state Republican party.

“The Select Committee is seeking information about efforts to send false slates of electors to Washington and change the outcome of the 2020 election,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Select Committee, said in a statement.
None of the six could be immediately reached for comment.

(Reuters) - The Manhattan federal judge who made the unusual move of saying he would dismiss Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against the New York Times on Monday while jurors were still deliberating is considered a maverick known for tussling with Wall Street regulators and criticizing the U.S. sentencing regimes.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, 78, announced he planned to dismiss Palin's case once the jury delivers a verdict, after concluding that her lawyers had failed to prove the newspaper acted with malice by incorrectly linking her to a mass shooting in an editorial.
Rakoff said he would still let jurors reach their own verdict in the case by the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate, as he expected her to appeal, making the timing of the announcement unorthodox.
Rakoff declined to comment. Judges typically do not speak to the press in the midst of a trial.
Lawyers who know Rakoff, though, say his decision carried little risk -- Palin could still win a jury verdict that could be restored on appeal, negating the need for a potential retrial -- and was on-brand for a judge known for making his views plain.
""If the facts that were presented at trial demonstrate that they didn’t meet the legal standard, he would not be shy, nor should he be, in dismissing the case,” said Carrie Cohen, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
Rakoff, an appointee of former Democratic President Bill Clinton, joined the federal bench in 1996 after working as a federal prosecutor and defense lawyer and is seen as a leading authority on securities laws and white-collar crime.
Among lawyers, he is known as a witty, hard-working judge who despite being having taking senior status, a form of semi-retirement for judges, has maintained an active court docket with a demanding trial schedule and high-profile cases.
Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law and a friend of Rakoff's, called him an ""intellectually independent"" judge who trusts his instincts.
HIGH-PROFILE CASES
In one of his most high-profile rulings, Rakoff in 2002 declared the federal death penalty unconstitutional, saying it created ""an undue risk of executing innocent people."" He was later reversed on appeal.
Rakoff has said he issued that ruling even though earlier in his life he enthusiastically backed the death penalty, after his older brother was murdered in the Philippines, where the killer got a three-year sentence.
The iconoclastic judge has long been a critic of the federal sentencing guidelines used by judges to estimate a recommended prison term for defendants, blasting the ""absurd"" long sentences they generate for fraud defendants.
He has at times been a thorn in the side of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by helping fuel a debate over its longstanding practice of allowing defendants to settle civil charges without admitting wrongdoing.

In 2011, he refused to approve the SEC's $285 million financial crisis-related settlement with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Rakoff at the time said he had no way to know if the accord was in the public interest. 
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately concluded Rakoff abused his discretion. But by then, then-SEC Chair Mary Jo White had adopted a policy of requiring admissions in some, though not all, instances.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A surprising and unusual ruling against Sarah Palin in her defamation case against the New York Times has narrowed the former Alaska governor's route to victory but the high-profile suit is far from over, legal experts said. 
In an abrupt twist in a trial seen as a test of longstanding protections for American media, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff on Monday announced plans to throw out the lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/jury-resumes-deliberations-sarah-palin-case-against-new-york-times-2022-02-14 - even as jurors were still deliberating. The judge did not inform the jurors of his plan.
Rakoff said Palin, the 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate who for years has been a leading conservative political figure, had failed to prove the Times defamed her in a 2017 editorial that erroneously linked her political rhetoric to a mass shooting.
The judge allowed jurors to keep deliberating as he announced his plans from the bench and said he would enter a formal dismissal only after they reached their own verdict.
Media law experts said it is not unprecedented for judges to issue so-called directed verdicts in defamation cases but called the timing of Rakoff's announcement highly unusual.
The U.S. Supreme Court has said that, given the importance of protecting freedom of the press, it can be appropriate for judges to take defamation cases out of the hands of jurors, said David Logan, a law professor at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.
Logan said this procedural rule was created by New York Times v. Sullivan, a landmark 1964 Supreme Court ruling known for ushering in the ""actual malice"" standard for public figures to prove defamation.
In that decision, the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Constitution requires a reviewing court to independently examine the facts in a defamation case for itself to determine that a jury verdict does not amount to ""a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.""
""The trial judge has an independent role to play in evaluating actual malice,"" Logan said. 
""Actual malice"" required a showing that the Times knew its editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
It has been more common for a judge to issue a directed verdict either before jurors begin deliberations or after they have reached a verdict.
""The dispute isn't about what he (Rakoff) is doing,"" said Alexandra Lahav, a University of Connecticut law professor. ""It is that he communicated his thinking at this stage of the case.""
Rakoff said while the Times had engaged in ""unfortunate editorializing,"" the newspaper did not act with ""actual malice.""
The judge added that the jury verdict could still help the parties and the appellate courts resolve the case.
The New York Times will be in a stronger position if the jury also rules in its favor, said Eric David, a media lawyer at the firm Brooks Pierce. In general, appeals courts are reluctant to second-guess factual determinations by jurors, David said.
""A jury verdict for the New York Times would be much more appeal-proof than a directed verdict,"" David said.
APPEAL SCENARIOS
If the jury rules in favor of Palin, the case would become more complicated. If Palin appeals as expected, the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would then review Rakoff's directed verdict and decide whether it agrees with him that she failed to prove ""actual malice."" If not, it could reinstate the jury verdict.
Palin is expected to argue on appeal that she presented strong evidence of ""actual malice,"" but in any event the ""actual malice"" standard needs to be revisited by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch last year wrote dissenting opinions making clear they think the ""actual malice"" framework is outdated, but it is unclear if other justices would join them. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. 
While the timing of Rakoff's directed verdict was unusual, Lahav said there was a certain efficiency to it given that jurors took time out of their lives to hear the case and lawyers were paid a lot of money to argue it.
""You don't want all those costs to go to waste,"" Lahav said, adding that it is worthwhile to ""make sure the jury verdict is preserved so they don't have to do it all again.""

One potential issue with Rakoff's approach that Palin's lawyers could raise on appeal is that there is a risk of jurors learning Rakoff's views on the case, said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University in New York.
The jurors have been instructed to not read about the case when they go home at night. But in the digital era it can be difficult to avoid news reports and social media posts about a high-profile trial, Zipursky said.

325,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 10:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee plan to boycott a meeting scheduled for Tuesday afternoon to vote on President Joe Biden's slate of nominees to the Federal Reserve, a person familiar with the matter said, a move that could delay their consideration by the full Senate.
Republicans plan not to attend a meeting scheduled for 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) scheduled by committee Chairman Sherrod Brown to vote on the five nominees to the Fed's Board of Governors, including whether to recommend Jerome Powell for a second term as the U.S. central bank's chair, the person said.
While most Republicans on the panel back Powell, they appear unified in their objection to Sarah Bloom Raskin's nomination as vice chair for supervision, the top U.S. banking regulatory role. They have attacked Raskin over her past comments on using financial rules to police climate change. 

Should all 12 Republicans on the committee not appear, the 24-member panel would not have the required quorum to conduct business, including holding a vote on the Fed nominees. In addition to Powell and Raskin, Biden has nominated Fed Governor Lael Brainard to be Powell's deputy as vice chair and has put forward economists Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson for the remaining vacancies on the seven-member Board of Governors.
Asked about the Republican plans not to attend the meeting, Brown said he had heard rumors in the media of a boycott but was not familiar with what Republicans were planning.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One in four U.S. Democrats say their party did not take full advantage of its grip on the White House and Congress last year, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found, in a troubling sign for their voters' enthusiasm in this year's congressional elections.
The finding echoes concerns raised by moderate Democratic members of Congress whose seats the party will have to defend in the Nov. 8 election if it wants to keep its majorities. They said the party has paid too much attention to its failures and not enough to successes like the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed in November.
The poll, conducted online Jan. 31-Feb. 8, found 28% of Democrats said their party was unable to get things done last year because they were too busy fighting each other or lacked resolve. Forty-seven percent blamed Republicans for blocking Democratic efforts and only 25% said the party had been able to accomplish most of its goals.
The finding illustrates a dissatisfaction among Democratic voters. Some 55% of Democrats said they were certain to vote in November, lower than the 59% of Republicans who said that, a statistically meaningful gap in a narrowly-divided electorate.
The disappointment among Democrats underscores a risk for President Joe Biden. If his party cannot close the enthusiasm gap, its turnout could suffer in November, raising the risk of losing its slim congressional majorities and dooming his legislative agenda.
""When you have a quarter of your own party conceding that we didn't get things done and it was mostly our fault, that's a problem,"" said Daron Shaw, an expert on polling and elections at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Biden's approval rating https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa among all Americans is currently hovering near the lowest level of his presidency at 43%.
Democratic voters said they were disappointed the party failed to deliver on high-level priorities like Biden's $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" social spending bill or to pass sweeping voter rights reform. Both those bills faced solid Republican opposition in the 50-50 Senate and two critical conservative Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who rejected top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer's proposed maneuvers to pass them. ""He hasn't done anything near what he promised,"" said Paul Sansing, 29, a band and orchestra teacher in Cygnet, Ohio, who voted for Biden in 2020 but says he was let down on climate change and will be open to third-party congressional candidates.
Physician Sanjay Krishnan said elderly, white Democratic leaders like Biden haven't taken seriously enough Republican-led efforts to put restrictions on voting that advocates say could disenfranchise minorities. Krishnan said he would rather not vote than support a Democrat who only pays lip services to his concerns.

""If the Democratic candidates don't follow through on their promises, why should I put in the effort to go vote for them?"" said Krishnan, 44, of Manchester, New Hampshire. 
Reuters/Ipsos polls are conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The latest large-sample survey was conducted from Jan. 31-Feb. 8 and gathered responses from 4,404 adults including 2,015 Democrats, 1,663 Republicans and 510 independents. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of between 2 and 5 percentage points.

LANSING, Mich. (Reuters) - If Democrats are to keep control of the U.S. Congress in this year's midterm elections, moderates in highly competitive districts, such as Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, must hold on to their seats.
Yet Slotkin and two fellow Democratic lawmakers who were part of the 2018 Democratic ""blue wave"" that helped the party retake the U.S. House of Representatives say continuing fights within their own party over President Joe Biden's agenda risk dooming them to devastating losses this year.
The three congresswomen - Slotkin, Virginia's Abigail Spanberger and Iowa's Cindy Axne - told Reuters in recent interviews that they believe Democrats achieved great things during Biden's first year in office, but too many voters only see a party fighting with itself.
Voters turn on the television and see ""Democrats complaining about fellow Democrats,"" they see Democratic lawmakers ""whining, blaming another Democrat"" Spanberger said. ""There's a negativity that I don't ascribe to. It's unfortunate because we have a good record.""
Slotkin, who like Spanberger and Axne faces a tough Nov. 8 re-election battle, said: ""I just talk to a lot of people who feel like Washington is so broken. And the only way to prove to people that our democracy still works is by governing effectively.""
Biden carried Slotkin's Michigan district by 2 percentage points, while former President Donald Trump narrowly won Axne's in Iowa by less than half a percentage point. Biden won Spanberger's Virginia district by a more comfortable 6 points, but the state went on to elect a Republican governor in 2021.
Rising inflation and voter exhaustion over the COVID-19 pandemic have created stiff political headwinds for Democrats, who control the White House, Senate and the House.
Independent analysts and historic patterns favor Republicans' changes of regaining control of at least one chamber of Congress in November, which would all but kill Biden's domestic agenda. The Senate is split 50-50 while Democrats hold a narrow 222-212 House majority.
Slotkin's newly redrawn district sits in the heart of battleground Michigan, a Midwestern mix of industry - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) operates plants in the Lansing area - and farmland.
'DISAPPOINTED IN BIDEN'
In interviews with 20 voters around Lansing, people were evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, but two who voted for Biden and Slotkin in 2020 say they now have their doubts.
One of them is Ahmed Khan, 48, a small-business owner.
""I had a lot of high hopes, but I'm disappointed in Biden. I don't see the economy turning around. People are too afraid to spend. A lot of shops are closing down. The economy, the virus situation, inflation, this is what matters most,"" Khan said. ""If I believe a Republican can do a better job, absolutely I will vote for them this November. I'm going to vote for somebody who's going to look after me.""
Anthony Whalen, 31, a software developer, said he's tired of the rancor in Washington.
""My leanings in voting are Democratic but it's not a party I'm proud of,"" he said.
The concerns are underscored by a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. One in four Democrats think the party underachieved last year because they were too busy fighting each other or unwilling to force legislation through. 
Democratic dissatisfaction also shows up in Biden's polling https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa, with just 43% of U.S. adults approving of his performance in a Feb. 7-8 poll.
The Democratic lawmakers are particularly dismayed by what they see as missteps by party leaders over Biden's $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" legislation, which failed to pass in January after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin pulled his support.
Biden also failed to pass federal voting rights legislation last month, again after Manchin and another Democratic senator, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, refused to change Senate rules to overcome Republican opposition.
Slotkin conceded that millions of Americans feel insecure because of rising prices and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic, now in its third year.
Like Spanberger and Axne, she hailed Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed Congress in 2021, which bailed out families and businesses from the COVID-19-hit economy and lifted millions of children out of poverty.
The lawmakers also pointed to Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill as a landmark achievement that will repair roads, bridges, expand broadband internet across the U.S. and create jobs.
They say party leaders should have broken up the ""Build Back Better"" bill and tried to pass smaller, more targeted spending measures rather than one colossal package that voters did not understand.

Dave Wasserman, a political analyst at the non-partisan Cook Political Report, said Biden's low polling numbers and voter anxiety about inflation, COVID-19 and the economy, means Democrats face ""an exceptionally difficult year.""
He added: ""Biden and the Democrats' legislative agenda is not only stalled, but voters see it as disconnected to their day-to-day lives.""

328,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 07:16PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Monday he would not support a Senate vote to confirm President Joe Biden's pick for a Supreme Court seat if a vacancy opened up right before the 2024 presidential election.
Manchin, who often clashes with his own party, told reporters his view was consistent with his view when Republican President Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court a little over a month before the 2020 presidential election.
Manchin voted against Barrett's confirmation, though he said he had supported her nominations for a previous post. He added it would be ""hypocritical"" for him to support a similar move by Biden.
Manchin has emerged as a key vote in the evenly divided Senate, willing to buck Biden and the Democratic party by opposing nominees and legislation, including Biden's priority social spending bill.
Biden is expected to name his first pick for a Supreme Court seat at the end of the month, after Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement. Biden has pledged to nominate a Black woman to the seat.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who could return to power as majority leader in that chamber if Republicans win in the 2022 midterm elections that decide control of Congress, has said he would block any Supreme Court confirmations if a vacancy opened up before the 2024 presidential election.
He also was noncommittal when asked, in the same interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, if he would allow a confirmation vote in 2023 if Republicans held the Senate majority.

In 2016, when Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died during then-President Barack Obama's term, Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, who now serves as the attorney general.
The move held little precedent in U.S. history, but cleared the way for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch to the seat, the first of three justices he named to the Supreme Court, giving it a 6-3 conservative majority.

329,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 07:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge said on Monday he will dismiss a defamation lawsuit by Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate, against The New York Times.
Palin sued over a June 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked her to a January 2011 mass shooting where six people died and Democratic U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded. 
Here is a look at 10 key moments from the trial, which began on Feb. 3.
*During his opening statement, Palin's lawyer Shane Vogt told jurors that his client was fighting an ""uphill battle"" to show the editorial reflected the Times' knowledge it was false and its ""history of bias"" toward her and other Republicans.
*Times lawyer David Axelrod countered in his opening statement that the editorial sought to hold both Democrats and Republicans responsible for inflammatory rhetoric, and said the newspaper acted ""as quickly as possible"" to correct its mistake.
*Palin testified on the fifth and sixth days of the trial. She told the jury she felt ""powerless"" after the editorial was published, likening herself to the biblical underdog David. 
""I wanted to raise my head and try to get the word out that there were untruths printed once again,"" Palin said. ""I knew I was up against Goliath, and I felt collectively the people were David, that I was David.""
*Palin also described her suffering following the editorial.
""It's hard to lay your head on a pillow and have a restful night when you know that lies are told about you, a specific lie that was not going to be fixed,"" she said. ""That causes some stress that anyone would feel."" 
*The former New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet testified on the fourth and fifth days of the trial. He said he did not mean to cause Palin harm, and that the Times moved quickly to correct the editorial.
""We don't promise to be perfect, we promise to try our damnedest to be perfect, and when we're not, we try to fix it,"" he said.
*Ross Douthat, a conservative New York Times columnist, testified that he had emailed Bennet less than an hour after the editorial was published that it appeared without basis to link Palin to the Giffords shooting.
""If there was a correction that needed to be made, the sooner the better,"" he said.
*Linda Cohn, a now-retired Times editor, testified that Bennet was initially surprised after the editorial was published that some readers were upset with its wording.
""There was a general sense of 'oh no,'"" she said. 
*Kenneth Turkel, another lawyer for Palin, in his closing argument accused the Times and Bennet of turning a ""blind eye"" to the facts, and essentially accusing Palin of inciting the murder of six people.
""All they had to do is care the slightest bit,"" he said. ""All they had to do is dislike her a little less, and we're not sitting here today.""
*Turkel also noted that Palin had withstood many attacks in the nine years since she had entered the national spotlight, something that Palin acknowledged in her own testimony came with the territory.
""She's got thick skin,"" Turkel said. ""This one crossed the line.""

-Axelrod said in his closing argument that no one criticized Palin over the editorial, undermining her claim that the editorial hurt her reputation. He labeled the error an ""honest mistake"" several times.
""The evidence does not support branding him (Bennet) with a scarlet 'D' for defamation for the rest of his life,"" Axelrod said.

""I'm for them,"" echoed Warner, who represents Virginia. Warner added he is confident committee Chairman Sherrod Brown of Ohio ""can get this done.""

Support for Biden's five nominees, including Jerome Powell for a second term as chair, is varied. Raskin, nominated as vice chair for supervision, is seen as facing the narrowest path to confirmation, one that could require the support of every Democrat in the closely divided Senate.
The first step in that process is Tuesday afternoon's vote by the 24-member banking panel, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Most of the nominees are expected to pick up one or more Republican votes, but Republicans have been particularly critical of Raskin for past remarks on using financial rules to police climate change.

(Reuters) - Texas will hold the nation's first primary nominating contests of 2022 on March 1, with early voting beginning on Monday.
While the gubernatorial race – headlined by incumbent Republican Greg Abbott and Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke – will capture much of the attention [L1N2U007J], there are several primary elections for the U.S. House of Representatives that will help determine the makeup of the next Congress.
Under Texas law, if no candidate earns a majority of the vote in any given election, the two top finishers head to a runoff on May 24. Here are six key congressional races worth watching:
TRUMP LOYALTY TEST
Republican Representative Van Taylor comfortably won a second term in Texas' 3rd District in 2020, even though former President Donald Trump barely outpolled then-candidate Joe Biden in the district. But Taylor's vote to support the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters has attracted Republican opponents who accuse him of betraying the former president and his party.
After Republican-backed redistricting, the suburban Dallas district is significantly more conservative in 2022, potentially making Taylor vulnerable to a challenge from the right. His leading rival is Keith Self, a former judge in Collin County who has attacked Taylor for being one of only 35 Republican House members to vote in favor of the commission, which failed in the Senate. House Democrats have launched their own probe of the Jan. 6 assault.
The Republican winner will be a heavy favorite in the Nov. 8 general election.
A SUCCESSOR TO KEVIN BRADY
Nearly a dozen Republicans are seeking their party's nomination to succeed 13-term Congressman Kevin Brady representing the 8th District, north of Houston. The two most prominent have split many of the state's top Republicans.
Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL, is backed by a political action committee with ties to Republican congressional leadership, as well as Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, former Governor Rick Perry and U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw. Luttrell is the twin brother of Marcus Luttrell, also a Navy SEAL, who wrote the bestselling memoir ""Lone Survivor.""
Christian Collins, a conservative activist, is supported by the campaign arm of the House's right-wing Freedom Caucus, as well as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and devoted Trump acolytes like Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial Georgia congresswoman. 
The winner is all but assured to prevail in the general election, given the district's Republican lean.
REPUBLICANS GAINING GROUND
The elongated 15th District, which stretches south from the San Antonio area to the Rio Grande, is held by Democrats but was already competitive in 2020 thanks to Trump's unexpected strength among Hispanic Texans before Republicans redrew the lines to be more favorable to them in last fall's redistricting. The incumbent, Vicente Gonzalez, decided to run for reelection in the neighboring – and more Democratic-leaning – 34th District, leaving half a dozen Democrats vying for the party's nod. 
The Republican front-runner is Monica De La Cruz, who narrowly lost to Gonzalez in 2020. The race is expected to be the state's most hotly contested congressional battle this fall.
DEMOCRATIC REMATCH
The Democratic primary in the South Texas 28th District will be a rematch: Jessica Cisneros, a liberal backed by Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing Justice Democrats, will again challenge nine-term incumbent Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, after a close 2020 contest.
An FBI raid at Cuellar's house https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-searches-home-prominent-texas-democratic-congressman-cuellar-reports-2022-01-20 in January has given Cisneros a boost. The agency has not commented on the matter, and Cuellar, who has not been charged with a crime, has said he is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.
There are seven Republicans vying for their party's nomination. The district is majority Latino and swung toward Trump in 2020, though President Joe Biden narrowly carried it.
PROGRESSIVE PUSH
The solidly Democratic 35th District, stretching from San Antonio to Austin, will also see a test of the party's left wing. Greg Casar, a democratic socialist and former Austin city council member, is running with the backing of high-profile liberals, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ocasio-Cortez.
Casar faces several challengers, including state Representative Eddie Rodriguez. The district's current Representative, Democrat Lloyd Doggett, has opted to run in the newly created 37th district based in Austin.
BLACK REPUBLICAN VETERAN

One of two new congressional seats this year thanks to Texas' booming population, the 38th District stretches northwest from Houston and was drawn by Republicans https://www.reuters.com/world/us/redistricting-gets-under-way-democrats-prospects-looking-brighter-2021-10-02 to be safely conservative.
Wesley Hunt, a Black conservative and Army veteran who narrowly lost to Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 in a race that earned national attention, has emerged as the leading candidate for Republicans. He has been endorsed by Cruz, as well as House Republican leaders, though he faces several challengers.

In the letter dated April 13, 2021, Senators Ron Wyden, of Oregon, and Martin Heinrich, of New Mexico, warned top U.S. intelligence officials that an unspecified ""bulk collection"" program was operating ""entirely outside the statutory framework that Congress and the public believe govern this collection.""
The Democrats said that even lawmakers on the Senate's Intelligence Committee were unaware of the nature of the program until the dissemination of a secret report by U.S. intelligence oversight authorities in March of 2021.
The letter to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns was partially redacted and lacked several key details, notably the nature of the CIA program and the kind of data it collected. It referred instead to a cache of newly declassified documents https://www.cia.gov/about/organization/privacy-and-civil-liberties from the U.S. intelligence watchdog known as the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

(Reuters) - When Idaho nurse Joan West received a fundraising mailer from U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, she saw a way to address her regret for having voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and her worry about the future of U.S. democracy: She wrote a $500 check.
Cheney, of Wyoming, is the most high-profile of the nine congressional Republicans that former President Trump is trying to drive from office after they rejected his false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
That high profile has attracted thousands of donors ranging from celebrities to average Americans like West, all hoping to help her fend off primary challengers, including a candidate endorsed by Trump and the Republican Party, which last week broke precedent and agreed to campaign against one of its own.
""We are hopeful that sanity will prevail, that there are people in Wyoming who will wake up and realize that following Donald Trump's insanity is the wrong move,"" said West, 60, an independent voter who leans Republican. ""We wanted to help her."" 
The $7.2 million raised to date by Cheney is already a record for Wyoming's sole House district, and has given her a big financial edge over her main challenger, land-use lawyer Harriet Hageman, who has pulled in $745,000.
But Hageman has raised a majority of funds from Wyoming residents, who unlike out-of-state donors can vote in the Aug. 16 primary, a distinction being stressed by her campaign. In contrast, Cheney's campaign has raised 96% of its dollars from outside Wyoming, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Open Secrets of itemized donations by individuals.
""Liz Cheney cannot buy this race with out-of-state money,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a Hageman campaign advisor.
Cheney, who voted with Trump 93% of the time, believes support for her policies will attract voters. Cheney had more individual donors from inside Wyoming than Hageman as of the end of September, according to campaign filings. 
""Liz is an unwavering conservative who is committed to fighting for the people of Wyoming and defending the Constitution,"" said spokesman Jeremy Adler.
The flood of money into Cheney's campaign shows no sign of slowing. Reuters spoke with a dozen people who had donated in the last three months of 2021, and all said they were considering donating again.
Gerry Dee, a carpenter from Rochester, New York, said he gave $200 because he was worried about the country moving towards authoritarianism, and saw Cheney as one of the few Republicans standing up for democratic principles.
""I'm a registered Democrat. I believe she is doing the right thing,"" said Dee, 59. ""I'm just a working Joe, but I'm concerned about the country."" 
The Republican National Committee censured Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger last week for participating in the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, saying they were focused on destroying Trump rather than supporting Republicans in 2022. 
The RNC also granted a request by Wyoming party officials for a rule exception allowing the national party to provide financial and practical support to Hageman, should it choose to take the unprecedented step of using funds against an incumbent.
Robert Boatright, a professor at Clark University and an expert on congressional primaries, said that while the two major parties have in the past stopped short of supporting incumbents, the RNC helping finance Hageman's campaign would be a first. 
""Nothing like that has happened before,"" Boatright said.
Money may not prove to be the decisive factor. Trump won Wyoming with 70% of the vote in 2020, and his endorsement should solidify support for Hageman even if Cheney keeps fundraising at her current pace. The winner of the primary is almost certain to sail to victory in the general election in the deeply red state. 
Last month the non-partisan Cook Political Report said Cheney faced a ""far-fetched path to renomination"" that would depend on Democrats switching parties to vote for her -- which they can do in the state's primaries -- and Hageman splitting votes with state Senator Anthony Bouchard, who along with retired military officer Denton Knapp has stayed in the race.

Cheney's supporters are not deterred. Bobbie Kilberg, a well-connected Virginia Republican, said more than 200 people have indicated they will attend the March 14 fundraiser she is hosting with Senator Mitt Romney as featured guest, prompting her to change the venue from her home to a hotel that could accommodate more guests.
""In the end she's going to surprise people,"" Kilberg said. ""A lot of people who have been quiet will stand up and vote for Liz.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. congressional committee is investigating former President Donald Trump's handling of White House records after 15 boxes of documents were transferred from his Florida resort to a federal agency, including whether the material included classified information, the panel's chairwoman said on Thursday.
House of Representatives Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement she was ""deeply concerned"" that the records were not promptly turned over to the National Archives when Trump's term ended in January 2021 and ""that they appear to have been removed from the White House in violation of the Presidential Records Act.""
Maloney, a Democrat, also expressed concern over U.S. media reports that Trump ""repeatedly attempted to destroy presidential records, which could constitute additional serious violations"" of that law, which requires the preservation of written communications related to a president's official duties.
An upcoming book written by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said staffers found documents clogging Trump's toilet in the White House during his tenure - an account that the Republican former president in a statement called ""categorically false.""
""Staff in the White House would periodically find the toilet clogged"" and would then find ""wads of clumped up, wet printed paper ... either notes or some other piece of paper that they believe he had thrown down the toilet"" in his bathroom, Haberman told CNN, adding it was unclear what types of documents were found.
In his statement, Trump acknowledged the boxes of records were sent to the Archives after discussions he called collaborative. Trump said he had been told he ""was under no obligation"" to hand over any White House materials, though he did not say who gave him that directive, which was at odds with the law. 
""The papers were given easily and without conflict and on a very friendly basis,"" Trump said.
The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the National Archives and Records Administration, the federal agency responsible for preserving government records, has asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Trump's handling of White House records.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would investigate. The National Archives said it would not comment on potential or ongoing investigations.
In a report on Thursday, the Post, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter, said some of the documents Trump took to his Florida resort were clearly marked as classified, including documents at the ""top secret"" level.
The Archives in a statement on Monday said it had arranged for the transfer of 15 boxes of memos, letters and other documents from Trump's private resort in Florida in mid-January, a month after a Trump representative reporting locating them.

The Archives also said it had worked with Trump representatives throughout last year to locate presidential records that had not been transferred to the agency. 
Maloney said she asked the Archives whether it checked for and found any classified documents in the 15 boxes, whether it was aware of any other missing records from Trump's administration and whether it had notified the U.S. attorney general. She also asked if the Archives was aware of any records destroyed by Trump without its approval, and any actions to recover or preserve them, giving the agency until Feb. 18 to respond.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump has told associates he has remained in contact with North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong Un since leaving the White House, according to a report on Thursday amid raised tensions over recent North Korean missile tests.
""As we know, he had a fixation on this relationship,"" New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman told CNN. The revelation is contained in her upcoming book on Trump, ""The Confidence Man.""
Trump famously declared in 2018 that he and Kim ""fell in love"" after exchanging letters, but three meetings with the North Korean leader failed to persuade him to give up his nuclear bombs and missiles.
Trump's claims could not be verified and may not be true, Haberman said. 
""What he says and what's actually happening are not always in concert, but he has been telling people that he has maintained some kind of a correspondence or discussion with Kim Jong Un,"" she said. 
It is the only foreign leader Trump has said he remains in contact with, she added.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the report and when asked if it was aware of such contact and the White House did not immediately respond. A representative for Trump also did not return a request for comment.
The 1799 Logan Act bars private U.S. citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without authorization.
Jenny Town, director the Washington-based North Korea project 38 North, said Trump had been known to exaggerate and any messages he had sent might only have been greetings and might not have been reciprocated. 
""But if it’s true, and there is communication taking place on anything of substance without coordination or consultation with the White House, it could be highly problematic and potentially counterproductive to U.S. interests,"" she said.
President Joe Biden's administration has repeatedly urged a return to dialogue with North Korea, but has avoided pushing for summit diplomacy, favoring detailed lower-level engagement first, an approach that has been rebuffed.
Biden called Kim a ""thug"" during his 2020 presidential campaign, but has said he would be willing to meet him under the right conditions - if he agreed to discuss his nuclear program and that their advisers met first to lay the groundwork.
Despite Trump's direct personal engagement with Kim, U.S.-North Korea relations grew frosty after the breakdown of their 2019 summit in Hanoi and Pyongyang said it would not engage further unless Washington dropped hostile policies.
The Washington Post reported that correspondences with Kim were among the presidential records in 15 boxes the National Archives said it retrieved last month from Trump's Florida residence.

North Korea's recent missiles tests, including its first of an intermediate range ballistic missile since 2017, have raised fears it may be preparing for a return to tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs, which it has not conducted since that year. 
North Korea boasted on Tuesday it is one of only a handful of countries to field nuclear weapons and advanced missiles and the only one standing up to the United States by ""shaking the world"" with missile tests.

Investigators have not uncovered evidence that any official records were tampered with or deleted, the newspaper reported https://nyti.ms/3HJN5f9 on Thursday, citing two people familiar with the phone records and noting Trump was known to use his personal cellphone or other people's cellphones.
The call log gaps may complicate House investigators' efforts to get a complete picture of the former Republican president's actions at the time his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. 
Still, the House panel has obtained information on calls and other communications as it interviews other witnesses.
In August, investigators told 35 telephone, email and social media companies to preserve any records that could be relevant to the probe. Last month, the panel subpoenaed several social media firms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Reddit.

CNN last month also reported that the panel had subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with Trump's son Eric Trump as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to his other son, Donald Trump Jr.
Trump, in a statement released before the Times' report, again decried the panel and called the probe a political attack against him.

Jolie's voice broke as she acknowledged the women and children ""for whom this legislation comes too late"" in a speech in Washington D.C.
""Standing here at the center of our nation's power, I can think only of everyone who has been made to feel powerless by their abusers by a system that failed to protect them,"" Jolie, wearing a black suit and pearls, said.
The Violence Against Women Act expired at the end of 2018 and U.S. President Joe Biden, who originally sponsored the bill as a senator in 1994, had campaigned on renewing it.
The House of Representatives approved its renewal in a 244-172 vote almost a year ago, but legislation stalled in Congress amid partisan disputes over access to guns and transgender issues.
""The reason many people struggle to leave abusive situations is that they have been made to feel worthless. When there is silence from a Congress too busy to renew the Violence Against Women Act for a decade, it reinforces that sense of worthlessness,"" said Jolie. ""You think, I guess my abuser is right. I guess I'm not worth very much.""

Republican Senators Joni Ernst and Lisa Murkowski and Democrats Dick Durbin and Dianne Feinstein issued a joint media release confirming they had reached a ""compromise"" deal to get the bill moving. 
Biden said in a statement he was ""grateful that this critical bipartisan bill is moving forward, and I look forward to Congress delivering it to my desk without delay.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin portrayed herself as a dedicated public servant in testimony in her defamation case against the New York Times, after a former editor who oversaw the 2017 editorial underlying her lawsuit on Wednesday denied trying to blame the prominent Republican for a 2011 mass shooting.
Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate, appeared only briefly on the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, and is expected to return on Thursday.
James Bennet, a former Times editorial page editor, earlier testified that changes he made to a draft of the editorial, which the Times later corrected, were not meant to hold Palin or her political action committee responsible for the 2011 shooting.
""Did you intend to cause Ms. Palin any harm through any of your edits to the draft?"" the Times' lawyer David Axelrod asked Bennet during the trial's fifth day in Manhattan federal court.
""No, I didn't,"" Bennet responded. 
Bennet also said ""no"" when asked if he tried to blame Palin or the political action committee. Bennet said he moved quickly to correct the editorial as criticism mounted that its wording suggested they were to blame.
""We don't promise to be perfect, we promise to try our damnedest to be perfect, and when we're not we try to fix it,"" Bennet testified.
On the witness stand, Palin, 57, discussed her family, her background and being chosen by 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain as his running mate.
""I don't think they were prepared for me, necessarily, because I was new to the national stage,"" Palin said.
""But it was an amazing experience ... to travel around the country and meet so many amazing people, and to see the beauty of America and offer myself up in the name of public service at that level,"" Palin added.
The trial is a test of longstanding legal protections for U.S. media against defamation claims by public figures. 
To win, Palin must prove that Bennet and the Times acted with ""actual malice,"" https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-times-palin-idUKKBN25O31B meaning they knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
Palin sued over a June 14, 2017, editorial, headlined ""America's Lethal Politics,"" that addressed gun control and lamented the deterioration of political discourse.
It was written after a shooting at a Virginia baseball field where congressman Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded.
'POLITICAL INCITEMENT'
The editorial referred to the January 2011 shooting in an Arizona parking lot by gunman Jared Lee Loughner where six people died and Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic congresswoman, was among those wounded.
It referred to Palin's political action committee having earlier circulated a map that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under cross hairs.
Bennet added incorrect language that said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" between the map and the Giffords shooting. The editorial was corrected the next day.
In Wednesday's testimony, Bennet maintained that he added the language while under deadline pressure, thinking that the growth of ""highly charged political rhetoric"" could prompt such incidents.
Bennet denied adding the language in order to suggest Loughner used the cross hairs map.
""If I thought it caused the violence, I would have used the word 'cause,'"" Bennet said.
Bennet said he was ""alarmed"" when conservative Times columnist Ross Douthat emailed less than an hour after the editorial ran that it appeared to incorrectly link Palin to the Giffords shooting. Some readers also complained.
""We were really, really harshly criticized for muddying the record,"" Bennet said, ""I thought it was urgent to correct the piece as forthrightly as possible, to acknowledge our mistake. This is basic practice. It's the right thing to do.""
Lawyers for Palin have tried to show that the correction was too slow, and noted several times that it did not mention her.
Palin's lawyer Shane Vogt questioned Bennet about why the correction omitted his role in crafting the editorial.
Douthat subsequently testified that he thought his inference of a link between Palin and the Giffords shooting was ""the natural one,"" and which even some liberals shared.

""It was something that was being discussed a lot online,"" he said. ""If there was a correction that needed to be made, the sooner the better.""
Palin has signaled that if she loses at trial, she will on appeal challenge a landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision, New York Times v Sullivan, that established the actual malice standard.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol announced on Wednesday it had subpoenaed former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a key player in then-President Donald Trump's effort to overturn his election defeat.
The House of Representatives committee said it is seeking records and deposition testimony from Navarro who, according to public reporting, interviews and his own book, was involved in efforts to delay Congress' certification of the 2020 election.
""Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the Jan. 6 attack on the capitol,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's Democratic chairman, said in a statement.
""He hasn’t been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former President’s support for those plans,"" Thompson said.
In response to a request for comment, Navarro said Trump had claimed his communications while in the White House are protected by executive privilege. ""President Trump has invoked Executive Privilege; and it is not my privilege to waive,"" he said in a statement.
Navarro served as White House trade policy adviser under Trump. Navarro has said in media interviews and his book that he helped coordinate an effort - ""the Green Bay Sweep"" to halt certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3, 2020 election and keep Trump, a Republican, in power. 
""We spent a lot of time lining up over 100 congressmen, including some senators,"" Navarro told the Daily Beast in December. 
""It was a perfect plan,"" he added.
The committee has so far interviewed more than 500 witnesses, issued more than 60 subpoenas and obtained more than 50,000 pages of records as it probes the causes of the assault by a pro-Trump mob on the Capitol, and the role played by Trump, who continues to push false claims that his election defeat to Biden was the result of fraud. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the violence.

The committee is aiming to release an interim report in the summer and a final report in the fall, a source familiar with the investigation said in December. 
It asked Navarro to produce documents by Feb. 23 and appear for a deposition on March 2.

Weeks ago, Pelosi said the House Administration Committee was reviewing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-says-banning-member-stock-trades-possible-2022-01-20 several suggestions from rank-and-file members amid calls for a new prohibition on stock market transactions. 
""I assume that they'll have it pretty soon,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference. She was referring to an Administration Committee bill.
The top House Democrat added that she also wants to see a tightening of fines on lawmakers who violate existing ethics laws on reporting investments and that any new controls on members of Congress would have to be extended to the entire federal government.
Pelosi singled out the need to include the federal judiciary.
Late last year, Pelosi had defended stock market trading by members.
But the practice has come under increasing scrutiny, in part as social media users pay growing attention to U.S. lawmakers' investments https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosis-stock-trades-attract-growing-following-online-2022-01-26.
Some individual lawmakers' investments have raised questions over possible conflicts of interest given that Congress' oversight duties can allow it to get information ahead of the public, with some members facing investigation or charges.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday joined in calling for bipartisan legislation. 
""I believe this is an important issue that Congress should address, and it's something that clearly has raised interest from both sides of the aisle in the past few weeks,"" he said in a Senate speech.
Democrats hold a majority in Congress, but House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told Punchbowl News in January that he also backed the effort -- which precedes the Nov. 8 midterm congressional election that will decide which political party will control each chamber.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell separately told reporters on Tuesday that he had not yet weighed a possible ban but would consider any legislation. He added that he does not own any individual stocks and advises members to invest via mutual funds, as he does. 

At her Wednesday news conference, Pelosi sidestepped a question on whether lawmakers' spouses should be included in whatever new controls are written into legislation, saying she was leaving details to the committee.
But referring to the overall effort, she said: ""It is a confidence issue. And if that's what the members want to do, then that's what we will do,"" adding, however, that crafting a bill will be ""complicated.""

(Reuters) - Republican and Democratic lawmakers across the United States are drawing political maps that will likely deepen polarization and encourage more extreme candidates by eliminating competitive congressional seats, a new Reuters analysis shows.
Thirty-one states have finalized new congressional maps as part of the once-a-decade redistricting mandated by law. Along with six states that each have only one district, 308 of the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives now have boundaries in place for November's midterm elections.
In 2020, there were 62 districts in those states where the margin in the presidential election was within 10 percentage points, according to the analysis. Under the new maps, that figure drops by one-third to 41.
The erasure of competitive districts is damaging to democracy in multiple ways, electoral experts say.
Congress is already deeply divided, with major legislation frequently drawing support or opposition strictly along party lines. If the fear of losing in the general election is gone, candidates are more likely to move toward the ideological extremes to secure their party's nomination.
With so many elections predetermined before a ballot is cast, voters - particularly in the minority party - can feel effectively disenfranchised.
""When politicians draw lines that lock in the winners for the rest of the decade, it creates a disillusionment among voters that elections may not matter, because our voices won't be heard,"" said Kathay Feng, the national redistricting director for the good government group Common Cause. 
And without the political middle represented in Congress, ""you end up with a dysfunctional body,"" she said.
Political gerrymandering - the manipulation of district lines to entrench one party in power - has become increasingly weaponized by both parties in recent years, helped along by advances in data and mapping technology. Republicans have used the practice more effectively, however, after making major gains in statehouses in 2010.
Even before this redistricting cycle, close to half of U.S. House races were determined by margins of more than 30 percentage points.
The elimination of swing districts is especially marked when looking only at states where one party held unfettered power over redistricting.
In Texas, there were 14 congressional districts in 2020 where Joe Biden and Donald Trump were separated by fewer than 10 percentage points. The state's new Republican-drawn map includes only three such districts, leaving 35 seats where the outcome is all but assured before November's election ever takes place.
New York Democrats last week approved an aggressive map that eliminates three of the state's five competitive seats in order to give Democrats the edge in a whopping 22 of 26 districts.
Thus far, neither party has emerged from redistricting with a significant edge. Republican-controlled Florida, which has 28 seats, has not completed new lines, and lawsuits in several states could force changes to their maps.
The Reuters analysis relied on PlanScore, a mapping tool developed by the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, as well as voting totals calculated by the Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) of U.S. Presidential Elections. The calculations exclude Kentucky because full precinct-level voting data could not be obtained.
CENTRISTS UNDER FIRE
A lack of competitive races may decrease voter turnout and lessen investment in voter outreach by the national parties in many parts of the country, electoral experts said.
Voters who turn out in primary elections tend to be further left or right than the general electorate. As a result, candidates in heavily partisan districts are incentivized to cater to their base.
""Probably the biggest effect is you really pull the rug out from under centrists in both parties,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston. ""All the candidates have to worry about is winning the primary.""
In Texas' 3rd district, for instance, which Trump barely carried over Biden in 2020, two-term Republican congressman Van Taylor won by a double-digit margin in part by touting his bipartisan credentials.
Now, however, his vote last year in support of creating an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters has prompted a right-wing challenge from a former county judge, Keith Self.
Republican legislators redrew the district to make it safer, transforming it from one that Trump won by a single percentage point to one he would have carried by 14. But it may also provide more of an opportunity for Self, who has argued that Taylor is not sufficiently loyal to Trump.
Texas on March 1 holds the country's first primary of the 2022 midterm election cycle. 
In Illinois, Democratic lawmakers pushed through an aggressively gerrymandered map that aimed to secure 14 of the state's 17 seats. The plan merged two northern Republican districts into one heavily conservative area, prompting incumbent Adam Kinzinger, a moderate who drew Trump's ire for voting to impeach him, to retire.

In southern Illinois, the map also placed moderate incumbent Rodney Davis in a much more Republican district. Republican Congress member, Mary Miller, a far-right Trump supporter with a penchant for controversy, has announced she will take on Davis in the primary after her own district was merged with another.
Trump has already endorsed Miller, in part because Davis - who had represented a swing district - voted to certify the 2020 election results.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell on Tuesday criticized his party's censure of two prominent Republican critics of Donald Trump, joining an intra-party battle that could upend his efforts to project an image of party moderation in this year's midterm elections.
Last week, the Republican National Committee censured https://www.reuters.com/world/us/loyal-trump-republican-party-moves-censure-us-reps-cheney-kinzinger-2022-02-04 Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the only two Republicans serving on the House of Representatives select committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of then-President Trump stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
""The issue is whether or not the RNC should be sort of singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority. That's not the job of the RNC,"" McConnell told a news conference. 
The RNC took its action on Friday, calling the Democratic-led committee's inquiry an attack on ""legitimate political discourse."" 
McConnell rejected that description, saying, ""We saw what happened. It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election from one administration to the next. That's what it was."" 
The controversy comes as Republicans are hoping to regain majorities in the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
McConnell, the Senate minority leader and one of his party's most wily political tacticians, has been trying to paint Biden as a former moderate radicalized by the Democratic Party's left wing. Projecting an image of moderation for the Republicans could help the party's Senate candidates in key states.
Lawmakers close to McConnell have found themselves on the defensive about the RNC censure resolution.
""They said, in the resolution, they wanted Republicans to be unified. That was not a unifying action,"" said Senator John Cornyn of Texas. 
Senate Republican leaders were quick to acknowledge the trouble that party divisions might pose for Republican Senate candidates. 
""If we want to win the elections in November, there are better things for us to be focused on,"" said Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican after McConnell. 
""The focus right now needs to be forward, not backward. If we want to get majorities in the fall, then it's better to turn our fire on Democrats and not on each other,"" Thune added.
Others pointed to Senate Republican criticism of the RNC as a problem for candidates in some states. 
""Whatever you think about the RNC vote, it reflects the view of most Republicans,"" said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who objected to 2020 election results on Jan. 6. 
""In my state, it's not helpful to have a bunch of D.C. Republicans commenting on the RNC... super unhelpful,"" he said. 
Democrats may be vulnerable in November, particularly considering Biden's falling public approval https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa numbers in opinion polls. The party of sitting presidents typically loses congressional seats in the first midterm elections after winning the White House.
McConnell has sought to cast Biden and his pricy ""Build Back Better"" social spending plan that is stalled in the Senate as creatures of the Democratic Party's left wing. McConnell has accused Biden of ignoring troubles facing American families such as inflation, including higher energy costs. 
""If the president starts acting like a moderate, like he campaigned, we can do business,"" McConnell told Fox News last month.

While McConnell is calling for bipartisanship, he often has been a partisan warrior himself. As majority leader, he refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and last year said https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/republican-mcconnell-signals-blockade-any-2024-biden-high-court-nominee-2021-06-14 he might block Biden's nominees to the high court if Republicans gain Senate control. He also has used the Senate's filibuster rule to thwart parts of Biden's legislative agenda, including voting rights.
McConnell did deliver critical Republican votes last year for two bipartisan priorities - a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a deal to avert a default on the federal government's debt. Both prompted enraged statements from Trump, who has called for McConnell's ouster from his Senate leadership post.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A former New York Times editorial page editor was put on the defensive on Tuesday in Sarah Palin's defamation trial against the newspaper over a 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked the former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor to an earlier mass shooting in Arizona.
James Bennet, the former editor, testified in the trial's fourth day that he relied upon research from colleagues before adding language, under deadline pressure, that suggested Palin's political action committee might have incited the 2011 Arizona shooting.
Six people died and former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in that shooting. 
The June 14, 2017, editorial about gun control and the decline of political discourse followed a shooting at a Virginia baseball practice in which Steve Scalise, a member of the House of Representatives' Republican leadership, was wounded.
""I was really concerned ... that something like this didn't seem like such a big deal any more,"" Bennet told Palin's lawyer Shane Vogt. ""It seemed like a huge deal that several Republican congressmen had been shot, and I did want to get our readers' attention to that.""
The trial is a test of legal protections that have long safeguarded U.S. media from defamation claims by public figures.
Lawyers for Palin have accused the Times of trying to falsely smear her, and questioned other Times journalists about the newspaper's writing and editing procedures. 
Palin, 57, has signaled that if she lost she would use an appeal to challenge the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case called New York Times v Sullivan. 
She is trying to prove that Bennet and the Times acted with ""actual malice,"" https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-times-palin-idUKKBN25O31B a high standard adopted in the Sullivan decision, meaning they knew the editorial was false or had reckless disregard for the truth.
Bennet is the highest-level Times journalist expected to testify.
The editorial originally drafted by board member Elizabeth Williamson referenced Palin's political action committee having circulated a map before the Giffords shooting that put the congresswoman and 19 other Democrats under cross hairs.
Bennet added language that ""the link to political incitement was clear"" and that there was no sign of incitement in the Scalise shooting as direct as in the Giffords shooting.
In a subsequent correction, the Times said there was no such link.
NOT SHIFTING BLAME
Bennet testified that he initially intended to make notes for Williamson to review, but under deadline pressure made changes and asked her to ""please take a look"" at them.
""I was concerned about getting the piece done on time, ... and I just began editing the piece myself,"" he said. ""I'm not looking to shift the blame.""
Vogt tried to show that shortly after the editorial's late evening publication, Bennet learned from Times colleague Ross Douthat and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts that the wording might be problematic, but waited until the next morning to ask staff to look into it.
Bennet said the Times had a policy against taking down published pieces, and noted that the editorial was already running in the print edition.
He said he later apologized to the newspaper's board.
""I wasn't asked to do that, there just happened to be a meeting,"" he said. ""I don't know if that qualifies as a reprimand but it felt like one.""
Bennet also said the Times had a policy against apologizing for corrections, which are ""extremely painful"" for journalists, and that it would be ""meaningless"" to apologize for every error.
Asked if he had apologized to Palin, Bennet said: ""I hope that as a consequence of this process, now I have.""
Linda Cohn, a retired Times editor, testified earlier on Tuesday that she never heard Bennet discussing Palin negatively, and that he initially appeared surprised to learn people were upset with the editorial's wording.
""There was a general sense of 'oh no,'"" she said.

Palin was John McCain's running mate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.
Bennet was expected to resume testimony on Wednesday. He has yet to be questioned by his own lawyers. Palin is also expected to testify at the trial.

(Reuters) -U.S. Secret Service agents rushed Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, to safety on Tuesday while students and administrators evacuated after a bomb threat to a Washington school celebrating a Black History Month event, officials said.
Emhoff was at Dunbar High School, the first high school for Black Americans in the United States, according to its website.
A series of bomb threats were made last week to at least a dozen historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) nationwide, forcing the institutions to cancel classes and raising fears among Black communities. No explosives were found at any of the locations but the threats are being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Police said that preliminary information indicated Tuesday's bomb threat was neither related to last week's threats nor was it targeted at Emhoff. However, it added that a connection with last week's threats could not be completely ruled out.
Police said that the bomb threat was made in a phone call, which authorities were tracing. The area was deemed safe by late afternoon.

Emhoff's staff earlier told reporters that the school reported the threat to the U.S. Secret Service, which protects U.S. political leaders and their families. Emhoff was safe, his spokesperson said.
""We had a threat today to the facility so we ... took the precaution of evacuating everybody, as you saw. I think everyone is safe. The building is clear,"" a District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) spokesperson said.

Russia has amassed troops and equipment along its border with Ukraine, stoking fears of an invasion. Washington has threatened Moscow with sanctions should it attack Ukraine.
""It is moving along but there are still a couple of areas of disagreement, but they're bridging the gap. They're getting closer and closer,"" Schumer said of the sanctions bill.
Schumer told reporters that many congressional Democrats and the administration of President Joe Biden think that passing a ""strong sanctions bill before any invasion ... would take away the disincentive from Russia invading."" That, he said, is one of the outstanding areas of disagreement with Republicans.
Russia has demanded that NATO pledge to never admit Ukraine into its military alliance and that it remove its presence from eastern Europe.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell played down the potential impact of such legislation. 
""The president has all the authority he needs"" to act against Russia, McConnell told reporters, adding, ""He needs to decide the timing. I think it's going to be a serious deterrent if it's executed before the invasion, not afterwards.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Colorado lawmakers are seeking stronger protections for election workers after an unprecedented year of terroristic threats inspired by former President Donald Trump’s false voting-fraud claims, state officials said on Tuesday.
Colorado’s “Election Official Protection Act” adds to a growing number of U.S. states considering similar legislation. The bill would expand on existing law to “make clear that it is a crime to intimidate, threaten, or coerce - or to attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce - an election official while they are performing official duties,” said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold ahead of an expected Tuesday announcement on the legislation.
The bill, sponsored by state Representatives Monica Duran and Emily Sirota, both Democrats, also makes it a crime to retaliate against election officials “for the performance of official duties.” And it gives election workers greater protections against “doxing,” the public release of information such as home addresses or other private identifying information, often to facilitate harassment.
“We are seeing the Big Lie morph into just big threats to election officials across the country,” Griswold, a Democrat, said in a phone interview, referring to Trump’s false claims of fraud. “Extreme elected officials who are spreading disinformation, repeating lies about 2020 and future elections, are now fueling threats against election officials.”
At least seven other states - Vermont, Maine, New Mexico, Illinois, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Washington - are considering similar measures https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-trump-death-threats-prompt-bills-3-states-protect-election-workers-2022-01-24 to protect election workers, according to a review of the legislation.
The proposals follow a Reuters series of investigative reports https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/campaign-of-fear documenting a nationwide wave of threats and harassment against election administrators by Trump supporters who embrace the former president’s false stolen-election claims. Sponsors and supporters of the legislation in several states cited Reuters reporting as an impetus for proposing tougher enforcement.
In Minnesota, legislators have introduced a bill that would prohibit “intimidation,” including threats of violence, against election officials. Reuters coverage “played a role in our decision to bring forward this bill,” said state Senator Nick Frentz, a co-sponsor of the bill. “Minnesota has to signal to the public that we will protect our election workers if we want our democracy to remain strong. And in Minnesota, we sure as hell do.”
Reuters coverage on the threats “basically opened the entire topic to the country,” said Griswold in Colorado, who has faced harassment and death threats herself following the 2020 election. 
Reuters documented the violent messages against Griswold in a Sept. 8 report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-law-enforcement that highlighted the gaps in law enforcement protection for threatened election workers. “Watch your back. I KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP, I SEE YOU SLEEPING. BE AFRAID,” said one Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message to Griswold on Aug. 10. “I hope you die.” 
After police failed to investigate the threat, Reuters tracked down and interviewed the man https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats, who admitted to reporters that he sent the message but said he didn’t believe he did anything wrong.
Sirota said election workers shouldn’t “have to feel unsafe in their own homes” because of their work. “It has become rapidly and startlingly apparent that we need to provide additional protections for election workers in the face of the threats of violence they have received over the last two years.”
Griswold said she expected the bill would be submitted in the current legislative session which ends in May. Democrats control both chambers of Colorado’s state legislature and the governor’s office.
Prosecutions of such threats have been rare. But last month, a task force launched in June by the Department of Justice to address threats against election workers made its first two arrests. On Jan. 27, it announced the arrest https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nevada-man-charged-with-threatening-state-elections-official-2022-01-28 of a man accused of threatening a worker in the Nevada Secretary of State’s office. That followed a Jan. 21 announcement of the arrest of a Texas man https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-texas-man-threatening-georgia-government-officials-2022-01-21 accused of threats against Georgia officials.
Colorado’s current law prohibits the interference of an election official’s work and makes it a crime to cause an election official “to violate or refuse to comply” with their duty. The bill expands on that law and adds language making threatening an election official a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to 120 days in jail and a fine of no more $750.

Current state laws also prohibit doxing people in certain government roles, such as human services and public health workers, judges, police officers, prosecutors, public defenders or public safety workers. Election officials and workers would join this group under the new legislation.
Federal laws have stiffer penalties for criminal threats. It’s a federal felony, for instance, to communicate a threat across state lines, such as by phone or email. Federal laws against stalking could also apply to the intimidation of election workers, legal experts say, particularly in cases of repeated threats of violence over a period of time. Such laws generally prohibit any actions that put a person in reasonable fear of death or serious injury, or cause emotional distress.

President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats suffered twin legislative defeats last month in their push to toughen voting rights protections in the run-up to this November's midterm elections that will determine control of Congress in 2023.
Senate Republicans blocked Democrats' efforts to advance the voting rights legislation, accusing Democrats of fabricating a crisis and saying little or nothing need be done with the way states administer elections.
Democrats accuse Republicans in various U.S. states of exploiting their majorities in state legislatures to craft electoral maps and restrictions that diminish the clout of Black and other racial minority voters while maximizing the power of white voters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Republican David McCormick (NYSE:MKC) won the endorsement on Tuesday of former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his drive to secure his party's nomination for a U.S. Senate seat that could decide control of Congress in November's elections.
McCormick, a former hedge fund chief executive officer who has ties to ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, is among the Republicans vying to replace Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who is retiring.
Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas, was CIA director and secretary of state under Trump and is considered a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
The former secretary of state's endorsement was announced in a statement released by the McCormick campaign. McCormick was recently endorsed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders, who is running for governor of Arkansas this year.
""Dave McCormick is a warrior, from the battlefield to the negotiating table, and I've seen his toughness in action since we were together at the United States Military Academy,"" Pompeo said.
McCormick, who was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and also served in former President George W. Bush's administration, pledged to fight for tough policies against China if elected. 
""Mike understands that China is one of the biggest threats facing the U.S. and the urgent need for Pennsylvania to have a U.S. senator who will stand strong to protect Pennsylvania and America's interests,"" McCormick said.
McCormick's wife, Dina Powell, served as deputy national security adviser early in the Trump administration.
Republicans in Pennsylvania decided last Saturday not to endorse a primary candidate in the one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country, amid concerns they could back a candidate in a crowded field who might put them at odds with Trump. 
Other Republicans in the race include Carla Sands, Trump's former ambassador to Denmark, and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who is a friend of the former president.
Trump has not said whether he will back any of the current candidates.

The Pennsylvania Republican primary election is scheduled for May 17.

""Former President Trump’s representatives have informed NARA that they are continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives,"" the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) said in a statement on Monday.
The hunt for additional documents and items raises questions about Trump's compliance with federal law requiring the preservation of all communications regarding official presidential duties.
The archives confirmed officials retrieved the boxes from Trump's Mar-a-Lago property - one year after they should have been transferred to the agency when Democratic President Joe Biden took office.
""The Presidential Records Act is critical to our democracy, in which the government is held accountable by the people,"" U.S. Archivist David Ferriero said. 
The statement followed reports by the Washington Post on the boxes found in Florida and the Trump administration's haphazard recordkeeping, including Trump's habit of tearing up official documents.
Representatives for Trump, a Republican, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Former aides to Trump told the Post and the New York Times the materials handed over to the archives were packed up hastily during the former president's exit.
Several presidential historians said the violations under Trump were unprecedented.
""It's a pretty shocking disregard for the Presidential Records Act,"" historian Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Chervinsky told CNN on Tuesday. 
""Presidential documents belong to all of us Americans, not some ex-President,"" historian Michael Beschloss tweeted on Monday. ""Crucial now for all Americans to know exactly how many and what Presidential documents were illegally taken, hidden or destroyed.""
Among the items retrieved in January were letters to Trump from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump's predecessor, former Democratic president Barack Obama, according to the reports.
The U.S. House of Representatives is investigating Trump supporters' Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump sought to block congressional investigators from obtaining his records but the U.S. Supreme Court last month rejected his request.

Experts said it was unclear what, if any, repercussions could follow regarding the materials' improper handling. 
""There has never been a prosecution under the Presidential Records Act because no president has ever flouted it to this extent,"" Chervinsky said.

Eric Lander, who serves as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, was the focus of an internal review after subordinates complained about his treatment of them. The review was first reported by Politico earlier on Monday and confirmed by White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
""I am devastated that I caused hurt to past and present colleagues by the way in which I have spoken to them,"" Lander said in the resignation letter submitted to Biden.
Noting that he sought to push himself and colleagues by at times ""challenging and criticizing,"" he acknowledged that ""things I said, and the way I said them, crossed the line at times into being disrespectful and demeaning.""
The allegations against Lander struck a nerve given Biden came into office pledging to take a hard line on any disrespect among members of his administration and turn the page from the derisive rhetoric of his predecessor Donald Trump. 
""If you're ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot ... no ifs, ands or buts,"" Biden told political appointees during a swearing-in ceremony.
""Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity,"" he said at the time.
When asked about the allegations against Lander earlier on Monday, Psaki condemned Lander's behavior.
""In addition to the full, thorough investigation, it was conveyed through meetings to senior White House officials directly that his behavior was inappropriate,"" she said.
""Nothing about his behavior is acceptable to anyone here - not at all,"" she added.

On Monday evening, Psaki put out a statement saying Biden had accepted Lander's resignation letter ""with gratitude for his work,"" citing his role in fighting cancer, climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.
Lander said his resignation should be effective no later than Feb. 18.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 33 Republican senators warned U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday that they would work to thwart implementation of any new Iran nuclear agreement if his government did not allow Congress to review and vote on its terms.
Led by Senator Ted Cruz, a long-time opponent of the 2015 nuclear deal, the senators told Biden in a letter dated Monday that they would use ""the full range of options and leverage available"" to ensure that his government adhered to U.S. laws governing any new accord with Iran.
Indirect talks in Vienna between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 agreement are due to resume on Tuesday. Talk of a possible agreement has driven oil prices lower, with markets anticipating that the possible removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales could boost global supplies.
The Biden administration has been trying to revive the deal, which lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities, a deal from which former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018.
Iran later breached many of the deal's nuclear restrictions and kept pushing well beyond them.
Cruz and other senior Republican senators told Biden that implementation of any new deal would be ""severely, if not terminally hampered"" if he did not meet statutory obligations aimed at ensuring congressional oversight over revisions or changes to the 2015 Iran nuclear accord.
They provided no details about their plans, but Republicans have used various tactics to slow down other legislation or put holds on Biden's nominees, including many for ambassador posts. 
Democrats control the 50-50 Senate only by virtue of a tie-breaking vote that can be cast by Vice President Kamala Harris, but they could lose control of the Senate and the House of Representatives in mid-term elections later this year.
The senators said any nuclear agreement with Iran was of ""such grativity for U.S. national security"" that it would by definition be a treaty requiring the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, they argued.
Any deal that fell short of Senate-ratified treaty would ""likely be torn up in the early days of the next presidential administration,"" they added, anticipating a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential race.

In addition, they noted that a 2015 law passed before completion of the initial nuclear deal requires that any new “agreement” related to Iran’s nuclear program to be transmitted to Congress for a 60-day review period during which Congress could pass a joint resolution of disapproval that would essentially prevent the deal from going into effect.

(Reuters) - The United States faces heightened threats from extremist groups domestic and foreign, underscored by last month's hostage standoff crisis in a Texas synagogue and bomb threats at many historically Black colleges and universities, a U.S. government agency said on Monday.
The warning comes after some schools across the United States cancelled classes and issued shelter-in-place orders last week. Investigators ultimately failed to turn up any explosives.
""Threats directed at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other colleges and universities, Jewish facilities, and churches cause concern and may inspire extremist threat actors to mobilize to violence,"" the Homeland Security Department said in a bulletin.
Last month, British-born gunman Malik Faisal Akram took four people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, including its rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker. He brandished a gun and held them hostage for 10 hours https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rabbi-threw-chair-texas-synagogue-hostage-taker-before-escaping-2022-01-17. The standoff ended in gunfire, with all four hostages released unharmed and the suspect dead.
""Supporters of foreign terrorist organizations have encouraged copycat attacks following the January 15, 2022 attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas,"" the federal agency added.
The U.S. intelligence community warned months ago https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-terrorism/u-s-report-warns-of-threats-from-white-supremacists-militias-idUSKBN2B92SG of a threat that racially motivated violent extremists, such as white supremacists, would seek to carry out mass-casualty attacks on civilians. 
The United States remains in a heightened threat environment, the department said on Monday.

""Foreign terrorists remain intent on targeting the United States and U.S. persons, and may seek to capitalize on the evolving security environment overseas to plot attacks.""
The agency also warned that the Islamic State or its affiliates may issue public calls for retaliation due to a U.S. special forces raid in Syria https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-led-coalition-operation-northern-syria-targeted-jihadists-2022-02-03 last week that led to the death of the group's leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let Alabama use a Republican-backed map of the state's U.S. congressional districts that a lower court found likely discriminates against Black voters, handing an important victory to Republicans as they seek to regain control of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections.
In a 5-4 decision, the court granted an emergency request by Alabama's Republican Secretary of State John Merrill and two Republican legislators to put on hold the lower court's injunctions ordering the state's Republican-led legislature to redraw the map. 
Five of the six conservative justices were in the majority, with conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court's three liberal justices in dissent. The court also said it would take up and decide the Alabama dispute on the merits, with arguments expected in the fall and a decision due by June 2023.
The state legislature previously approved the map delineating the borders of Alabama's seven U.S. House of Representatives districts.
A panel of three federal judges on Jan. 24 ruled that the map unlawfully deprived Black voters of an additional House district in which they could be a majority or close to it, likely violating the Voting Rights Act, a landmark 1965 federal law that prohibited racial discrimination in voting.
Democrats control the House by a slim margin, making every seat vital in the Republican attempt to win back a majority.
The Alabama dispute reflects an ongoing issue of contention between Democrats and Republicans in a broader fight over voting rights. Democrats have accused Republicans in various states of exploiting their majorities in state legislatures to craft electoral maps that diminish the clout of Black and other racial minority voters while maximizing the power of White voters.
Alabama's legislature adopted the latest map of the state's seven House districts last November. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the map, including by a group of Black voters and another group of voters who sued alongside the Alabama NAACP civil rights group. 
'JUDICIAL TINKERING'
In a written opinion, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower court blocked Alabama's map too close to the 2022 election, contravening Supreme Court precedent. 
""Late judicial tinkering with election laws can lead to disruption and to unanticipated and unfair consequences for candidates, political parties and voters, among others,"" Kavanaugh wrote.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan called the decision ""badly wrong"" and, referring to the Voting Rights Act, said the high court's action ""forces Black Alabamians to suffer what under that law is clear vote dilution."" Her dissent was joined by fellow liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. 
""Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians' voting rights just because the court's order came down in the first month of an election year,"" Kagan added.
In his dissent, Roberts wrote that the lower court ""properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.""
The action in the case reflects an increasingly assertive Supreme Court since the 2020 addition of former President Donald Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, gave it a 6-3 conservative majority. Her appointment changed the court's dynamics by marginalizing Roberts, considered an incrementalist conservative.
The case is among dozens https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-redistricting-legal-battles-that-could-affect-control-congress-2022-02-02 of legal challenges nationwide over the composition of electoral districts, which are redrawn each decade to reflect population changes as measured by a national census, last taken in 2020. 
In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain. In a major 2019 ruling https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gerrymandering/in-major-elections-ruling-u-s-supreme-court-allows-partisan-map-drawing-idUSKCN1TS24Z, the Supreme Court barred federal judges from curbing the practice, known as partisan gerrymandering. That ruling did preclude court scrutiny of racially discriminatory gerrymandering.
The challengers in Alabama accused the legislature of strategically designing the new map to dilute the electoral clout of Black voters by confining their power to a single district even though Alabama's population is 27% Black, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars voting practices that result in racial discrimination.
Section 2 has been the main tool used to show that voting policies discriminate against minorities since the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the part of the law that determined which states with a history of racial discrimination needed federal approval to change voting laws. 

In a ruling https://www.reuters.com/world/us/voting-rights-breyers-future-spotlight-us-supreme-court-2021-07-01 last July in favor of Republican-backed voting restrictions in Arizona, the Supreme Court made it harder to prove violations under Section 2. 
The three-judge lower court panel, which included two appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump and one by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, unanimously blocked the map, saying that voting in Alabama is ""polarized along racial lines"" and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat Black voters' preferred candidates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. congressional panel, calling Washington's rail and bus network essential to the functioning of the federal government, holds a hearing on Wednesday in the face of an October train derailment and other challenges.
Last month, the subway system that serves the District of Columbia and parts of Virginia and Maryland said it planned to delay for another 90 days the return of trains like the one that derailed.
None of the 187 passengers was injured but National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident could have been ""catastrophic."" 
The Washington Metrorail Safety commission in October ordered the system known formally as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to indefinitely remove about 60% of its rail cars following inspections after the derailment.
The NTSB has said the system had been aware of wheel assembly issues since 2017. In December, a group of U.S. senators also asked WMATA about the issue.
The Washington Post reported Metro had said earlier that it first detected a problem in 2017, but that it initially appeared to be limited in scope and Metro was working with the railcar's manufacturer on the issue.
Testifying before the House of Representatives Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations will be WMATA general manager Paul Wiedefeld, board chair Paul Smedberg and David Mayer, CEO of the Metro safety commission.
The subcommittee said WMATA is an ""essential component of transit for the functioning of the federal government.""

Congress provides substantial funding for the heavy rail transit system, the country's third largest, and for the bus network, the sixth largest. 
In 2019, prior to the pandemic, WMATA’s total ridership reached nearly 300 million trips per year with an average weekday Metrorail ridership of 626,000. WMATA said in January service was averaging below 200,000 rail trips daily – less than a third of pre-pandemic demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump received bad advice from ""snake oil salesmen"" who falsely told him Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, Pence's former chief of staff Marc Short said. 
""Unfortunately, the president had many bad advisers who were basically snake oil salesman giving him really random and novel ideas as to what the vice president could do,"" Short said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.
Short's comments came two days after Pence rebuked Trump in a speech to the conservative Federalist Society, saying Trump was wrong to suggest the vice president has the power to overturn an election.
""I believe that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United States,"" Short said on Sunday. ""The reality is that there was not enough significant fraud that was presented that would have overturned any of those states' elections.""
Short, who was with Pence on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to overturn the election results, recently appeared before the House Select Committee investigating the siege to answer questions.
During the attack, some of the rioters shouted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" and one now-convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-seeks-four-years-prison-capitol-rioter-qanon-shaman-2021-11-17 Trump supporter known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" left the vice president a note that read: ""It's only a matter of time, justice is coming."" 
Last week, the National Archives announced it would be turning over Pence's records to the panel, after Trump lost a legal bid to block the committee from seeing them.
Short did not discuss the details of his testimony on Sunday, saying only that he was complying with a subpoena.
However, he cast doubt on whether Pence would ever appear before the committee to testify, telling NBC ""that would be a pretty unprecedented step.""
""I think it is very different to subpoena a former vice president to talk about private conversations he had with the president,"" Short said. ""It's never happened before."" 
The committee is investigating whether any of Trump's inner circle helped plan the attack on the Capitol. It is also scrutinizing what steps Trump took to keep himself in power.
Last week, new details emerged in media reports suggesting Trump was actively exploring whether the U.S. government had the power to seize voting machines.
Reuters has confirmed that in one meeting with former Attorney General William Barr in late November 2020, Trump broached the topic, telling Barr his legal team told him the Justice Department was sitting on its hands when it could be seizing voting machines, according to one person familiar with the matter.

Barr immediately shut the idea down, saying the department had no such power, the person added.
Short, speaking on NBC on Sunday, said he had not personally heard that Trump was interested in seizing voting machines.

361,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 08:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - North Carolina's divided Supreme Court struck down the state's new congressional map on Friday, upholding claims from Democratic voters and advocacy groups that the redrawn district lines illegally favor Republicans. 
The 4-3 decision, with justices registered as Democrats making up the majority, could have an outsized impact on the 2022 midterm elections in November, when control of the closely divided U.S. Congress will be at stake. 
Democrats and civil rights activists had asserted that the new map ensures Republicans will win a majority of the state's 14 congressional districts, even in elections in which more Democratic voters cast ballots.
Issuing a ruling Friday, the Supreme Court said the maps ""are unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt under the free elections clause, the equal protection clause, the free speech clause, and the freedom of assembly clause of the North Carolina Constitution.""
North Carolina's legislature can submit new congressional and state legislative districting plans ""that satisfy all provisions of the North Carolina Constitution,"" the court said. The deadline to submit such plans for review by a trial court is Feb. 18, the court said. 
Federal law requires states to draw new congressional lines every 10 years to account for population shifts, after the U.S. Census completes its once-a-decade count. In most states, legislators control the process, leading to the practice of gerrymandering, in which one party engineers political maps to benefit itself.

The case was among numerous pending lawsuits challenging congressional maps in at least half a dozen states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking redistricting litigation.
Republicans need to flip only a handful of seats in the Nov. 8 elections to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a 221-212 edge, including vacancies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday the United States has a moral duty to condemn China's rights abuses but she urged U.S. athletes not to risk angering the ""ruthless"" Chinese government, a day before the opening of the Beijing Olympics.
Pelosi, speaking at a Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing, said the International Olympic Committee ""turns a blind eye"" to Beijing's rights violations.
Rights groups have long criticized the IOC for awarding the Games to China, citing its treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups, which the United States has deemed genocide. China denies allegations of human rights abuses.
Lawmakers on Monday urged U.S. Olympic officials to prepare to defend American athletes from possible Chinese government retaliation should they choose to speak out about China's rights abuses during the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Pelosi said Washington had an ""urgent moral duty to shine a bright light"" on Beijing's abuses during the Games.
""Now the IOC, aided by corporate sponsors, once again turns a blind eye with the 2022 Winter Olympics just to bolster their bottom line,"" Pelosi said.
""If we do not speak out against human rights violations in China, because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out against human rights violations anywhere.""
But she said athletes should focus on competing in Beijing and resist the temptation to speak out. ""Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government because they are ruthless.""

Representative Jim McGovern, the Democrat who leads the committee, blasted the IOC and corporate sponsors.
'If given a choice, I believe no athlete would want to compete in a country committing genocide and crimes against humanity. But that is what they are forced to do because of the feckless IOC and its corporate sponsors,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Republican state lawmakers in Georgia are pushing legislation to redraw electoral maps in three counties in a move that would effectively override local officials who have traditionally wielded that power in what has become a battleground state.
Democrats and voting rights activists say the moves are norm-busting power grabs for county commissioner seats that could significantly impact governance in areas with large minority populations. Republicans say they need to protect their constituents amid a period of intense demographic change.
The legislative maneuvers in Gwinnett, Athens-Clarke and Cobb counties all relate to the once-a-decade redistricting process in which local officials typically redraw the maps for commissioners and the state legislature approves them in a rubber-stamp vote. Commission chairs are elected county-wide, while members, or commissioners, are elected by district.
""What we are looking at is this idea that Republicans can use their power at the state legislature to circumvent local control,"" said Atlanta state Representative Bee Nguyen, a Democrat who is also a candidate for secretary of state. ""It is setting a new precedent that is dangerous in nature.""
The Republican lawmakers who have proposed their own maps in the bills say the maps drawn up by local officials deny their voters a voice.
The bills are the center of the latest battle over voting rights in a state President Joe Biden won narrowly in 2020, a victory that prompted Republicans to impose sweeping new ballot restrictions and make a flurry of efforts to place county election boards in Republican hands.
Redistricting has always been a partisan exercise. But for decades, lawmakers in Georgia have deferred to locally elected officials who most reflect the will of their constituents - a norm that would be changed by the bills moving their way through the state's Republican-controlled House and Senate.
Gwinnett, Cobb and Athens-Clarke all have sizeable minority populations, prompting allegations that the maneuvers are aimed at installing whites or conservatives in county seats they otherwise could not win.
In Gwinnett, the state's second-most populous county, a Republican state lawmaker this week submitted a map to replace one approved by its county commissioners and local legislative delegation, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
The map proposed by Bonnie Rich, a powerful House Republican who represents part of Gwinnett, would create a district that is roughly half white in a county that has undergone big population shifts and is now two-thirds Black, Hispanic and Asian.
Rich, who is white, said her map was ""compact"" and ""fairly apportioned"" and would keep communities in northern Gwinnett together. She criticized the county commission's map, which made minimal changes to the one drawn by Republicans a decade ago, before Gwinnett flipped to Democratic control in 2016.
""They have ensured that my constituents will not have a voice at the county level,"" Rich said during a House Governmental Affairs Committee meeting on Tuesday.
The Georgia House passed Rich's map on Thursday, mostly along party lines. The new map would require Marlene Fosque, the first Black person elected to Gwinnett's board of commissioners, to move in order to run for re-election this year.
A similar process is playing out in Cobb County, where Republican legislators have filed their own maps for the education and commissioner boards.

In Athens-Clarke, four Republicans are pushing ahead with a map that renumbers districts in way that will prevent three Democratic commissioners from running for re-election, and which goes against a map approved by the county commission.
Yurij Rudensky, a redistricting counsel in the Brennan Center's Democracy Program, said the Georgia events represent ""signs of extreme redistricting abuses"" and could be traced to the 2013 Supreme Court ruling gutting the Voting Rights Act's provision requiring former Confederate states to seek federal approval before re-drawing voting districts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell to the lowest level of his presidency this week, a danger sign for his Democratic Party which risks losing control of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.
The national poll, conducted Feb. 2-3, found that 41% of U.S. adults approved of Biden's performance in office, while 56% disapproved and the rest were not sure. The prior week's poll had put Biden at a 45% approval rating and 50% disapproval.
Americans appear increasingly exhausted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic toll. About six in ten think the country is heading in the wrong direction, with the economy and public health most often cited as top concerns, the poll showed.
After holding above 50% in his first months in office, Biden's popularity began dropping in mid-August as COVID-19 deaths surged across the country and the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed.
Democrats are increasingly worried that dissatisfaction with Biden's presidency could cost them their congressional majorities. If Republicans take control of either the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate, Biden's legislative agenda could be doomed. 

Biden's popularity remains above the lowest levels seen by his predecessor, Donald Trump, whose approval rating sank to as low as 33% in December 2017. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 377 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of 4 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former high-ranking Justice Department official appeared on Wednesday before the congressional committee probing the assault on the U.S. Capitol for questions about his bid to bolster former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.
Jeffrey Bossert Clark was seen by TV cameras entering a room inside a U.S. House of Representatives office building where the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack takes its depositions. A committee spokesman declined to comment.
Clark's attorney Harry MacDougald declined to comment on Wednesday's deposition.
Clark is among a growing list of Trump supporters who have balked at requests to cooperate with the investigation, though the panel has scored some legal victories over Trump's efforts to keep certain government records under wraps.
The National Archives said it would be providing some of former Vice President Mike Pence's records to the committee.
The committee has so far interviewed about 400 witnesses, issued more than 60 subpoenas and obtained more than 50,000 pages of records.
Committee investigators on Wednesday also interviewed by video Stewart Rhodes, the detained leader of the right-wing Oath Keepers group, his attorney told CBS. Rhodes was arrested and charged with seditious conspiracy https://www.reuters.com/world/us/founder-right-wing-oath-keepers-await-capitol-riot-trial-washington-judge-2022-02-02 last month.
Clark, who served as the acting head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, drafted a Dec. 28, 2020, letter to Georgia state lawmakers that falsely claimed the department had found ""significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.""
The draft letter urged state legislators to convene a special session https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-give-new-details-trumps-bid-overturn-election-2021-10-07 to overturn the election results there. 
Clark tried to persuade former Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Rich Donoghue to send the letter, but they refused. 
Rosen and Donoghue later told U.S. Senate investigators that Clark also privately met with Trump to lobby the then-president to oust Rosen so Clark could be installed as acting attorney general, paving the way for him to send the letter and launch voter fraud investigations.

Clark in November declined to answer the committee's questions about his legal advice to Trump, saying such discussions were privileged.
The panel voted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-committee-seeks-contempt-charge-trump-era-justice-dept-official-2021-12-02 on Dec. 1, 2021, to seek contempt of Congress charges against Clark, but it has not sought a vote of the full House after Clark's attorney said his client intends to invoke his right against self-incrimination, protected by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Some of the 1,000 U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers hit by a mysterious illness known as Havana Syndrome could have been targeted by electromagnetic energy pulses, according to a report to U.S. intelligence leaders released on Wednesday.
""Pulse electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radio frequency range, plausibly explains"" the ear pain, vertigo, and other symptoms of some of those suffering the ailments first reported by U.S. diplomats in the Cuban capital in 2016, experts from inside and outside the U.S. government said.
The panel of experts was convened by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Deputy Director David Cohen. 
The combination of symptoms ""cannot be easily explained by known environment or medical conditions"" among a subset of victims. The number of those people was not disclosed in the report's unclassified executive summary.
Cases have been reported in Russia, China, Tajikistan and some African countries.
The findings echo a 2020 National Academy of Sciences study and follow a Jan. 20 interim CIA report that concluded that it was unlikely that Russia or another foreign adversary was behind most of the so-called ""anomalous health incidents.""
The CIA report, however, said there were about two dozen cases of the 1,000 that remained unexplained.
The report released on Wednesday did not delve into responsibility. But its conclusions will likely fuel frustration among current and former U.S. officials who lack a clear explanation for their chronic afflictions.
""We were not looking at attribution or assigning it to a foreign adversary or actor. We stuck to the causal mechanism,"" a U.S. intelligence official familiar with the report told reporters.
The findings ""reinforce the need for a coordinated, whole of government approach,"" Mark Zaid, a lawyer representing victims from numerous U.S. government agencies, said in a statement. ""These piece-meal agency reviews at times reveal inconsistent and even contradictory results.""
Eric Lander, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement that the panel worked for nearly nine months and was the first of several expert groups to have such extensive access ""to intelligence reporting and patient data."" 
The panel found that the symptoms ""are genuine and compelling"" based on medical reports and interviews with physicians and victims.
In finding that ""pulsed electromagnetic energy"" could be the cause, the panel said ""information gaps exist"" but there are several plausible ways the energy could have been generated ""each with its own requirements, limitations and unknowns.""
Such sources exist that ""are concealable and have moderate power requirements,"" the report said. ""Using non-standard antennas and techniques, the signals could be propagated with low loss"" through the air and building materials.
Individuals accidentally exposed to electromagnetic energy signals - which include radio waves, microwaves and X-rays - have reported ""sensations"" similar to the symptoms reported by Havana Syndrome victims, the report noted.
Ultrasound also could account for the symptoms, but only if a victim was in close proximity to the beam because ultrasound ""propagates poorly through the air and building materials,"" it continued.

Psychosocial factors - which include work demands, stress and depression - cannot alone account for the core symptoms of Havana Syndrome, it said.
The report offered recommendations to help understand, prevent and manage the afflictions, including collecting and coordinating incident and medical data within the U.S. government.

The same jury also found that Moore did not defame the woman, Leigh Corfman, when he defended himself against her accusations, according to the Montgomery County Clerk's office. 
Moore, a Republican known for staunchly conservative views, was defeated in Alabama's special election for the U.S. Senate in 2017. Doug Jones became the first Democrat sent to the Senate from Republican stronghold Alabama in a quarter century. Jones was defeated in 2020 by Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville.
Moore was a highly controversial candidate whose campaign was beset by allegations that he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while he was in his 30s. He has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations, saying they were a result of ""dirty politics.""

(Reuters) -North Carolina's top court heard arguments on Wednesday over whether the state's new congressional map illegally favors Republicans.
The case is among dozens of lawsuits filed in states around the country challenging congressional lines drawn as part of a once-a-decade cycle. How the litigation is resolved could have a significant impact on the battle for control of Congress in November's midterm elections.
Here is a rundown of some of the most notable lawsuits:
ALABAMA
A panel of federal judges last week threw out https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-democrats-will-control-redistricting-after-bipartisan-panel-fails-2022-01-24 the state's Republican-backed congressional map, finding it likely violated the Voting Rights Act by depriving Black residents of opportunities to elect representatives of their choice.
The map included six districts seen as solidly Republican and only one district that is majority Black, even though the state's population is more than one-quarter Black. The court ordered lawmakers to create a new map that includes a second district in which a Black candidate would be favored to win. Alabama has appealed the decision.
GEORGIA
Multiple federal lawsuits are challenging Georgia's new congressional map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Black voters and civil rights groups argue that the Republican-controlled legislature deliberately drew the lines to dilute the voting power of people of color.
The map makes Republicans the favorites in nine of the state's 14 districts, slightly better than their current eight-to-six edge, according to analysts.
MARYLAND
Several Republican voters, as well as a Republican state legislator who is running for Congress, have asked a state court to invalidate the new congressional map as an illegal gerrymander.
The map, which became law after Democrats in the legislature overrode a veto from Republican Governor Larry Hogan, solidifies Democratic control in seven of the state's eight congressional districts while making the lone Republican seat more competitive.
NORTH CAROLINA
The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in a pair of lawsuits brought by Democratic voters and civil rights groups challenging the Republican-approved congressional map as an unconstitutional partisan and racial gerrymander. A panel of three judges https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judges-uphold-north-carolinas-new-congressional-map-win-republicans-2022-01-11 in January agreed the map was deliberately drawn to favor Republicans but concluded it would be an overstep of their authority to invalidate it.
The map in question would likely deliver 10 or 11 of the state's 14 districts to Republicans, despite North Carolina's status as a closely divided swing state. A ruling is expected soon, with the court already having delayed primary elections from March to May to accommodate the litigation.
OHIO
In January, the state Supreme Court struck down https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ohio-supreme-court-strikes-down-new-congressional-map-republican-gerrymander-2022-01-14 the new congressional map as an illegal Republican gerrymander and ordered lawmakers back to the drawing board. In a split decision, the court found the redistricting plan ignored constitutional provisions that bar legislators from creating maps that favor a particular party.
The invalidated map would have given Republicans 12, and perhaps 13, of the state's 15 congressional seats, according to electoral analysts, in part by fracturing Cincinnati's county into multiple districts to dilute Democratic voters.
TEXAS

The Republican-backed new congressional map has drawn numerous lawsuits, including one from the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Texas https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-sues-texas-over-redistricting-2021-12-06 in December for allegedly violating the constitutional rights of Latinos and other minority voters. The new lines were designed to shore up vulnerable Republican incumbents, in part by linking urban neighborhoods, which tend to vote Democratic, with more rural areas far from city centers.
Plaintiffs, including the Biden administration, have argued the map dilutes the voting power of minority residents even though they have driven the state's population growth over the last decade. The litigation will not be resolved in time to affect this year's campaign; Texas holds its first-in-the-nation primary elections on March 1.

The statement said Lujan, 49, suffered a stroke last Thursday, underwent surgery to ease swelling and is hospitalized in Albuquerque in his home state of New Mexico.
""We are very grateful that he will have a full recovery,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a brief statement to reporters. ""I believe the Senate will be able to carry forward with its business,"" he added.
Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote in the 50-50 Senate, where their razor-thin majority hangs on Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
They have big votes coming up, including to confirm President Joe Biden's nominee to replace retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and a possible second attempt to pass some of Biden's ""Build Back Better"" domestic spending bill. 
It was unclear whether any Republicans would join Biden's Democrats in voting for his nominee as Supreme Court confirmation votes have become highly partisan.

If any senator were to become unable to serve, many states have laws allowing their governors to appoint a temporary successor. New Mexico has a Democratic governor.
Due to Lujan's absence, the Senate Commerce Committee has postponed votes scheduled for Wednesday on nominees for the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission ""to take into consideration the need for all Democratic votes in order to move certain nominees forward,"" panel spokesperson Tricia Enright said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said Tuesday it will not move forward with votes on nominees for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the wake of the illness of a Democratic senator who could cast a critical vote.
The panel was scheduled to vote on Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama to serve on the FCC and Alvaro Bedoya, founding director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology, to serve on the FTC.
A spokeswoman for the committee said the nominations were being pulled from Wednesday's hearing ""to take into consideration the need for all Democratic votes in order to move certain nominees forward."" The panel is also delaying a vote on the nomination of Mary Boyle to serve on the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
The panel is divided 14-14 between Republicans and Democrats and Democratic U.S. Senator Ben Ray Lujan, a committee member, has been hospitalized after suffering a stroke and is expected to make a full recovery.
More than a year after President Joe Biden took office, the FCC remains divided 2-2 between Republicans and Democrats and it has been unable to move forward on some issues like restoring net neutrality rules that were repealed under President Donald Trump.
The panel is still set vote on the nominations of some other nominees, including Steven Cliff to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has not had a Senate-confirmed leader since January 2017 and several other Transportation Department nominees.
In December, the panel deadlocked 14-14 on Bedoya's FTC nomination. After the full Senate failed to take up the nomination before the end of the year, Biden renominated Bedoya, a law professor and privacy advocate.
The FTC enforces antitrust law and pursues allegations of deceptive advertising, including scams.

372,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 07:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump and his family on Tuesday called a civil investigation of their business practices ""selective prosecution,"" arguing that an email by New York state's top prosecutor to her supporters showed she was motivated by politics. 
The Trumps are trying to stop Attorney General Letitia James from forcing Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, to testify in the probe into whether their family business misrepresented the value of its assets for financial benefit.
Neither Trump nor his children have been accused of criminal wrongdoing. James' three-year-long civil probe is separate from a criminal inquiry now led by new Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg into the Trump Organization's business practices.
Lawyers for Republican Trump said in a court filing that James, a Democrat, was targeting the former president because of her ""dislike of his speech and political views"" in an effort to ""interfere with his political ambitions."" Trump, who left office last year, has not ruled out running for president again in 2024.
James is running for re-election in November. Trump's lawyers cited an email James' campaign sent her supporters on Jan. 9, after she had subpoenaed Trump and his children, stating that Trump ""might win"" in 2024. She said in the email that the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol ""may be traced back to one person: Trump himself.""
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington, motivated by Trump's false claims that the November 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him through fraud. 
""There can be no stronger basis for a claim of selective prosecution than the evidence presented herein,"" the Trumps' lawyers wrote, calling the email ""extraordinary, unprecedented and frankly appalling."" 
In a statement, James called the filing a ""baseless attempt"" to ""evade accountability."" 
""Throughout the three years of this investigation, they have never questioned our legal authority until Donald J. Trump himself was subpoenaed to testify,"" James said. ""As with every investigation, we will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead.""

James has been investigating whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. In one example, she said Trump's annual financial statements said an apartment he personally owned in Trump Tower was 30,000 square feet, when it was in fact a third that size.
During a political rally in Texas on Saturday, Trump called for protests against prosecutors in New York and Georgia investigating him and his company.

McConnell made his remarks days after Trump said he would consider pardons for people convicted of joining the attack if elected to a second term in 2024. 
""I would not be in favor of shortening any of the sentences for any of the people who pleaded guilty to crimes,"" the top Senate Republican said at a news conference, when asked about Trump's remarks at a rally on Saturday in Conroe, Texas.
""What we saw here on Jan. 6 was an effort to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, from one administration to another, which had never happened before in our country,"" McConnell said. 
A frequent target for Trump's invective, McConnell also repeated his view that an 1887 law used as the basis for Republican Trump's attempts to overturn his November 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden should be changed. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are moving toward possible enactment of reforms intended to prevent future attacks.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in the worst assault on Congress since the War of 1812. They were motivated by Trump's false claims that the election was stolen from him through fraud.
McConnell also took issue with those claims. ""The election of 2020 was decided December 14 of 2020, when the Electoral College certified the winner of the election,"" he said.

At least 165 of the 725 people charged with taking part in the U.S. Capitol riot have pleaded guilty, according to the Justice Department.
During Saturday's rally Trump also called for protests against prosecutors in New York and Georgia investigating him and his company.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Spotify's plan to add a content advisory to any discussion of COVID-19 on its platform is a positive step, but tech platforms should do more to prevent the spread of misinformation on the coronavirus, the White House said on Tuesday.
""Our hope is all major tech platforms and all major news sources for that matter be responsible and be vigilant to ensure that the American people have access to accurate information on something as significant as COVID-19"", White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in a briefing.
""This disclaimer - it's a positive step, but we want every platform to continue doing more to call out misinformation.""

Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) shares have risen 18.23% since Rogan apologized and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) gave it a ""buy"" rating. 

Rogan's show has been the most listened-to podcast on Spotify. His views on vaccines and government mandates to control the spread of the coronavirus alienated prominent figures from the platform before Spotify said it would add a content advisory to any episode with discussion of COVID to try to quell the controversy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden, who plans to unveil his U.S. Supreme Court pick by the end of the month, has chosen former Senator Doug Jones to guide the confirmation process for the White House and conferred on Tuesday with key lawmakers including the Senate's top Republican.
Biden met at the White House with the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles judicial nominations, and spoke separately with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who last week warned the Democratic president not to ""outsource this important decision to the radical left.""
The president, who pledged to name a Black woman to the lifetime Supreme Court post for the first time in U.S. history, selected Jones, who represented Alabama in the Senate from 2018 to 2021, as part of a team aiming to ensure a smooth confirmation process in the Democratic-led chamber, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Biden's nominee would replace Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who last week announced plans to retire at the end of the court's current term.
""I'm serious when I say that I want the advice of the Senate as well as the consent, if we can arrive on who the nominee should be,"" Biden said as he met with Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and the panel's top Republican, Chuck Grassley, citing the Senate's responsibilities regarding federal judicial nominees under the U.S. Constitution.
Biden reiterated the timetable he announced last week, saying: ""I intend to make this decision and get it to my colleagues by the end of this month. That's my hope.""
The White House has said that a veteran team of advisers, including Chief of Staff Ron Klain and White House Counsel Dana Remus, will help lead the process for selecting the nominee. The nominee will have a round of visits with senators, followed by confirmation hearings, a vote in the committee and a final vote by the full Senate. 
Jones, considered as a potential attorney general pick for Biden, will help usher her through that process.
Biden's selection will not shift the court's ideological balance. It has six conservative justices, three of whom were named by former President Donald Trump, and three liberal justices.
McConnell, who oversaw a change to Senate rules that allowed Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed with a simple majority vote during Trump's tenure, also spoke to Biden. That rules change means that the Senate now could confirm Biden's nominee without any Republicans voting in favor.
""He emphasized the importance of a nominee who believes in judicial independence and will resist all efforts by politicians to bully the court or to change the structure of the judicial system,"" a McConnell spokesperson said.
During a hearing earlier on Tuesday, Durbin laid out his expectations for the process of confirming the nominee.
""This committee will undertake a fair and timely process to examine her record and determine her fitness for the court. That process must not only be fair to members of this committee, but also to the nominee herself. And so it is my expectation that this committee and all its members will treat the nominee with respect and an open mind,"" Durbin said.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, seen as a leading contender for the job, penned her first ruling as an appeals court judge on Tuesday, striking down a policy begun under Trump that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.
The ruling could help burnish Jackson's reputation with organized labor and Democrats. Labor unions are an important constituency for Democrats.

(Reuters) - Republican U.S. lawmakers donated more than $380,000 last year to the campaigns of eight colleagues who Donald Trump is trying to drive from office, prioritizing the goal of regaining control of Congress over the former president's desire for vengeance.
At least 71 Republican members of the House of Representatives and Senate transferred money to the campaigns of seven House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection arising from last year's Capitol riot and Senator Lisa Murkowski, who voted to convict him.
Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, and a group aligned with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, were among those making the donations.
President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats control both the House and Senate with slim majorities. Republicans are trying to take over one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 congressional elections. If they do so, they could torpedo Biden's legislative agenda.
Election experts said these contributions to colleagues reflect a long-standing practice among lawmakers to share money freely to help their party secure a majority, with incumbents typically seen as having the best chances of winning.
""It's very much a strategic consideration,"" said political scientist Zachary Albert of Brandeis University in Massachusetts. 
Trump's efforts to brand a swath of the party as an enemy faction, Albert added, in part represents ""showmanship or, really, political marketing.""
The former president, who still holds a strong grip over his party after a contentious four years in office that ended in January 2021, has labeled those who voted against him in the impeachment battle as RINOs - Republicans In Name Only - and has urged challengers to seek to topple them in party nomination contests.
Three House lawmakers targeted by Trump already have dropped out of their races following public backlash from Republican leaders.
Nonetheless, congressional Republicans are donating to colleagues who Trump has disparaged as ""disloyal"" and ""losers,"" according to financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission ahead of a Monday deadline.
The incumbents targeted by Trump ended 2021 with more money in their campaign war chests than any of their challengers, including those backed by Trump. 
A week after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump's supporters, the House voted to impeach him, with the Senate then falling short of the super-majority needed to convict him and bar him from future public office. 
Scalise gave money in September to at least three House members who voted to impeach Trump: Peter Meijer of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state - who are both facing Trump-endorsed challengers - as well as David Valadao of California. Scalise also transferred money in December to the re-election campaign of Dan Newhouse of Washington, a House Republican who also voted for impeachment.
EYE OF THE TIGER 
The contributions ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 and came from Scalise's re-election campaign committee or from his ""Eye of the Tiger"" fundraising group, a so-called leadership committee that lawmakers use to support other candidates.
Representative Elise Stefanik, who replaced Representative Liz Cheney as the No. 3 House Republican after Cheney was ousted from her post following her vote to impeach Trump, made a $5,000 contribution to Herrera Beutler from her ""E-PAC"" leadership committee, which Stefanik uses to support Republican women candidates.
Cheney, the scion of a storied Republican family and the most forceful Trump critic in Congress, received $5,000 from McConnell's ""Bluegrass Committee"" fundraising group. 
The group also gave $10,000 to the campaign of Murkowski, who is the only one of the Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his Senate impeachment trial last year who is seeking re-election this year.
Cheney and Murkowski both are facing Republican primary challengers endorsed by Trump, as is Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, another Republican who voted to impeach Trump and took contributions from the leadership committee of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington.
Representatives August Pfluger of Texas, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, Byron Donalds of Florida and Carlos Gimenez of Florida - who each have been endorsed by Trump in their re-election bids for this year - also transferred money to impeachment voters from their campaigns or leadership committees. Their offices did not respond to requests for comment.
A Trump spokesperson and representatives for Scalise, Stefanik, McConnell and McMorris Rodgers also did not respond to requests for comment.

Joe Kent, a U.S. Army veteran endorsed by Trump to unseat Herrera Beutler, said the lawmakers backing the incumbent are hoping Trump's movement ""will just go away."" 
""2022 is a referendum on the establishment,"" Kent said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate hope to prevent a repeat of the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot by reforming a 135-year-old election law laying out the roles that Congress and the vice president play in certifying presidential election results.
Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, released a proposal on Tuesday.
A separate bipartisan group led by Republican Susan Collins is also working on the issue and is expected to meet later this week.
WHAT HAS CONGRESS DONE ON ELECTION REFORM UP TO NOW? 
Democrats have pushed to strengthen voting rights in response to a wave of voting restrictions passed in Republican-led states following Republican President Donald Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Republicans opposed that effort as a power grab that undercut state and local control of elections, and the effort ran aground in the Senate last month.
However, Republicans have been more open to tightening the way the United States counts votes once they are cast. 
WHY IS REFORM NEEDED?
Lawmakers want to clarify the 1887 Electoral Count Act so that Congress would have a harder time blocking the certification of elections and to make it clear that vice presidents cannot overturn them. 
The law was used as a pretext for another false Trump claim that his vice president, Mike Pence, had the authority to overturn the 2020 election of Democrat Joe Biden. Pence concluded that he did not have that power, much to Trump's frustration. 
As Congress worked to certify the election results on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump criticized Pence at a rally near the White House for disagreeing with him and urged supporters to march to the Capitol. Thousands then stormed the Capitol in the worst assault on Congress since the War of 1812. 
Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives but acquitted in the Senate on a charge of inciting the assault.
Since then, the former president has criticized Pence repeatedly for failing to interfere with the vote count. 
WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS PROPOSING? 
The Democrats' draft legislation would make it clear that the vice president has no power to resolve disputes over electors or to determine the validity of electors or their votes. 
It would limit the circumstances under which members of Congress can object to election results. It would require one-third of the House and Senate to sign an objection in order for it to be considered, and three-fifths of both chambers to vote to support an objection.
Currently, an objection must be signed by only one senator and one House member to be considered separately by each chamber. To succeed, an objection must then be agreed to by simple majorities in both the House and Senate. In 2021, Republicans objected to election results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Eight senators and 139 House members -- all Republicans -- later voted to support either or both. 
The proposal would establish Election Day in November as the time for choosing presidential electors and prohibit states from choosing electors on any other day -- a response to the Trump campaign's attempts to round up alternate electors in the weeks after the 2020 vote.
It also sets a Dec. 20 deadline for states to resolve controversies or contests involving an election outcome. 
WHAT IS THE COLLINS GROUP CONSIDERING? 
The Collins-led group of Democrats and Republicans is looking at similar reforms. But it is also weighing federal penalties for anyone who threatens an election official or a poll worker, protections from unwarranted removal from office for election officials, stronger election security measures and election management improvements.
WHERE COULD THINGS GO FROM HERE? 
The involvement of Klobuchar, the Senate Rules Committee chair, and Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, is seen as a sign that Democratic leaders support the effort. 
The White House has also said it is open to reform efforts but does not view them as a replacement for the more sweeping voting rights legislation that failed to win approval in the Senate. 

The Collins group has drawn tentative interest from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 
Some lawmakers and aides say there is a chance that elements of the two initiatives could be incorporated into a single piece of legislation that can draw enough support to win 60 votes, a threshold for most legislation to advance in the 100-seat chamber.

(Reuters) - A judge seen as a leading contender to be nominated by President Joe Biden to the U.S. Supreme Court penned her first ruling as an appeals court judge on Tuesday, striking down a policy begun under former President Donald Trump that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote that a federal labor board failed to explain its abrupt departure in 2020 from decades of precedent when it limited government agencies' obligations to bargain with unions over workplace changes. 
The ruling represented an important win for unions that collectively represent more than a million government employees and could help burnish Jackson's reputation with organized labor and Democrats as Biden considers appointing her to the Supreme Court. Labor unions are an important constituency for Democrats.
Biden has said he will nominate a Black woman to replace Breyer, a member of the court's liberal wing, and Jackson is believed to be among the handful under close consideration. 
Jackson, 51, spent eight years as a federal judge in Washington before joining the D.C. Circuit last June, and prior to Tuesday had not authored any opinions for the court. As a district court judge she ruled against the Trump administration in a series of high-profile cases, but was often reversed by the D.C. Circuit. 

Breyer, who is 83 and joined the Supreme Court in 1994, said he will step down at the end of the court's current term in June. His retirement gives Biden a first chance to shape the court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has shown an increasing assertiveness on issues including abortion and gun rights.
A Biden appointee to replace Breyer would not change the court's ideological balance, but would enable him to refresh its liberal wing with a much younger jurist who could serve for decades in the lifetime post.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials are planning a more subtle approach to try to win pivotal U.S. Senator Joe Manchin's support for a key part of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda, hoping that keeping matters private and avoiding public spats can help salvage the ambitious Build Back Better https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/whats-bidens-175-trillion-build-back-better-package-2021-11-05 climate and social spending bill.
Biden last year won congressional passage of COVID-19 relief legislation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/democrats-push-bidens-1-9-trillion-covid-bill-through-senate-on-party-line-vote-idUSKBN2AY07M and a sweeping infrastructure improvement bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-sweeping-infrastructure-social-spending-bills-finally-get-vote-2021-11-05 with fellow Democrat Manchin's backing. But the West Virginia senator remains a significant roadblock toward getting some version of Biden's $1.7 trillion Build Back Better bill - passed by the House of Representatives in November - through the Senate.
With talks between Manchin and the White House expected to resume this week, Biden and his advisers are planning to rely on their revamped approach - keeping the progress of the talks more confidential and making greater use of the White House legislative team and Cabinet members, officials said.
A public tussle between Biden - a long-time former senator himself - and Manchin in recent months over the bill resulted in its prospects for passage slipping even as Manchin's public approval ratings in his home state rose and his fundraising haul grew.
""I just want to make sure we find a balance and do something we can afford,"" Manchin told reporters on Monday, referring to the Build Back Better legislation.
Biden in December said that he and Manchin would ""get something done"" https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-he-manchin-are-going-get-something-done-2021-12-21 on the bill.
Manchin's vote is crucial for Biden by virtue of simple mathematics. The Senate is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Biden's party controlling it only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote. That means any measure that can pass with a simple majority must attract Manchin's support if Republicans remain united in opposition as usual.
Manchin, considered the Senate's most conservative Democrat, previously served as governor of West Virginia, a very Republican state. He surprised Biden and presidential advisers when he announced in December he would not support the bill, later blaming White House staff https://www.reuters.com/world/us/manchin-says-white-house-staff-drove-him-reject-bidens-social-policy-plan-2021-12-20. Manchin also dealt his fellow Democrats a setback on major voting rights legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-make-personal-plea-democrats-unify-pass-voting-rights-2022-01-13.
The White House needs to win over a second holdout Democrat, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, as well. Manchin's December announcement followed weeks of calls and meetings between him, Sinema and Biden - with the White House giving blow-by-blow details to an eager Washington press corps. 
'NOT GOING TO SPEAK'
This time, the White House plans not to disclose much about Biden's conversations with lawmakers, including Manchin. 
""We're just not going to speak to or confirm any conversations the president has with members of the Senate, moving forward,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said last week.
The change appears to be a tacit admission that Manchin had sometimes been mishandled by the White House. At the same time, some Democrats in Congress and some at the White House consider Manchin an unreliable negotiating partner, saying he has agreed on certain provisions in the past only to later renege.
""Senator Manchin clearly articulated his policy concerns with Build Back Better which are rooted in rising inflation, the ongoing pandemic and the geopolitical uncertainty around the world,"" an aide to the senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A Biden administration official, also speaking on condition of anonymity about Manchin, said the White House needs to ""stand in his shoes politically and be willing to understand and appreciate the variables of what it means to represent a state like West Virginia."" Republican then-President Donald Trump won West Virginia against Biden by 39 percentage points in 2020 - among his largest margins in any state - while losing nationally. 
Manchin, first elected to the Senate in 2010, comfortably won the Democratic primary during his 2018 re-election bid before winning the general election by 3 percentage points, showing he has little margin for error if he wants to be re-elected in 2024. 
He managed to raise nearly $5 million in political donations last year versus less than $1 million in 2020, Federal Election Commission records https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/S0WV00090/?cycle=2022&election_full=false showed, including from Republican donors. 
West Virginia, a state of 1.8 million people, ranks among the lowest in the United States in various health and education categories - areas the legislation at issue would address. It would provide billions of dollars for the healthcare industry and universal pre-kindergarten education. 
Manchin remains open to talks on a significant spending bill and his relationship with Biden is solid, said a source familiar with the senator's thinking, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

Congressional Democrats are hoping for a Build Back Better agreement before Biden's State of Union address, set for March 1. 
""We are in touch with a wide range of members working to pass the president's economic growth plan for the middle class, which you heard a number of top business executives speak in support of,"" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates, referring to Biden's meeting with CEOs last week. ""Anyone purporting to share our strategy with regard to any lawmakers is not speaking for the White House.""

(Reuters) -Donald Trump's fundraising slowed in late 2021 but the former leader still amassed more than $100 million in cash that could help Republicans in their bid to win congressional majorities later this year, disclosures released on Monday showed. 
Trump's main fundraising committee, known as Save America, took in about $23 million between July and December of last year, down from $62 million in the first half of 2021, according to reports to the Federal Election Commission.
Trump, now about one year out of office after losing the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, remains popular among Republicans as he continues to falsely state he lost the election due to fraud. 
The slowdown in his fundraising raised eyebrows among Republicans.
""The further Trump gets away from the White House, the harder it seems to be for him to raise money,"" said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor and the CEO of oilfield services company Canary, LLC.
While Trump has strongly hinted he could run for president again in 2024, campaign finance rules forbid him from funding his own candidacy with money raised by Save America. 
But Trump is spending large sums to hold political rallies that ostensibly support Republican candidates but which feature his own speeches as the main event.
""Trump very well may find a way to spend the money he raised in 2021 in support of a 2024 campaign and get away with it,"" said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance specialist at Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that advocates for government reform.
In the second half to 2021, Save America paid event management company Event Strategies, Inc more than $1.4 million, according to Save America's financial disclosure.
Trump has endorsed dozens of Republican candidates, including several who are mounting challenges against Republicans who voted with Democrats to impeach Trump on a charge he incited a deadly assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 
Save America, which ended 2021 with $105 million in cash, has contributed just $1.35 million to ""like-minded causes and endorsed candidates,"" according to sums released by Trump's office. 
The group in July made a $1 million donation to the Conservative Partnership Institute, which currently lists Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as a senior partner.
Trump's former campaign committee, now dubbed the Make America Great Again PAC, had $6.7 million in cash at the end of the year, with much of its outlays in the second half of the year going to legal expenses, according to a separate financial disclosure.
Save America and the former campaign together spent more that $290,000 on rent, catering, meetings and lodgings at Trump properties during the period, the disclosures showed. In addition, Make America Great Again spent more than $52,000 in rental and meeting expenses at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, according to its filing.

In the statement about the fundraising haul, Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich said the former leader's movement ""is set to crash across the midterms and carry forward all the way through 2024.""
Democrats, who hold slim majorities in Congress, are bracing for a difficult election season as Biden's popularity has slumped among voters worn down by the COVID-19 pandemic and its toll on the economy.

Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis, who is investigating whether Trump tried to influence the state's handling of the 2020 election, told the FBI's Atlanta field office that her concerns were driven by Trump's comments in Texas on Saturday, when he attacked ""radical, vicious racist prosecutors"" and encouraged protests in Washington, New York and Atlanta. 
In a letter dated Sunday, Willis said her staff has already made security accommodations around the Fulton County courthouse and government offices. 
""Security concerns were escalated this weekend by the rhetoric of former President Trump at a public event in Conroe, Texas,"" she wrote, adding that the event was ""undoubtedly watched by millions.""
""This rhetoric is more alarming in light of his statements"" concerning pardons for those convicted of crimes in last year's deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Willis asked the FBI for an immediate risk assessment and protective resources including intelligence and federal agents.
She said it was important the resources were in place well before a special grand jury convenes in the case on May 2.

The FBI's Atlanta office confirmed it had received Willis' letter but declined to comment further.
The investigation by Willis, a Democrat, is the most serious probe facing Trump in Georgia after he was recorded in a phone call pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's election results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A handful of Republicans pushed back against former President Donald Trump's weekend offer to consider pardoning people convicted of joining the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, saying it showed he would ""do it all again"" if he regains the White House in 2024.
""Trump uses language he knows caused the Jan. 6 violence; suggests he'd pardon the Jan. 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election,"" U.S. Representative Liz Cheney posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday. ""He'd do it all again if given the chance.""
Cheney is one of just two Republicans taking part in the U.S House of Representatives' official investigation of Jan. 6.
Cheney and a few other Republicans spoke out after a weekend in which former President Trump at a Saturday rally in Conroe, Texas, offered to consider pardoning people convicted of joining the attack if elected to a second term in 2024 and called for protests against prosecutors in New York and Georgia investigating him and his company. 
He followed up Sunday evening with a statement repeating his false claims that his vice president, Mike Pence, ""could have overturned the Election"" that Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
He also lambasted a bipartisan effort led by Republican Senator Susan Collins to reform the federal law that allows Congress members to dispute presidential election results.
Representative Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican on the Jan. 6 committee, wrote on Twitter late on Sunday that it was ""time for every Republican leader to pick a side ... Trump or the Constitution, there is no middle on defending our nation anymore.""
Trump's comments on targeting prosecutors led Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis, who is investigating whether Trump tried to influence the state's handling of the election, to ask the FBI for additional security for her office.
She noted in a Sunday letter to the FBI's Atlanta field office that her concerns were driven by Trump's comments in Texas attacking ""radical, vicious racist prosecutors"" and encouraging protests in Washington, New York and Atlanta. 
Trump was impeached in the House but acquitted in the Senate last year on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 attack, in which thousands of his supporters stormed the Capitol in the worst assault on Congress since the War of 1812. Cheney and Kinzinger voted for his impeachment, and Collins voted to convict him. 
Fueled by Trump's false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud, the attackers sought to stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory and threatened to hang Pence for refusing to overturn the results. More than 700 people have been charged with joining in the assault.
Other Republicans on Sunday also rejected his remarks about pardons.
""The folks that were part of the riots and, frankly, the assault on the U.S. Capitol, have to be held accountable. There is a rule of law,"" New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu told CNN. 

Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a staunch Trump ally, voiced his own concerns about the potential for repeated violence. 
""I don't want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was OK. I don't want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,"" he told CBS.

Durbin, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would conduct a confirmation hearing for Biden's eventual nominee to the top U.S. court, said he had already spoken with Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican.
""I'm reaching out to the Republicans and saying the nominee will be available for you to get to know them,"" Durbin said on ABC's ""This Week.""
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26 announced on Thursday that he will retire after nearly three decades on the court.

Collins, also speaking on ABC, said she appreciated Durbin's offer to make the eventual nominee available for an interview.
Potential nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26, a former Breyer law clerk confirmed by the Senate last June to serve on the influential U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
Other potential nominees include Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26, one of the youngest justices ever appointed to the California Supreme Court, and U.S. District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs.
Collins, who voted to confirm Jackson to the appeals court, said on Sunday that she would ""certainly give her every consideration"" if Jackson was nominated for the Supreme Court.

Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a Republican from South Carolina and Judiciary Committee member, praised Childs on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" as a highly qualified candidate, but did not say whether he would vote in favor of her nomination.
Speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Durbin said the speed to confirm a nominee would depend on whether the person had previously appeared before the Judiciary Committee for an appeals court nomination.

""Another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it, if I run and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly,"" Trump said to applause. ""We will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.""

Childs, whose federal district court is in South Carolina, has been endorsed by U.S. Representative James Clyburn, the majority whip and third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, who is close to Biden.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) -President Joe Biden stopped to look at a Pittsburgh bridge that collapsed just hours before he arrived for a scheduled visit to the city on Friday, dramatically underscoring the urgency of his drive to rebuild the United States' creaky infrastructure.
Visibly moved, Biden gazed across a ravine over the buckled sections of the half-century-old Fern Hollow Bridge, flanked by Pennsylvania and local officials and emergency workers as he surveyed the damage.
""The idea that we have been so far behind on infrastructure, for so many years -- it's just mind-boggling,"" the president told them.
One emergency worker described the scene after the collapse as loud as a jet engine. Biden praised the work of rescuers, noting a natural gas leak that was not stopped until some 30 minutes after first responders arrived at the scene.
Rescuers rappelled at least 150 feet (46 meters) into Fern Hollow, and used ropes to pull people to safety after the snow-covered span over the ravine collapsed around 6 a.m. (1100 GMT), Pittsburgh Fire Chief Darryl Jones said.
""They helped the firefighters that were here initially on scene, also did like a daisy chain, with hands just grabbing people and pulling them up,"" Jones said.
Ten people suffered minor injuries, including four who were taken to the hospital, city officials said. Jones added that crews would search under the bridge for any victims.
The incident was a high-profile example of the need to rebuild the nation's aging bridges, highways and other infrastructure with money from $1 trillion spending bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-needing-boost-sign-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-11-15 that was a signature achievement of Biden's first year in office.
Images of the collapse showed the four-lane span buckled into three large sections, with several vehicles piled in the rubble of the collapsed roadway at the bottom of the ravine. The tail end of a long, red city bus appeared trapped by the rubble. 
The massive gas leak caused by the collapse forced the evacuation of several families from their homes before being brought under control, Jones said.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to the site.
Pennsylvania has 3,198 bridges rated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/collapsed-pittsburgh-bridge-is-one-44000-poor-condition-us-2022-01-28/#:~:text=Like%20nearly%2044%2C000%20other%20spans,of%20Transportation's%202021%20national%20inventory as being in poor condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The collapse came just two weeks after Pennsylvania got $327 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation for bridge repair as part of the Biden administration's new infrastructure law. Pennsylvania's share of the bridge-repair money is the third-largest state allocation, behind only California and New York.
Biden said he was astonished to learn Pittsburgh had more bridges than any city in the world. ""And we're going to fix them all,"" he said before leaving the site.
ECONOMIC GROWTH JUMPS
Biden, whose approval ratings have fallen in recent months amid a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation, got a boost on Thursday when the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew the fastest https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-economy-regained-speed-q4-2021-growth-best-since-1984-2022-01-27 in nearly four decades in 2021.
Economists say Biden-backed fiscal stimulus, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that pumped money into states for COVID relief and into households in the form of stimulus payments, played a big role. 
In Pittsburgh, the president toured Mill 19, a former steel mill building now serving as a research and development hub, and said he was taking stock of what he had accomplished so far. 
""Making it in America is what built this city, the steel city,"" he said. Pittsburgh understands the consequences of what happens ""when we ignore the backbone and fail to invest in ourselves."" 
The Democratic president was returning to the site of his first major campaign event in 2019 and his first stop after he was inaugurated. The state is a crucial battleground for Democrats to retain control of the Senate in the 2022 midterms. 
He touted the creation of 6.4 million jobs and 367,000 manufacturing jobs since he took office a year ago, and the passage of the infrastructure bill -- a rare bipartisan victory in a deeply divided Congress. 

""It takes a federal government that doesn't just give lip service"" to buying American, he said. ""Now we're beginning to see the results."" 
In recent days, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has said it would invest $7 billion in Michigan to expand electric vehicle production and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) has said it would invest $100 billion to build a chip-making complex in Ohio.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday upheld California's net neutrality law, saying a 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reverse federal internet protections could not bar state action.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling, rejected a challenge from telecom and broad industry groups to block California's net neutrality law, which aims to protect the open internet.
The panel's decision said since the FCC under former President Donald Trump reclassified internet services as more lightly regulated information services, the commission ""no longer has the authority to regulate in the same manner that it had when these services were classified as telecommunications services.""
A lower court judge refused to block California's net neutrality law from taking effect after the Justice Department withdrew its separate legal challenge to California's state law in February 2021.
California's 2018 law barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes, but it only took effect last year.
The appeals court said, ""The stakes in this case are high for the industry and consumers,"" and noted that without net neutrality rules, internet providers could ""open the door for anticompetitive, discriminatory behavior that could disadvantage important segments of society.""
The industry groups that sued California included USTelecom, wireless trade association CTIA, and the NCTA - The Internet & Television Association, as well as internet providers including AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). They said in a joint statement Friday they were ""disappointed and will review our options. Once again, a piecemeal approach to this issue is untenable and Congress should codify national rules for an open Internet once and for all.""
California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the decision ""will protect Californians from blocking, throttling, zero-rating, and other anti-competitive practices.""
The FCC under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had adopted net neutrality rules in 2015. They were overturned in 2017 by the FCC under Trump, a Republican. California's legislature responded by adopting a state law requiring net neutrality in August 2018.
Supporters of net neutrality rules argue that the protections ensure a free and open internet. Broadband and telecoms trade groups contend their legal basis from the pre-internet era was outdated and that they would discourage investment. 
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said Friday that the decision was ""good news"" and added the FCC needs ""once again to make it the law of the land.""
Tom Johnson, who served as general counsel of the FCC during the Trump administration, said the decision ""creates confusion on whether states can adopt policies that undermine the FCC’s decision to repeal net neutrality rules.""
""Ultimately, he said, ""the Supreme Court will have to address the role of the states in this area.""

The FCC remains divided 2-2. Democrats have been unable to launch proceedings to reinstate net neutrality. A Senate committee is set to vote next week on FCC commissioner nominee Gigi Sohn, a Democrat.
John Bergmayer, legal director at Public Knowledge, called the decision ""a major victory for internet users in California and nationwide.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol has issued subpoenas to several individuals involved in an unsuccessful ""alternate electors"" scheme to keep former President Donald Trump in office, the panel's chairman said on Friday.
The 14 relatively unknown individuals receiving subpoenas included David Shafer and Michael McDonald, the chairmen of the Georgia Republican Party and the Nevada Republican Party, respectively. Shafer and McDonald did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Republican Party operatives were asked to provide documents and sit for deposition interviews in the coming weeks.
The U.S. president is selected by 538 electors who are apportioned based on each state's population.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) -A Pennsylvania court sided with Republicans in striking down a law on Friday that eliminated barriers to voting by mail, raising doubts over ballot access in the battleground state ahead of important election contests this year.
The administration of Democratic Governor Tom Wolf immediately appealed the ruling, which deemed the law unconstitutional. That puts its implementation on hold while the Pennsylvania Supreme Court weighs the matter.
Three Republican judges agreed with the GOP who had challenged the law, Act 77, saying the state's constitution required people to vote in person unless they had a specific excuse, such as having a disability or being away from home on Election Day. Two Democratic judges dissented.
Implemented in 2019 with Republican support, Act 77 had eliminated such requirements for mail-in ballots. Democrats actively used the method of voting in 2020, helping U.S. President Joe Biden win the state over Donald Trump by some 80,000 votes. 
Commonwealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt said that while she believed Pennsylvanians would support eliminating the in-person voting requirement, a constitutional amendment rather than legislation was the appropriate first step.
""An amendment to our Constitution that ends the requirement of in-person voting is the necessary prerequisite to the legislature's establishment of a no-excuse mail-in voting system,"" Leavitt wrote in the ruling.
The ruling comes ahead of important races in Pennsylvania, including the one to replace retiring Republican U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, a contest that could help determine control of Congress in November's midterm elections.
Josh Shapiro, the state's Democratic attorney general, said he was confident the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has a Democratic majority, would overturn the lower court's ruling.
""This opinion is based on twisted logic and faulty reasoning, and is wrong on the law,"" Shapiro, who is running for governor, said in a statement, predicting that there would not be any ""immediate impact on Pennsylvania's upcoming elections.""
Act 77 was the result of a deal struck between Republican and Democratic lawmakers that expanded access to mail-in ballots and eliminated straight-party voting, which allowed voters to select a party instead of a candidate in each race.
Republicans had long sought to ditch the party-line vote because it was seen as an advantage in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans.
Some Democrats lament the tradeoff, particularly in light of Friday’s ruling. They said it was to blame for big losses for the party's down-ballot candidates in 2020, even as Biden prevailed at the top of the ticket. 
""It was a mistake and it crushed us,” said Joe Foster, chairman of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, the largest of the Philadelphia suburbs. 

Republicans changed their views on the law after Trump lost the state, with many of them embracing the former president's false claims that widespread fraud tied to mail-in ballots was behind his defeat.
The COVID-19 pandemic also made mail-in voting more attractive to voters worried about health risks. More than 2.6 million Pennsylvanians voted by mail in the 2020 election. Roughly three-quarters of the ballots cast by mail selected Biden.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday said he plans by the end of February to nominate a Black woman to replace retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a historic first that he called ""long overdue.""
Biden appeared with Breyer, whom he has known since the 1970s, at the White House after the 83-year-old justice formally announced his retirement in a letter to the president. Breyer wrote that he plans to depart at the conclusion of the court's current term, typically at the end of June, assuming his successor has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Biden, who won the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination in large part because of strong support from Black voters, noted that he committed during that campaign to name a Black woman to a lifetime post https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/historic-first-black-women-judges-who-could-join-us-supreme-court-2022-01-27 on the high court and would keep his promise. 
""Our process is going to be rigorous. I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence and decency,"" Biden said, calling the selection of a Supreme Court justice one of a president's most serious constitutional responsibilities.
""While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity - and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court. It's long overdue, in my view,"" Biden said.
Potential nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26, a former Breyer law clerk confirmed by the Senate last June to serve on an influential U.S. appellate court, and Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26, who serves on the California Supreme Court. Another potential contender is Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina who Biden already has nominated to the U.S. appeals court in Washington.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden believes that being a sitting judge is not prerequisite for his nominee and that whether a candidate could draw support from Republicans is not an influencing factor.
Biden said he wants the Senate, which his fellow Democrats control by a razor-thin margin, to ""move promptly"" once he chooses his nominee. Democrats can confirm a nominee without a single Republican vote because Republicans in 2017 changed the Senate rules to no longer require 60 of the 100 senators to allow Supreme Court nominations to move forward.
While Breyer's retirement after 27 years gives Biden his first chance to fill a vacancy on the nine-member court, it will not change https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-next-supreme-court-nominee-not-likely-change-its-rightward-push-2022-01-27 its ideological balance.

Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump appointed three justices during his single four-year term in office.
Breyer, the court's oldest justice https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-breyer-fortified-abortion-rights-doubted-death-penalty-2022-01-26, often found himself in dissent on a court that has moved ever rightward. He spoke at the White House of the importance of a diverse nation like the United States resolving its deep divisions by adhering to the rule of law.
""People have come to accept this Constitution and they have come to accept the importance of the rule of law,"" Breyer said, holding a copy of the 18th century foundational document in his hand.
WHITE HOUSE REACHING OUT TO CANDIDATES
White House officials expect to begin reaching out to and potentially meeting with candidates as soon as next week, according to a source familiar with the situation. Biden is expected to work with a list of 10 or fewer people.
Senate Democrats aim to quickly confirm Biden's nominee in a time frame similar https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-plan-move-swiftly-biden-supreme-court-pick-2022-01-26 to the one-month process that the chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, used in 2020 to approve Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, according to a source familiar with planning.
Republicans are seeking to regain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 congressional elections, underscoring the need for speed from the perspective of Democrats. McConnell has indicated he would block any Biden nominations to the court if his party regains the Senate majority.
McConnell said in a statement: ""The president must not outsource this important decision to the radical left. The American people deserve a nominee with demonstrated reverence for the written text of our laws and our Constitution.""
Trump's three conservative appointees who McConnell pushed through the Senate came from a shortlist prepared with the input of outside conservative legal activists https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kennedy-advisers/conservative-lawyers-steer-trump-on-supreme-court-pick-idUSKBN1JO32P associated with the Federalist Society.

Biden said he was expressing the nation's gratitude to Breyer for his ""remarkable career in public service"" and noted past rulings the justice authored upholding abortion rights, voting rights, environmental measures and religious liberty.
""This is a bittersweet day for me,"" Biden said. ""I think he's a model public servant in a time of great division in this country.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday called on Congress to immediately enshrine the Equal Rights Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and formally protect women's rights nearly a century after lawmakers first raised them.
In a statement, Biden urged Congress ""to pass a resolution recognizing ratification of the ERA,"" saying recent legal analysis showed there was nothing preventing lawmakers from acting.
The Democratic president's call comes amid jostling over the deadline to enact the ERA, which passed Congress in 1972 with a 1982 deadline to be enacted if 38 state legislatures voted to approve. Nearly 100 years have passed since it was first introduced in 1923.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives separately unveiled a resolution to enshrine the ERA, but it could fall short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate, where Democrats control just 50 seats.
Congressional aides also said the ERA resolution would have to overcome the filibuster unless Republicans agree to pass it by unanimous consent. 
While supporters say the ERA is needed to protect against sexual discrimination and would help achieve equal pay, opponents argue the original timetable has passed and that the amendment is no longer needed.
Virginia became the 38th state in 2020 to adopt the ERA, but Republican then-President Donald Trump sought to block ratification with a legal memo saying the process must begin anew. 
A new Justice Department legal analysis, however, allows the process to move forward and ""makes clear, there is nothing standing in Congress’s way from doing so,"" Biden said.
House oversight panel Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and other Democrats argue that the ERA made clear it takes effect two years after the final state’s ratification, with Thursday marking two years since Virginia's vote.
The resolution ""reaffirms what we already know to be true: the Equal Rights Amendment is the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution,"" Maloney said. 

The issue also remains entangled in the federal courts: Virginia, Illinois and Nevada sued to have the ERA declared valid.
In a statement, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration said it would abide by the Justice Department's legal opinion unless otherwise directed by a final court order.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden can make history by appointing the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court to succeed the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26, but replacing one liberal with another won't change the aggressively conservative court's trajectory.
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority bolstered by three appointments made by former Republican President Donald Trump. The new majority has recently flexed its muscles https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/aggressively-conservative-supreme-court-plunges-into-us-culture-wars-2022-01-25 by taking up major cases that could curb abortion rights, expand gun rights and bring an end to the consideration of race in university admissions.
For Democrats, Breyer's https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-breyer-fortified-abortion-rights-doubted-death-penalty-2022-01-26 retirement provides a boost and a distraction from Biden's slide in popularity https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-rating-drops-43-lowest-his-presidency-2022-01-20 over the last five months during surges in COVID-19 cases and deaths and Americans' frustration with the pandemic's economic toll. Opposition by two conservative Democratic senators also stalled a spending proposal that Democrats hoped would energize voters ahead of the Nov. 8 congressional elections.
Now the focus can be on the Biden White House's goal of diversifying the courts and appointing liberal judges to counteract Trump's appointments. 
Biden's chance to pick a Supreme Court justice gives the White House an opportunity to tell a positive story, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
""It's better than what the White House has had to deal with lately,"" Kondik said.
Black women judges such as Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court judge Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26 and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26 are among those likely to be in contention.
TICKING CLOCK
There is a narrow window to replace the 83-year-old Breyer. In November's elections, Republicans could regain control of the Senate. The chamber is tied 50-50, with Democrats holding majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' deciding vote.
The situation is different at the Supreme Court building across the street from the Capitol, where a new liberal justice can refresh the liberal wing but is likely powerless to stop the trend of conservative rulings.
On major, politically-divisive issues, ""Justice Breyer has been a pretty reliable vote for how you’d expect a Democratic-appointed justice to vote on those issues, and we could expect someone Biden nominates would vote the same way,"" said Kelsi Brown Corkran, a Supreme Court litigator at Georgetown University Law Center. Biden’s appointment will mean ""probably very little"" for the court in terms of its overall outcomes and direction,"" she added.
The abortion and guns cases before the court will be decided before Breyer is expected to step down at the end of the current term, which is usually the end of June. The court's conservatives seem willing, in a case from Mississippi, to undermine or even overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide and, in a case from New York, expand the right to carry firearms in public, based on oral arguments late last year.
The new justice, if confirmed by the Senate, would likely be on the bench for the start of the court's next term in October, when it will be preparing to hear the university admissions case. As with the abortion and gun cases, if the conservative justices all vote in lockstep, the liberal justices have no leverage.
""The members of the six-justice conservative majority know what they think. A new voice on the other side is unlikely to make them rethink their views,"" said Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, who served as a law clerk under Breyer.
CAFETERIA COMMITTEE DUTY
Although insiders often say that a single change on a nine-justice court changes the court as a whole, junior justices generally have to wait before having a major impact.
Traditionally, initial tasks included serving on the court cafeteria committee and answering the door if someone seeks to enter the justices' private conference, where they talk about how they plan to vote in cases and which new cases to take up. The junior justice also speaks last at those meetings.
The new appointee could make waves outside the court, where the first Black woman justice would be a role model for future generations and part of an all-woman liberal minority on the bench along with Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The court, with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have four women justices serving together for the first time.

Chicago-Kent's Shapiro said justices in the minority can also make a broader case to the public that can over a longer period help shape the law, as conservative Justice Clarence Thomas and the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have done at times.
""They can have tremendous influence that way,"" Shapiro said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee is set to vote Feb. 2 on nominees to head the auto safety agency and to open seats on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) among other positions, according to a notice seen by Reuters.
The panel is set to consider more than a dozen nominations including Steven Cliff to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has not had a Senate-confirmed leader since January 2017.
Cliff, a former California Air Resources Board official, has been serving as deputy NHTSA administrator and overseeing several agency investigations into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The committee is also set to vote on Gigi Sohn for the FCC. If she were confirmed by the Senate, it would give Democrats control of the FCC, which is currently split 2-2. The notice said the nominees to be voted on could change.
Sohn, a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama, said last year that it would take at least a year for the commission to reinstate landmark neutrality rules repealed in 2017 under then-President Donald Trump. She told senators she does not favor government regulation of broadband rates.
The committee is to consider Alvaro Bedoya to serve on the FTC, according to the notice.
In December, the panel deadlocked 14-14 on Bedoya's nomination. After the full Senate failed to take up the nomination before the end of the year, Biden renominated Bedoya, a law professor and privacy advocate, earlier this month.

Bedoya, founding director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology, is also a former chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law.
The agency enforces antitrust law and pursues allegations of deceptive advertising, including scams.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer plans to retire, lawmakers said on Wednesday, giving President Joe Biden the opportunity to fulfill a campaign promise to nominate the first Black woman to the nation's top judicial body.
The retirement of Breyer https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-breyer-fortified-abortion-rights-doubted-death-penalty-2022-01-26, who is 83 and has served on the court since 1994, gives Biden a first chance to shape the court https://www.reuters.com/world/us/historic-firsts-diversifying-us-supreme-court-2022-01-26, whose 6-3 conservative majority has shown an increasing assertiveness https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/aggressively-conservative-supreme-court-plunges-into-us-culture-wars-2022-01-25 on issues including abortion and gun rights. Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump was able to choose three justices during his four years in office.
Biden's fellow Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the Senate, which under the U.S. Constitution confirms Supreme Court nominees. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Biden's nominee to replace Breyer will receive a ""prompt hearing"" and will be considered and confirmed with ""all deliberate speed."" 
The Democrats have reason for speed. Republicans are seeking to regain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 congressional elections. The chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, has made clear he would block any Biden nominations to the court if his party regains the majority.
A Biden appointee to replace Breyer, who is set to step down after the court's current term that runs through June, would not change its ideological balance, but would enable him to refresh its liberal wing with a much younger jurist who could serve for decades in the lifetime post. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will honor his presidential election campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to fill any Supreme Court vacancy. Neither the White House nor the Supreme Court confirmed Breyer's retirement plans. 
Breyer and Biden are scheduled to make a public appearance on Thursday where the justice is set to formally announce his retirement, a CNN reporter wrote in a tweet, citing a source familiar with the matter. 
Democrats aim to confirm Biden's pick for the vacancy in a time frame similar https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-plan-move-swiftly-biden-supreme-court-pick-2022-01-26 to the one-month process that McConnell and the Republicans used in 2020 to confirm Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, according to a source familiar with planning.
White House counsel Dana Remus is likely to help spearhead the process for Biden. 
The Senate's filibuster https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-senate-democrats-mull-ending-filibuster-pass-voting-rights-reform-2022-01-11 rule that requires 60 of the 100 members to agree to advance most legislation does not apply to judicial nominations, meaning Democrats could confirm a Biden pick with just their 50 members and Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
Two centrist Democrats who have blocked some Biden legislative priorities, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have so far supported most of his judicial nominees.
Breyer, the Supreme Court's oldest member, was appointed to his lifetime post by Democratic President Bill Clinton. He authored important rulings https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-breyer-fortified-abortion-rights-doubted-death-penalty-2022-01-26 upholding abortion rights and healthcare access, helped advance LGBT rights and questioned the constitutionality of the death penalty. He often found himself in dissent on a court that has moved ever rightward. 
POTENTIAL NOMINEES
Potential Biden nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26, a former Breyer law clerk who was confirmed by the Senate last June to serve on an influential U.S. appellate court, and Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26, who serves on the California Supreme Court.
Only conservative Justice Clarence Thomas has served longer than Breyer among the current justices, joining in 1991. Thomas is one of two Black men to have served on the high court, alongside Thurgood Marshall who served from 1967 to 1991.
Trump's three appointees all are young enough to serve for decades. The Senate, then under Republican control, confirmed Barrett in 2020 after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
After Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, some liberal activists urged Breyer to step aside while Democrats control the Senate, concerned that if he did not do so Republicans could block confirmation of his successor or a future Republican president could name his replacement and tilt the court even further to the right.
The court is due to rule by the end of June in cases giving its conservative majority a chance to curtail abortion rights and widen gun rights. The justices this week took up a case to be decided in their next term that could doom university policies considering race as a factor in student admissions and cripple affirmative action policies despised by the American right.

Breyer last year authored a ruling rejecting a Republican bid to invalidate Obamacare https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-obamacare-idTRNIL2N2NZ2ZM, preserving the landmark healthcare law formally called the Affordable Care Act for the third time since its 2010 enactment. 
He authored two important abortion rulings in 2016 and 2020 that struck down restrictions on clinics in Texas and Louisiana. He also was in the majority in the landmark ruling in 2015 that legalized gay marriage. Breyer has become a persistent critic of the death penalty and wrote that it was ""highly likely"" that capital punishment violates the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrats who control the U.S. Senate plan to move President Joe Biden's upcoming nomination of a replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26 on a quick timetable, similar to the single month that Republicans used for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a source familiar with the planning said.
Breyer, 83, will retire when the court's current term wraps up in June, U.S. lawmakers said on Wednesday. Democrats narrowly control the Senate, which confirms federal judicial nominees.
Senate Democrats do not have to await Breyer's departure to clear a nominee who would be sworn in when he formally steps down, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Former President Donald Trump nominated Barrett on Sept. 26, 2020, a little over week after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Senate, then led by Republicans, confirmed Barrett on Oct. 26, 2020, a week before the presidential election that Trump lost to Biden. Barrett's appointment boosted the court's conservative majority to 6-3.
Replacing Breyer will not change the ideological makeup of the court because a Biden nominee is expected to be a liberal just as the retiring justice is.
The Senate is now split evenly between 50 Democrats, including the two independents who align with them, and 50 Republicans. Under this makeup, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris can cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation and nominations.
As a result, Democrats would want to move as quickly as possible to confirm Breyer's replacement because if any one of the 50 members of their caucus suddenly becomes unable to serve for any reason they could lack the votes to confirm the nominee.
They also face a risk that Republicans will regain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. If that occurs, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell has indicated he likely would block Biden nominations to the top court.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Biden's nominee will receive a ""prompt hearing"" and will be considered and confirmed by the chamber with ""all deliberate speed."" Biden is expected to nominate a Black woman to the court, which would be a historic first https://www.reuters.com/world/us/historic-firsts-diversifying-us-supreme-court-2022-01-26.
""With this Supreme Court vacancy, President Biden has the opportunity to nominate someone who will bring diversity, experience and an evenhanded approach to the administration of justice,"" said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which takes the lead in the confirmation process.
Biden will have to be careful to pick a nominee Schumer can easily navigate through the Senate since he has no Democratic votes to spare.
The two most rebellious Senate Democrats - centrists Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have generally backed Biden's picks for lower court appointments, including the June 2021 confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26 to serve on an influential U.S. appellate court. Jackson and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26 are among potential Biden choices to replace Breyer.
""I look forward to meeting with and evaluating the qualifications of President Biden's nominee to fill this Supreme Court vacancy,"" Manchin said in a statement.
'PRIORITY ONE'
Breyer's expected retirement makes the Supreme Court confirmation drive ""priority one"" in the Senate's 2022 agenda, said one Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A formal announcement by Breyer could clear the way for Biden to quickly pick a replacement. If that were to occur in the coming few days or weeks, the Senate potentially could confirm the nominee in March under the expedited timetable sketched out by the source with knowledge of plans.
It has taken an average of more than two months for Supreme Court nominees to win Senate approval in recent decades. The Senate floor debate and vote to confirm Barrett were completed in just three days after rapid Judiciary Committee hearings.
Supreme Court nominees generally must submit detailed written answers to questions posed by the Judiciary Committee, be approved by the panel, attend private meetings with individual senators to help smooth the road to confirmation and survive a full Senate debate with the hope that no last-minute hitches arise.
Toward the end of Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh's 2018 confirmation process, allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied, threw his nomination into chaos before a final Senate vote. 

The confirmation process for a Supreme Court pick is not expected to delay negotiations on legislation to fund the federal government beyond a Feb. 18 deadline when existing money will be depleted.
Other major Democratic priorities in the Senate, including passage of a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill called ""Build Back Better"" and election reform legislation, already were in trouble, largely because of resistance by Manchin and Sinema. Backers of both initiatives hope to find a way to win over the two Democrats and secure passage.

400,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 10:51PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - A federal judge in South Dakota temporarily blocked on Wednesday a new rule by the state's health department that makes access to a medication abortion more difficult. 
Planned Parenthood sought the injunction against the South Dakota measure, which was first part of an executive order issued last September by Governor Kristi Noem, a Republican. 
Judge Karen Schreier wrote in her ruling that Planned Parenthood had shown that South Dakota had created a ""substantial obstacle"" in the path of women seeking medication abortions. 
Noem's executive order mandated that the two drugs used in mediation abortions both be administered by a medical provider. Typically, a woman would receive the first medication at a provider's office, and be handed the second drug at the same time, with instructions to take it 24 to 72 hours later. 
Because Planned Parenthood's office in Sioux Falls is the only one that provides abortions in the state, and because many women travel long distances to reach its office, forcing them to make repeat visits could put an undue burden on many women, the judge wrote in her restraining order. 
The legal battle over abortion in the United States has grown increasingly tense in recent months. In December, the Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments in Mississippi's bid to revive its 15-week ban on abortions.

Conservative justices indicated then that they are open to either gutting or overturning entirely Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that established a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before the fetus is viable. A decision is due by the end of June. 
In December, the federal government permanently eased some restrictions on medication used in abortions for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, allowing the drug to be sent by mail rather than requiring it to be dispensed in person. However, 19 states have laws that supersede the FDA decision by barring telehealth consultations or mailing of abortion pills.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York State attorney general Letitia James on Wednesday urged the dismissal of Donald Trump's lawsuit seeking to stop her civil probe into him and his family business, where she claims to have found evidence of possible fraud.
In a filing with the U.S. District Court in Albany, New York, James said legal matters in her nearly three-year probe into the former U.S. president and the Trump Organization were more appropriately and efficiently handled in ongoing proceedings in a state court in Manhattan.
She accused Trump of waiting to challenge her probe until he was subpoenaed to testify, calling the Dec. 20, 2021 lawsuit a wrongful means to escape a court order in the state case requiring him and his company to honor her subpoenas.
""State-court losers"" cannot ask a federal judge to override such orders, James said. ""This lawsuit is nothing but a baseless and meritless collateral attack by Donald Trump to stop our legal and legitimate investigation.""
Alina Habba, a lawyer for Trump, said in an email: ""Once again, Letitia James fails to address her egregious and unethical conduct in her weak response to our complaint.""
Trump, a Republican, has accused James of being motivated by partisan animus, calling her probe a ""witch hunt"" and a ""thinly veiled"" effort to malign him and his associates.
James, a Democrat, repeated on Wednesday that ""no one is above the law.""
The attorney general has been investigating whether Trump and his company inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans and reduced them to lower tax bills. 
On Jan. 18, James said her office uncovered misleading statements about the values of six Trump properties, including golf clubs and Trump's own penthouse in Trump Tower, as well as the ""Trump Brand.""
She suggested that the use of inflated valuations were ""part of a pattern to suggest that Mr. Trump's net worth was higher than it otherwise would have appeared.""
James has also subpoenaed Trump's children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump to testify.
She can sue Trump and his company, but cannot file criminal charges because her probe is civil.

Trump has not been criminally charged.
James' probe partially overlaps a criminal probe by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg into the Trump Organization's practices. James joined that probe last May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Thursday imposed a 44-month prison sentence on a man who pleaded guilty to a felony charge after throwing objects at police during last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol and boasting about his actions on social media.
The defendant, Nicholas Languerand, has been jailed since his arrest in April in South Carolina and will receive credit for time served. 
Prosecutors had recommended a 51-month sentence, but U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington said a ""modest reduction"" was warranted in light of Languerand's personal circumstances, including what the judge described as a ""extremely difficult and chaotic upbringing.""
When Languerand was a child, his father intentionally set fire to a trailer Languerand and his mother were living in, nearly killing them, Languerand's grandfather told the judge during the sentencing hearing.
Languerand pleaded guilty in November to a single charge of assaulting law enforcement with a dangerous weapon. Authorities said he hurled objects, including an orange traffic barrier, at police and took an officer's riot shield on Jan. 6, 2021. He was 26 at the time he entered the guilty plea.
Languerand bragged about the attack on social media in the preceding days, vowing that ""next time we come back with rifles.""
His defense lawyer proposed a one-year sentence with credit for time served in custody, saying Languerand has demonstrated a willingness to hold down a job and follow the law, despite trauma and hardship.
The attack was carried out by a mob of Republican then-President Donald Trump's supporters in a failed effort to prevent Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump. 

More than 725 people have been charged, with about 200 pleading guilty to a variety of federal charges. The longest sentence imposed thus far was five years and one month in prison for a Florida man last month for assaulting police officers.
About 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot, according to the Justice Department.

A vocal critic of former U.S. President Donald Trump during his 2013-2019 tenure in the Senate, Flake arrived in Ankara earlier this month to succeed David Satterfield, who is now U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa.
He starts the job as NATO members and other Western states mull responses to Russia in the event of military action against Ukraine. Ankara is close to Kyiv and Moscow, has offered to mediate the crisis, and opposes sanctions against Russia.
Relations between Washington and Ankara have soured in the past few years over issues such as Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 systems, judicial and civil rights cases, and policy differences in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean. 

After Trump and Erdogan had warm personal ties, President Joe Biden has taken a cooler approach towards Turkey. One of his first steps in the White House was recognising the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide - a position that infuriated Turkey.
The governments have since looked to set differences aside and are in talks over the conflicts in Libya, Ethiopia and Afghanistan, where Turkey is discussing potentially operating Kabul's international airport with Qatar.

Romney is the featured guest at a March 14 fundraiser for Cheney at the home of Bobbie Kilberg, a well-connected Virginia Republican who lined up against Trump during his 2016 bid for the White House, according to an invitation seen by Reuters.
In addition to Romney, the list of attendees is comprised of an array of establishment Republican figures and Trump critics, including former congresswoman Barbara Comstock, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, lobbyist Charlie Black, and former Vice President Dick Cheney, Cheney's father.
The event comes as Cheney gears up for a tough primary battle for Wyoming's only congressional district in August against a lawyer, Harriet Hageman, endorsed by Trump. The race, which will almost certainly determine the general election winner in the deeply conservative state, is widely seen as a proxy for the former president's grip over the Republican Party.
Cheney has been the target of Trump's ire and sidelined by most Republicans after voting in January to impeach Trump on a charge that he incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and helping lead an ongoing congressional committee investigating the attack. Last year Republicans voted to remove Cheney from her leadership position in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Cheney is not in financial trouble, having ended September with more than $3.6 million in the bank. But she faces a challenge for survival in Wyoming, where the activist base of her own party has moved against her. Over the weekend, Cheney won only six votes in a straw poll conducted by the Wyoming Republican State Central Committee, with Hageman securing 59.
Billionaire Peter Thiel and Donald Trump Jr. were scheduled to co-host a pair of fundraisers for Hageman on Wednesday, Politico reported last month. Hageman had roughly $245,000 in the bank as of September.

""I know that the members are very hopeful that it happens by the end of February or March,"" Representative Jamie Raskin told MSNBC, adding that ""the more foot-dragging"" there was by those around Trump the more difficult it would be to start the process.
But he cautioned that he was just one member of the nine-person committee and did not have final say. Its chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, has previously said the committee aims for hearings by spring.

The committee's members are racing to finish their work before the Nov. 8 midterm congressional elections, when Republicans are favored to win back a majority in the House and could shut down the committee.
The committee has spoken to about 400 witnesses and has issued dozens of subpoenas to compel testimony.

406,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 08:51PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday she will run for a 19th term in office, without saying whether she would seek to remain in her Democratic leadership role.
The 81-year-old California lawmaker was the first woman to serve as speaker and had been expected to step down, particularly as her party braces for a possible loss of its majority in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
It was not immediately clear if she would honor an agreement she made to secure an unprecedented second term as speaker after the 2018 election to serve only two additional terms in the role and pave the way for a new generation to ascend to House Democratic leadership.
Pelosi's office declined to answer questions as to whether she would seek the speaker's gavel again. ""The Speaker is not on a shift, she's on a mission,"" a senior aide said.
It would not be unprecedented for a speaker to run again for re-election and then announce later a decision not to seek the top leadership post again.
In 2006, then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a Republican, easily won re-election to his House seat, even though Democrats won control of the House and Senate in those elections. 
Immediately after Election Day, Hastert said he would not seek a leadership position in the Congress convening in January 2007. 
Hastert resigned from Congress altogether later in 2007.

""While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people's lives. This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy,"" Pelosi said in a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Though Democrats are preparing for a likely difficult election season this fall, Pelosi's seat is considered to be a safe one for the party to hold on to.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dominion Voting Systems Corp has told a court there is ""no realistic possibility"" that the voting machine manufacturer will reach settlements in its billion-dollar defamation lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, lawyers who worked for former President Donald Trump.
Dominion and another voting software firm, Smartmatic, have brought several lawsuits against people who spread conspiracy theories related to their voting machines after the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost to President Joe Biden.
""Given the devastating harm to Plaintiffs, the lack of remorse shown by Defendants, and the fact that many of them continue to double down on their lies, Plaintiffs do not believe any realistic possibility of settlement exists,"" Denver-based Dominion said in a filing https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699.63.0.pdf on Monday in federal court in Washington.
Lawyers for Giuliani and Powell said in the same filing that their clients may be open to settlement talks once the exchange of evidence, or ""discovery,"" is complete.
""Powell and Giuliani have nothing to show remorse for and dispute that they have lied about anything,"" the defense lawyers said.
""There's no particular incentive to settle with Giuliani or Powell, and it's not just the sadistic glee of making their lives miserable by forcing this to continue,"" said Don Herzog, a University of Michigan law professor. 
""It's that almost always, the party settling will stipulate in its terms of settlement: I don't concede that I did anything wrong. And unless they're nuts, what the corporation wants out of those two is exactly the acknowledgment that you did something wrong. So for them, there's a pressing interest to go to trial and make them lose,"" Herzog added.
Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, was the lead campaign lawyer for Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Trump's campaign distanced itself from Powell in November 2020 after she appeared with Giuliani at a news conference and claimed without evidence that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.

Powell the following month visited Trump at the White House and urged him to seize voting machines and to appoint her as a special counsel to investigate the election, according to the news website Axios.
Dominion has other pro-Trump media personalities and networks, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and Newsmax, seeking billions of dollars in monetary damages. The defendants have argued in court filings that they engaged in free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump is nowhere to be seen in Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race, but he nonetheless is shaping the election as Republican candidates vie for his support and the state party considers skipping an endorsement to avoid being at odds with him.
Trump has not revealed whether he will back any of the current candidates in the contest that could decide control of Congress in November's midterm elections.
The crowded Republican field vying to replace retiring Senator Pat Toomey includes several contenders with connections to the former president: Carla Sands, former ambassador to Denmark under Trump; celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a Trump friend; and hedge fund CEO David McCormick (NYSE:MKC), whose wife served in the Trump administration.
Trump's silence has left the state party considering the rare – and perhaps unprecedented - step of not endorsing a candidate in the state’s marquee race for fear of not moving in step with Trump, sources told Reuters. 
Pennsylvania's primary race illustrates how Trump has maintained his iron grip on the Republican Party as he aims to play king-maker in the midterm elections ahead of a possible 2024 presidential bid. 
He so far appears to be succeeding in the battleground state even after losing his 2020 re-election effort, in part due to President Joe Biden's win there, and pushing false voting-fraud concerns. 
Trump's long shadow in Pennsylvania leaves the state Republican Party struggling to maintain its power. It is unsure how to proceed with its endorsement, which this year would be given in early February and has traditionally been a major asset to a candidate. 
In interviews, 25 state party committee members and Republican Party officials in Pennsylvania said they are reluctant to back one Senate candidate. They cited both the large field of 12 candidates and the possibility that Trump might eventually endorse a different contender.
Some said they would prefer to endorse multiple candidates to preserve the committee's influence, while helping ensure they support a Trump candidate if he decides to engage. No party official could recall an instance when the party endorsed a slate of candidates for a single race. 
The state party did not reply to requests for comment.
“Trump is looming over this whole thing. Everyone knows if Trump comes out and endorses a candidate, then all bets are off,” said Val Biancaniello, a Republican organizer.
In regional caucuses ahead of a state meeting, members have overwhelmingly voted against endorsements, according to results seen by Reuters.
Frank Schiefer, a Republican state committeeman from western Pennsylvania, said he will vote against endorsing a Senate candidate. A Trump endorsement might have swayed him to act otherwise, he said.
""It certainly would've changed how I approached it, but it's not the only factor,"" Schiefer said.
TRUMP TIES 
McCormick jumped into the race this month and has recruited a number of people from Trump's orbit to serve as advisers. The Oz campaign did not respond to questions about the endorsements but noted his ""long-standing"" relationship with Trump. Sands' and McCormick's campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.
Real estate developer Jeff Bartos has strong support within the state's Republican Party but lacks the Trump ties of some of his rivals.
Trump is expected to withhold making an endorsement until he has a clearer idea of who is most likely to win, according to two sources familiar with his thinking.
The former president remains stung by his first foray into the race, having backed Sean Parnell only to see him drop out in November amid allegations that he abused his wife. 
The sources said Trump wants to avoid any more embarrassing setbacks in a state considered critical if he runs for president again. Trump spokesman Tyler Budowich did not respond to requests for comment. 
The primary election is slated for May but is expected to be postponed due to delays in finalizing new congressional and state district maps. Democrats have their own large field of Senate candidates and hope the Republican primary produces a Trump-aligned candidate who will have a harder time appealing to moderate voters.

With no signal from Trump on his intentions, state party committee member Lee Snover said she has been asking each Senate candidate how much they talk to the former president for a sense of whether they might win his favor.
""I sure wish Trump would just endorse,"" said Snover, also the chair of the Northampton County Republican Party. ""It would make this whole thing a lot easier.""

(Reuters) -A U.S. court rejected on Monday the Alabama legislature's redrawn U.S. congressional district map for November elections, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act and stood to deny Black voters an additional representative.
The ruling, which can be appealed, addresses an issue of contention between the two major political parties, in which Democrats accuse Republicans of exploiting their relative strength in state legislatures to diminish Black voting power.
U.S. states must redraw congressional lines once a decade to reflect shifts in population. In most states, lawmakers control redistricting, which can lead to one party manipulating district lines to entrench its power.
In Alabama, African Americans make up 27% of the population, but ethnic minorities have a majority of voters in only one of the state's seven congressional districts. That district, concentrated around the city of Birmingham, is held by the Democratic Party and the other six by Republicans.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama found that the Republican-dominated state legislature should have drawn the district lines to give minorities a majority in a second district, or at least a better chance of competing.
""The appropriate remedy is a congressional redistricting plan that includes either an additional majority-Black congressional district, or an additional district in which Black voters otherwise have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice,"" the judges said in a 225-page ruling.
The court postponed an upcoming candidate qualification deadline until Feb. 11 to give the legislature time to redraw the lines.
Control of the closely divided U.S. House of Representatives will be at stake in the Nov. 8 elections.
Many Democrats have complained Republicans use redistricting and voter access laws to suppress Black voters, as African Americans vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Republicans contend restrictive voter access laws are meant to prevent fraud.
In New York state, where Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor's office, it is the Republicans who accuse the Democrats of unfairness.

New York's bipartisan redistricting commission has failed to reach consensus on a new congressional map, ensuring that the state's Democratic lawmakers will redraw district lines.
Republican commissioners said the Democrats deliberately refused to negotiate ahead of Tuesday's deadline ""so that the determination of district lines would be tossed back to a legislature controlled by Democrat super-majorities.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden was caught on a hot mic cursing a Fox News reporter at a White House event on Monday after the journalist shouted a question about the impact of rising inflation on this year's congressional elections.
As journalists were ushered out of a meeting of Biden's Competition Council, Peter Doocy, a White House correspondent with whom Biden regularly spars, asked if it was OK to ask about inflation and if it was a political liability.
""That's a great asset, more inflation,"" Biden responded sarcastically over a din of reporters shouting questions, apparently not realizing his microphone was still on. ""What a stupid son of a bitch,"" he added.
U.S. consumer prices increased solidly https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-strongly-december-2022-01-12 in December, culminating in the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades.
Within about an hour of the exchange, Biden called Doocy's cell phone and said ""it's nothing personal, pal,"" Doocy later told Fox News host Sean Hannity. 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment while Fox News pointed Reuters to a transcript of an interview with Doocy about the exchange on Monday evening.
Biden took office a year ago pledging to take a hard line on any disrespect among members of his administration.
""If you're ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot ... no ifs, ands or buts,"" Biden told political appointees during a virtual swearing-in ceremony. ""Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity,"" he said at the time. 

Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, famously attacked reporters at rallies and news conferences, to the delight of many of his supporters.
Doocy, who has long covered Biden, regularly gets called on by the president at events, often asking skeptical and critical questions. Conservative-leaning Fox News has been critical of Biden's presidency and Democrats.

(Reuters) -The Georgia prosecutor investigating then-U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state will be allowed to seat a special grand jury to subpoena witnesses to testify against him.
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis last week sought to have a special grand jury aid her investigation into the Republican leader's efforts to pressure officials in a state where he lost to Joe Biden.
The Fulton County Superior Court approved the request on Monday, according to a court filing. The grand jury will commence on May 2 and convene for up to a year.
A Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Democrat, Willis launched the investigation after Trump was recorded in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his loss. Raffensperger declined.
The transcript quotes Trump telling Raffensperger: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" which is the number Trump needed to win Georgia. Trump has for months before and after the November 2020 election made false claims of voter fraud.
In a statement last week, Trump defended what he called his ""perfect"" phone call.
Legal experts have said Trump's phone calls may have violated at least three state election laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and intentional interference with performance of election duties. The possible felony and misdemeanor violations are punishable by fines or imprisonment.

In a recent court filing, Willis specifically mentioned that Raffensperger, whom she described as an ""essential witness,"" had indicated he would only take part in an interview once presented with a subpoena.
In Georgia, a special grand jury can issue subpoenas forcing witnesses to testify but cannot issue indictments. Unlike a traditional grand jury, a special grand jury is devoted to just one case, making it a powerful investigative tool.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor, has tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing a U.S. judge on Monday to delay her defamation trial against The New York Times.
Jury selection and opening statements had been expected to begin on Monday, but were pushed back 10 days to Feb. 3 after test results for the 57-year-old Palin became known. Palin had been expected to testify in person as soon as Tuesday.
""She is of course unvaccinated,"" U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said at a hearing. ""Since she has apparently tested positive three times, I'm going to assume that she's positive.""
Lawyers for Palin did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but said she wanted to attend the trial.
Palin, who tested positive https://people.com/politics/sarah-palin-tests-positive-coronavirus-urges-others-wear-masks for COVID-19 last March, has objected to mandatory vaccinations.
""It will be over my dead body that I'll have to get a shot,"" the mother of five told a conservative conference last month, drawing applause. ""I won't do it, and they better not touch my kids either."" She called the top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci ""the biggest shyster out there.""
C-Span posted a video https://www.c-span.org/video/?516849-4/sarah-palin-speaks-turning-point-usa-conservative-conference of Palin's comments. 
Palin is seeking unspecified damages from the Times and its former editorial page editor James Bennet.
She accused them of damaging her reputation in a June 14, 2017, editorial linking her to a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that killed six people and wounded U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords.
The editorial, headlined ""America's Lethal Politics,"" was published after a shooting at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia where U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a top Republican from Louisiana, was wounded.
It said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" between the 2011 shooting and a map circulated by Palin's political action committee putting 20 Democrats including Giffords under ""stylized cross hairs.""
The Times quickly corrected the editorial, saying it wrongly stated that political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting were linked, but Palin said the disputed material fit Bennet's ""preconceived narrative"" against supporters of gun rights.
Palin has signaled that if she lost, she would challenge a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court precedent that made it difficult for public figures to win libel lawsuits, by requiring that they show defendants acted with ""actual malice.""
Rakoff said Palin will be allowed in the courthouse on Feb. 3 ""provided that she is asymptomatic,"" and if she still had symptoms would need to be assessed first by an in-house doctor.
He also said no juror has contracted COVID-19 during the more than 100 trials held in the Manhattan courthouse since the pandemic began.

""I think that chances are reasonably good that we will start on Feb. 3,"" Rakoff said. ""Ms. Palin's health comes first, and the health of the rest of the courthouse is equally important.""
A trial is expected to last five days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a challenge by Republican lawmakers to pandemic-related proxy voting rules set by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the Democratic-led House of Representatives that were tailored to limit exposure to COVID-19.
The voting rules, implemented in May 2020, allow members of the 435-seat House to serve as proxies for colleagues in quarantine or otherwise unable to cast floor votes in the chamber. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and other lawmakers had asked the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision that allowed the remote voting rules to remain in effect.
The resolution passed by the House enabled lawmakers to act as a proxy for up to 10 colleagues at any one time, requiring that they disclose which members they intended to represent. The proxy voting system was embraced early in the pandemic and was intended to be temporary, but has been extended several times. The most recent extension is in effect until Feb. 13.
Republican lawmakers have called the measure a violation of the U.S. Constitution, arguing that only lawmakers actually present within the halls of Congress can cast votes. Republicans also called the resolution a way for Democrats to maintain their slim majority in the House regardless of whether all their members are present on Capitol Hill.
Despite Republican opposition to the measure, both parties have taken advantage of the proxy voting system to work remotely - much like millions of other U.S. office-workers.
Last May, seven House Democrats cast votes by proxy when they joined President Joe Biden on a visit to a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plant in Michigan. The following month, nine House Republicans voted by proxy while visiting the U.S.-Mexican border with former President Donald Trump.
A federal appeals court dealt a setback to McCarthy's legal challenge last July. Affirming a lower court ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said it was foreclosed from reviewing the proxy voting rules.
The D.C. Circuit's three-judge panel cited the Constitution's ""speech or debate"" clause that offers broad protection to members of Congress against lawsuits for actions they undertake as legislators.

The House has embraced other rules aimed at protecting the safety of lawmakers during the pandemic including a requirement for wearing face masks and a prohibition on congregating in an area called the Speakers Lobby outside the House chamber. In addition, many House and Senate hearings are held virtually. Tourists are not allowed in the Capitol.
The legal challenge brought by McCarthy and his colleagues is an example of the sharp partisan tensions in the House and the Republican animus toward Pelosi. Republicans are seeking to regain a majority in the chamber in November's congressional elections.

(Reuters) - In Vermont, lawmakers are considering bills to make it easier to prosecute people who threaten election officials. In Maine, proposed legislation would stiffen penalties for such intimidation. In Washington, state senators voted this month to make threatening election workers a felony.
The measures follow a Reuters series of investigative reports documenting a nationwide wave of threats and harassment against election administrators by Donald Trump supporters who embrace the former president’s false voting-fraud claims. Sponsors and supporters of the legislation in all three states cited Reuters reporting as an impetus for proposing tougher enforcement.
Washington state Senator David Frockt, a Seattle Democrat, said the reports “gave us more evidence” to build support for legislation to hold accountable those who threaten election officials.
In Maine, a bill authored by Democratic state Representative Bruce White would enhance penalties for anyone who “intentionally interferes by force, violence or intimidation” with election administration. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited the Reuters reporting in testimony supporting the bill.
“This is unacceptable,” she said, noting that two municipal clerks in Maine were threatened with violence.
In all, Reuters documented more than 850 threats and hostile messages https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/THREATS/mopanwmlkva to U.S. election officials and workers. Nearly all the communications echoed Trump’s baseless claims that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. More than 100 of the threats could meet the federal threshold for criminal prosecution, according to law professors and attorneys who reviewed them.
Prosecutions in such cases have been rare https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-law-enforcement. But on Friday, a U.S. Department of Justice task force on election threats announced its first indictment https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-texas-man-threatening-georgia-government-officials-2022-01-21, charging a Texas man for posting online threats against three officials in Georgia https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-threats-georgia-exclusiv-idCAKBN2IP0VZ. An assistant attorney general said the case is among “dozens” being investigated by the task force, which was formed shortly after Reuters in June published the first in the series https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-georgia-threats of reports on election-related threats.
In Vermont, menacing voicemails to Secretary of State Jim Condos and his staff – and a decision by police and prosecutors not to seek charges – spurred lawmakers to reconsider state laws that enshrine some of America’s oldest and strongest free-speech protections. Two measures introduced this month would make it easier to charge suspects for criminal threats and toughen penalties when they target public officials.
An unidentified man left a first round of hostile messages for Condos' office shortly after the 2020 election. Then, last fall, the same man left voicemails threatening Condos and his staff, along with two Reuters journalists who had interviewed the man about his earlier threats.
“Justice is coming,” the man warned in an October message. “All you dirty c‑‑‑suckers are about to get f‑‑‑ing popped. I f‑‑‑ing guarantee it.”
Condos said in an interview that he expected the threatener would face no consequences under state law. Police and prosecutors already had reviewed the caller’s earlier messages and decided they were protected speech.
Frustrated, Condos wrote to a half-dozen lawmakers, urging them to consider legislation to align state law more closely with federal statutes and to set a clearer standard for prosecution.
“These voicemails do cross the line,” Condos wrote in an October 27 email to lawmakers, which was reviewed by Reuters.
Federal officials considered the threats serious enough to investigate. After Reuters asked Vermont officials about the October threat, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an inquiry into the matter, according to two local law enforcement officials.
Condos said the email reflected his concern that the intimidation could escalate to violence. “It also was recognizing the world we are in,” he said, “and understanding we had to do something.”
Public calls for stronger legislation in Vermont emerged after Reuters published the October threats in a Nov. 9 story https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats along with details of the caller’s earlier messages. State authorities declined to pursue the case, saying the anonymous calls amounted to protected speech and were “essentially untraceable.” Reuters journalists, however, were able to contact and interview the man, who admitted to making the threats but declined to identify himself. He said he believed he had done nothing wrong.
The week after the Reuters report, Vermont Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, and state Senator Richard Sears, a Democrat, told reporters https://www.benningtonbanner.com/local-news/scott-will-consider-legislation-to-protect-election-workers/article_a4f7a134-4672-11ec-b04c-67156aea69cf.html that they would consider changes to state laws governing criminal threats. 
Newspaper editorials also urged new legislation. “This case makes it clear that Vermont law needs to change,” the Manchester Journal said in a Nov. 11 editorial https://www.manchesterjournal.com/opinion/editorials/our-opinion-protecting-election-workers-protects-the-democracy/article_0d50e134-7aad-5c63-a00a-979ec69a4b6a.html, referring to the threats reported by Reuters against Condos and his staff.
THREATS VS. FREE SPEECH
The bills in Vermont and other states wouldn’t alter the free-speech protections guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution to all Americans. Advocates for the Vermont legislation say the intent is to bring state laws in line with federal standards, which make it easier to prosecute threats of violence.
The Vermont bills would sharpen the definition of a criminal threat and remove several hurdles to prosecution, including a requirement that a threat must target a specific individual and an additional burden of proving the suspect has the means and ability to carry out any threatened violence. Another measure would impose stiffer sentences for threats to public officials.
“This is about not tying our hands” with statutes that are “too narrow or unduly restrictive,” says Rory Thibault, a state’s attorney who advised lawmakers in crafting the legislation.
Striking that balance is delicate in Vermont, which codified its expansive free-speech protections nearly 250 years ago, more than a decade before the U.S. Constitution. 
In 1777, the independent Vermont Republic enacted a constitution that guaranteed “a right to freedom of speech, and of writing and publishing their sentiments” – language that remains in the state’s constitution today. In 1798, one of the state’s first members of Congress, Matthew Lyon, was re-elected while jailed under the Sedition Act for criticism of President John Adams, whom Lyon had described as having “an unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp.”
When state lawmakers tried several years ago to make it easier to prosecute criminal threats, the legislation died amid concerns that it might infringe on speech rights. But Vermont, like much of America, has wrestled recently with violent anti-government sentiment, white nationalism and political extremism, straining its free-speech tradition. 
In 2018, Vermont’s Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member on two counts of disturbing the peace. The defendant had placed pro-Klan flyers on the cars of two women, one Black and one Hispanic. The court ruled the flyers constituted protected speech under Vermont law.
Last year, the town of Bennington paid $137,500 to a Black state legislator and apologized publicly for a police failure to sufficiently respond to racial harassment against her by a self-described white nationalist. The legislator, Kiah Morris, resigned in 2018.

So far, the criminal-threats legislation has not drawn significant public opposition, although proponents expect that might change once hearings begin. The American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont said it is monitoring the bills but has not taken a position. 
Sears, who is also Judiciary Committee Chairman, plans hearings on the legislation this month. Passing the legislation wouldn’t ensure that people threatening public officials will go to jail, said Sears, who sponsored one of the bills. “But we know that if we don’t make these changes, there’s no chance anything will happen.”

The trial before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan marks a rare instance of a major media company having to defend its editorial practices before a jury.
The editorial was published after a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia in which U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a member of the House of Representatives Republican leadership, was wounded.
It said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" in the 2011 shooting, which followed the circulation by Palin's political action committee (PAC) of a map putting 20 Democrats including Giffords under ""stylized cross hairs.""
The Times quickly corrected the editorial to disclaim any connection between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting, and Bennet has said he did not intend to blame Palin.
But Palin said the disputed material fit Bennet's ""preconceived narrative,"" and that he was experienced enough to know what his words meant. 
Opening statements could take place as soon as Monday, following jury selection in a trial expected to last five days. Palin is seeking unspecified damages. She has estimated $421,000 in damage to her reputation, according to court papers.
To prevail, Palin must show by clear and convincing evidence that ""actual malice"" https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-times-palin-idUKKBN25O31B underlay the editorial. The U.S. Supreme Court adopted the actual malice standard in 1964 for public officials, making it difficult for them to win libel lawsuits.
""The key will be showing how the editorial came together,"" said Timothy Zick, a professor and First Amendment specialist at William & Mary Law School. ""Essentially, did the Times do its homework before publishing?""

Politics could also enter jurors' thinking.
Benjamin Zipursky, a Fordham University law professor, said jurors will ""likely grasp"" that left-leaning media such as the Times often depict Palin in unflattering terms, but might find her PAC's associating cross hairs with Democratic politicians ""unseemly.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is set to hold the second meeting of its Competition Council on Monday, federal agencies said on Sunday.
Officials from two federal agencies told Reuters about the meeting and that their departments planned to attend. The White House did not confirm the meeting would take place but said President Joe Biden would meet on Monday ""with members of his administration on efforts to lower prices for working families.""
Biden signed in July a sweeping executive order to promote more competition in the U.S. economy, asking agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. That order created the council, which held its first meeting in September.
The order in July instructed antitrust agencies to focus on labor, healthcare, technology and agriculture. The White House has said the ""lack of competition drives up prices for consumers and drives down wages for workers.""
The council is chaired by the head of the White House National Economic Council and includes a number of cabinet agencies including the Justice, Transportation, Commerce and Agriculture departments as well as the chairs of the Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Communications Commission.
The Biden administration has taken steps to promote competition in many sectors, including the U.S. meat industry.
The Justice Department in September sought to unwind an alliance between American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp.
And last week, U.S. antitrust enforcers announced plans to rewrite merger guidelines in order to better fight illegal deals.

The Justice Department and FTC said U.S. industries had become increasingly concentrated and a surge in merger filings in 2020 and 2021 signaled the situation will worsen.
The second council meeting would also come as Congress scrutinizes technology companies. Last week, a Senate committee approved a bill that would bar tech giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) from giving preference to their own businesses on their websites.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, has spent 4-1/2 years battling the New York Times over an editorial she said falsely linked her to a deadly Arizona mass shooting that left a U.S. congresswoman seriously wounded.
On Monday, Palin is poised to try to begin convincing jurors in a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court that the newspaper and its former editorial page editor James Bennet defamed her. 
The trial before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff marks a rare instance of a major media company defending its editorial practices before an American jury. Opening statements could take place as soon as Monday, following jury selection.
Palin bears the high burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that there was ""actual malice"" involved in the newspaper's editorial writing process.
""This is a lawsuit over an editorial, essentially an opinion. This is a potentially dangerous area,"" said Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University law and communications professor. ""If we give public officials a green light to litigate on editorials they disagree with, where's the end?""
Palin, 57, has accused the Times of defaming her in a June 14, 2017, editorial linking her political action committee (PAC) to the 2011 mass shooting in an Arizona parking lot that left six people dead and then-U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords wounded. Palin is seeking unspecified damages, but according to court papers has estimated $421,000 in damage to her reputation.
The editorial said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" in the 2011 shooting, and that the incident came after Palin's PAC circulated a map putting 20 Democrats including Giffords under ""stylized cross hairs.""
It was published after a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia in which U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a member of the House of Representatives Republican leadership, was wounded.
Palin objected to language that Bennet had added to a draft prepared by a Times colleague. She said the added material fit Bennet's ""preconceived narrative,"" and as an ""experienced editor"" he knew and understood the meaning of his words.
The Times quickly corrected the editorial to disclaim any connection between political rhetoric and the Arizona shooting, and Bennet has said he did not intend to blame Palin.
Bennet's ""immediate sort of emergency mode or panic mode"" upon learning what happened strongly suggests he had been unaware of any mistake, said Benjamin Zipursky, a Fordham University law professor.
""Negligence or carelessness - even gross negligence - is clearly not good enough for Palin to win,"" Zipursky said.
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT
It has been 58 years since the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the ""actual malice"" standard in the landmark decision called New York Times v. Sullivan, which made it difficult for public figures to win libel lawsuits.
Two current justices, conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have suggested revisiting that standard.
Palin has signaled in court papers she would challenge the Sullivan case precedent on appeal if she loses at trial.
Don Herzog, a University of Michigan law professor, said Palin would have trouble showing that the Times ""subjectively doubted or disbelieved"" the truth of what it presented as fact.
""In context, and given the kind of publication it was, this is a matter of opinion and so simply not actionable in defamation,"" Herzog said.
While the trial could spotlight office politics at the Times, the newspaper could argue that mistakes do happen under deadline pressure. 
It has said that despite Palin's efforts to demonstrate its ""liberal bias"" and views on gun control, the editorial was never about her and did not undermine her reputation.
""Gov. Palin already was viewed as a controversial figure with a complicated history and reputation, and in the time since the editorial was published, Gov. Palin has prospered,"" the Times said in a Jan. 17 court filing.
The trial is expected to last five days.

Gutterman said he expects the Times to prevail. 
""It's unfortunate that this happened at one of the most prominent newspapers in the county, on deadline, but even a mistake does not rise to actual malice,"" Gutterman said.

418,"<span>Jan 22, 2022 06:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The executive committee of the Arizona Democratic Party (ADP) formally censured U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema over her vote against changing rules in the chamber to steer through voting rights legislation, the state party said on Saturday.
Sinema was one of two Democratic senators who joined with Republicans to vote against lowering the Senate's 60-vote threshold to 50 so that the Senate could pass voting rights bill without bipartisan support.
The censure is mostly a symbolic move, but it does highlight criticism that Sinema has faced from members of her own party, with polling indicating that Sinema is facing a rising amount of backlash from Democratic voters.
Raquel Teran, the state party's chair, said in a Saturday statement they supported Sinema's votes to pass legislation to provide more coronavirus relief and to improve the nation's infrastructure.
""However, we are also here to advocate for our constituents and the ramifications of failing to pass federal legislation that protects their right to vote are too large and far-reaching,"" Teran said. 
""While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the ADP Executive Board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy,"" Teran added.
The failure to pass the legislation was a major blow to President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and for voting rights groups, which had been fighting a slate of laws passed in Republican-controlled states that election experts have said were designed to suppress voting, especially among Black, Hispanic and poor voters.
Experts and voting rights advocates say the states have passed the legislation largely to back former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was marred by rampant fraud. 
In Sinema's home state of Arizona, state Senate Republicans contracted a private company called Cyber Ninjas to perform a so-called ""audit"" of the 2020 election. Election officials discredited the probe, with Arizona's Secretary of State issuing a report saying the election was secure and accurate and calling the review ""secretive and disorganized.""
The company has since shut down after a judge ordered it to pay $50,0000 a day in fines, according to media reports.
Sinema co-sponsored the Senate version of election overhaul legislation, but has publicly stated repeatedly she opposed changing filibuster rules.

Sinema's office shrugged off the censure in a statement.
""During three terms in the U.S. House, and now in the Senate, Kyrsten has always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state - not for either political party. She's delivered for Arizonans and has always been honest about where she stands,"" a spokesperson said.

419,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 12:57PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday that President Joe Biden could not require federal employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and blocked the government from disciplining employees who failed to comply.
Biden issued an order requiring about 3.5 million workers to get vaccinated by Nov. 22 barring a religious or medical accommodation - or else face discipline or firing. 
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown said the question was whether Biden could ""require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment. That, under the current state of the law as just recently expressed by the Supreme Court, is a bridge too far.""
Brown, based in Galveston and appointed by former President Donald Trump, said the government could protect public health with less invasive measures, such as masking and social distancing.
The ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions to go against government vaccine requirements.
In mid-January, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the president's COVID-19 vaccination-or-testing mandate for large businesses, a policy the conservative justices deemed an improper imposition on the lives and health of many Americans. The court allowed a separate federal vaccine requirement for healthcare facilities.
A third major vaccine requirement aimed at employees of federal contractors was blocked by a federal judge in December.
The Biden administration has struggled to contain COVID-19, which has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States and weighed heavily on the economy.

Many large employers such as United Airlines and  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) have touted their success in using mandates to get nearly all staff vaccinated against COVID-19.
The Supreme Court ruling that blocked the mandate for larger businesses prompted some employers, including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), to abandon vaccine requirements for staff.

""The House will soon introduce its competitiveness bill,"" she said in a note to Democratic colleagues.
The announcement came just hours after  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said it would invest more than $20 billion in two new chip-making plants in Ohio in a massive manufacturing project that could benefit from federal funding in the years ahead.
President Joe Biden's administration is pushing to persuade Congress to approve funding to help boost chip production in the United States, as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks.
""I want to see Congress pass this bill right away and get it to my desk,"" Biden said. ""Let's do it for the sake of our economic competitiveness and our national security.""
The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, which includes $52 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
""The House legislation will supercharge our investment in chips, strengthen our supply chain and transform our research capacity, plus many other key provisions,"" Pelosi said in a letter to Democratic colleagues. 
Biden earlier in the week said surging inflation had ""everything to do with the supply chain"" and that the United States had the capacity to become self-reliant on the computer chips it needed to manufacture automobiles.
The administration has made efforts to alleviate the chip shortage, including meeting with industry executives and allies to discuss the topic, and initiating a study from the Commerce Department to identify chokepoints and other problems.
Biden touted Intel's investment Friday at a White House event with the chip company's CEO Pat Gelsinger and made the case for congressional action.

Gelsinger said in an interview with Reuters before the White House news conference that without government funding ""we're still going to start the Ohio site. It's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""
Intel's initial $20 billion investment - the largest in Ohio's history - on a 1,000-acre site in New Albany will generate 3,000 jobs, Gelsinger said. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and is the largest investment in Ohio's history, he told Reuters.

The directive will impact almost 70,000 federal employees most of whom work at the Departments of Defense, Agriculture and Veteran Affairs, OPM said in a statement on Friday.
President Biden made supporting blue-collar workers a priority of his presidential campaign, saying strong unions and higher wages could resurrect America's middle class while helping bridge economic and racial inequities. 
Last year Biden issued an executive order raising wages of federal contract workers to $15 an hour.

""Raising pay rates across the federal government to a minimum of $15 per hour reflects our appreciation for the federal workforce and our values as a nation,"" Kiran Ahuja, Director of the Office of Personnel Management, said in the statement.
OPM has asked agencies to implement the new wage by Jan. 30, and it excludes the U.S. Postal Service and Postal Regulatory Commission, the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives' panel investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol on Thursday requested an interview with former U.S. President Donald Trump's daughter and White House aide Ivanka Trump.
In a letter to Ivanka Trump, lawmakers said they were seeking her voluntary cooperation as part of their ongoing probe and would limit their questions to issues related to events surrounding that day, including activities leading up to or influencing it and her role in the White House at that time. 
The panel noted that she ""was present in the Oval Office"" during key conversations leading up to Jan. 6, and observed a telephone conversation between her father and former Vice President Mike Pence on the morning of the Capitol attack. Donald Trump had attempted to persuade Pence to reject the results of the election.
A statement released by Ivanka Trump's spokesperson did not address whether she would cooperate with the committee's investigation.
""Ivanka Trump just learned that the January 6 Committee issued a public letter asking her to appear,"" a spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said in a statement. ""As the Committee already knows, Ivanka did not speak at the January 6 rally. As she publicly stated that day at 3:15 p.m., ""any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.'""
The committee said in its letter to Ivanka Trump that it also probing whether Donald Trump's own White House lawyers determined that he broke the law by attempting to interfere with the election outcome.
“The committee has information suggesting that President Trump’s White House counsel may have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice President Pence to take would violate the Constitution or would be otherwise illegal,” Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, wrote in the letter to Ivanka Trump.
The committee said it also wanted to ask whether her father made any effort to deploy federal agents or troops to end the Jan. 6 violence, saying it so far has no evidence of that.
The former president has blasted the committee's probe as a partisan effort, and has sought to block other aides' testimony and White House documents from reaching the panel.
U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, vice chair of the committee and one of its two Republican members, said earlier this month that the panel has ""firsthand testimony"" that Ivanka Trump asked her father to intervene during the Capitol riots.
""We know his daughter -- we have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to 'please stop this violence,'"" Cheney said in a Jan. 2 interview with ABC News's ""This Week.""
Cheney last month shared text messages sent by Donald Trump Jr. pleading with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to have the former president urge an end to the Capitol assault.
“He’s got to condemn this shit ASAP,” Cheney read aloud from a text sent by Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, to Meadows.

CNN reported on Tuesday that the committee has subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with one of Trump's children, Eric Trump, as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr.
The committee has spoken to about 400 witnesses and has issued dozens of subpoenas to compel testimony.

There were multiple planning calls between campaign officials and Republican Party state operatives with Giuliani being involved in at least one call, one source said, in efforts to stop Joe Biden's victory when Congress met on Jan 6, 2021. 
Trump and officials are facing several probes after failing to accept the election result, which is decided by the electoral college, where each person's ballot goes toward a statewide tally, requiring the votes of at least 270 electors for victory. 

The former president's campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, had rooms for fake electors to meet and circulated draft certificates, CNN reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell to the lowest level of his presidency this week as Americans appeared exhausted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic toll, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.
The national poll, conducted Jan. 19-20, found that 43% of U.S. adults approved of Biden's performance in office, while 52% disapproved and the rest were not sure. The prior week's poll had put Biden at a 45% approval rating and 50% disapproval.
After holding above 50% in his first months in office, Biden's popularity began dropping in mid-August as COVID-19 deaths surged across the country and the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed.
The ongoing slump in Biden's popularity is ringing alarm bells https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-must-tighten-focus-economy-pandemic-before-midterms-democrats-say-2022-01-19 in his party, with Democrats worried dissatisfaction could cost them their congressional majorities in Nov. 8 elections. If Republicans take control of either the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate, Biden's legislative agenda could be doomed.
In a rare news conference on Wednesday, Biden acknowledged Americans' frustration at the close of his first year in office. But he vowed to make progress fighting considerable challenges from the pandemic and inflation, which hit a near 40-year high in December as the health crisis snarled global supply chains.
The weekly poll showed the top issues concerning Americans were the economy and public health.

At the same point in Donald Trump's presidency, about 37% of Americans approved of his performance in office, while 59% disapproved.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,004 adults, including 453 Democrats and 365 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of 4 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his party splintered and Democrats across the coalition that elected him in 2020 unhappy, President Joe Biden has just a few months to try to chart a path out of the malaise or risk getting swamped in the looming midterm elections in which Republicans are seeking to regain control of Congress. 
A year into Biden's presidency, suburban, college-educated and women voters who helped make him president are exhausted after almost two years of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite robust economic indicators, many Americans are frustrated by regular school disruptions, high prices at the gasoline pump and barren grocery store shelves. 
As the sitting president, all of that weighs on Biden's popularity. He acknowledged those frustrations at a rare news conference at the White House on Wednesday.
""It's been too much to bear,"" Biden said, referring to the pandemic and its accumulated effects on Americans. 
Containing the coronavirus is ""a job not yet finished,"" Biden added. ""It will get better.""
The United States leads the world https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/united-states in COVID-19 deaths, with almost 860,000.
Analysts have said Biden has just a few months to reverse public opinion on his performance before voter attitudes harden ahead of the November elections. 
Republicans have proven to be surprisingly resilient politically, showing renewed electoral appeal despite party fissures over former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread election fraud and his supporters' attack last year on the U.S. Capitol.
More than a dozen Democratic strategists, analysts and pollsters told Reuters that Biden needs to deliver a more focused economic message, one that highlights meaningful policy victories such as passage of a major infrastructure bill and targets other problems such as supply-chain disruptions - all while continuing to make combating the pandemic a top priority. 
Biden must find a way, they said, to move beyond the squabbling on Capitol Hill and turn his attention to tailored measures that will help families still dealing with fallout from a pandemic that has rattled the economy and changed society in seemingly endless ways.
""We have a lot of policies, a lot of statistics. But we're not making people feel better,"" said Jen Ancona of Way to Win, a Democratic advocacy group. 
Biden's achievements on securing congressional passage of COVID-19 relief legislation and infrastructure spending have been overshadowed by party-infighting over the massive ""Build Back Better"" bill - a spending plan with healthcare, education, child care, immigration and climate components - and voter-protection measures.
Even as Biden spoke on Wednesday, the Democratic-led Senate was poised to hold a vote https://www.reuters.com/world/us/voting-rights-brawl-takes-center-stage-us-senate-2022-01-19 regarding the voting-rights legislation - a top priority of party activists - that seems doomed to failure. 
IT'S THE ECONOMY
A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken this month showed the economy remains the top concern for voters across the political spectrum despite strong employment numbers, followed by containing the spread of the coronavirus. 
Most critical for Democratic prospects in the congressional elections is getting inflation under control, said Doug Sosnik, a former senior adviser to Democratic President Bill Clinton. 
""I feel sticker-shock three or four times a day when I buy something,"" Sosnik said. ""It affects everybody."" 
At his news conference, Biden said improving supply chains and upgrading infrastructure could eventually lower consumer prices, while conceding that Americans are struggling. 
Biden has lost ground among some of the groups that helped push him past Trump in 2020. According the Reuters/Ipsos poll, support among white voters (41%), suburban voters (43%) and college-age voters (45%) has dropped to the lowest levels of his presidency while disapproval among those voters has shot above 50%.
Some of those voters defected to Republican candidates in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey last November, while turnout by the hardcore Democratic base was spotty. If repeated, that could trigger a Republican landslide in the midterm elections, according to strategists. 
Democrats narrowly control both chambers of Congress. If Republicans win a majority in either the House of Representatives or Senate, Biden's legislative agenda could be doomed.
Democrats hope that once the current COVID-19 surge powered by the Omicron variant recedes, voters will feel a greater sense of normalcy and view the economy - and the president - more favorably. 

There also remains the possibility that the White House will be able to salvage pieces of its legislative agenda - as Biden called for on Wednesday, something that would give Democratic candidates more to sell on the campaign trail this summer.
""I think there's still the opportunity to get it right,"" said David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party. ""You've got to figure out how to break through.""

Currently, representatives are required to disclose stock sale transactions within a prescribed number of days or face penalties. The requirement is aimed at tackling any appearances of a conflict of interest by House members who could be working on legislation affecting companies or certain investors.
Pelosi added that any suspicions of insider trading by members of Congress would be subject to investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Her remarks were a departure from a month ago when she defended lawmakers engaging in stock market trading.

""To give a blanket attitude of we can't do this and we can't do that because we can't be trusted, I just don't buy into that,"" the top House Democrat said.

Meantime, Pelosi criticized the U.S. Supreme Court for having lax rules. ""When we go forward with anything let's take the Supreme Court with us to have disclosure,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats suffered twin legislative defeats late on Wednesday in their push to toughen voting rights protections in the run-up to this November's mid-term elections that will determine control of Congress in 2023.
In back-to-back votes late on Wednesday, Senate Republicans first blocked Democrats' move to advance the voting rights legislation toward passage. It was the fifth time in less than a year that they did so.
They employed the decades old ""filibuster"" rule to stop the legislation, which requires the cooperation of at least 60 of the Senate's 100 members to keep bills alive. The Senate currently is split 50-50.
In lightning speed, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, then moved to revamp the filibuster rule by lowering the 60-vote threshold to 50. This time, it was not Republicans, but Schumer's own Democrats - conservatives Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - who put the final nail in the coffin by voting against the rules change.
With their year-long initiative stymied even after Republican-controlled states enacted bills that experts said were designed to suppress voting in federal elections, especially among Black, Hispanic and poor voters, the focus turned to a nascent bipartisan effort to pass far more limited election reforms.
Republican Senator Mitt Romney told reporters a group of senators planned to meet on Friday to discuss launching a bipartisan effort.
Some of the changes they are discussing already have been dismissed by leading Democrats and civil rights groups as being far short of what is needed to guarantee easier access to the ballot in American elections.
""Let us not sink into the abyss of voter suppression; give us the ballot,"" Schumer implored before the rules change vote. But he failed to sway Manchin and Sinema.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell warned against changes to the rule. ""Factional fires are burning hot all across our country,"" McConnell said, adding altering the filibuster rule ""would shatter the Senate for short-term power.""
Between 2016 and 2020, however, McConnell stoked partisan fires by first blocking then-President Barack Obama's nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, only to then ram former President Donald Trump's three nominees through the Senate by scrapping the filibuster for those picks.
Now, with the 2022 mid-term elections heating up that will see the election of all 435 House of Representatives members and one-third of the Senate, the partisan fighting is only expected to deepen.
Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who aligns with Democrats, left the Senate chamber late on Wednesday telling reporters that the party needed to go on the offensive.
He urged Schumer to schedule votes on popular initiatives, such as lowering prescription drug costs to consumers, expanding Medicare and improving child care. All are ideas that were bundled together with other domestic social program improvements and climate change remedies in a $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" bill that is languishing in Congress.
The voting rights bill that was passed by the House but buried on Wednesday by the Senate would have established minimum federal voting standards so that any registered voter could request a mail-in ballot. It also would have established at least two weeks of early voting and expanded use of ballot drop boxes that make voting more convenient in many areas.
The Democrats' legislation also would have attempted to remove partisanship from the way congressional districts are redrawn every decade. Currently, ""gerrymandering"" regularly tilts the field to whichever party is in power in the various states. 
Democrats argued their bill would strengthen a democracy buffeted by domestic strife and the Jan. 6, 2021, violent riot at the U.S. Capitol at the hands of thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump. The rioters were trying to stop a congressional certification of Biden's 2020 victory against Trump.
Underscoring deep divisions in Congress and throughout the nation, Republicans countered that Democrats had fabricated a crisis over voting rights and maintained that little or nothing needed to be done with the way states administer elections.
The final tally on limiting debate on the election reform bill was 49-51. No Republicans voted to advance it.
Then, all 50 Republicans plus Manchin and Sinema defeated the move to change the filibuster rule on a one-time basis by a vote of 52-48.

As the drama was playing out in the Senate, Biden told a news conference on Wednesday that he had not given up hope of advancing voting rights.
""We've not run out of options yet,"" the Democratic president said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.
The decision means the documents, held by a federal agency that stores government and historical records, can be disclosed even as litigation over the matter continues in lower courts. 
Trump's request to the justices came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 ruled that the businessman-turned-politician had no basis to challenge President Joe Biden's decision to allow the records to be handed over to the House of Representatives select committee.
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, the panel's chairman, and Republican Representative Liz Cheney, its vice chair, in a statement called the Supreme Court action ""a victory for the rule of law and American democracy."" The committee has already begun receiving some of the documents Trump had hoped to withhold, they added.
A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle with the committee seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke a legal principle known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, a stance rejected by lower courts.
The brief Supreme Court order noted that the weighty question of whether a former president can assert an executive privilege claim did not need to be answered to resolve the case.
""Because the court of appeals concluded that President Trump's claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former president necessarily made no difference to the court's decision,"" the unsigned order said.
Only one of the court's nine members, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, publicly noted disagreement with the decision.
The House committee has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.
The committee has asked the National Archives, which holds Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers.
Biden, who took office two weeks after the riot, has determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege and that turning them over to Congress was in the best interests of the nation. Trump has argued that he can invoke executive privilege based on the fact he was president at the time even though he is no longer in office.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Nov. 9 rejected Trump's arguments, saying he had not acknowledged the ""deference owed"" to Biden's determination that the committee could access the records and adding: ""Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.""
The select committee is comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, but it has not always been receptive to his requests. 

The court last year rejected his request to block disclosure of his tax records as part of a criminal investigation in New York and also turned away attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election.
Shortly before the riot, Trump repeated to a crowd of his supporters his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, telling them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden acknowledged Americans' frustration as his first year in office came to an end on Wednesday, but said the United States was on track to meet considerable challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and inflation.
""Our work's not done,"" he told a rare solo White House news conference about the economic and health recovery from the pandemic. The president added that he thought his administration could have done more on COVID testing. 
But the United States is on track to meet considerable challenges from the pandemic and inflation, Biden said, citing job growth, low unemployment and new business growth. 
Asked whether he had promised more than he could deliver on the 2020 campaign trail, Biden was adamant: ""I didn’t over-promise."" 
For 2022, Biden said he needed to leave the White House to talk to the American people more regularly.
""I'm gonna get out of this place more often. I don't get a chance to look people in the eye,"" he said, and ""let them take a measure of who I am."" 
Biden faces a slump in opinion polls as his fellow Democrats gird for Nov. 8 midterm elections in which their majorities in Congress are on the line. 
Two of Biden's top legislative priorities -- his signature economic and social spending package called Build Back Better and a federal voting rights bill -- have languished. 
Biden said one challenge he underestimated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-blasts-republicans-asks-party-name-what-it-stands-2022-01-19 going into the White House was the ""stalwart"" opposition of Republicans to his presidency, which he characterized as worse than it was when he was vice president under Barack Obama. 
Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ""has been clear, he’d do anything to prevent Biden from being a success,"" the president said, speaking about himself in the third person. 
""Name me one thing they're for,"" he said of the opposing party.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel shot back that ""Biden showed how deeply out of touch he is, claiming that the struggles Americans are facing each day aren't real.""
Asked about surveys showing he lost favor among some voters who supported him in 2020, Biden said: ""I don't believe the polls."" 
But he acknowledged that Build Back Better was all but dead in its old form. Instead, the president said, he expected that he could get ""big chunks"" of that bill passed, if not the full package.
Biden raised concerns that Republicans could succeed in undermining the legitimacy of the elections this year. 
Biden's fellow Democrats are fighting to retain their control of Congress https://www.reuters.com/world/us/first-months-2022-crucial-biden-agenda-november-midterms-loom-2022-01-10 in the coming elections https://www.reuters.com/world/us/another-midterm-worry-biden-white-house-probes-impeachment-attempts-2022-01-17 amid a flood of Republican-backed state laws that civil rights advocates say could suppress Black and other minority votes.

""The increase in the prospect of it being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed,"" Biden said about federal voting rights law.
Biden has held nine total news conferences in his first year in office, including six solo, a slower pace than his most recent predecessors, according to the American Presidency Project at University of California, Santa Barbara.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an unusual joint statement from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch denying a rift between them over wearing a face mask during oral arguments to protect against COVID-19.
""Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false,"" Sotomayor and Gorsuch said in the statement, which was provided by a court spokesperson. ""While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends.""
Sotomayor, 67, has diabetes, a risk factor for complications from COVID-19. Sotomayor sits next to Gorsuch on the nine-member bench when the court hears oral arguments.
The statement appeared to be in response to reporting by National Public Radio and other media outlets that, during a surge in COVID-19 infections driven by the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant, the justices were asked to wear masks but only Gorsuch refused. NPR's report said that it was Chief Justice John Roberts who made the request, not Sotomayor.
Roberts issued a separate statement denying the report, saying: ""I did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench.""
As a result, according to the media reports, Sotomayor decided to participate in oral arguments and the private weekly conference among the justices from the confines of her own chambers. Reuters could not independently verify the accuracy of the reports.
The joint statement did not address why, since returning to work after the New Year, all the justices have worn masks in the courtroom except Gorsuch. From October to December, all justices were maskless in the courtroom except for Sotomayor, who consistently wore one.
On Wednesday, Gorsuch was again the only justice present not to wear a mask. Some of the other justices sometimes removed their masks when asking questions during oral arguments.
A rift between Gorsuch and Sotomayor would have been at odds with their friendly relationship on the bench. Over the years observers had noted the pair frequently laughing together. ""He's a lovely person,"" Sotomayor told an audience in 2019.
The court returned to in-person arguments in October after hearing cases by teleconference during the pandemic. The court remains closed to the public. Arguing attorneys and journalists who cover the court must test negative for COVID-19 prior to attending arguments.
When the justices entered the courtroom on Jan. 7 to hear an emergency set of oral arguments involving two of President Joe Biden's key pandemic-related policies, only Gorsuch was maskless. Sotomayor did not take the bench at all and has continued to work from her chambers ever since.

The justices eventually blocked Biden's vaccination-or-testing mandate for businesses with at least 100 workers while allowing a federal vaccine requirement covering healthcare facilities. 
Citing court sources, NPR reported that because of Sotomayor's concerns about working next to unmasked people, Roberts ""in some form asked the other justices to mask up. They all did. Except Gorsuch, who, as it happens, sits next to Sotomayor on the bench.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. senators said on Wednesday they are working with Democrats on legislation to aid Ukraine as Washington works to prevent another attack by Russia on the former Soviet state and after a bill they supported failed to pass last week.
A bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-democrats-slam-cruz-nord-stream-2-sanctions-bill-ahead-vote-2022-01-13 led by Republican Senator Ted Cruz that would place sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany within 15 days of passage, last week did not get the majority it needed to pass in the 50-50 Senate.
Critics said automatic sanctions on the pipeline risked driving a wedge between the United States and its allies, especially Germany, potentially harming a united front against Russia.
A day before Cruz's bill, Democratic Senator Robert Menendez proposed a bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us-senate-democrats-unveil-russia-sanctions-bill-washington-post-2022-01-12 imposing sanctions on the pipeline, on top Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin, and on banking institutions, should Russia attack Ukraine again.
""Passing something is better than passing nothing,"" Senator Kevin Cramer told reporters, who added that elements of Republican proposed legislation, such as that sponsored by Senator Marco Rubio could be joined with items in the Menendez bill. 
The senators did not say when a unified bill could come to the floor for a vote in the Senate, which has a packed schedule.
Cramer, who earlier this week took part in a bipartisan visit of U.S. Senators to Ukraine, said the bill should cut off Russia's access to the SWIFT global electronic payment system.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat is also preparing sanctions on Russia and will be prepared to impose them as soon as any tanks roll, officials have said. Restrictions under consideration could affect U.S. products exported to Russia and certain foreign-made products subject to U.S. jurisdiction. 
Russia, which invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, has massed about 100,000 troops on the border but says it is not readying another attack. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at ""very short notice https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/blinken-says-russian-attack-ukraine-could-come-very-short-notice-2022-01-19"" but Washington would pursue diplomacy as long as it could.
The Menendez bill does not mention SWIFT by name, but the senator has said his legislation would target companies in Russia that offer secure messaging systems, such as SWIFT, which banks use to exchange information with other financial institutions.

Senator Rob Portman, who was also on the trip to Ukraine, said the bill could include measures to help Ukraine fight against cyberattacks that were passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last April.
""We would most likely be able to fold that in any new legislation,"" Portman said. A massive cyberattack on Ukraine this month splashed Ukrainian government websites with a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"".

The requirements, laid out in a national security memorandum released Wednesday, require agencies such as the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Energy to implement baseline security measures for ""national security systems"" - networks where the most sensitive U.S. data is held.

Among the requirements: multi-factor authentication, or the use of multiple layers of passwords delivered via different services; NSA-approved encryption; and zero-trust architecture, an industry term for the continuous validation of users' or devices' identities.
The memo builds on previous requirements from the Biden administration for federal civilian networks. The White House has made cybersecurity a priority after a series of digital debacles including a cybercriminal shakedown effort that briefly paralyzed gasoline deliveries to the East Coast last year and the discovery that allegedly Russian hackers had infiltrated several government agencies by piggybacking on network-monitoring software made by the company SolarWinds.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The congressional committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol issued subpoenas on Tuesday to three lawyers who joined former President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to overturn his election defeat: Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis.
The House of Representatives committee demanded the pro-Trump lawyers hand over documents and sit for depositions on Feb. 8.
Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said in a statement that the panel expects the lawyers to join the nearly 400 witnesses who have spoken with the Select Committee as part of its investigation into the causes of the deadly attack by Trump supporters.
The committee also subpoenaed Boris Epshteyn, a Trump political adviser.
Robert Costello, a lawyer for Giuliani, said in an interview that the subpoena was ""political theater"" and that his client was constrained by the legal doctrines of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.
""I don't think there's anything here he can testify about,"" Costello said.
Powell, Epshteyn, and Ellis did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The four individuals we've subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former president about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,"" Thompson said in the statement.
Powell, Giuliani, and Ellis jointly spoke at a Trump campaign news conference on Nov. 19, 2020, where they vowed to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory. Powell promised to ""release the Kraken,"" likening their effort to a mythological sea monster.
The Trump campaign distanced itself from Powell after she claimed without evidence at the news conference that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots from Trump to Biden. 
Giuliani's New York law license was suspended in June, after a state appeals court found he made ""demonstrably false and misleading"" statements that widespread voter fraud undermined the election, won by Democrat Joe Biden.
The committee is aiming to release an interim report in the summer and a final report in the fall, a source familiar with the investigation said last month.

CNN reported on Tuesday that the committee has subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with one of Trump's children, Eric Trump, as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr.
The Select Committee's members have said they will consider passing along evidence of criminal conduct by Trump to the U.S. Justice Department. Such a move, known as a criminal referral, would be largely symbolic but would increase the political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge the former president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's top diplomat will seek to defuse a crisis with Moscow over Ukraine when he meets the Russian foreign minister in Geneva this week following visits with Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv and European officials in Berlin. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel amid concerns voiced by Ukraine and its Western allies over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed in and near Ukraine.
""The United States does not want conflict. We want peace,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday. 
""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin has it in his power to take steps to de-escalate this crisis so the United States and Russia can pursue a relationship that is not based on hostility or crisis,"" the official told reporters.
Russia denies planning a new military offensive but has made several demands and said it could take unspecified military action unless the West agrees to them.. 
Blinken will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday. 
Then in Berlin he will meet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and later the Transatlantic Quad, referring to a format that involves the United States, Britain, France and Germany.
A State Department statement said the discussions would focus in part on a readiness among allies to impose ""massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia.""
Blinken will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Friday to seek a diplomatic off-ramp with Moscow, the senior official said.
Blinken spoke with Lavrov on Tuesday and the senior official said the two decided in the call that it would be useful to meet in person.
Lavrov separately said Moscow would welcome U.S. diplomatic efforts and reiterated Russian accusations that Ukraine was ""sabotaging"" agreements aimed at ending the conflict between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Despite diplomatic engagements this month, Washington has yet to see Russia de-escalate tensions and Moscow could launch an attack on Ukraine at any time in January or February, the senior official said.
""We are now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack on Ukraine,"" the official said
A second senior State Department official on Tuesday voiced concern about Russian troops being deployed since Monday in Belarus close to its southern flank with Ukraine for what Moscow and Minsk say will be joint military drills.
The numbers of Russian troops are beyond what the United States would expect in a normal exercise and potentially could be used to attack neighboring Ukraine, the official said.
Biden has warned of severe economic consequences for Moscow if Russia invades Ukraine. 

Baerbock, in Moscow for talks with her counterpart, on Tuesday said Germany was ready to pay a high economic price to defend its fundamental values in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Kyiv has sought weapons from Western nations to shore up its defense. On Monday, Britain said it had begun supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons to help it defend itself.

(Reuters) - Texas election officials have rejected hundreds of mail-in ballot applications, abiding by a new Republican-backed law just weeks before a March 1 primary kicks off this year's U.S. election cycle.
""My friends, this is what voter suppression looks like,"" Democrat Dana DeBeauvoir, the Travis County clerk, told reporters on Tuesday.
The county, home to the state capital Austin, invalidated approximately 300 applications because people failed to meet the law's stricter identification requirements, said DeBeauvoir, who retires at month's end.
Lawmakers in Texas approved a raft of voting restrictions last year, one of many efforts in Republican-controlled states to pass new limits after former President Donald Trump falsely claimed he lost the 2020 election because of widespread fraud.
Democrats in Congress this week renewed their push to pass sweeping voting rights legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-democrats-start-voting-rights-showdown-with-no-clear-path-victory-2022-01-18 that would overturn limits such as the Texas law, but the effort appears doomed in the face of united Republican opposition. 
The Texas bill prompted some Democratic legislators to flee the state for weeks to prevent the state House of Representatives from having the quorum necessary to pass it, though they eventually relented.
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who signed the bill in September and is seeking re-election this year, has said the law, known as Senate Bill 1, will increase public trust in elections.
The U.S. Justice Department has sued Texas over the legislation, saying it disenfranchises voters. Democrats say such restrictions discriminate against Black voters and other minorities who traditionally support Democratic candidates.
Among other provisions, the law requires voters applying for a mail ballot to provide either a driver's license or Social Security number, which must match the number they gave when first registering to vote.
That leaves some voters playing a ""guessing game,"" DeBeauvoir said, because many people cannot recall which number they provided originally and there is no easy way for voters to check.
Harris County, which includes Houston, had rejected 409 out of 1,373 applications as of last Friday for ID problems, including 309 missing ID numbers and 173 with numbers that did not match those on file, according to Leah Shah, a spokesperson for the county elections office.
In Bexar County, home to San Antonio, officials had processed more than 300 rejections through last week out of some 1,200 applications, elections administrator Jacquelyn Callanen said in a phone interview. Around 80% of those were due to the new ID requirements.
Other provisions in the law are also creating obstacles, she said. The office previously added a sticker with voters' addresses to applications that were mailed out to save them a step, but that is no longer permitted, Callanen said.
The law also prohibits residents from obtaining applications for other people, including relatives. Callanen said her office regularly receives messages from senior citizens asking for ballots for themselves and their spouses; under the law, spouses must make their own separate requests.
""It's sort of thwarting us at every turn,"" she said.
Mail ballots in Texas are already sharply limited to a handful of categories, including residents 65 years and older, disabled residents or voters who will be absent from their county during early voting and Election Day.
DeBeauvoir said Secretary of State John Scott's office had failed to give local officials enough guidance on how to help voters cure any defects.

In response, Sam Taylor, a spokesperson for Scott's office, said state officials reached out to Travis County last week to advise staff on the proper process and noted that the county's own estimated rejection rate went down from 50% to 27% following that guidance.
He said clerks have been instructed to accept applications in which voters have included both their license and Social Security number, as long as one of them matches what is on file.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has lamented that her office has been unable to gain access to the western Chinese region to probe allegations of rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups. 
Her office said in December that it was finalizing a report on the situation in Xinjiang that it hoped to publish in the coming weeks after long-running talks with Chinese officials on a proposed visit had yielded no progress.
Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative James McGovern, two Democrats who respectively chair and co-chair the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote a public letter to Bachelet asking her to issue the report before the ""international spectacle"" of the Beijing Games begins on Feb. 4. 
""Its publication would send an important reminder that no country can evade international scrutiny for engaging in serious human rights abuses,"" Merkley and McGovern said. 
Bachelet's office did not respond immediately to a Reuters question asking when the report would be released. 
Bachelet had been negotiating the terms of a Xinjiang visit since September 2018, as allegations were emerging that some one million Uyghurs had been held in mass detention camps.

China denies wrongdoing in Xinjiang, and says the camps are for vocational training and to stem religious extremism. 
The United States and many of its allies, including Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan and Denmark, have said they will not send official diplomatic delegations to the Games in protest of China's rights record.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Tuesday unveiled a 10-year plan to treat and maintain millions of additional acres of forests in the western United States to reduce the severity of seasonal wildfires.
“We’re not going to stop fires,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said at a press event in Arizona alongside Forest Service chief Randy Moore. “But what we can do is begin the process of reducing the catastrophic nature of those fires.”
The plan, called the “wildfire crisis strategy,” aims to make some 50 million acres (20 million hectares) of forests healthier and more resilient to fires through treatments like thinning, pruning, and prescribed burning, they said. 
Wildfire seasons have worsened in the United States in recent years after decades of federal policy to immediately extinguish wildfires instead of letting some of them burn on in a controlled fashion, leading to a buildup of flammable brush, a report on the plan said. 
Climate change has also led to hotter, drier conditions in the American West, making fires more common and brush more flammable. 
The U.S. Forest Service has historically treated up to 2 million acres in the western United States annually, the report said. 
Under the new plan, the Forest Service, along with the Department of the Interior and other partners, will treat up to 20 million additional acres of National Forest System land and up to 30 million additional acres of other federal, state, tribal, and private land in the western United States over the next 10 years.
The priority will be parts of Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington state most at risk of wildfires. 

The effort, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, will get underway with nearly $3 billion in funds from the infrastructure law. But it will require an additional $50 billion over time in order to meet the 50 million-acre target, a USDA official said.
A record 2020 wildfire season burned more than 10 million acres in the United States, about half of which was Forest Service land. The Forest Service is part of the USDA.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The family of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and their supporters, some shouting, “Hey Hey! Ho Ho! Voter suppression has got to go,” marched in Washington on Monday urging passage of a law to protect voters from racial discrimination.
As part of the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day D.C. Peace Walk, the King family and more than 100 national and local civil rights groups strode across the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge calling on President Joe Biden's Democrats to pass a bill in the U.S. Senate.
The march followed a disappointing week for Biden, who went to the Capitol to urge Senate colleagues to change filibuster rules so they could overcome Republican opposition to the bill, only to be forcefully rejected by two conservative Democrats who effectively hold veto power in the evenly split chamber.
In a separate speech livestreamed to the late Rev. King's Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Vice President Kamala Harris also urged the Senate to act, warning that efforts to restrict voting in some U.S. states could make it more difficult for millions of Americans to vote. 
""We must not be complacent or complicit,"" Harris said. ""We must not give up, and we must not give in. To truly honor the legacy of the man we celebrate today, we must continue to fight for the freedom to vote, for freedom for all.""
At a rally before Monday's March, King's son, Martin Luther King III, praised Democrats for passing a sweeping infrastructure bill last year, but implored them to push through voting-rights legislation.
""You were successful with infrastructure, which was a great thing,"" King said to a crowd of hundreds, ""but we need you to use that same energy to ensure that all Americans have the unencumbered right to vote.""
King III, his wife, Arndrea Waters (NYSE:WAT) King, and their daughter Yolanda Renee King, led the march across the bridge.
“We need to make sure that everyone in this country can get to the polls, vote, and have their vote heard,” said Lisa Meunier, 53, of Washington, who joined the marchers. 
The bill before the Senate would expand access to mail-in voting, strengthen federal oversight of elections in states with a history of racial discrimination and tighten campaign finance rules. Democratic supporters argue it is needed to counter a wave of new restrictions on voting passed in Republican-led states that election observers say would make it harder for minority and low-income voters to cast ballots.
New restrictions have emerged following former President Donald Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
'HISTORY WILL REMEMBER'
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has said the chamber would take up the bill on Tuesday, a delay from his earlier plan to hold a procedural vote on the bill by Monday, the federal holiday honoring King.
Republicans, who hold half the 100 seats in the Senate, are united in opposition to the bill, which they brand a partisan power grab. That leaves Biden and Schumer just one path to passing it: persuading conservative Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to agree to change the chamber's filibuster rule that requires at least 60 senators to agree on most legislation.
Yolanda Renee King addressed comments to the two holdout senators after the march.
""Senator Sinema, Senator Manchin, our future hinges on your decision, and history will remember what choice you make,"" she said.
Some civil rights groups in Georgia that helped propel Biden to presidential victory during the 2020 election boycotted his voting rights speech in Atlanta last week, saying they were disappointed by Biden's lack of action.
""Black voters risked everything – including their own health at the height of the pandemic – to vote Biden and Senate Democrats into office,"" wrote Cliff Albright and LaTosha Brown, co-founders of Black Voters Matter in a response to Biden's speech.
""It's time that officials in Washington treat us and our rights with the same level urgency."" 
Should these groups lose their enthusiasm for Democrats, it could increase the party's chances of losing their razor-thin majorities in at least one chamber of Congress in the Nov. 8, 2022, election.

Yolanda Townsend, who called herself a “senior” from the Washington, D.C., area, said at Monday's rally that she had found Biden's Georgia speech timely and forceful. 
“I wish it was drawn earlier, but I think a line in the sand has been drawn and you’re either with us or against us,"" Townsend said.

(Reuters) - A leader of the right-wing Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, was released from jail on Friday after serving four months and a week for burning a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic African American church in Washington in December 2020.
Tarrio was among a group of Proud Boys who stole the banner during a demonstration in Washington on Dec. 12, 2020. Tarrio then set it on fire, according to comments he made afterward. He pled guilty in July, was sentenced in August and began serving his jail sentence in September.
Tarrio did not take part in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. He was arrested when he arrived in Washington two days before the failed bid to prevent Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election win over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.

The FBI has said his January 2021 arrest was to try to pre-empt the events of Jan. 6 when several other members of the Proud Boys were taken into custody.
Those members of the right-wing group face charges including obstruction of law enforcement, destruction of government property and conspiracy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. midterm elections are some 10 months away, but President Joe Biden's administration and allies already foresee a possible scenario in which Republicans take the House of Representatives, the Senate, or both, and launch a series of investigations and attempts to impeach the president.
Lawmakers, congressional staffers and strategists predict a slew of investigations targeting the Biden administration, particularly if Republicans loyal to former President Donald Trump gain important committee seats in Congress.
Those seeking to pursue investigations include House Republicans Matt Gaetz, who pledged in a podcast to target the Department of Justice until ""sphincters tighten,"" Bob Gibbs, who has been pushing to impeach Biden since September over the Afghanistan pullout, and James Comer, a hopeful to become head of the House Oversight Committee. 
Comer's targets include the president's son Hunter Biden, the administration's handling of supply chain issues and vaccine mandates, and its removal of Trump military academy appointees, his office said. 
The White House has already taken small steps that will help shield the administration from aggressive probes.
It hired a special advisor, former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, to oversee implementation of the $1 trillion infrastructure law, which Republicans would likely scrutinize in search of fraud. 
The White House also bolstered the legal counsel's office with a longtime Democratic communications official to help with fallout from the chaotic U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. 
Biden's transition team after his 2020 election win formed the White House counsel's office in anticipation of Republicans winning the Senate and pursuing investigations, one team member said. 
The January 2021 runoff elections in Georgia left control of the body to Democrats instead but the counsel's office still has that legal firepower.
""We had every reason to believe that it was going to be a Republican Senate,"" said Andy Wright, director of legal policy for the transition team. ""That was built in to the original planning.""
That planning included having Jonathan Su, who has experience handling investigations in the Obama White House years, serve as Biden's deputy counsel.
The Biden White House may hire new researchers, lawyers and communications officials to focus on the probes, strategists said.
Ben LaBolt, a former Obama spokesman, said the Clinton and Obama White Houses assembled teams of roughly the same size and expertise as congressional committees pursuing investigations. 
“You need to have a parallel structure at the White House that's capable of anticipating those attacks, responding to those attacks,” he said. 
Biden plans to travel to states with key political races this year, an adviser said, and the White House hopes Democrats will maintain majorities in Congress on the back of its COVID-19 vaccination rollout and legislative achievements. 
The Democratic National Committee is expected to spend heavily in contested races in states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that will also be important in 2024.
If the Republicans do win in November, they are ""going to run the same play they did in 2011 but it will be even more unhinged and less credible,"" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama who was brought in as a spokesman in the Obama White House to deal with investigations then. 
""They’ll subpoena everything under the sun,"" said Richard Painter, former associate counsel under Republican President George W. Bush.
Among the issues, Republicans could look into the Justice Department's investigation of the deadly Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and thwart the congressional investigation into the attack if it is still ongoing.
“We are going to go after this administrative state, and we are going to start at the Department of Justice and the FBI,” Gaetz said, referring to Jan 6. 
Outlays from the COVID-19-related $1.9 trillion ""American Rescue Plan"" and the infrastructure law, both unpopular with Republicans despite some bipartisan support for the latter, also would likely be scrutinized. 
""There’s no doubt Republican lawmakers are going to pour over documents and all this spending will see unprecedented scrutiny,” said Amy Koch, a Republican strategist in Minnesota who helps state and federal candidates get elected.
IMPEACHMENT AND HUNTER BIDEN 
Some Republicans have already signaled an appetite for impeaching Biden, with a group of four led by Gibbs filing articles of impeachment over immigration on the U.S. border with Mexico and for the way U.S. troops were removed from Afghanistan.
Gibbs is joined by House Republicans Andy Biggs, Brian Babin and Randy Weber. Separately Marjorie Taylor Greene, a pro-Trump firebrand, filed articles of impeachment the day after Biden was sworn into office.
""There will be a lot of pressure on Kevin McCarthy, if he’s speaker, to pursue impeachment of Biden from day one. He may not have much of a choice if he wants to retain the title,” a Republican congressional staffer with ties to leadership said.
McCarthy is in line to succeed Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi if Republicans take over control of the chamber.
During the 2020 election, Biden's son, Hunter, became a target of Trump and Republicans, who alleged wrong-doing when he served on the board of a Ukraine energy company. A Ukraine review found no evidence.

“There will be a lot of this Hunter stuff, and a lot of it is going to be unfair to Biden, and a lot of it is going to be personal,” Painter predicted.
House Democrats twice impeached Trump, once over Ukraine and again for his actions ahead of the Jan. 6 riot, but he was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate both times.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden traveled to Philadelphia on Sunday to honor the legacy of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as he continues to press for voting rights legislation and concerted action to combat rising extremism.
Biden's visit to the ""City of Brotherly Love"" comes hours after an FBI hostage rescue team https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-colleyville-texas-involved-standoff-synagogue-media-2022-01-15 stormed a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, to free three hostages after a more than 10-hour standoff. Another hostage had been freed earlier.
The president, who was briefed on the crisis as it unfolded, said there was more to learn about what motivated the hostage-taker, but pledged to ""stand against anti-Semitism and against the rise of extremism in this country.""
Biden and first lady Jill Biden are volunteering at Philabundance, a hunger relief organization in Philadelphia, to mark Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. 
In a proclamation on Friday, Biden warned against complacency and said it was crucial to continue King's work by enacting legislation to protect voting rights, opposing the rise of white supremacism and other forms of extremism, and pressing for greater economic justice.
""Living up to his legacy, and what Dr. King believed our Nation could become, requires more than just reflection -- it requires action,"" Biden said in the proclamation.
""That is why the Congress must pass Federal legislation to protect the right to vote -- a right that is under attack by a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion.  We must confront the scourge of racism and white supremacy -- a stain on our Nation -- and give hate no safe harbor in America.""
But Biden's push to enact voting rights legislation appears doomed after Democratic Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin said they opposed changing the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires that 60 of the 100 senators agree on most legislation, in a chamber where Democrats now hold only 50 seats. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer still plans to begin debate on the voting rights legislation on Tuesday. If Republicans block that bill as anticipated, Schumer said he was still prepared to seek a change in the Senate's filibuster rule to win passage. But given Sinema and Manchin's stance, efforts to change the filibuster appear doomed to fail.
Biden told reporters on Thursday he was not certain the bill could pass now but vowed to keep trying.

""One thing for certain: Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time, we can come back and try it a second time. We missed this time.""
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a voting bill on Thursday. But Democrats cannot overcome universal Republican opposition in the Senate without changing the filibuster.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's attempt to rally Democrats on Thursday to alter Senate rules and pass voting-rights legislation was stymied, even before he arrived at the U.S. Capitol, by opposition from a key moderate lawmaker.
U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said in a speech https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-sinema-defends-filibuster-despite-bidens-plea-reform-it-2022-01-13 on the Senate floor on Thursday - less than an hour before Biden's lunchtime arrival - that the ""filibuster rule"" that allows a minority of senators to block legislation was necessary to prevent worsening political divisions in the country.
After Biden left the Capitol following his meeting with Democrats, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin joined Sinema in opposing Senate rule changes.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer nonetheless announced late on Thursday that the Senate will begin debate on the legislation next Tuesday. If Republicans block that bill as anticipated, Schumer said he was prepared to seek a change in the Senate's filibuster rule to win passage.
While officials were not anticipating any quick breakthroughs, Biden continued pressing his case with Sinema and Manchin into the evening. The two senators met Biden at the White House for a meeting that lasted well over an hour, the administration said.
None of the participants spoke to media afterwards. A White House official characterized the meeting as a ""candid and respectful exchange of views.""
Earlier, when he left the Capitol, the president acknowledged his party may not succeed in getting a voting rights bill passed. 
""I hope we can get this done, but I'm not sure,"" Biden told reporters. ""One thing for certain: Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time, we can come back and try it a second time. We missed this time.""
Biden and many fellow Democrats have ratcheted up their campaign to pass voting-rights https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-champion-voting-rights-georgia-clock-ticks-reforms-2022-01-11 legislation after spending much of his first year in office on infrastructure and spending bills focused on COVID-19 relief, infrastructure and social safety-net programs.
They are pushing new legislation that they say would protect access to the ballot, particularly for minority voters, as Republican-controlled states enact new restrictions ahead of Nov. 8 congressional elections.
Non-white voters disproportionately support Democratic candidates for office.

Democrats hold 50 seats.
""I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division in our country,"" Sinema said on the Senate floor.
Sinema and Manchin voted https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/deal-avert-us-default-raise-debt-limit-faces-test-senate-2021-12-09 in December to side-step the 60-vote threshold to raise the nation's debt limit without Republican support.
'DIFFICULT' PATH
Independent Senator Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, said he thought Biden made a powerful case when he met with lawmakers. 
""It looks like the path forward is very difficult, particularly based on Senator Sinema's statement today,"" he said. ""She believes that the risk of changing the filibuster is greater than the risk of what's going on in the states. I hope profoundly that she's right. I fear that she's wrong."" 
The House repackaged and passed two elections-related bills as one, sending it to the Senate under a special procedure preventing Republicans from blocking debate. The bill was approved along party lines.
""Make no mistake, the United States Senate will for the first time this Congress debate voting rights legislation beginning on Tuesday,"" Schumer said late on Thursday. Three separate attempts to debate the legislation last year were stymied by Republicans.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate's minority leader, on Wednesday reiterated that Republicans oppose Democrats' voting-rights legislation and changes to the filibuster.

Democratic former President Barack Obama wrote in a USA Today opinion piece on Thursday that the filibuster rule has become a tool for the chamber's minority to obstruct moves supported by most voters. 
""We can't allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy,"" Obama wrote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday blocked President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccination-or-testing mandate for large businesses - a policy the conservative justices deemed an improper imposition on the lives and health of many Americans - while endorsing a separate federal vaccine requirement for healthcare facilities.
Biden voiced disappointment with the conservative-majority court's decision to halt his administration's rule requiring vaccines or weekly COVID-19 tests for employees at businesses with at least 100 employees. Biden said it now is up to states and employers to decide whether to require workers ""to take the simple and effective step of getting vaccinated.""
The court was divided in both cases, centering on pandemic-related federal regulations at a time of escalating coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant in a nation that leads the world with more than 845,000 COVID-19 deaths. 
It ruled 6-3, with the six conservative justices in the majority and three liberal justices dissenting, in blocking the rule involving large businesses - a policy that applied to more than 80 million employees. The court's majority downplayed the risk COVID-19 specifically poses in the workplace, comparing it instead to ""day-to-day"" crime and pollution hazards that individuals face everywhere.
The vote was 5-4 to allow the healthcare worker rule, which requires vaccination for about 10.3 million workers at 76,000 healthcare facilities including hospitals and nursing homes that accept money from the Medicare and Medicaid government health insurance programs for elderly, disabled and low-income Americans. Two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined the liberals in the majority in that case.
In a statement, Biden said the court's decision allowing the healthcare worker mandate ""will save lives"" and his administration will enforce it. Workers must be vaccinated by the end of February.
The court heard arguments last Friday in the legal fight over temporary mandates issued in November by two federal agencies aimed at increasing U.S. vaccination rates and making workplaces and healthcare settings safer. The cases tested presidential powers to address a swelling public health crisis.
In an unsigned ruling, the court said the rule affecting large businesses, issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was not an ordinary use of federal power.
""It is instead a significant encroachment on the lives - and health - of a vast number of employees,"" the court said.
""Permitting OSHA to regulate the hazards of daily life -simply because most Americans have jobs and face those same risks while on the clock - would significantly expand OSHA's regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization,"" the court added.
Challengers led by the state of Ohio and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which represents employers, asked the justices to block OSHA's rule after a lower court lifted an injunction against it. Companies were supposed to start showing they were in compliance starting this past Monday.
In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote on behalf of the liberal justices that the decision ""stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that COVID-19 poses to our nation's workers.""
'WELCOME RELIEF'
""Today's decision is welcome relief for America's small businesses, who are still trying to get their business back on track since the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Karen Harned, executive director of the NFIB's legal arm.
The high court blocked a Dec. 17 decision by the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had allowed the mandate to go into effect.
In the healthcare facilities case, the court's differently comprised majority concluded that the regulation ""fits neatly"" within the power Congress conferred on the government to impose conditions on Medicaid and Medicare funds, which includes policies that protect health and safety.
""After all, ensuring that providers take steps to avoid transmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm,"" the court said.
Four conservative justices dissented from the healthcare facility decision, concluding that Congress had not given the federal agency the authority to require vaccinations for millions of healthcare workers. In one dissent, Justice Samuel Alito doubted that the agency can ""put more than 10 million healthcare workers to the choice of their jobs or an irreversible medical treatment.""
The justices lifted orders by federal judges in Missouri and Louisiana blocking the policy in 24 states, allowing the administration to enforce it nearly nationwide. Enforcement was blocked in Texas by a lower court in separate litigation not at issue before the Supreme Court.

Gerald Harmon, president of the American Medical Association physicians group, said that although he is pleased the court allowed the healthcare worker mandate, the broader workplace rule is also needed.
""Workplace transmission has been a major factor in the spread of COVID-19,"" Harmon added. ""Now more than ever, workers in all settings across the country need commonsense, evidence-based protections against COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, Stewart Rhodes, and 10 alleged members of the group with seditious conspiracy for their role in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
They said Rhodes had warned his group to prepare for a ""bloody and desperate fight"" in the days leading up to the assault, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying his election defeat.
This is the first time alleged participants in the attack have been charged with seditious conspiracy, which is defined as attempting ""to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States.""
""We are going to have a fight,"" prosecutors said Rhodes told his allies on the messaging app Signal. ""That can't be avoided.""
The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, and focus on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.
Nine of the eleven charged with seditious conspiracy were already facing other charges relating to the Capitol attack. Members of the far-right Proud Boys and Three Percenters have also been charged with taking part in the attack.
ATTEMPT TO STOP TRANSFER OF POWER
The indictment says Rhodes started sending messages to his followers in November 2020, the month of Trump's election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, encouraging them to ""oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power."" 
After his defeat, Trump repeatedly made false claims that his loss was a result of widespread fraud. He repeated those claims in a fiery speech near the White House before thousands of his followers stormed the Capitol in the worst attack on the seat of Congress since the War of 1812.
Prosecutors said that beginning in late December 2020, Rhodes used private encrypted communications to plan to travel to Washington on Jan. 6. He and others planned to bring weapons to help support the operation, prosecutors said.
While some of the Oath Keeper members rushed inside the building wearing tactical gear, others remained outside in what they deemed ""quick-response force"" teams, which were prepared to rapidly transport arms into the city, prosecutors said. 
Jon Moseley, an attorney for Rhodes, told Reuters he was on the phone with Rhodes to discuss his planned appearance before the House Select Committee on Jan. 6 when the FBI called.
""He patched me in on the call and I identified myself as his lawyer,"" Moseley said in an e-mail. The agent then told him they were outside Rhodes' home in Granbury, Texas, and were there to arrest him. 
The indictment alleges that Thomas Caldwell, who was previously charged, and Edward Vallejo of Arizona, a new defendant, were in charge of coordinating the quick-response force teams.
Seditious conspiracy is a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. 
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland last week vowed to hold accountable anyone involved in the attack on the Capitol. The department has charged more than 725 people with crimes arising from the attack. Of those people, about 165 have pleaded guilty and at least 70 have been sentenced. Garland said the Justice Department would ""follow the facts wherever they lead.""
On the day of the attack, four people died. One of them, Ashli Babbitt, was shot dead by Capitol Police while trying to break into the Speaker's Gallery. Three others died of natural causes.
The following day, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died. Although he had been sprayed with a chemical irritant the day of the attack, it was later determined he died of natural causes. Around 140 police officers were injured, and four police officers later died by suicide.
The Justice Department has previously obtained seditious conspiracy convictions against Puerto Rican nationalists and alleged Islamist militants including Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the radical Islamic clergyman known as the ""Blind Sheikh.""

Seditious conspiracy charges featured prominently in a case federal authorities brought in 1987 against leaders and members of a neo-Nazi group known as The Order. Fourteen alleged members or supporters were indicted, with 10 facing seditious conspiracy counts.
After a two-month trial, a jury acquitted all defendants.

(Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol asked House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday to voluntarily answer questions about Donald Trump's actions on the day of the riot.
In a letter https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-12.BGT%20Letter%20to%20McCarthy.pdf to McCarthy released publicly, the House of Representatives Select Committee requested he sit for an interview in early February. 
McCarthy later issued a written statement saying he would not cooperate with what he described as an ""illegitimate"" committee.""As a representative and the leader of the minority party, it is with neither regret nor satisfaction that I have concluded to not participate with this select committee’s abuse of power that stains this institution today and will harm it going forward,"" McCarthy said in the statement.
The committee is trying to establish Trump's actions while thousands of his supporters attacked police, vandalized the Capitol and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives.
The committee met virtually with Trump's former White House spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the meeting.
""We also must learn about how the President's plans for Jan. 6 came together, and all the other ways he attempted to alter the results of the election,"" the Select Committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said in the letter to McCarthy. 
The committee is also investigating whether Trump suggested to McCarthy what he should say publicly and to investigators about their conversations on the day of the attack, according to the letter.
McCarthy and Trump met on Jan. 28, 2021, in Palm Beach, Florida.
The panel had previously asked another Trump ally in Congress, Representative Jim Jordan, to disclose conversations he had with Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. Jordan said on Sunday he would not cooperate with the committee's investigating, also calling it illegitimate.
Two Republicans, Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are members of the committee.
Thompson has said the panel is looking into whether it has the authority to issue subpoenas to congressional Republicans to force their cooperation.
The Select Committee has interviewed more than 340 witnesses and issued dozens of subpoenas as it investigates the storming of the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters as lawmakers were certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.
The committee is aiming to release an interim report in the summer and a final report in the fall, a source familiar with the investigation said last month.

The committee's members have said they will consider passing along evidence of criminal conduct by Trump to the U.S. Justice Department. Such a move, known as a criminal referral, would be largely symbolic but would increase the political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge the former president.
One police officer who battled rioters died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later committed suicide. Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell on Wednesday blasted President Joe Biden's push for a voting-rights bill, underscoring the difficulty Biden's Democrats face in trying to steer legislation through a Congress they narrowly control.
Biden has called for Democrats to jettison the chamber's longstanding ""filibuster https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-senate-democrats-mull-ending-filibuster-pass-voting-rights-reform-2022-01-11"" rule requiring 60 of the 100 senators to agree to advance most legislation, a move that McConnell said would irreparably damage the Senate.
""The president's rant yesterday was incoherent, incorrect and beneath his office,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor, referring to Biden's speech in Atlanta on Tuesday in which he appealed for voting-rights legislation and called Republicans cowardly for not supporting it. 
McConnell accused the president of giving ""a deliberately divisive speech that was designed to pull our country further apart.""
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the administration was disappointed by McConnell's opposition to the bill.
""It is even more disappointing that someone who has supported and advocated for voting rights in the past ... is on the other side of this argument now,"" Psaki said.
Biden plans to make a personal plea to Senate Democrats on Thursday, urging them to agree on changing or eliminating the filibuster so they can pass the voting rights bill.
Former President Donald Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud inspired a wave of new restrictions on voting in Republican-controlled states last year.
Democrats see their voting rights bills as a last chance to counter those ahead of the Nov. 8 elections, when they run the risk of losing their razor-thin majorities in at least one chamber of Congress.
Since Trump's defeat, Republican lawmakers in 19 states have passed dozens of laws making it harder to vote. Critics say these measures target minorities, who vote in greater proportions for Democrats.
The Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act together would make Election Day a holiday, expand access to mail-in voting and strengthen U.S. Justice Department oversight of local election jurisdictions with a history of discrimination.
""Twelve months ago the president said that politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,"" McConnell said. ""But yesterday he poured a giant can of gasoline on the fire.""
Republicans argue that the bills Democrats are proposing are an infringement of states' rights to run their elections. They come as Trump supporters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fundraising-surges-races-us-election-oversight-roles-report-says-2022-01-12 who have embraced his false claims of election fraud are running for offices that could give them oversight over local elections. Democrats and election analysts have raised concerns that they could use those posts to influence https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22 election outcomes.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday outlined a strategy to ensure a Senate floor debate on voting rights, after three separate attempts last year were stymied by Republicans.
Under the plan, outlined in a Schumer memo to fellow Democrats that was seen by Reuters, the House of Representatives will soon repackage two election-related bills into one and pass it. It would then go to the Senate under a special procedure preventing Republicans from blocking debate.
""We will finally have an opportunity to debate voting rights legislation – something that Republicans have thus far denied,"" Schumer wrote in the memo.
But if Republicans remain united in opposition, even that bill will not pass the Senate unless all Democrats agree to change the filibuster, he said. 
Centrist Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are opposed to the idea, saying it would cause turmoil with every change of control in Washington.
Schumer has set a deadline for a vote on the election reforms by the Jan. 17 holiday honoring the slain civil rights hero Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
EROSION OF FILIBUSTER
For at least a decade, worries about atrophy in the Senate have led to calls for revising or scrapping the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block bills.
In 2013, Democrats, fed up with then-President Barack Obama's nominees languishing amid Republican filibusters, scrapped the 60-vote majority needed to confirm most federal judges and administration appointees. Four years later, Republicans ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, clearing the way for Trump to install three conservative justices during his presidency.

That 6-3 conservative court has agreed to take up major cases this year on the hot-button issues of abortion and guns that could dramatically change American life.
Biden had previously opposed changing the filibuster rule but more recently has argued that voting rights reforms were urgently needed even if it meant weakening that procedure.

(Reuters) - Senate Republicans on Wednesday criticized the White House for failing to sufficiently consult two Tennessee GOP senators about President Joe Biden's nomination of a lawyer from their state to sit on a federal appellate court over their objections.
Andre Mathis, a Memphis lawyer at the law firm Butler Snow, was the first Biden appellate pick to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee who lacked his home state senators' support, creating a test for the president's push to rapidly seat judges.
Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee called it ""insulting"" that the White House did not meaningfully consult her or fellow Senator Bill Hagerty about Mathis and that they did not even receive so-called ""blue slips"" to express their views on him.
Committee Chair Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, conceded it was a mistake that the Tennessee senators did not receive those blue forms, which home-state senators historically needed to return for a nominee to be considered.
But Durbin said even if they had returned blue slips against Mathis, who is Black, it would not have mattered as Democrats are following a policy adopted by Republicans during the Trump administration of not heeding them for circuit nominees.
That helped former Republican President Donald Trump to secure the confirmation of 54 circuit court nominees during his four years, including many conservative judges who were appointed over the objections of home-state Democrats.
""My colleagues across the aisle I think would be hard pressed now to demand that Democrats reinstate this practice,"" Durbin said.
Blackburn said she had ""serious concerns"" about Mathis' experience and, with Hagerty, had identified an alternative pick, Camille McMullen, a Democratic appointee to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals who is also Black and is nearly a decade older than the 41-year-old Mathis.
She also said Mathis had a ""rap sheet with a laundry list of citations"" with speeding tickets that led to his driver's license being suspended three times from 2008 to 2011 for failure to pay or appear in court.
Mathis expressed regret about the tickets, which he forgot to pay. ""I can assure the committee I'm a law abiding citizen,"" he said. 

While GOP senators grumbled about their Tennessee colleagues' frustrations, Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana acknowledged that reviving the blue slips process now ""would be perceived unfair to this administration."" 
He urged both sides to find a neutral way to revive the practice, which Durbin said was possible after the 2024 presidential election and ""four years of trying to balance the books.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday made a full-throated appeal for U.S. voting rights legislation stalled in Congress, saying Democratic lawmakers should rewrite Senate rules to overcome Republican opposition.
In a speech designed to breathe life into the fight to pass federal voting laws and convince skeptical Democrats of his commitment, Biden called many Republicans cowardly and committed to changing the U.S. Senate ""filibuster"" to pass legislation.
Calling it a ""battle for the soul of America,"" the Democratic president put the voting rights effort on par with the fight against segregation by slain civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Former President Donald Trump maintains the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats through voter fraud, despite investigations' finding no supporting evidence. Since then, Republican lawmakers in 19 states have passed dozens of laws making it harder to vote. Critics say these measures target minorities, who vote in greater proportions for Democrats.
Biden on Tuesday said Republicans must choose which side of history they want to be on, as he contrasted civil rights heroes with the country's most ardent white supremacists.
""Do you want to be on the side of Martin Luther King or George Wallace?"" Biden asked, referring to the segregationist former Alabama governor. 
His tone echoed remarks on the one-year anniversary of the attacks on the U.S. Capitol, reflecting a new White House calculus after a year focused on working with Republicans. Supporters of Trump were attempting ""a coup"" on Jan. 6, 2021, Biden said Tuesday.
""Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America's right to vote,"" Biden said. ""Not one.""
Before Biden spoke, there was a moment of solemnity as he and Vice President Kamala Harris stood before King's gravesite, with King's family standing nearby, heads bowed. Biden and Harris later spoke on the shared campus of Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, two historically Black schools.
Jesiah Osbourne, 21, a senior at Morehouse who gives Biden mixed reviews overall, said he credits the president for pushing for a cornerstone civil right even in the absence of a clear legislative path. ""It's not going to happen overnight,"" he said. ""There's no unity.""
Many activists say Biden should have done more during his first year in office to push for reforms, and some, including Georgia's Stacey Abrams, did not attend his speech.
Biden told reporters on Tuesday that he spoke to Abrams, and despite a schedule mix-up, they are ""on the same page.""
""The President deeply understands that Congress must pass"" the voting-rights bills ""by whatever legislative means necessary,"" said Abrams, a Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia.
FILIBUSTER CARVE-OUT 
Biden wants to build public support for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The bills would make Election Day a holiday, register new voters and strengthen U.S. Justice Department oversight of local election jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. 
Both bills have languished in the Senate under united opposition from Republicans, who argue they would impose questionable national standards on local elections.
Biden said if no breakthrough on the legislation can be achieved, lawmakers in the Senate should ""change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.""
The filibuster is a parliamentary maneuver effectively requiring a 60-vote majority in the Senate for passage of most bills, instead of a simple majority. 
""Sadly, the United States Senate, designed to be the greatest deliberative body, has been rendered a shell of its former self,"" Biden said. 
Republicans criticized Biden's proposal as overreach.
""What the Democrats have coined a 'voting rights' bill is really just a partisan, political power grab. And now they want to eliminate the filibuster in order to advance this terrible legislation, which would only compound confusion in our election process,"" Senator Mike Crapo said after Biden's speech. 
It was Biden's most direct plea to date for the Senate to change its rules. Democrats, with only narrow control of the chamber, do not currently have the votes for such a maneuver. 
Biden said he had had quiet conversations with lawmakers about the legislation in recent months, but ""I'm tired of being quiet.""
Newly passed laws in Republican states could impact as many as 55 million Americans, the White House said.

Georgia was a battleground state in the 2020 election, and Democrats won two crucial U.S. Senate seats there that gave them effective control of the chamber. Last year, the Republican-led state legislature approved sweeping voting restrictions 4. The Justice Department sued, saying the law infringes the rights of Black voters.
Democrats are girding themselves for tough 2022 congressional elections that could strip them of their majority and the chance to change federal voting laws.

NBC News said the girlfriend, whose name was withheld, and her lawyer were seen entering a federal courthouse in Orlando, Florida, but that the lawyer, Tim Jansen, declined to comment. 
CNN also reported that the woman, a former congressional staffer, entered the courthouse where people familiar with the case said the grand jury has been meeting. 
Representatives for the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on the report. 
Gaetz has not been charged with any crimes and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
""We have seen no credible basis for a charge against Congressman Gaetz. We remain steadfast in our commitment to challenge any allegations with the facts and law,"" one of his lawyers, Isabelle Kirshner, told Reuters in a statement. 
Wednesday's move could represent a significant development in the more than yearlong sex crimes investigation involving the Florida congressman that has roiled state politics.
Gaetz is being investigated for three crimes: sex trafficking of a 17-year-old; violating a federal law that prohibits moving women across state lines for prostitution; and obstructing justice, NBC reported, citing unnamed legal sources familiar with the case. 

Last year, a former Florida official central to the U.S. probe agreed to cooperate https://www.reuters.com/world/us/friend-embattled-us-rep-matt-gaetz-plead-guilty-sex-trafficking-2021-05-17 with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to six charges, including sex trafficking of a minor. A lawyer for Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Florida's Seminole County, at the time suggested his client would implicate Gaetz. 
Gaetz, currently serving his third two-year term in the U.S. House of Representatives, is one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress, with the former president praising him at a Florida rally https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-hosts-campaign-style-rally-florida-he-aims-retain-republican-spotlight-2021-07-03 last summer as a warrior fighting on his behalf.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a bill to impose sweeping sanctions on top Russian government and military officials, including President Vladimir Putin, and key banking institutions if Moscow engages in hostilities against Ukraine. 
The proposed legislation, backed by the White House, includes provisions to help bolster Ukraine’s security and encourages the United States to ""consider all available and appropriate measures"" to ensure the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - a ""tool of malign influence of the Russian Federation"" - does not become operational.
""This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,"" Senator Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who unveiled the bill, said in a statement. 
Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border and Washington is trying to dissuade Moscow from re-invading the country.
The bill, first reported by the Washington Post, would also target companies in Russia that offer secure messaging systems, such as SWIFT, which banks use to exchange key information with other financial institutions.
More than two dozen Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have endorsed the bill, a Menendez spokesperson said.
The bill would ""trigger severe costs to Russia's economy"" if Russia goes ahead with an invasion, a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said. 
Other legislation, such as a bill sponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, will ""not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,"" the NSC spokesperson said.
Cruz struck a deal with Schumer last month, in which the Texas senator released his hold on dozens of President Joe Biden's ambassadorial nominees. Cruz's bill will be put to a vote this week, but it requires 60 votes to pass, a high hurdle in the evenly divided Senate. 
The Menendez-backed bill provides an alternative for Democrats who support sanctions on the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is completed but waiting approvals from Germany, and makes it harder for Cruz's bill to pass.
Many Democrats have supported sanctions on the pipeline as it would bypass Ukraine, depriving the country of transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle against Russia. 
Cruz's bill would slap sanctions on the pipeline within 15 days of passage, regardless of whether Russia reinvades Ukraine, and would allow Congress to vote to reinstate sanctions should the president waive them. Cruz has said sanctions are needed immediately to stop the project.
THREAT TO EUROPE
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy believes sanctions should be imposed immediately on the pipeline even if Russia does not invade, as its operation poses a ""material security and economic threat to Europe,"" a person close to him said. ""Kyiv is vehemently opposed to any policy that allows Russia to use invasion threats to get what it wants in other areas,"" said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Biden has described the pipeline as a bad deal for Europe and said it would increase Russia's influence there. But his administration last year waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company controlling the project, as the White House sought to repair relations with Germany.
A senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday that the threat of stopping the project is leverage that Germany holds over Russia. 
""If sanctions are imposed right now, and Russia views these sanctions as a sunk cost, then this would be one less consideration in its calculus,"" the official said. ""The deterrent potential of sanctions or shutting down the pipeline would be lost.""
Washington is looking at a range of contingency options to help Ukraine should Russia cut off energy supplies, another senior Biden administration official said.

The pipeline, backed by Russia's state gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would provide fuel to Germany, Europe's largest economy, which is shutting coal and nuclear plants, and other European countries.
Several Democratic senators said late on Monday, after meeting with Biden administration officials, that they believe the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 proposed by Cruz could harm relations with Germany, an important U.S. ally, especially on policy toward Russia, Iran and climate change.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Campaign donations are surging to candidates for U.S. election oversight roles, a report released on Wednesday found, in a sign of how former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud are raising the stakes in this year's November elections.
Candidates for the previously low-profile secretary of state positions in swing states -- a role that holds substantial power in determining how votes are certified -- are smashing fundraising totals from previous recent election cycles, according to the report https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/financing-races-offices-oversee-elections-january-2022 by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
At least 10 Republicans running for secretary of state in five presidential battleground states have embraced Republican Trump's false claim that he lost a ""rigged"" election last year, according to a Reuters analysis https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22.
The former president has endorsed three of those candidates, in Arizona, Michigan and Florida.
Democrats warn that having proponents of Trump's debunked claim https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-false-claims-debunked-2020-election-jan-6-riot-2022-01-06 that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud in charge of the election process in swing states threatens the integrity of future elections, especially if Trump runs for president again in 2024.
In two states that were crucial to Biden's victory last November - Georgia and Michigan - candidates for secretary of state have received 2.5 times more campaign funding than they had at a comparable point in either of the last two election cycles, according to an analysis of fundraising data by the Brennan Center.
In the secretary of state race in Georgia, a state Biden won by less than 12,000 votes, four candidates have each raised more than the Republican incumbent, Republican Brad Raffensperger, had at this point in 2018. Raffensperger refused Trump's demands to overturn Biden's win and faces a tough re-election battle.
Republican congressman Jody Hice, who voted to overturn Biden's victory after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, has been endorsed by Trump and is challenging Raffensperger. He has raised over $500,000, more than any other candidate.
The Georgia secretary of state contest also shows how these normally obscure races have been nationalized.
Out-of-state donors so far have made 22% of the contributions to this race, nearly twice that of 2018, when it was 13%.

In Michigan, incumbent Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has raised $1.2 million, six times what the last incumbent had raised at this point in 2014.
Her Republican challenger Kristina Karamo, endorsed by Trump, has raised over $164,000 from more than 2,600 contributions.

(Reuters) -The House of Representatives committee investigating last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol issued subpoenas on Tuesday to a White House official under former President Donald Trump and two advisers to his son Donald Trump Jr.
Ross Worthington, who helped draft the former president's speech for a rally before Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was subpoenaed along with Donald Trump Jr.'s aides Andy Surabian and Arthur Schwartz, the House Select Committee said in a statement.
""The committee is demanding records and testimony from three witnesses involved in planning and preparations for the January 6th rally at the Ellipse, which immediately preceded the violent attack on the Capitol"", the statement said.
In that rally at the Ellipse park area near the White House, Trump told his supporters he would never concede the November 2020 presidential election.
""We have reason to believe the individuals we've subpoenaed today have relevant information and we expect them to join the more than 340 individuals who have spoken with the Select Committee,"" the panel said.
Daniel Bean, a lawyer for Surabian, said his client plans ""on cooperating with the committee within reason."" Bean said Surabian ""had nothing at all to do with the events that took place"" at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and was not involved in organizing the rally.
Trump's supporters sought to stop the U.S. Congress from certifying his loss to Joe Biden. Trump falsely claimed his loss in the election was a result of widespread fraud.

Four people died in the hours-long chaos after Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol and ""fight like hell.""

At a Senate health committee hearing, Fauci had his latest heated back-and-forth with Paul, a lawmaker from Kentucky and supporter of former President Donald Trump. Fauci said Paul was focused on misinformed attacks rather than oversight aimed at addressing the health care crisis that has so far killed more than 800,000 people in the United States.
Paul's website accuses Fauci of ""ignoring good advice, and lying about everything from masks to the contagiousness of the virus"" and on Tuesday the senator accused Fauci of smearing other scientists who disagreed with him.
Fauci said Paul was distorting the truth.
""There you go again, you just do the same thing every hearing,"" Fauci told the senator, accusing him of making personal attacks that had no relation to reality. '
""He's doing this for political reasons,"" Fauci continued, pointing to fundraising appeals on Paul's website next to a call to have Fauci fired.
""It distracts from what we're all trying to do here today, (which) is get our arms around the epidemic and the pandemic that we're dealing with, not something imaginary,"" Fauci said. 
Fauci has faced sharp criticism from some conservatives and death threats from people who object to measures such as vaccination and masking that he has advocated to halt the pandemic.
Fauci said misinformation had fueled such threats.
""What happens when he (Paul) gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue is that all of a sudden, that kindles the crazies out there and I have ... threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children,"" Fauci said.
Fauci said on Dec. 21 a person was arrested in Iowa who was traveling from California to Washington, D.C., allegedly to kill Fauci.

Paul accused Fauci of making personal attacks against him and said no one wished violence on Fauci.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden and top health officials on Tuesday defended the government's response to the unrelenting pandemic as daily U.S. COVID-19 cases reached a new high, largely fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant.
Biden, who has been accused of focusing on vaccinations at the expense of testing and support for struggling healthcare systems, told reporters on Tuesday he was ""confident we're on the right track"" to fight the pandemic. 
A surge in cases and hospitalizations has forced Americans to cancel travel plans, shuttered entertainment venues, and scrambled plans for students and teachers to return to school and workers to go back to the office. 
The heads of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the protracted battle against the virus has made clear the need for easier access to testing, better therapies and a vaccine more widely effective against a range of variants.
Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner, acknowledged the agencies' challenges in dealing with the pandemic after two years, especially amid Omicron, but said the focus now needed to be on the current surge.
""I don't think prior approaches reflect what's going on right now. I think it's hard to process what's actually happening right now, which is most people are going to get COVID,"" she told a Senate committee hearing. ""And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens. I think after that will be a good time to reassess how we're approaching this pandemic.""
Dawn O'Connell, assistant Health and Human Services secretary for preparedness and response, said at the same hearing that the administration was working on shipping out the 500 million at-home COVID-19 tests ordered by Biden. The first batch goes out later this month and the rest in the next 60 days.
Democratic and Republican senators at the hearing lamented testing woes and other problems even as they vowed support for the agencies and the fight ahead, including the possibility of more funds.
The United States reported 1.35 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest daily total for any country in the world. Omicron was estimated to account for 98.3% of total new coronavirus cases circulating in the country as of Jan. 8, the CDC said Tuesday.
A closely watched projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington estimates that number is far higher due to the likelihood that many more infections go undetected, either because people are without symptoms or do not have access to testing. 
As a result, the IHME model suggests that the U.S. surge fueled largely by Omicron may have already hit a daily peak of more than 6 million cases, and could drop significantly from that point by the end of this month. But disruptions to health systems, schools and businesses might not resolve quickly even as infections decrease.
'GLIMMER OF HOPE' 
After a surge of COVID-19 cases that overwhelmed some hospitals in New York state, Governor Kathy Hochul said Tuesday that the tide might be turning.
While daily new infections remain high with 48,686 new cases reported on Monday, Hochul said the downward trajectory offered a ""glimmer of hope."" 
""Looks like we might be cresting over that peak,"" the governor said at a news conference.
In Chicago, the seven-day average of cases showed indications of a decrease last week, dropping 8% since the week prior that saw 5,200 cases, city data showed.
The Omicron surge led to a tense standoff between city officials and the union representing most of the city's public school teachers that canceled classes for a week. 
Teachers reached an agreement on COVID-19 safeguards with the district on Monday, and the system's 340,000 students are due back to school on Wednesday. 
The walkout began with a union vote to reinstate virtual instruction and a push for more rigorous safety protocols, including wider testing, as the Omicron variant spread. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has pushed to keep schools open, citing, among other factors, how remote learning disproportionately affects minority students. 

While most U.S. public school districts have reopened their campuses for the new year, education systems in some major cities have opted for online learning or delayed back-to-classroom plans due to staff shortages, in some cases caused by COVID illnesses.
In New York City, some students, wrapped in winter coats to protect them against freezing weather, staged a walkout on Tuesday over COVID-19 concerns in schools.

(Reuters) -A panel of North Carolina judges upheld the state's new congressional map on Tuesday, rejecting claims from Democratic voters and advocacy groups that the redrawn district lines illegally favor Republicans.
The decision, which will be appealed, could have an outsized impact on the 2022 midterm elections in November, when control of the closely divided U.S. Congress will be at stake.
The lawsuit, backed by Democratic and civil rights groups, had asserted that the new map ensures Republicans will win a majority of the state's 14 congressional districts, even in elections in which more Democratic voters cast ballots.
During a trial last week, experts for the plaintiffs testified that the map approved by the Republican-controlled legislature in November represented an extreme outlier, compared with thousands of computer-generated alternatives.
In a 258-page ruling on Tuesday, a panel of three Superior Court judges found the evidence showed the map was ""a result of intentional, pro-Republican partisan redistricting.""
But the judges unanimously agreed with Republican lawmakers that inserting themselves into a purely political matter would overstep their authority. Moreover, the state constitution does not expressly forbid legislators from taking partisan factors into account, the judges ruled.
""Despite our disdain for having to deal with issues that potentially lead to results incompatible with democratic principles and subject our State to ridicule, this Court must remind itself that these maps are the result of a democratic process,"" they wrote.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs immediately said they would appeal the decision, calling it ""disappointing"" but expressing confidence that the North Carolina Supreme Court will eventually throw out the map. 
The state's top court, which has a 4-3 Democratic majority, previously delayed the primary election from March to May to allow time for the lawsuit to proceed.
Federal law requires states to draw new congressional lines every 10 years to account for population shifts, after the U.S. Census completes its once-a-decade count. In most states, legislators control the process, leading to the practice of gerrymandering, in which one party engineers political maps to benefit itself.
The new map would give Republicans 10 or 11 seats statewide, according to analysts, even though the state is considered a perennial battleground in national elections. Republicans currently control eight of the state's 13 districts; North Carolina is gaining a 14th district thanks to a fast-growing population.
The case is among numerous pending lawsuits challenging congressional maps in at least half a dozen states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking redistricting litigation.
Republicans need to flip only a handful of seats in the Nov. 8 elections to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a 221-212 edge, including vacancies.

In a statement, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said the maps were the result of a transparent process.
""The General Assembly's maps were drawn in the light of day, after months of public comment and feedback,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. election workers could face escalating threats, potentially imperiling American democracy, if major voting-rights legislation backed by President Joe Biden fails to pass the Senate, Democratic lawmakers and rights advocates warned.
Democrats have teed up a pair of bills that would make it a crime to threaten or intimidate election workers, among other provisions that would expand voting access, toughen campaign finance rules and prevent partisan gerrymandering. The bills address a surge in threats https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/THREATS/mopanwmlkva documented by a September Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/terrorized-us-election-workers-get-little-help-law-enforcement-2021-09-08. 
Democrats say passage of the bills is critical to protect elections after Republican-led states adopted a wave of new restrictions on ballot access following Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud cost him re-election in 2020.
But it will be difficult to pass the bills amid united Republican opposition in the narrowly divided Senate, where Democrats disagree on whether to amend the ""filibuster"" rule https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-senate-democrats-mull-ending-filibuster-pass-voting-rights-reform-2022-01-11 that requires 60 of the 100 senators to pass most legislation.
On Tuesday, Biden called https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-champion-voting-rights-georgia-clock-ticks-reforms-2022-01-11 for Senate Democrats to do whatever it takes to pass the bills, including amending the filibuster. Sponsors of the bills say inaction will result in intimidated election officials and increasing threats to rank-and-file workers, making it harder to run fair elections.
""If you don't have independent election workers that are about the integrity of the process then I don't know how our elections can proceed,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in an interview, warning that more harassment would make it difficult to hire staff for future elections. 
""If these people won't perform this function, and you suddenly have only partisans in these roles then people's faith again in our system is going to be undermined.""
Democratic Representative Colin Allred, who has sponsored bills to safeguard election workers, said they need the tough new protections https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-us-legislation-seeks-expand-protections-election-workers-2021-10-04, which also would make it tougher for political leaders to fire professional election administrators. 
""If Donald Trump is the candidate for the Republican Party in 2024, ... every county is going to become a battleground,"" Allred said in an interview.
The former president has not said he will run again in 2024, but has publicly flirted with the idea and his endorsements are shaping the field of Republicans trying to regain control of U.S. Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
Senate Republicans dismiss the voting-right bills as unnecessary, saying that the record-shattering turnout in the 2020 election shows the strength of American democracy.
""These states have changed their laws in a way that makes it easier to vote than it was in any other election than the pandemic election,"" of 2020 Republican Senator Roy Blunt told a news conference.
The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, has pushed for a floor vote on the voting rights bills by the Monday holiday honoring slain civil-rights hero Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But Democrats cannot end the filibuster rule without all 50 of their senators, and two of them, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have adamantly opposed the step. They have said it would damage the Senate and could lead to constant change in major aspects of American life each time power changes hands in Washington.

A handful of moderate Senate Republicans have voiced support for a more limited voting rights bill, though they have said they don't see the urgency almost three years ahead of the next presidential election.
Warner said that if the larger rights bills fail, Democrats could try again to pass a more limited bill focused on protecting election workers from threats https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-threats-georgia-exclusiv-idCAKBN2IP0VZ.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday said the U.S. Senate should consider scrapping a longstanding supermajority rule known as the ""filibuster"" if necessary to pass voting-rights legislation that is opposed by Republicans. 
Critics say the filibuster, which requires 60 of the 100 senators to agree on most legislation, is an anti-democratic hurdle that prevents Washington from addressing pressing problems.
Supporters say it forces lawmakers to seek consensus, serves as important check on the party in power and ensures that major laws that affect American life don't change radically with every election.
Once a rarity, the filibuster is now routinely invoked. In recent months, Republicans have used it to block voting-rights bills and bring the United States perilously close to a crippling debt default.
Democrats could use their razor-thin Senate majority to eliminate the filibuster altogether. But centrist Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema oppose this move, saying that it will shatter the few bipartisan bonds that remain and give Republicans free rein if they take a majority in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has warned that his party would use other tactics to bring the chamber to a halt if the filibuster is eliminated. 
WHAT IS THE FILIBUSTER?
Unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate was set up to allow for unlimited debate. In the 19th century, lawmakers developed the filibuster - a word derived from Dutch and Spanish terms for Caribbean pirates - as a way to talk a bill to death.
Then-Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond set the record in 1957, when spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes to block a major civil rights bill. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy spoke for nearly 15 hours in 2016 to press for gun-control legislation and Republican Senator Ted Cruz spoke for more than 21 hours in 2013 to protest President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act. None of those efforts were successful.
Senators agreed in 1917 that a vote by a two-thirds majority could end debate on a given bill. That majority was reduced in 1975 to three-fifths of the Senate, currently 60 senators.
Under current rules, senators don't need to talk to gum up the works -- they merely need to register their objection to initiate a filibuster. 
Over the past 50 years, the number of filibusters has skyrocketed as Democrats and Republicans have become more politically polarized. From 1969 to 1970 there were six votes to overcome a filibuster, the nearest reliable proxy. There were 298 such votes in the 2019-2020 legislative session. 
WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS?
Democrats control 50 seats in the Senate, which allows them to eke together a majority with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking 51st vote when needed. They can't overcome filibusters unless at least 10 Republicans vote with them.
Democrats were able to bypass the filibuster to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus plan using a special process known as ""reconciliation"" that only requires a simple majority for certain budget bills. But that process is subject to complex limitations and cannot be used regularly.
Republicans have blocked many other Democratic priorities, though 19 of them did vote for a $1 trillion package to revamp the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
CAN THE FILIBUSTER BE CHANGED?
There have already been changes.
In 2013, Democrats removed the 60-vote threshold for voting on most nominees for administration jobs, apart from the Supreme Court, allowing them to advance on a simple majority vote.
In 2017, Republicans did the same thing for Supreme Court nominees. Both the 2013 and 2017 Senate rule changes were made by simple majority votes.
Some Democrats have called for eliminating the filibuster entirely, but they lack the 50 votes needed to take that step.
Democrats plan to vote sometime over the next week to scale back the filibuster so it would not apply to voting-related legislation. But it's not clear whether they have the votes for this either; Manchin said last week that he would prefer to get some Republican buy-in for that change. 

On Sunday he said he might support making the tactic more ""painful"" by requiring senators to keep talking on the Senate floor. 
Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, long supported the filibuster but has grown more open to changing it as Republicans have blocked several of his major initiatives over the past year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department is creating a new unit to counter domestic terrorism following the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack, a senior official said on Tuesday, as it faces a growing threat from white supremacists and anti-government activists.
The move reflects a growing realization by U.S. national security officials that domestic extremists represent a threat on par with that posed by foreign militant groups https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-believes-us-faces-equal-threats-domestic-extremists-islamic-state-official-2021-11-03 such as Islamic State.
""We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists - that is, individuals in the United States who seek to commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of domestic social or political goals,"" Matthew Olsen, the assistant attorney general of the department's National Security Division, told a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies,"" Olsen added.
Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-supremacist-groups-pose-rising-us-threat-garland-says-2021-05-12 last May that domestic violent extremist groups, particularly white supremacists, pose a growing threat to the United States. 
Olsen said the new unit will be part of the National Security Division and will work to ""ensure that these cases are properly handled and effectively coordinated"" across the department and around the country.
The Justice Department has brought criminal charges against more than 725 people stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in which then-President Donald Trump's supporters sought to stop Congress from certifying his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Some of the defendants are members or associated with far-right groups including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.
A top FBI official told Congress https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-believes-us-faces-equal-threats-domestic-extremists-islamic-state-official-2021-11-03 in November that the bureau was conducting around 2,700 investigations related to domestic violent extremism.
Jill Sanborn, the executive assistant director for the FBI's National Security Branch, told lawmakers on Tuesday the bureau is particularly concerned about violent extremists motivated by racial hatred and those who are anti-government.

""Racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists advocating for the superiority of the white race and anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists ... present the most lethal threat,"" she testified.
She added that extremists motivated by racial and ethnic hatred are ""most likely to conduct mass casualty attacks against civilians"" while militias are more prone to target law enforcement or government employees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday expressed confidence the United States was on the right track in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the country grapples with a surge in infections sparked by the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
White House officials have said the situation is different from previous stages of the pandemic because more people are getting protection from vaccinations and booster shots.
""I'm confident we are on the right track,"" Biden told reporters on Tuesday.
However, Biden acknowledged that he was concerned about the pace at which the virus was spreading worldwide because, ""it’s not slowing up very much.""
While COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is potentially less severe, health officials have warned that the sheer number of infections could strain hospital systems, some of which have already suspended elective procedures as they struggle to handle the increase in patients and staff shortages.
The United States reported 1.35 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest daily total for any country in the world, driven by the Omicron variant.
There were more than 136,604 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States, surpassing the record of 132,051 set in January last year, according to the tally for Monday.

The surge in cases has disrupted schools, which are struggling with absences of staff, teachers and bus drivers.
A redesigned COVID-19 vaccine that specifically targets the Omicron variant is likely needed,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s chief executive said on Monday, adding his company could have one ready to launch by March.

(Reuters) -Donald Trump's lawyer argued in court on Monday that the former president cannot be sued over his fiery speech before the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol because he was acting within the scope of his official presidential duties.
Trump's lawyer, Jesse Binnall, said during a court hearing that Trump was ""immune,"" or shielded, from three lawsuits by Democratic members of Congress and two police officers.
""Executive immunity must be broad,"" Binnall said.
The lawsuits, filed by plaintiffs including Democratic U.S. representatives Eric Swalwell and Jerry Nadler, argue that Trump is liable for injuries to police and lawmakers.
Looming large in the case is a Supreme Court case from 1982 holding that presidents are immune from lawsuits over their official acts.
During a five-hour court hearing, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in the District of Columbia pressed lawyers for both sides about the limits of this presidential immunity.
Plaintiffs lawyer Joseph Sellers countered that Trump's speech was a campaign event, not an official act and said it was ""inconceivable"" that the Supreme Court intended to shield presidents from lawsuits over this sort of conduct.
""There is no legitimate role for fomenting an insurrection aimed at Congress,"" Sellers said.
The Democratic lawmakers have invoked an 1871 law passed to fight the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan that prohibits political intimidation.
The lawsuits charge that the Capitol attack was a direct consequence of Trump's actions, including the speech to thousands of supporters who then stormed the building to try to overturn President Joe Biden's election.
Mehta did not issue a ruling on Monday, saying during the hearing that the litigation raises difficult legal questions.
""If there is one thing this hearing has shown it's that this is not an easy case,"" Mehta said.
At one point, Mehta questioned whether Trump's remarks in the aftermath of the Capitol siege were intended to encourage rioters.
""What do I do about the fact the president didn’t denounce the conduct immediately?” Mehta said to Binnall.
“Isn’t that, from a plausibility standpoint, enough to at least plausibly infer that the president agreed with the conduct of the people that were inside the Capitol that day?""
Binnall replied: “The president cannot be subject to judicial action for any sort of damages for failing to do something.” 
Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate on a charge of inciting the riot, which is also under investigation by a House select committee.
Swalwell's lawsuit includes similar claims against Trump allies who also spoke at the Jan. 6 rally, including campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr., and Republican congressman Mo Brooks.
Brooks, representing himself during the hearing, asked Mehta to dismiss Swalwell's claims against him.
Brooks argued his remarks at the Jan. 6 rally were within the scope of his duties as a House member. A law called the Westfall Act protects federal employees from being sued for actions taken as part of their jobs.

Trump and his co-defendants have argued that their remarks preceding the Jan. 6 attack were political speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The two Capitol Police officers who sued Trump are James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday will begin an effort to weaken rules that allow a minority group of senators to kill proposed laws, arguing democracy is in peril unless new voting-rights legislation passes, the White House said. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday will speak in Atlanta, a city with a majority Black population and capital of the battleground state of Georgia, where Democrats won two crucial U.S. Senate seats in January 2021.
Since then, Republican state lawmakers have passed dozens of state voting laws https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-erect-voting-barriers-politically-crucial-us-states-2021-06-16 around the country in response to former President Donald Trump's false allegations he lost the 2020 election because of voting fraud. Democrats say the state laws will make it harder for minorities to participate in elections. 
""Tomorrow is an opportunity to speak about what the path forward looks like,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, before confirming that Biden is expected to address changing Senate rules.
Atlanta was the home of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights leader slain in 1968, who is remembered in a national U.S. holiday on Jan. 17. 
Biden is expected to support changing filibuster rules https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-10-06 that require 60 senators to back most legislation, including voting rights bills that do not have that many supporters. The specifics of Biden's plans were not clear. 
Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema, who represent the more conservative states of West Virginia and Arizona, say they want to protect the Senate's 60-vote threshold to ensure bipartisanship.
Republicans have said they support keeping the filibuster because it gives minority lawmakers a voice in policymaking.
In October, Biden said the United States should ""fundamentally alter"" https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-wants-fundamentally-alter-senate-filibuster-some-issues-2021-10-22 the Senate filibuster on certain issues.
He has signaled he would support requiring dissenting members to speak on the floor to delay a vote on a bill, a step up from the current system where they can just note their opposition. 
The so-called ""talking filibuster"" would require senators to physically take the floor and likely speak for hours to halt legislation. 
Democrats have also discussed voting on rule changes that would only apply to the voting rights bills or requiring at least 41 senators in the 100-member chamber to block legislation.
Biden and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have huddled over the legislative strategy for months, starting before Biden publicly acknowledged his support for weakening the filibuster on voting rights during an October CNN town hall.

Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist who is traveling to Atlanta to attend the Biden speech, said he has warned the White House that half-measures on voting rights will not work.
""This is a defining moment, not just for the president, but for the country and the future of democracy,"" Sharpton told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York man upset with what he perceived as Donald Trump's threats to democracy was criminally charged on Monday with threatening to kill the former U.S. president, who he once referred to as Hitler.
Prosecutors said the defendant, Thomas Welnicki, 72, of Rockaway Beach, threatened to do ""everything I can"" to ensure Trump's death, and once inquired about Secret Service protection for former presidents and their children.
Welnicki was accused in a criminal complaint of discussing Trump's demise in several voluntary communications with U.S. Capitol Police and the Secret Service between July 2020 and December 2021, during and after Trump's presidency.
The case was brought as Trump, a Republican, continues pressing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-false-claims-debunked-2020-election-jan-6-riot-2022-01-06 false claims that widespread voting fraud caused him to lose the November 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.
""Mr. Welnicki intended no harm to anyone,"" his lawyer Deirdre von Dornum, attorney-in-charge of the federal defender's office in Brooklyn, said in an email. ""He was expressing how distraught he was at what he saw as the threats to our democracy posed by former President Trump.""
Lawyers and spokespeople for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Vera Scanlon set bail at $50,000, and ordered Welnicki to undergo alcohol and mental health treatment and submit to GPS monitoring.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor Zapana said there remained ""lingering concern"" about the defendant following his ""very concrete and scary threats.""
Von Dornum countered that Welnicki had not left New York City for 15 years, and that if he were a danger ""they would have arrested him sooner.""
According to the criminal complaint, Welnicki told Capitol Police in July 2020 that if Trump lost the election and refused to step down, he would ""acquire weapons"" and ""take him down.""
Welnicki allegedly later called the Secret Service around Jan. 4, 2021, threatening to kill Trump and 12 unnamed congressional supporters, and referring to a $350,000 bounty.
""I will do anything I can to take out (Trump) and his 12 monkeys,"" Welnicki was quoted as saying. ""Tomorrow (Trump) will be in Georgia, maybe I will.""
Trump visited Georgia that day https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-promises-new-day-trump-heads-georgia-eve-pivotal-senate-runoffs-2021-01-04 to campaign for two incumbent Republican senators who sought unsuccessfully to win re-election and keep the U.S. Senate under Republican control.
Two days later, on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump supporters assaulted the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to overturn the presidential election.

Prosecutors said Welnicki's threats continued into the autumn of 2021, when he likened Trump to Adolf Hitler and referred to Trump's children.
He also allegedly told the Secret Service on Dec. 2, 2021 that ""the new Civil War could break out and taking up arms against the government is justified when ballots don't matter.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats are urging the Biden administration to allow at least 2 million immigrants in the country illegally to prolong their stay and to prevent deportation to home countries where natural disasters and crises prevent their safe return.
They want President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, to take executive action to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Central American immigrants from Guatemala and expand eligibility for those from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
Senator Robert Menendez and more than 30 fellow Democrats wrote to top administration officials calling on them to act after a failed push last year to pass immigration reform during Biden's first year in office. 
Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border reached record highs https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-under-pressure-us-mexico-border-arrests-reach-record-highs-2021-10-20 last year, fueled by new arrivals from Central America.
TPS allows people already in the United States at the time of the designation to stay and work legally if their home countries have been affected by natural disasters, armed conflicts or other events that prevent their safe return. 
The designations, which are issued by the secretary of homeland security, last six to 18 months and can be renewed indefinitely. 
""It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the administration,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.
More than 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua already have TPS. 
Under the proposal, at least another 2 million immigrants from the region could be eligible for deportation relief, according to an estimate generated early last year by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
The estimate did not account for the high volume of border crossings in 2021 and the Menendez-led letter did not say how many people could be eligible.

Critics contend the temporary protections encourage more illegal entries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has three years left in office, but some of his domestic agenda may have a much shorter clock.
The White House has a small window of time to pass any meaningful laws in 2022, including the 'Build Back Better' plan, Biden allies tell Reuters, before Congress shifts its attention to the November midterm elections. If Democrats in swing districts get cold feet about passing sweeping legislation as voting gets closer, the $2 trillion landmark bill that funds universal preschool and climate initiatives could be derailed entirely. 
Democrats believe chances are slim they will retain a narrow majority in both houses of Congress, which allowed them to pass the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill in 2021. 
All 435 members of the House are up for reelection in 2022, and one-third of the U.S. Senate, including Democrats in competitive districts in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. 
""History has shown that lawmakers are risk averse during the mid term,"" says Phil Schiliro, who served as legislative affairs director under former president Barack Obama. ""Some have felt they have taken enough difficult votes and they want to focus on reelection,"" Schiliro says. 
What that means is ""the first few months, from a legislative perspective, could be the last-best chance for this administration to get anything done,"" said a Biden ally.
Some congressional aides and White House allies are holding out faint hope that Biden can renew discussions with U.S. Senate Democrat Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, and pass key aspects of the Build Back Better plan. 
White House officials say there has been no sign of progress with Manchin since he said he wouldn't back https://www.reuters.com/world/us/manchin-says-white-house-staff-drove-him-reject-bidens-social-policy-plan-2021-12-20 the current bill in mid-December, even on a plan Manchin told Biden he could support just a month ago.
""If it doesn’t happen in the first quarter, we are cooked,"" said a Democratic legislative aide involved in the discussions, referring to the first three months of 2022. 
VOTING RIGHTS DILEMMA 
The White House is expected to detail its midterm strategy in the upcoming weeks, including more aggressive https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-2022-pitch-target-trump-acolytes-woo-swing-voters-2022-01-09 attacks against acolytes of former President Donald Trump. 
The strategy includes heavy investment of time and money in competitive elections in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona - all states also considered crucial to retaining the White House in 2024, according to three sources familiar with the plan.
With few potential legislative options, the White House is expected to continue to make fighting COVID and inflation a priority as Biden and other officials tour the country selling the benefits of a $1 trillion infrastructure law https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-needing-boost-sign-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-11-15 passed in November. 
That includes leaning into more grassroots liberal issues like voting and abortion rights and gun control. While the issues may energize Democratic voters, the path forward for new laws is unclear. 
Republicans blocked multiple attempts to pass voting-rights reform bills last year, leaving top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer threatening to make changes to the ""filibuster"" rule https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-10-06, which requires 60 of the 100 senators to agree on most legislation.
Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema oppose changes, saying they would damage the way the Senate operates.
While other Democrats lean on the duo to change their views, top Senate Republican suggested another approach - changing the 1887 Electoral Count Act https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-senate-republican-signals-interest-narrow-approach-us-election-reform-2022-01-05, which allows members of Congress to dispute presidential election results when they certify them on January 6th. 
After the attack on Congress by Trump supporters on Jan. 6 of 2021, experts fear the process could be at the center of a constitutional crisis over future elections.
""I think it's worth discussing,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, without providing specifics of what he would change. Democrats say his suggestion is insufficient because it doesn't include plans to expand access to ballots or remove new barriers being erected by Republican-controlled states.
Biden is expected to publicly demand changes to the filibuster rule to pass voting rights legislation as soon as Tuesday, when he and Vice President Kamala Harris visit Georgia to make a push for voting rights, and make the case that he exhausted options on an issue that his base cares deeply about. 
Civil rights groups are asking for more. 
""Many policy makers, including in the White House, did not prioritize this issue early enough,"" Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP told Reuters, adding the group plans on ""doubling down"" on efforts to pressure Congress and the White House to act. 

However, he said it may be too late. Johnson said the lack of action has the left the country in a ""precarious situation"" that allowed Republicans to redraw congressional districts, particularly in southern states, without any federal protections against disparate impacts to black voters. 
""In addition to that, we're looking at a midterm elections where many voices will be hampered from truly participating in the election,"" Johnson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two-term Wisconsin Republican U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, reversed course and announced on Sunday that he now intends to run for a third term, rather than retire as previously planned.
Johnson - who as the former chairman of the powerful Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee once held a controversial hearing to entertain baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen - wrote in the Wall Street Journal he felt compelled to run again because he thinks America ""is in peril.""
""Much as I’d like to ease into a quiet retirement, I don’t feel I should,"" Johnson said in his op-ed.
""Countless people have encouraged me to run, saying they rely on me to be their voice, to speak plain and obvious truths other elected leaders shirk from expressing—truths the elite in government, mainstream media and Big Tech don’t want you to hear.""

Wisconsin is a battleground state closely fought between Republicans and Democrats.

He has also cast doubt on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, opposed a vaccine mandate, and he hosted a panel several months ago that featured people who claimed they were harmed by the vaccine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden heads into his second year in office with two unfinished aims: ending Trumpism and unifying a polarized country.
To achieve both, Biden will more regularly attack the values of Republicans aligned with former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy, while holding out an olive branch to opponents, people close to the Democratic president said in multiple interviews inside and outside the White House in recent weeks. 
Biden's speech on Thursday, the one-year anniversary of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, outlined the new approach. Biden savaged Trump, who egged on his supporters to march on the seat of Congress one year ago with unproven claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and struck out at other members of the Republican Party who continue to support his predecessor.
""'The Big Lie' being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day,"" Biden said in a speech from inside the Capitol.
""Can you think of a more twisted way to look at this country - to look at America? I cannot.""
Ahead of congressional elections in November, Biden and his closest allies have made fresh calculations about a country at a crossroads, the people close to the president said. 
They see a divided public gorging itself on misleading information, not just about the 2020 election but a range of other issues including whether COVID-19 vaccines are effective. They believe the White House is hobbled by a Republican Party hell-bent on ensuring Biden's failure, even if it damages the United States overall.
Biden is dismayed by the ""silence and complacency"" of Republicans in a Congress he served in for decades, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. 
On Friday, he lashed out again, in a speech about the U.S. economy, which is outperforming those of other developed nations. ""Republicans want to talk down the recovery because they voted against the legislation that made it happen,"" Biden said. ""I refuse to let them stand in the way of this recovery.""
Republicans accuse Biden of having tacked hard to the left since winning the White House on a largely center-left message and of pushing spending initiatives and tax proposals that they say will hurt the economy and boost already-high inflation.
'NOT OUR PRESIDENT' 
Biden stacked his first year in office with policies Democratic polling showed most voters would embrace: an aggressive COVID-19 response, stimulus checks, spending on roads and bridges, a military withdrawal from Afghanistan and cutting drug prices.
Proposing fixes for those ""kitchen-table"" issues, mostly avoiding divisive topics like abortion and police reform, and hewing closely to a career-long belief that simple, empathetic explanations can woo America's centrist majority, moved the country no closer to a key goal he set out as a candidate for the presidency.
Uniting the United States ""is turning out to be one of the most difficult things"" he has tried to do as president, Biden admitted last month in Missouri, a state that he lost handily to Trump in the 2020 election.
Biden's motorcade there was greeted with someone carrying a sign that read ""Not our president,"" another reminder that polls show most Republican voters still believe Trump's false story about the election having been stolen. On Christmas Eve, when Biden called children to discuss Santa Claus, he was greeted by one parent with a crass shout-out popular among Trump supporters.
Aiming for the center has not helped the president's popularity. About 48% of Americans approved of Biden's performance in December, compared to a 55% approval rating around his inauguration in early 2021, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
The White House believes a new effort to push core Democratic values, including speeches to tout voter-enfranchisement concerns and shoring up election laws in time for the 2022 vote, could have broad support among the American people, no matter how they previously voted.
But a shift in emphasis is risky: swing voters like it when Biden appears to be trying to work with the other side, the president's aides and allies believe. Biden tried to thread that needle in Thursday's speech, pledging to work together with Republicans ""who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man."" 
The president is willing to take short-term political heat associated with attacking Trump, allies say. 

""Joe Biden has always played the long game,"" said Richard Harpootlian, a South Carolina lawyer, Democratic state senator and longtime Biden supporter, who met with the president last month. ""He's not worried about the week-to-week polls and the day-to-day polls. He believes what he's doing in the long run will pay off.""
However, he added, ""It may have some consequences in 2022 that he might not prefer.""

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - U.S. political luminaries including President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama celebrated the life of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday, describing him as an unpretentious pragmatist who got things done.
Reid died last month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-us-senate-majority-leader-harry-reid-has-died-2021-12-29 at age 82 after battling pancreatic cancer. 
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also paid tribute to Reid at the Nevada memorial service, which featured remarks from Reid's family members and music from singer-songwriter Carole King.
Reid helped secure congressional passage of Obama's signature healthcare law in 2010 over sharp opposition from Republicans, and the former president said he could not have asked for a better friend.
""Without Harry, there would be no Affordable Care Act,"" Obama said in his eulogy. ""Harry refused to give up."" 
Obama said Reid had gently pointed out that he knew the Senate when Obama would question changes or deals he made to get the bill passed.
“Pragmatism, practicality, a premium on getting things done, a lack of pretension and an abiding loyalty. That’s what Harry Reid represented,"" said Obama.
Obama, Biden, Pelosi and others described Reid's penchant for cutting conversations short and hanging up the phone without saying goodbye. ""Every time I hear a dial tone, I think of Harry,"" Biden quipped. 
Biden, who served in the Senate for some 36 years, said Reid was one of the best majority leaders in history.
“For Harry, it wasn’t about power. It was about the sake of power, the power to be able to use power to do right by people,"" he said.

Reid was first elected to the House in 1982 and was sent to the Senate by Nevada voters in 1986. He retired in 2016.
The president described Reid as a plainspoken, honorable, decent, brave and unyielding man.

This is the first time in U.S. history that a State of the Union address or annual message will be delivered in March; for most of the past century presidents delivered their annual addresses to Congress in January or February, according to the House historian.

March 1 also marks the start of the congressional election season as Texas will hold primary elections that day for Democrats and Republicans to choose their candidates for the Nov. 8 election.

In 2009 Republican Representative Joe Wilson shouted ""You lie!"" at Obama during a special speech to a joint session of Congress to pitch for the Obamacare healthcare bill. Wilson was widely condemned for the breach of protocol by both Republicans and Democrats, and apologized publicly to the president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will tell Americans that his predecessor, Donald Trump, carries ""singular responsibility"" for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol when he marks the first anniversary of the assault on Thursday, the White House said.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both Democrats, will speak on Thursday morning at the U.S. Capitol, one year after a mob loyal to Trump raided the complex https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democracy-under-siege-an-hour-by-hour-look-assault-us-capitol-2022-01-04 in a failed attempt to stop the certification of Electoral College votes that officially delivered Biden's election victory. 
Biden and his top aides have been reluctant to talk directly about Trump since the former senator took office last January, even as the Republican former president continued to spread lies about his election loss, and Democrats, historians and civil rights activists have grown increasingly concerned about the future of the nearly 250-year-old representative democracy. Thursday's speech comes after Biden spent months encouraging Americans to unite against the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuild together after weather disasters. 
On Thursday, Biden will “lay out the significance of what happened in the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw and he will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters as well as distract from his role in what happened,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. 
Trump canceled a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for Thursday evening, blaming what he called the ""bias and dishonesty"" of the House of Representatives probe of the attacks and the news media, a favorite target.
Taylor Budowich, a Trump spokesperson, said it was ""unsurprising"" that Biden would spend Jan. 6th ""trying to further divide our nation, adding ""division is the only thing Democrats know how to do."" 
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the day after defending Congress. Dozens of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives https://www.reuters.com/world/us/officer-who-responded-us-capitol-attack-is-third-die-by-suicide-2021-08-02.
The White House said Biden would push back against Trump's false claims, adopted by many of his followers, that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and attempts to downplay the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.
Biden has been ""clear eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy,"" Psaki said, ""and how the former president constantly works to constantly undermine basic American values and rule of law."" 

She added that the president sees the deadly attacks as a “tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country.”
Harris will use her remarks to ""outline that the American experiment is being tested, and that we must work to secure voting rights, ensure free and fair elections and safeguard our democracy for generations to come,"" an administration official said.

(Reuters) - Donald Trump's former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham will meet on Wednesday evening with the U.S. congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, according to a source familiar with the meeting.
Grisham was White House press secretary from July 2019 until April 2020, when she became chief of staff for Trump's wife Melania.
Grisham resigned from that job on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, after mobs of the former president's supporters stormed the Capitol to try to prevent certification of President Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory.
Grisham released a tell-all book last year that accused Trump of mistreating his staff and placating Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Grisham's cooperation with the House of Representatives Select Committee was first reported by CNN, which said her decision followed a phone call with U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the committee, who encouraged her to meet with the panel.
The investigation into the worst attack on Congress since the War of 1812 has largely played out behind closed doors so far. The Select Committee has interviewed more than 300 witnesses about the violence by Trump supporters and Trump’s response to it.
Around 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot, according to the Department of Justice. One officer who battled rioters died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide. Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window in a door inside the Capitol leading to an area known as the Speaker's Lobby.

A current Trump spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, said in a Dec. 27 court filing that he has cooperated extensively with the committee, producing more than 1,700 pages of documents and provided about four hours of sworn testimony.

(Reuters) - Ahead of the one-year anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Capitol,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) convened a team to prepare the social networking site to address any harmful content associated with the event, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.
Social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were accused of enabling extremists to organize the siege on Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Republican then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to block Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory.
Twitter said it ""convened a cross-functional working group"" comprised of members across its site integrity and trust and safety teams, which is specific to the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol and will watch for risks such as tweets and accounts that incite violence. The company did not say how many people were on the monitoring team.
The company said the effort expands upon its work to monitor the platform around major global events, and added it will continue to monitor trending topics and search results for harmful content. 
A spokesperson for Meta Platforms Inc, the company previously known as Facebook, said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We’re continuing to actively monitor threats on our platform and will respond accordingly.”
A spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said on Wednesday the online video platform had removed tens of thousands of videos for violating its U.S. elections-related policies over the past year, and said it continued to closely monitor for election misinformation on the site.
In March, the chief executives of Twitter, Google and Facebook, testified in a hearing before Congress and were asked by U.S. lawmakers whether their platforms bore some responsibility for the riot.
Then-Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey was the only executive who answered ""yes,"" but said the “broader ecosystem” had to be taken into account.
Days after the Capitol riot, Twitter announced a permanent suspension of Trump's account, citing ""the risk of further incitement of violence.""

""Our approach both before and after January 6 has been to take strong enforcement action against accounts and Tweets that incite violence or have the potential to lead to offline harm,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday.
The company added that over the past year, it has permanently suspended thousands of accounts for violating its policies against coordinated harmful activity.

(Reuters) -The Manhattan District Attorney's office will not file criminal charges in connection with the handling of coronavirus deaths in New York nursing homes during the tenure of former Governor Andrew Cuomo, his representative said on Monday.
""I was contacted today by the head of the Elder Care Unit from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office who informed me they have closed its investigation involving the Executive Chamber and nursing homes,"" attorney Elkan Abramowitz said in a statement. 
""I was told that after a thorough investigation – as we have said all along – there was no evidence to suggest that any laws were broken.""
The DA's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cuomo was ""not fully transparent"" on the number of COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes, state lawmakers said in November while summarizing the results of an investigation.
Nursing homes across the United States took in COVID-19 patients in the early weeks of the outbreak, a move critics say spread the sometimes fatal respiratory virus among some of the country's most vulnerable at a time when there was no vaccine.
The issue dogged Cuomo in particular and helped spark a reassessment of his legacy. In the early stages of the pandemic, Cuomo's daily televised news briefings made him a national figure in the fight against COVID-19.
But he eventually battled allegations, including from New York state's attorney general, that his office had significantly undercounted nursing home fatalities and implemented policies that may have boosted the death toll.

In July, the U.S. Justice Department decided not to open a civil rights investigation into nursing homes in New York and two other states regarding their COVID-19 response.
Cuomo resigned a little over four months ago when a report from state Attorney General Letitia James accused him of sexual harassment and other transgressions.

""Much like the violent insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol nearly one year ago, Republican officials in states across the country have seized on the former president's Big Lie about widespread voter fraud to enact anti-democratic legislation,"" Schumer said in a letter to Democratic senators on Monday. ""We can and must take strong action to stop this anti-democratic march.""
Senate Democrats tried to bring the voting-rights bill to a floor vote four times last year, and were repeatedly blocked by Republicans, who made use of the filibuster rule that requires 60 of the 100 senators to agree to advance most legislation.
The chamber is divided 50-50 between the two parties, with Democrats holding the majority by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
Schumer said the chamber would vote for a rules change by Jan. 17, the federal holiday honoring civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Democrats could change the chamber's rules with just a simple majority, but two centrist members of their party -- Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- have repeatedly voiced objection to doing so.
Sinema said in a statement on Monday that she continued to support both voting rights and the 60-vote filibuster, but added that she was open to debating the Senate's rules.
Manchin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell's office declined to comment.
Nineteen state legislatures passed 34 laws restricting access to voting in 2021, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute, the highest number since the center began tracking voting legislation in 2011.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A county prosecutor in New York has decided not to bring criminal charges against Andrew Cuomo, the state's former governor, over accusations he kissed two women against their will.
Westchester District Attorney Miriam Rocah said in a statement on Tuesday that despite credible evidence supporting the women's complaints, they did not meet the statutory requirements for bringing criminal charges.
A lawyer for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Democrat who ran New York for a decade, Cuomo resigned in August after multiple women who worked for him accused him of unwanted sexual advances and contact. He denied touching anyone inappropriately and said his efforts to be a friendly boss may have been misinterpreted as flirtation.
He also faced investigations over his office's efforts to mask from lawmakers the extent of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. A state ethics board later concluded he improperly used state employees to help write a book about his leadership skills, for which he received a $5.1 million advance.
He resigned after the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a damning report that concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women. Several county prosecutors said they would investigate complaints in their jurisdictions.
In one of the encounters investigated by Westchester County, a female state trooper said she was on duty in the security detail outside Cuomo's home in Mount Kisco when she asked the governor in the driveway if he needed anything.
She said Cuomo asked if he could kiss her. She said she feared ramifications if she denied the governor's request, and answered: ""Sure.""

In the second episode, a woman said Cuomo grabbed her arm, pulled her toward him and kissed her on the cheek without her consent.
The U.S. Department of Justice also opened an investigation into the complaints of workplace sexual harassment by Cuomo, according to records released by state lawmakers this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday it plans to withdraw and reconsider a Trump administration decision to grant Oklahoma authority over environmental issues on tribal land after consulting with the state's 38 tribal nations.
The agency would reverse a decision made in October 2020 by then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who approved a request from Republican Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt to allow the state rather than tribal nations to regulate environmental issues on land inside historical tribal reservation boundaries.
Stitt's had requested the authority in July 2020 after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in the landmark McGirt v. Oklahoma case that a large part of eastern part of the state would be considered Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation land. The McGirt v. Oklahoma case focused on a question of criminal jurisdiction. 
“Our sovereign Tribal partners continue to have significant concerns with EPA’s previous decision and the consultation process used in reaching that decision,” said Assistant Administrator for International and Tribal Affairs Jane Nishida. “Today’s action reflects careful consideration of their concerns and our commitment to ensuring robust consultation on all policy deliberations affecting Tribal nations.""
The Biden administration began informal talks with Oklahoma tribes over whether they should have a bigger say over a range of environmental regulations in the eastern half of the oil-rich state in April. It began formal government-to-government tribal consultations in June.
Tribes had complained that they had not been consulted with before the Trump administration made its decision.

Oklahoma Republican government sources told Reuters in April that it was concerned the state risks losing control of a big tax base and about regulation of natural resource extraction and industry if jurisdiction remains with tribes.
Most of Oklahoma's oil and gas production is in the western part of the state, but some fields are in the eastern part of the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Thursday to ban imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, part of Washington's continued pushback https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-us-rights-idUSKBN2B41HM against Beijing's treatment of the country's Uyghur Muslim minority.
The Senate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act by unanimous consent, sending it to the White House, where President Joe Biden has said he will sign it into law. The House of Representatives passed the bill with a unanimous voice vote on Tuesday.
The measure rushed through Congress this week after lawmakers agreed on a compromise that eliminated differences between bills introduced in the House and Senate.
Republicans and Democrats in the two chambers have been arguing over the Uyghur legislation for months. The dispute complicated passage of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, and has held up the Senate's confirmation of some of Biden's ambassadorial nominees, including his selection of Nicholas Burns to be ambassador to China.
As they cleared the way for the Uyghur bill's passage on Thursday, lawmakers also agreed to allow a vote later in the day on at least a few of Biden's nominees for diplomatic positions, including Burns.
The compromise legislation keeps a provision creating a ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has set up a network of detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, were made with forced labor, in order to bar such imports.
""It is a horrifying human rights situation, fully sanctioned, as we now know, by the Communist Party of China,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio said, urging senators to vote for the bill.
China denies abuses in Xinjiang, which supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels, but the U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.
Nury Turkel, a Uyghur American who serves as vice chair on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, said the bill's effectiveness would depend on the willingness of the Biden administration to ensure it is effective, especially when companies ask for waivers.
""The possibility of it not being fully implemented is one of my major concerns,"" Turkel told Reuters. ""If this is not fully implemented then it will be a dead lever, just like the Genocide Convention.""
Republicans had accused Biden's Democrats of slow-walking the bill because it would complicate the president's renewable energy agenda. Democrats denied that.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai praised the legislation.

""We have a moral and economic imperative to eliminate this practice from our global supply chains, including those that run through Xinjiang, China, and exploit Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities,"" she said.
In a related development on Thursday, the U.S. government hit dozens of Chinese companies with investment and export restrictions, including top drone maker DJI, accusing them of complicity in the oppression of Uyghurs or of helping the military, further ratcheting up tensions between the world's top two economies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Longtime Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone will invoke the constitutional protection against self-incrimination during an interview on Friday with the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Stone's lawyer said on Thursday.
Stone's attorney, Grant Smith, said in an e-mail that his client will appear for a closed-door deposition before the House of Representatives committee on Friday but will not answer any questions, invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being forced to reveal to investigators information that might subject them to criminal prosecution.
At least two other high-profile witnesses who received subpoenas from the House Select Committee have indicated they would invoke the Fifth Amendment: John Eastman, a former lawyer for former president Trump, and Jeffrey Clark, a former top Justice Department official during the Trump administration.
The committee issued a subpoena to Stone on Nov. 22, saying it wanted his testimony about his appearances at pro-Trump rallies in Washington on Jan. 5.
Members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government group, provided security to Stone on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6. Several members of the Oath Keepers are facing criminal charges over their breaching of the Capitol on Jan. 6. 
Stone was previously indicted by Robert Mueller, the former special counsel tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A federal jury in Washington convicted Stone of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.
Trump pardoned Stone in December 2020, wiping away the criminal conviction.

A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events.
More than 700 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said it distributed more than $16 billion in expanded Child Tax Credit payments on Wednesday in the final month of a COVID-19 pilot program set to expire as President Joe Biden's social and climate spending bill languishes in Congress.
The monthly payments, which began in July, lifted some 3.6 million American children out of poverty in October, according to Columbia University research. 
December's check for $300 per child under age 6 and $250 per child age 6-17, which reached the families of 61 million children, will be the last monthly payment if a proposed extension in the ""Build Back Better"" legislation is not approved by Congress.
The tax credit is set to revert next year to its prior form: a lump sum that requires Americans to file a tax return to claim it, and a reduction to $2,000 annually per child from up to $3,600 this year. The Treasury in June estimated that families with as many as 2.3 million children did not file tax returns in 2019 or 2020. 
Since July, total monthly disbursements came to $93 billion. In August, average Child Tax Credit payments were highest in states that supported former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election. 

""The lives of tens of millions of children across the country have improved because families have received tax relief when they need it most,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
As Democrats in Congress struggled to find a path forward on Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill, a person familiar with negotiations said that moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin was objecting to extending the expanded Child Tax Credit in the legislation.

HONOLULU, Hawaii (Reuters) -U.S. military commanders in the Pacific have built a software tool to predict how the Chinese government will react to U.S. actions in the region like military sales, U.S.-backed military activity and even congressional visits to hotspots like Taiwan.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was briefed on the new tool during a visit to the United States Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii on Tuesday.
""With the spectrum of conflict and the challenge sets spanning down into the grey zone. What you see is the need to be looking at a far broader set of indicators, weaving that together and then understanding the threat interaction,"" Hicks said in an interview aboard a military jet en route to California. 
The tool calculates ""strategic friction,"" a defense official said. It looks at data since early 2020 and evaluates significant activities that had impacted U.S.-Sino relations. The computer-based system will help the Pentagon predict whether certain actions will provoke an outsized Chinese reaction.
In October, the Chinese military condemned the United States and Canada for each sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait, saying they were threatening peace and stability in the region. The incident and others like it have fueled demand for the tool, the U.S. official said, to ensure the United States does not inadvertently upset China with its actions.
While relations between the United States and China are already at low point, the tool provides visibility across a variety of activities such as congressional visits to Taiwan, arms sales to allies in the region, or when several U.S. ships sailing through the Taiwan Strait could provoke an outsized or unintended Chinese reaction.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year, provoking anger in Taipei. 

The new software will allow U.S. officials to look forward at planned actions as far as four months in advance, the official said.
Hicks is touring U.S. bases this week while the Biden administration's draft 2023 budget takes shape. The Department of Defense hopes to move budget dollars toward a military that can deter China and Russia.

Kennedy, 64, is the daughter of John Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States who was assassinated in 1963. She previously served as U.S. ambassador to Japan from 2013-2017 under former President Barack Obama.
Kwan is the winner of two silver Olympic medals in figure skating. She has served as an adviser to the U.S. Department of State on women's issues.
Australia is a key ally to the United States and that relationship has strengthened in response to China's growing power and increasingly assertive behavior in Asia and beyond.
Kennedy's experience in Japan should be helpful in Canberra given that Australia and Japan are both members of the so-called Quad grouping, which includes the United States and India, that has been expanding cooperation https://www.reuters.com/world/china/quad-leaders-meet-white-house-amid-shared-china-concerns-2021-09-24in the face of China's rise. 
In September, the United States, Britain and Australia announced a security pact dubbed AUKUS that will help Australia acquire U.S. nuclear-powered submarines https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-get-us-nuclear-submarine-technology-china-looms-large-2021-09-15 and expand its security reach in the IndoPacific region.

Kennedy was the first female U.S. ambassador to Japan. She trained as an attorney and has co-authored books on civil liberties and edited anthologies of poetry. 
It was unclear when Kennedy might be confirmed in her post, which requires Senate approval. Senate Republicans have been blocking dozens of Biden's nominees for diplomatic posts, including Nicholas Burns to be ambassador to China since his nomination in August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's nominee to serve as the top auto safety regulator will vow to address the massive increase in U.S. road deaths, according to congressional testimony seen by Reuters.
Steven Cliff, who was tapped to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), will tell a Senate panel Thursday the United States has ""seen an unprecedented rise in roadway fatalities. I am committed to turning this around.""
He will add the U.S. must learn ""how to change a culture that accepts the loss of tens of thousands of people in roadway crashes as inevitable.""
U.S. traffic deaths soared by 18.4% https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-traffic-deaths-soar-184-first-half-2021-20160-2021-10-28 in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period a year earlier, representing the most deadly first half of a year on American roads since 2006, NHTSA said. It was the largest six-month increase recorded since the current tracing system has been in use since 1975.
Cliff, a former California Air Resources Board official who since February has served as NHTSA's deputy administrator.
Cliff said a new infrastructure bill increases NHTSA’s budget by 50% and ""will improve our understanding of where and how crashes happen by improving data quality and expanding electronic reporting to move from paper-based data collection systems to digital systems.""
Cliff has been a key figure in the Biden administration's proposed rewrite of vehicle fuel economy standards through 2026 and is overseeing its safety investigation of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
The agency, part of the U.S. Transportation Department, faces a backlog of pending auto safety regulations and has not had a Senate-confirmed administrator since January 2017, the month when Republican former President Donald Trump took office.
NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency in August proposed reversing the Trump administration's rollback of Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has experienced a sustained increase in traffic deaths that NHTSA attributes to impaired driving, speeding, a failure to wear seatbelts and other unsafe behavior.

The Biden administration could unveil final fuel economy and vehicle greenhouse gas emissions rules as soon as next year, officials told Reuters.
""I am committed to making the transportation fleet as efficient as possible, to save consumers billions of dollars at the pump, to improve the nation’s energy security and to protect the environment,"" Cliff's testimony says.

Adams, himself a former New York City police captain, will introduce Keechant Sewell at a news conference in Queens on Wednesday, New York's Daily News reported.
“Keechant Sewell is a proven crime fighter with the experience and emotional intelligence to deliver both the safety New Yorkers need and the justice they deserve,” Adams said in a statement published by the newspaper. 
The New York Times reported that Sewell is a 23-year veteran of the police department in Nassau County, New York, where she is chief of detectives. She would be New York City's third Black police commissioner.

The current commissioner, Dermot Shea, was appointed in 2019 by Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Meadows could face criminal prosecution for refusing to cooperate fully with a probe into the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, after the House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to hold him in contempt of Congress.
The Department of Justice will now decide whether to pursue charges. They relate mainly to his refusal to heed a subpoena seeking his testimony about messages and other communications that he has turned over to the panel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Tuesday to ban imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, part of Washington's continued pushback against Beijing's treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority.
The measure passed by unanimous voice vote, after lawmakers agreed on a compromise that eliminated differences between bills introduced in the House and Senate.
The House last week passed its version of the bill, but that measure failed to advance to the Senate. But the Senate is expected to pass the compromise version as soon as Wednesday, sending it to the White House, where President Joe Biden has said he will sign it into law.
""The Administration will work closely with Congress to implement this bill to ensure global supply chains are free of forced labor, while simultaneously working to on-shore and third-shore key supply chains, including semiconductors and clean energy,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.
Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate have been arguing over the Uyghur legislation for months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to approve a Democratic proposal for a U.S. State Department office to address anti-Muslim bias, after a Republican congresswoman used an Islamophobic slur against a Democratic colleague.
The House backed the bill in a party-line vote of 219-212.
The bill, authored by Representative Ilhan Omar, would create a special envoy for monitoring and combating Islamophobia and include state-sponsored anti-Muslim violence in the department's annual human rights reports.
""We are in the midst of a staggering rise of anti-Muslim violence and discrimination around the world,"" Omar said on the House floor. ""Islamophobia is global in scope and we must lead the global effort to address it.""
The House vote comes a few weeks after video emerged showing first-term Republican lawmaker Lauren Boebert calling Omar, a Muslim second-term congresswoman who was born in Somalia, a member of a ""jihad squad.""
That comment led to calls by Democrats for a vote to strip Boebert of her committee assignments, as well as criticism by fellow Republican Representative Nancy Mace.
Republicans have decried the bill, calling it rushed and partisan. 

Debate on the bill stalled for about an hour after Republican congressman Scott Perry accused Omar of being anti-Semitic and affiliated with terrorist organizations. The House chair ruled Perry's words on the House floor impugned Omar's reputation and were inappropriate.
Aides for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer did not respond to requests for comment about the bill. Its fate in that chamber is unclear.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, could face criminal prosecution for refusing to cooperate fully with a probe into the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, after the House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to hold him in contempt of Congress.
The Democratic-led chamber voted 222 to 208, with just two Republicans joining Democrats to recommend the charges against Meadows, who served in the House before joining the Republican president's administration last year.
The Department of Justice will now decide whether to pursue charges. A conviction on the charge carries up to a year in prison.
The seven Democrats and two Republicans on the Select Committee investigating the attack voted unanimously on Monday evening to recommend that the full House approve its report appealing for a contempt of Congress charge against Meadows.
The two Republicans on the Jan. 6 committee, Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, were the only two Republicans who backed the resolution recommending the charges.
The charges against Meadows relate mainly to his refusal to honor a subpoena seeking his testimony about messages and other communications that he has turned over to the panel.
Cheney, the panel's vice chairwoman, read out panicked text messages from unidentified lawmakers and others pleading with Meadows on Jan. 6 to urge Trump to appear publicly and call off his followers. The texts surfaced during the Select Committee's investigation.
""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP. We need an Oval Office address,"" Trump's son Donald Jr. said in one text. In others, conservative media hosts made similar private pleas to Meadows - before playing down the violence of the attack on the air.
""The American people deserve to know all of the steps that Donald Trump and those around him and that his campaign were taking in an effort to change the results of the election,"" Cheney said.
Trump repeated his false claim at a rally on Jan. 6 that his defeat by Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of widespread fraud, and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress gathered to certify Biden's victory. Biden took office on Jan. 20.
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
The city of Washington on Tuesday sued two right-wing groups for the financial costs associated with the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.
'EVERYBODY'S LIFE WAS ENDANGERED'
Republican Representative Tom Cole argued it was too early for a contempt recommendation, given lawsuits filed by Trump and Meadows himself arguing that the former president's communications should be protected by executive privilege and that committee subpoenas are too broad.
""Today's action is wildly premature,"" Cole said. Cole was one of the dozens of Republicans who voted against certifying Biden's election on Jan. 6 in the hours after the assault on the Capitol. 
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Select Committee, said the panel viewed the lawsuits as delaying tactics. ""When a witness defies the law, that amounts to more than obstructing our investigation, it's an attack on the rule of law,"" he said in remarks urging support for the resolution citing Meadows.
Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, said in a statement on Tuesday that his client had not stopped cooperating.
""He has maintained consistently that as a former chief of staff he cannot be compelled to appear for questioning and that he as a witness is not licensed to waive executive privilege claimed by the former president,"" Terwilliger said.
A federal appeals court last week rejected Trump's request to withhold documents because of executive privilege, noting that Biden, as president, has already authorized their release.

""Both branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry into an attack on the legislative branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power,"" the court said.
Meadows could become the third Trump associate to face a criminal contempt charge. The Justice Department, at the House's request, has brought similar charges against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is considering similar action against former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a bid by former President Donald Trump to keep his tax returns from a House of Representatives committee, ruling that Congress' legislative interest outweighed any deference Trump should receive as a former president. 
U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said in his ruling that Trump was ""wrong on the law"" in seeking to block the House Ways and Means Committee from obtaining his tax returns.
McFadden, who also said it was within the power of the committee's chairman to publish the returns if he saw fit, put his ruling on hold for 14 days, allowing time for an appeal. 
Trump was the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.
The committee sued in 2019 to force disclosure of the tax returns, and the dispute lingers nearly 11 months after Trump left office.
Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge told McFadden last month the committee had no legitimate reason to see the tax returns and had asked for them in the hope of uncovering information that could hurt Trump politically.
Strawbridge did not respond to a request for comment on the ruling. 
House Democrats have said they need Trump's tax returns to see if the Internal Revenue Service is properly auditing presidential returns in general and to assess whether new legislation is needed.
""I am pleased that we're now one step closer to being able to conduct more thorough oversight of the IRS’s mandatory presidential audit program,"" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said in a statement.

McFadden, a Trump appointee, said the committee would be able to accomplish its stated objective without publishing the returns.
He cautioned Neal that while he has the right to do so, ""anyone can see that publishing confidential tax information of a political rival is the type of move that will return to plague the inventor.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The city of Washington, D.C., sued right-wing groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers on Tuesday, seeking to collect on the financial costs of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and its aftermath.
The suit aims to hold accountable two groups that prosecutors say played a leading role in an assault by thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump that aimed to prevent Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine told reporters the defendants had caused physical and financial harm to Washington and its residents, adding that the city will seek ""severe"" financial penalties against the defendants.
""Our intent ... is to hold these violent mobsters and these violent hate groups accountable and to get every penny of damage we can,"" he said at a news conference.
The lawsuit seeks to recover the costs of deploying roughly 1,100 city police officers to bolster other police forces who defended the Capitol against the attack, which it says amounts to millions of dollars.
It also seeks to recover medical and paid-leave costs incurred afterward for the more than 65 officers injured during the assault and the more than 1,000 who have sought therapy since.
The suit also brings civil assault and battery charges against the two organizations, along with 30 named and 50 unnamed people it alleges were involved in the riot.
The lawsuit opens up another legal front against alleged participants in the Jan. 6 attack. 
Four people died and hundreds were injured during the multi-hour onslaught, and one police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Four officers who were at the Capitol that day have since taken their own lives.
Prosecutors have filed conspiracy charges against some members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, saying they planned the attack in advance and were in the vanguard of the assault. 
Nearly 700 people overall face criminal charges stemming from the event.
The lawsuit invokes the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which allows people to sue for civil rights violations. The law has been used to target the Klan and other extremist groups - most recently last month, when a jury found https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jury-awards-12-million-damages-over-2017-charlottesville-rally-nbc-news-2021-11-23 the organizers of a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, liable for $26 million in damages. 
The lawsuit does not name Trump or former members of his administration as defendants. 
Members of Congress and several police officers who defended the Capitol have also filed separate lawsuits against the two groups, charging that they conspired with Trump to launch the attack.
It is not clear whether the two groups are in a position to defend themselves, or whether the lawsuit will yield any financial penalties. Lawyers defending several of those named in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Racine and other District officials said they hoped it would also serve as a warning to deter similar behavior by other extremist groups.
""If we don't get a penny in restitution, this lawsuit's deterrent effect will say, 'Be prepared to spend money, because we are coming after you,'"" said Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District in the House of Representatives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday he would oppose President Joe Biden's nominee for Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Robert Califf, because of his ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
Biden nominated Califf, a well-regarded cardiologist and researcher closely linked with the pharmaceutical industry, in November for a second stint as commissioner. Califf previously served as FDA commissioner from February 2016 until the end of then-President Barack Obama's second term in January 2017.
""After leaving the FDA in 2017, he received consulting fees from Merck, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY),"" Sanders said in a statement. ""According to his financial disclosure form, he owns up to $8 million in the stocks of major drug companies. That is exactly the close relationship Big Pharma has exploited to regulate the FDA, instead of the FDA regulating them."" 
Sanders, an independent from Vermont, added: ""I will oppose his nomination."" 
Sanders made the comments after a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee of which he is a member. The committee will vote on whether to confirm Califf before he is considered by the full Senate. It has not scheduled a vote yet.

Senators Joe Manchin and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, have said previously they would oppose the nomination. Democrats have a razor-thin majority in the Senate and so Califf will need Republican support. 
Califf was confirmed for his first term by the Senate 89-4 with broad bipartisan support. The HELP Committee's ranking Republican senator, Richard Burr, said after Tuesday's hearing that he will support Califf.

516,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Democrats introduced legislation to raise the nation’s debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, an amount intended to be enough to extend U.S. borrowing authority until early 2023.
The Senate is expected to clear the legislation on Tuesday, and the House plans to act soon after that. 
“Responsible governing has won on this exceedingly important issue,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. “The American people can breathe easy and rest assured there will not be a default.”
Congress previously approved legislation establishing a one-time process to fast-track the measure by shielding it from the threat of a GOP filibuster in the 50-50 Senate. Instead, the legislation can pass in the Senate with a simply majority.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could hit the debt limit and have difficulty meeting its obligations after Dec. 15, though outside analysts have said the government has a bit more time.
Congress added $480 billion to the U.S. debt ceiling in October after weeks of partisan sniping that unnerved investors. This time, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed on a process that allows the debt ceiling to be lifted without any Republicans having to support it.
Boosting the debt limit will allow the Treasury to replenish its depleted stockpile of cash and remove the risk of non-payment for government securities. Political wrangling over the issue had seen traders impose discounts on Treasuries maturing in the latter half of December. Those discounts were rolled back after news of the debt-ceiling plan, with yields on Treasury bills maturing during the second half of December dropping as much as 5 basis points.
Democrats successfully rebuffed GOP efforts to force them to use the so-called budget reconciliation process -- which they used for a March pandemic-relief bill and are deploying for a $1.6 trillion social-spending bill -- to boost the debt ceiling. That route would have involved substantially more parliamentary maneuvering, amid a year-end calendar already burdened with tasks for the legislature.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on Tuesday to recommend ""contempt of Congress"" charges against former President Donald Trump's last chief of staff, Mark Meadows for refusing to cooperate with an probe of the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.
Meadows has turned over some information to the committee probing the attack, but has declined to hand over other documents, arguing that they are protected because he worked for the president. He has also declined to appear for a deposition.
Meadows could become the third Trump associate to face a criminal contempt of Congress charge. The Justice Department, at the House's request, has already brought similar charges against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is also considering similar action against former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark.
Here's an explanation of the criminal charges Meadows could possibly face:
IS IT A CRIME TO DEFY A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA?
Yes, an 1857 law says failure to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony or documents is a misdemeanor, punishable by one to 12 months imprisonment.
This law, known as the ""contempt of Congress"" statute, outlines a process for the House or Senate to refer a non-compliant witness for criminal prosecution. The U.S. Justice Department then decides whether to bring criminal charges.
A final resolution could take time. Bannon's contempt trial is set to begin on July 18, just months before the Nov. 8 elections that determine control of Congress. If Trump's Republicans win back the House, they would have the power to dissolve the Select Committee the following January.
DOES CONGRESS HAVE OTHER OPTIONS FOR ENFORCING SUBPOENAS?
The Supreme Court said in 1821 that Congress has ""inherent authority"" to arrest and detain recalcitrant witnesses on its own, without the Justice Department's help.
But it has been almost a century since Congress exercised this arrest-and-detain authority, and the practice is unlikely to make a comeback, legal experts said.
During Trump's impeachment trials, senior Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Adam Schiff, discussed reviving this power, known as inherent contempt.
Instead of jailing recalcitrant witnesses, the House could issue daily fines, Schiff said in 2019. Democrats never followed through on that proposal.
WHAT ABOUT CIVIL LITIGATION?
The House sued recalcitrant witnesses during Trump's presidency in an attempt to get them to cooperate, but the court cases unfolded slowly. A lawsuit over whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must hand over Trump's tax returns to a House committee has still not produced a single ruling on the merits.
Trump has filed a lawsuit to keep Jan. 6-related material private, but a federal appeals court rejected his claim on Dec. 9. He is expected to ask the Supreme Court to consider the case.

Meadows, who was a House member for more than seven years until joining the Trump administration in 2020, has also filed a lawsuit saying the chamber is overstepping its boundaries.
The Select Committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, says Meadow's lawsuit is baseless because he has already shared details about the Jan. 6 attack in a book.

The following texts were made public in a meeting of the House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the attack. The full House will vote on Tuesday on whether to seek a contempt of Congress charge against Meadows for his failure to cooperate with the probe.
Following are quotes from texts Meadows provided the committee, as read by Republican Representative Liz Cheney during a committee hearing:

JAKARTA (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a plea on Tuesday to the U.S. Senate to speed up the confirmations of President Joe Biden's nominees to the post of ambassador, saying delays hampered efforts to tackle foreign policy challenges. 
Biden has pledged to restore U.S. leadership in the world through diplomacy, after four years of a unilateral approach espoused by his predecessor Donald Trump, and having Senate-confirmed nominees is crucial in achieving that goal.
""This is a huge problem,"" Blinken told a news conference in Jakarta, the first stop on a Southeast Asia trip that will cover Malaysia and Thailand. ""For the sake of our national security, the Senate must act,"" he said.
Nominees do not become ambassadors until they are confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
By last week, just 16% of the Biden administration's ambassadors were confirmed, Blinken said, compared with the level of 70% to 90% by the same point in the three previous administrations. 
""Virtually every challenge we face, including dealing with Russia, with China, with non-state factors, we're hampered by the fact that we don't have our full national security and foreign policy team on the field.""
He added that he had spoken about the problem with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday night.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz has put a hold on Biden's nominees as he wants the president to impose sanctions that would halt Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

Cruz has wielded power by being a lone holdout on a fast-track confirmation process that requires consent by all 100 senators for non-controversial nominees.
In November, Republican Senator Marco Rubio put a hold on Nicholas Burns, Biden's nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Beijing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol voted unanimously on Monday to seek ""contempt of Congress"" charges against Mark Meadows, who served as White House chief of staff to former President Donald Trump.
The seven Democratic and two Republican members of the House of Representatives Select Committee approved a report recommending the criminal charge against Meadows by a 9-0 vote. The full, Democratic-led House could vote as soon as Tuesday to approve the resolution.
Meadows has been called repeatedly to appear for depositions before the Democratic-led committee and has declined to do so despite being subpoenaed.
While he has turned over some information requested by the panel, he has held back many documents, arguing they are protected because he had worked for the president.
Asked about the committee decision in a Fox News Channel interview, Meadows said: ""Obviously it's disappointing but not surprising.""
""This is about Donald Trump and about actually going after him once again,"" Meadows said.
Meadows, who was a member of the House for more than seven years until joining the Trump administration in 2020, has sued the committee and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the matter.
His attorney, George Terwilliger, also sent a letter on Monday asking the committee to reconsider its plan to vote, arguing that it would be illegal for the panel to refer the matter for a House vote.
Representative Bennie Thompson, the Select Committee's chairman, discounted that argument, noting that Meadows published and is promoting a book that goes into detail about events being investigated.
""He has no credible excuse for stonewalling the Select Committee's investigation,"" Thompson said.
Thompson said about 300 witnesses have testified, and its investigators have received more than 30,000 records.
""A small group of people have gotten a lot of attention because of their defiance. But many others have taken a different path and provided important information about January 6 and the context in which the riot occurred,"" Thompson said.
'PROTECT PRO-TRUMP PEOPLE'
In its report on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-panel-details-case-against-former-top-trump-aide-meadows-2021-12-13 recommending the contempt charge, the Select Committee said Meadows stated in an email ahead of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that the U.S. National Guard would ""protect pro-Trump people."" 
Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the Jan. 6 committee's vice chair, said the committee wanted Meadows to testify about ""dozens of texts"" he was sent during the Capitol attack, including from Donald Trump Jr. saying his father should tell his supporters to go home.
""We cannot surrender to President Trump's efforts to hide what happened,"" she said.
Committee members also said they wanted to ask Meadows about his text messages from members of Congress - who were not named - discussing ways to avoiding certifying the election result.
Meadows could become the third associate of the former Republican president to face a criminal contempt of Congress charge. The Justice Department, at the House's request, has already brought similar charges against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is also considering similar action against former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.

Trump, at a rally on Jan. 6, repeated his false claim that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of widespread fraud, and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol.
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters hoping to stop formal certification of his election defeat, and four officers have since taken their own lives.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday approved federal assistance for Tennessee and ordered that state and local response efforts be supplemented after a swarm of tornadoes struck the region on Friday.

The U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the deadly riot recommends in the report that Meadows be prosecuted for refusing to fully cooperate with its inquiry. The committee is due to vote on the issue on Monday.
Meadow's Jan. 5 email about the National Guard, in which he indicated troops would be present and more would be on standby, was one of the issues the committee was hoping to question him about, it said in the report.
Meadows has been called repeatedly to appear for depositions before the Democratic-led Select Committee and has declined to do so despite being subpoenaed. While he has turned over some information requested by the panel, he has held back many documents, arguing they are protected because his testimony may be covered by executive privilege because he was working for the president.
""To be clear, Mr Meadows' failure to comply, and this contempt recommendation, are not based on good-faith disagreements over privilege assertions,"" the committee said.
""Rather, Mr Meadows has failed to comply and warrants contempt findings because he has wholly refused to appear to provide any testimony.""
A House member before joining the Trump administration, Meadows could become the third associate of the former Republican president to face a criminal contempt charge. The Justice Department, at the House's request, has already brought similar charges against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is also considering similar action against former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.

Meadows has filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Select Committee, accusing it of violating legal protections for a senior adviser to a president and using excessively broad subpoenas to obtain his mobile telephone data.
Trump, at a rally on Jan. 6, repeated his unfounded allegation that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of fraud, and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol.

523,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Tuesday to raise the federal government's $28.9 trillion limit debt limit, avoiding an unprecedented default as soon as later this month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday.
""The Senate will act tomorrow to prevent default,"" Schumer, a Democrat, said in a speech to the Senate.
Senate Republicans had resisted voting on the debt ceiling for months, seeking to link the move to President Joe Biden's proposed $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" domestic spending bill that Republicans oppose.
Democrats note the legislation is needed to finance substantial debt incurred during former President Donald Trump's administration, when Republicans willingly increased Washington's credit card bill by about $7.85 trillion, partly through sweeping tax cuts and spending to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lawmakers agreed last week to legislation that prevents the use of stalling tactics in this case, allowing the Senate to move quickly to approve raising the debt ceiling by a simple majority vote of Democrats in the chamber.

That is the legislation that Schumer is expected to bring to the floor for a vote on Tuesday. The Democratic-led House of Representatives is also expected to vote on it Tuesday, and if it passes both chambers as expected, Biden will sign it into law.
The specific dollar amount for increasing the current $28.9 trillion debt limit has not been disclosed, but it was expected to be in the range of $2 trillion to $3 trillion and is intended to keep Treasury Department borrowing operating normally at least through the November 2022 congressional elections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats hope in the coming days to pass a mammoth social spending bill they believe could help keep the party in power in next year’s crucial midterm elections, but sky-rocketing consumer prices are wreaking havoc with that plan. 
Friday’s announcement that inflation was rising at the fastest pace in almost 40 years appeared to endanger the fate of the $1.75 trillion bill, while handing Republicans a new weapon with which to attack the legislation.
Frustrated by polls showing large swaths of voters are not giving Democratic President Joe Biden credit for the rebounding economy, some Democrats view the bill, dubbed Build Back Better, as a way to show voters that progress on kitchen-table economic issues is indeed being made. 
“If we do not pass this bill, there is no chance of surviving in the midterms,” said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at Third Way, which advocates for centrist Democratic policies.
Rising prices for food, fuel and other household goods have complicated Biden’s legislative push. Friday’s report showing that the pace of inflation reached its highest rate since 1982 prompted a fresh messaging challenge for the administration.
Republicans for months have claimed that prior spending by Democrats on coronavirus stimulus and infrastructure measures caused the spike in prices and that Build Back Better would make things worse. 
“Prices keep rising and all Democrats want to do is spend trillions more in taxpayer money,” said Michael McAdams, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which backs Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Consumer prices began to rise as a result of stimulus spending during the Trump administration and have been exacerbated by supply chain disruptions largely out of the White House’s control. Economists in leading ratings agencies have said the Build Back Better bill would not add to inflationary pressure .
Over the weekend, the White House released a memo that argued the bill would benefit struggling families by lowering costs on health care, prescription drugs and child care. 
“Instead of working with the president to fight inflation, Republicans are playing politics with higher prices,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director, said in the memo. 
THE WRONG DIRECTION
According to an Oct. 18-22 Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll, a bipartisan majority of Americans agreed that inflation is a “very big concern for me” and that job creation should be a top priority for the country. Overall, 67% of U.S. adults agreed that inflation is a very big concern, including 64% of Democrats, 79% of Republicans and 62% of independents. 
The October poll also found that only 29% of adults described the economy as heading in the “right direction,” including 48% of Democrats, 11% of Republicans and 21% of independents.
A version of Build Back Better passed the House last month, but the road to passage in the Senate is rockier. Biden will need the vote of all 50 Senate Democrats, plus Vice President Kamala Harris, under a budget process known as reconciliation. 
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has emerged as the most skeptical voice on the bill. He reiterated last week before the latest inflation report that he was concerned about the state of the economy, and it remains possible the bill will be further modified to address his concerns. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has been pushing for a floor vote by Christmas.
Democrats already face fierce headwinds in their bid to retain control of Congress. Historically, the party in power loses seats. Moreover, Republicans in several states are redrawing congressional maps to eliminate competitive districts.
What is especially vexing for Democrats, Third Way and other groups say, is that elements of the Build Back Better bill – such as universal preschool, an enhanced child-care tax credit and larger healthcare subsidies – are popular with voters, but many are unaware they are in the bill. The White House has contended that Democratic infighting over the bill’s price tag has taken the focus from its components.

Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, said passage of the bill is critical ahead of the midterms – regardless of the risk of playing into Republican hands on inflation. 
“We’re going into 2022 with very little to show,” he said. “We need to show that once we take the reins of governing power, we have the ability to quickly deliver.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading Georgia legislator has introduced a bill that would eliminate absentee ballot drop boxes, a favored and highly-used tool last November that allowed voters to safely cast ballots during the coronavirus pandemic.
Butch Miller, the No.2 Republican in Georgia's Republican-controlled senate and a candidate for lieutenant governor in the 2022 elections, said drop boxes were a “weak link” in guarding against voter fraud, according to a statement released by his office. 
Former President Donald Trump had criticized Miller, the Georgia Senate’s president pro tempore, for not doing more to pursue his false voter fraud allegations and has said he will not support Miller's bid for lieutenant governor.
Georgia will see two high-profile contests next year, when former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams likely takes on Republican Governor Brian Kemp in rematch of their 2018 battle. Kemp must first fend off a primary challenge from David Perdue, a Trump-backed former U.S. senator who has endorsed his false election fraud claims. 
Democratic U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock, the state’s first African-American senator, is up for re-election. The leading Republican candidate is Herschel Walker, a former football star at the University of Georgia and in the NFL. 
The southern state became a flashpoint of baseless election conspiracy theories after President Joe Biden's upset victory over Trump last November. Kemp and the state's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, have insisted no widespread fraud occurred.
Democrats narrowly won two U.S. Senate races in the state that gave them majority control of that chamber. Warnock won one of them in a special run-off for the final two years of a term after Republican Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. 
Earlier this year, the Georgia legislature passed a voting reform measure that sharply limited the number of drop boxes, disproportionately affecting Democratic-leaning, urban counties with significant Black populations that relied on the boxes during the pandemic. The law also shortened the time for requesting an absentee ballot. 

The U.S. Justice Department sued the state in June, alleging that several provisions in the bill were adopted with the purpose of suppressing the right to vote on account of race.
In addition, the general assembly passed a series of county-specific bills that handed greater control of local election boards to Republican county commissions, pushing out some outspoken Black advocates in the process.

Biden spoke after getting an update on the tornado relief effort from his top advisers. He said he would soon approve a request for emergency assistance from Illinois.
The White House said Biden would travel to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for a storm briefing, and to Mayfield and Dawson Springs, Kentucky, to survey storm damage.

Biden vowed the federal government would provide ""whatever they need when they need it.""

527,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Democratic Senator Joe Manchin isn’t closing the door Senate passage of President Joe Biden’s economic package by the end of the year, but said he has growing concerns about rising U.S. debt and soaring consumer prices, after a measure of inflation hit the highest in four decades.
The West Virginia Democrat, who said he’ll be talking with Biden later today about the roughly $2 trillion social-spending package, also said Congress also needs to account for foreign policy challenges that might compete for resources -- including Russia’s troop buildup on the border with Ukraine and China’s threats to Taiwan.
“Inflation is real,” Manchin told reporters. “It’s not transitory. It’s alarming it’s going up, not down. And I think we should be more concerned about geopolitical fallout.”
Biden, speaking to reporters separately on Monday, declined to specify his message to Manchin in their expected call. He said his objective when speaking with lawmakers generally is to “convince them that what I’m proposing makes sense and it’s not inconsistent with what they believe.”
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer insists the Senate will pass the sweeping tax-and-spending package before Christmas, but there’s still much work to do and time is running short. 
Manchin also said that he still wants a package of about $1.7 trillion, adding that “whatever Congress is considering doing we should do it within the limits of what we can afford.”
He said he’s increasingly concerned about the way Democrats are making some programs in the so-called Build Back Better legislation temporary -- which he says hides their true costs over 10 years.

A Congressional Budget Office analysis requested by GOP Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) of South Carolina showed that Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan would -- if new and expanded programs are made permanent without new revenue -- cost far more than Democrats say.
The bill would add $3 trillion in deficits over ten years, the CBO said under the assumptions Graham asked them to use. That compares with $200 billion in deficits added under CBO’s score of the bill as written.
The White House and congressional Democratic leaders disputed the premise of the CBO report, arguing that Biden has long said he would only support expanding programs if doing so was fully paid for.
In addition, key pieces of the bill that are still under negotiation include a House-passed provision for four weeks of paid family and medical leave that Manchin opposes.
Also unresolved is an expansion of the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, which currently has a $10,000 cap. The House-passed version of Biden’s so-called Build Back Better bill lifted the cap on the write-off to $80,000.
Senators Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, say the House approach is too generous. They are instead looking at limiting the tax break to those under a certain income threshold, but disagree on what that should be.
Manchin’s vote is crucial for passage in a Senate split 50-50 between the two political parties. All Republicans in the chamber oppose the package.
The economic program would boost taxes on the wealthy and corporations while providing universal pre-kindergarten schooling, childcare subsidies, climate-change protections, expanded Obamacare health-insurance subsidies, and the ability of Medicare to negotiate prices on some medicines.

By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot said on Friday it had issued six more subpoenas demanding information from witnesses, including some top aides from former President Donald Trump's White House.
The House of Representatives Select Committee issued subpoenas to Brian Jack, who was Trump's White House political director; Max Miller, a former special assistant to Trump now running for a House seat in Ohio with Trump's endorsement; and Bobby Peede, former director of the White House advance staff, which prepared events for Trump's arrival.
The committee said Peede and Miller met with Trump in a private dining room at the White House to discuss Trump's rally on Jan. 6 - the day his supporters marched on the Capitol - and that Jack reportedly reached out to several members of Congress on Trump's behalf to invite them to speak at the rally.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy later hired Jack to lead his congressional political operation.
""Some of the witnesses we subpoenaed today apparently worked to stage the rallies on Jan. 5th and 6th, and some appeared to have had direct communication with the former President regarding the rally at the Ellipse directly preceding the attack on the U.S. Capitol,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said in a statement.
The committee also issued subpoenas to Bryan Lewis, who the committee said obtained a permit for a rally outside the Capitol; Ed Martin, whom the committee described as an organizer of Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" movement falsely claiming Trump did not lose the election, and Kim Fletcher, who runs a pro-Trump organization called Moms for America that organized a rally near the Capitol on Jan. 5.
The individuals sent the subpoenas could not be reached for comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 275 witnesses in its investigation of the attack by supporters of the Republican ex-president as Congress met to formally certify his November 2020 presidential election defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.
Four people died the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught, and four officers have since taken their own lives.

The panel has begun contempt of Congress proceedings against three Trump supporters for failure to comply with its subpoenas - former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, and Jeffrey Clark, a former Trump Justice Department official.
Trump has urged associates not to cooperate, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege. Multiple courts have rejected that argument, with the federal appeals court in Washington on Thursday saying Trump had provided ""no basis"" for his claim.

As part of the declaration, federal aid will be provided to affected individuals in the counties of Caldwell, Fulton, Graves, Hopkins, Marshall, Muhlenberg, Taylor, and Warren, the statement said.
The aid will include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear formally requested the declaration on Sunday after the twisters obliterated the small city of Mayfield and destroyed a candle factory.
Biden received the request and approved it on Sunday evening, an administration official said.
The governor said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state's history and that even the sturdiest structures of steel and brick were flattened. One twister tore across 227 miles (365 km) of terrain, almost all of that in Kentucky, Beshear said.
The Democratic president had previously declared the storms a federal emergency, enabling the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist in the aftermath as thousands face housing, food, water and power shortages. 

But under an emergency declaration assistance is limited to $5 million, according to the FEMA website.
A major disaster declaration has no such limit and ""provides a wide range of federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including funds for both emergency and permanent work,"" FEMA's website says.

ATLANTA (Reuters) -Weeks after the 2020 election, a Chicago publicist for hip-hop artist Kanye West traveled to the suburban home of Ruby Freeman, a frightened Georgia election worker who was facing death threats after being falsely accused by former President Donald Trump of manipulating votes. The publicist knocked on the door and offered to help.
The visitor, Trevian Kutti, gave her name but didn’t say she worked for West, a longtime billionaire friend of Trump. She said she was sent by a “high-profile individual,” whom she didn’t identify, to give Freeman an urgent message: confess to Trump’s voter-fraud allegations, or people would come to her home in 48 hours, and she’d go to jail.
Freeman refused. This story of how an associate of a music mogul pressured a 62-year-old temporary election worker at the center of a Trump conspiracy theory is based on previously unreported police recordings and reports, legal filings, and Freeman’s first media interview since she was dragged into Trump’s attempt to reverse his election loss.
Kutti did not respond to requests for comment. Her biography for her work at the Women’s Global Initiative, a business networking group, identifies her as a member of “the Young Black Leadership Council under President Donald Trump.” It notes that in September 2018, she “was secured as publicist to Kanye West” and “now serves as West’s Director of Operations.”
After this story was published, a representative for West said Kutti https://www.reuters.com/world/us/publicist-was-not-associated-with-kanye-west-when-she-pressured-election-worker-2021-12-13 was not associated with the music star when she met Freeman. Pierre Rougier, a spokesperson for the rapper, said on Sunday: “Trevian Kutti was not associated with Kanye West or any of his enterprises at the times of the facts that are reported in these articles or since these facts occurred.”
Rougier did not answer additional questions about whether Kutti worked for West at other times, or whether West and Kutti knew one another. Before publishing this article, Reuters reached out to a different representative for West but did not get a response.
When Kutti knocked on Freeman's door on Jan. 4, Freeman called 911. By then, Freeman said, she was wary of strangers.
Starting on Dec. 3, Trump and his campaign repeatedly accused Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, of illegally counting phony mail-in ballots after pulling them from mysterious suitcases while working on Election Day at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena. In fact, the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers, and the votes were properly counted, county and state officials quickly confirmed, refuting the fraud claims.
But Trump and his allies continued to accuse Freeman and Moss of election-rigging. The allegations inspired hundreds of threats and harassing messages against them and their family members.
By the time Kutti arrived, Freeman needed help but was cautious and wouldn’t open the door because of the threats, according to Freeman and a police report.
So Freeman asked a neighbor to come over and talk with Kutti, who was with an unidentified male. Like Freeman, Kutti and the other visitor were Black. Kutti told the neighbor that Freeman was in danger and that she’d been sent to provide assistance. Freeman said she was open to meeting them. She asked Cobb County Police to send an officer to keep watch so she could step outside, according to a recording of her 911 call.
“They’re saying that I need help,” Freeman told the dispatcher, referring to the people at her door, “that it’s just a matter of time that they are going to come out for me and my family.” 
An officer arrived and spoke with Kutti, who described herself as a “crisis manager,” according to the police incident report.
Kutti repeated that Freeman “was in danger” and had “48 hours” before “unknown subjects” turned up at her home, the report said. At the officer’s suggestion, the women agreed to meet at a police station. The officer’s report did not identify the man accompanying Kutti.
'YOU’RE A LOOSE END'
Inside the station, Kutti and Freeman met in a corner, according to footage from a body camera worn by an officer present at the meeting. Reuters obtained the video through a public-records request.
“I cannot say what specifically will take place,” Kutti is heard telling Freeman in the recording. “I just know that it will disrupt your freedom,"" she said, ""and the freedom of one or more of your family members.”
“You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up,” Kutti continued. She added that “federal people” were involved, without offering specifics.
According to Freeman, Kutti told her that she was going to put a man named “Harrison Ford” on speakerphone. (Freeman said the man on the phone wasn’t the actor by the same name.) Kutti said the man had “authoritative powers to get you protection,” the bodycam footage shows.
At that point, Kutti can be heard asking the officer to give them privacy. The body camera did not capture a clear recording of the conversation that followed after the officer moved away from the two women.
Kutti and the man on the speakerphone, over the next hour, tried to get Freeman to implicate herself in committing voter fraud on Election Day, according to Freeman. Kutti offered legal assistance in exchange, Freeman said.
“If you don't tell everything,” Freeman recalled Kutti saying, “you're going to jail.” 
Growing suspicious, Freeman said she jumped up from her chair and told Kutti: “The devil is a liar,” before calling for an officer.
Later at home, Freeman said, she Googled Kutti’s name and discovered she was a Trump supporter.
Police say they did not investigate the incident further.
West, who changed his name in October to “Ye,” did not respond to requests for comment sent through another publicist who represents him.
Media reports have cited Kutti's association with the rapper since 2018, when she ceased working with R. Kelly, an R&B singer who was convicted in September of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges. Kutti's biography says she is the founder of Trevian Worldwide, a media and entertainment advisory firm with offices in four cities. Among her clients, she says, are boxer Terence Crawford and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan.
The meeting took place two months after West ended a failed bid for the White House that drew media attention when several publications revealed that allies and supporters of Trump were working on the ground to advance West’s campaign. Some Democrats said they regarded West’s presidential bid as a ruse to siphon off Black votes from Democrat Joe Biden. Groups assisting the rapper’s campaign denied that charge.

On Jan. 5, the day after Freeman's meeting with Kutti, an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation called Freeman and urged her to leave her home of 20 years because it wasn’t safe, Freeman said.
The following day, Jan. 6, Kutti’s prediction that people would descend on Freeman’s home in 48 hours proved correct, according to a defamation lawsuit Freeman and Moss filed last week against a far-right news site. Freeman, the lawsuit said, left hours before a mob of angry Trump supporters surrounded her home, shouting through bullhorns.

""I've got towns that are gone,"" Beshear said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""My dad's home town, Paxton, isn't standing. It is hard to describe.""
The devastation goes on for a dozen blocks in some places and there are many people without power, he said. The state has a strong rescue effort in place, he said, but the damage is prohibitive and it will take time. 
""You think you can go door to door to check on people and see if they're OK - there are no doors. The question is, is somebody in the rubble of thousands upon thousands of structures?"" he said. ""It is devastating.""

Beshear could not provide a number of people in his state who have been reported missing. He said in his family's home town, Dawson Springs, population 2,700, the list of unaccounted for ran to eight pages, single-spaced. ""It's pretty bad,"" he said.

The Supreme Court on Friday left in effect the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.
The Texas law was designed by the state's Republican-controlled legislature to avoid normal means of legal challenge, because rather than making state officials responsible for enforcement, it instead gave private individuals anywhere the right to sue doctors who provide abortion services in Texas and anyone else who ""aids or abets"" the process.
While allowing the Texas law to remain in effect, the court ruled legal challenges may proceed against the measure, which critics say amounts to vigilante justice.
Newsom, a Democrat, said on Saturday his team will work with state Attorney General Rob Bonta and the legislature to draft a proposal in line with the Texas law that would let citizens sue manufacturers, sellers or distributors of assault weapons or ghost gun kits for at least $10,000 per violation.
""I am outraged by yesterday's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Texas's ban on most abortion services to remain in place,"" Newsom said in a statement https:// 
""If states can now shield their laws from review by the federal courts that compare assault weapons to Swiss Army knives, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives, where Texas used it to put women in harm's way.""

Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent to Friday's decision, blasted the court's majority for failing to ""put an end to this madness"" and warned that other states could try to copy the Texas enforcement mechanism.
President Joe Biden said he was ""very concerned"" by the decision to leave in place the abortion ban but said it was ""encouraging"" that the court allowed part of the abortion providers' lawsuit to continue.

The subpoena was issued in November by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis as part of its probe of whether former Trump administration officials mishandled the federal response to the pandemic by interfering with its own health agency's work. Nearly 800,000 people have died in the United States from the pandemic. 
Navarro, a Republican, also served as one of former President Donald Trump's pandemic response advisers and was responsible for procurement in the coronavirus response, among other things. Navarro said in a letter to the subcommittee he would not cooperate because Trump told him to ""protect executive privilege.""
""It is a direct order that I should not comply with the subpoena,"" Navarro said in a letter to the committee, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Representative James Clyburn, a Democrat and chairman of the coronavirus crisis panel, said in a letter to Navarro that he had no valid basis for refusing to comply and that he had waived any privilege by writing about conversations with Trump on the coronavirus response. 
The refusal is ""particularly indefensible given that you disclosed many details about your work in the White House, including details of conversations with the former President about the pandemic response, in your recent book and related press tour,"" Clyburn said in the letter. 
Navarro could not be immediately reached for a response to Clyburn's letter. 

Clyburn said the subcommittee expects Navarro to produce all records and information in his possession and appear for a deposition on Dec. 15, as the subpoena requires. 
Clyburn said when the subpoena was issued that ""rather than implement a coordinated national strategy to alleviate critical supply shortages, Mr. Navarro and other Trump Administration officials pushed responsibility to the states and pursued a haphazard and ineffective approach to procurement -- contributing to severe shortages of critically needed supplies and putting American lives at risk.""

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday approved an emergency declaration for Kentucky after the state was battered by a swarm of tornadoes that killed at least 70 people.
The storms, which weather forecasters said are unusual in cooler months, demolished a candle factory and a fire station in one Kentucky town, devastated a Missouri nursing home and killed at least two workers in an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Illinois. 
Biden has ordered federal aid to supplement the response from state and local authorities, the White House said.
""It's a tragedy. And we still don't know how many lives were lost and the full extent of the damage,"" Biden told reporters.
Asked if he thought climate change played a role in the devastation of the storms, Biden said he would be asking the Environmental Protection Agency and others to take a look.
""Acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent a continued movement on dealing with global warming, is just not going to happen,"" he said.
Biden also said a longer-term question, beyond the immediate response, sparked by the disaster for the states and the nation would be about the tornado warning systems.
""One of the questions that are going to be raised, I'm confident, is: What warning was there? And was it strong enough and was it heeded?"" Biden said.

Earlier on Saturday, Biden had spoken with the governors of five of the states hit by the storms - Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee - to express condolences and a commitment to delivering aid quickly, according to the White House.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending emergency response personnel, water and other needed commodities to seven states affected, and Biden has ordered a surge of resources to locations with the greatest need that will make other federal resources and personnel available.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Congress attacked Democratic President Joe Biden's proposed $1.75 trillion social bill on Friday, releasing a nonpartisan estimate that said it could increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion over a decade if its programs are made permanent.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) had asked the Congressional Budget Office to calculate the bill's effects https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/whats-bidens-175-trillion-build-back-better-package-2021-11-05 on the deficit if programs -- including a child tax credit and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds -- would continue over 10 years, rather than phasing out sooner as proposed by Democrats.
Republicans had earlier criticized the phaseouts as maneuvers to underestimate the bill's cost, and contend the bill would worsen inflation. Consumer prices on Friday notched their biggest gain https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-further-november-2021-12-10 since 1982. 
The new forecast comes a month after the CBO released an estimate saying the bill that has passed the House of Representatives would increase federal budget deficits by $367 billion over 10 years. 
That does not take into account some $207 billion in revenue that could be raised by improved tax enforcement, the CBO estimates. This, however, is only about half what the Biden administration says better tax enforcement could raise.
""Nobody believes these programs are going to end. Democrats want them to go on,"" Graham told reporters. ""I am begging some reasonable Democrats out there to stop this train.""
Democrats scorned the attack, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a ""phony score of an imaginary bill."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the existing proposal is paid for and any future extensions would be too.
The bill calls for the child tax cut to expire after one year, with free preschool and child-care subsidies expiring after six years.
Amid a flurry of activity in Congress that saw lawmakers avert a government shutdown and take the first steps toward raising the federal government's $28.9 trillion debt limit, thus averting an unprecedented default, there has been little visible progress on passing Biden's $1.75 trillion Build Back Better bill.
That package, the heart of Biden's social and climate agenda, would provide free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, boost coverage of home-care costs for the elderly and disabled, significantly lower the cost of some prescription drugs such as insulin, and expand affordable housing programs.
Two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have not committed to supporting Build Back Better, and both parties are lobbying them for support. Every Senate Democrat's vote will be needed if the party is to pass the measure without the backing of the chamber's Republicans, who unanimously oppose it.
Manchin in particular has expressed concern about large amounts of spending and their possible inflationary impact, and at one point last month accused his fellow Democrats of playing ""shell games"" with the program's cost. Biden told reporters on Friday that he'd be talking to Manchin next week.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen argued this week that it is inappropriate to judge the social policy bill based on assumptions concerning future acts of Congress.
""This analysis is of a bill that the House did not pass, the Senate is not considering, and the President - who has committed to paying for permanent investment - would not sign,"" she said in a memo to lawmakers seen by Reuters.
The surge in inflation this year to a near four-decade high as of November has become a favorite club by Republicans for bashing Biden's ambitious spending proposals.
There is little hard evidence that the plan - spread out over a decade - would have the same impact on elevating consumer demand and thus inflation as previous pandemic-relief spending bulges under both Biden and his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump.

Still, inflation is now the central economic concern voiced by American consumers, far more so than unemployment, which could make Democrats' jobs harder in selling what Biden has billed as a ""blue-collar jobs bill.""
""When directly asked whether inflation or unemployment was the more serious problem facing the nation, 76% selected inflation while just 21% selected unemployment,"" Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's widely followed Consumer Sentiment Index said on Friday in a statement accompanying the series' latest reading for early December. 
 
"
538,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New data showing the highest U.S. rate of inflation in four decades offer fresh ammunition to Republican critics of President Joe Biden’s signature tax and spending plan who say the roughly $2 trillion proposal would increase costs, and threatens to push Democratic Senator Joe Manchin to kill the bill. 
To make matters worse for the president, another analysis released Friday shortly after the inflation report showed that Biden’s Build Back Better plan would cost far more than Democrats say, if new and expanded programs are made permanent without new revenue. 
“This is a one-two punch to Build Back Better,” South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) said of the November consumer price index data and the Republican-requested report on the cost of making the Biden plan permanent.
Manchin, the Senate’s most conservative Democrat who has the power to crush Biden’s roughly $2 trillion agenda in a Senate divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, has yet to comment on the reports but remains the key holdout on Biden’s bill. Manchin has said he wants to see the final text of the legislation Democratic leaders plan to bring to the floor.
Republicans who have been appealing to Manchin to sink the bill trumpeted the 6.8% annual gain in the consumer price index to buttress their argument that it’s time to rein in the government, not expand it.
“It is unthinkable that Senate Democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Democratic leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi counter that Build Back Better would reduce costs for middle-class families on some of their biggest bills.
‘Add Urgency’
“November’s inflation numbers only add urgency to passing the Build Back Better Act to lower the costs that weigh heaviest on working families’ budgets, from the price of child care to health care to prescription drugs and more,” she said.
Biden said in a statement that U.S. price increases slowed after the November CPI data, in particular for gasoline and cars. “Developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we’d like,” he said.
Manchin has long argued that the Federal Reserve has printed too much money at a time of rising costs, and said Thursday night in a brief interview he’s still trying to set up another meeting with Fed Chair Jerome Powell to discuss Powell’s plans to rein in inflation. 
Manchin has previously urged a pause on Biden’s tax and spending bill, and a much smaller price tag of $1.5 trillion over a decade. In recent weeks he has been negotiating with fellow Democrats on several issues, including energy and tax policy.
Manchin, whose home state of West Virginia was overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump, has also complained that Democrats allowed Biden’s child tax credit and other measures to expire earlier to shrink the price tag. That would require a future Congress to decide whether, and how, to extend them.
CBO Analysis
The Congressional Budget Office on Friday produced an analysis at the request of Republicans showing that if benefit programs in the bill were extended without paying for them, then the bill would add $3 trillion in deficits over ten years. That compares to $200 billion in deficits added under CBO’s score of the bill as written. 
“Joe Manchin has been wanting to know without gimmicks how much the bill costs,” Graham said. “We now know, more than double.”
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Republican-requested CBO report “fake scores based on mistruths” because it does not take into account Democrats’ commitment to ensuring any extensions of the bill’s benefits be fully offset. The White House has said Biden only supports making the benefits in his bill permanent if they are paid for.
The political consequences and financial fallout of a failure to pass Biden’s plan could be swift, with child tax credit payments of as much as $300-a-month per child running out this month. Finance Chairman Ron Wyden said Thursday he’s focused on passing the bill by December 28 to ensure those payments go out without delay in January.
Among Manchin’s concerns is the sizable federal deficit as well as growing red ink from entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. He has criticized proposals to expand and create other social programs like a paid family leave program until existing programs are made solvent for the long term.
Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona had earlier forced the package to shrink from $3.5 trillion. But rather than jettison major planks, Democrats over Manchin’s objections mostly phased out programs earlier, with the intention of extending them later.
Manchin and Republicans complained that doing so masked the true cost of the proposal if all of the programs were extended as the Biden administration wants, though Biden has said he would insist future extensions not add to the deficit.
Manchin has also pushed for work requirements and limiting who can get benefits and tax credits, though other Democrats have pushed back hard on both ideas.

Russell, currently director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office and assistant to the president, will mark the eighth American to head UNICEF. Since it was established in 1946, all of the agency's executive directors have been American.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed and sent to President Joe Biden the first of two bills needed to raise the federal government's $28.9 trillion debt limit and avert an unprecedented default https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/what-happens-if-washington-falls-behind-its-bills-2021-12-03.
The Senate voted 59-35 for the measure, with 10 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, backing the bill, which allows an upcoming vote on raising the debt ceiling to pass the chamber with a simple majority. McConnell said earlier this week that he believed the procedure was in the best interests of the country because it avoids default.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the legislation on Wednesday night by 222-212, with only one Republican backing it.
Biden is expected to promptly sign the unusual procedural measure that paves the way for the second bill, which would actually increase government borrowing authority, to pass in coming days.
""I want to be clear, this is about paying debt accumulated by both parties. So I'm pleased we were able to facilitate a process with the supportive members from both parties that avoids needless and catastrophic default,"" the chamber's top Democrat, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, said in a speech after the vote on the measure, which he had negotiated with McConnell.
""This was a bipartisan process, and I hope there can be more and I want to thank Leader McConnell for working with us in good faith to get to this point,"" Schumer said.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to raise the limit before next Wednesday and Congress now appears to be on track to achieve that.
Final votes on the second, debt-limit implementing bill are expected in the Senate and House by Tuesday.
Republicans have been maneuvering for months to try to force Democrats to raise the debt limit on their own, seeking to link the move to Biden's proposed $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" domestic spending bill.
Democrats note that the legislation is needed to finance substantial debt incurred during Donald Trump's administration, when Republicans willingly jacked up Washington's credit card bill by about $7.85 trillion, partly through sweeping tax cuts and spending to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Still to come in the prolonged legislative battle is a disclosure of the actual dollar amount for the new cap on Treasury's borrowing, which is expected to cover Washington's expenses through the 2022 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. 
'RIGHT THING TO DO'
Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who is up for re-election in Alaska next year, told reporters that she voted earlier with 13 other Republicans to advance the first bill because ""it was the right thing to do.""
She added that at a time when Russia is amassing troops on its border with Ukraine, ""we don't need to be sending signals anywhere in the world that we're not going to back the full faith and credit in the United States.""
Some Republicans, including Senator Shelley Moore Capito, said they were backing the measure because it included provisions to avoid cuts otherwise set to take place next year in the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly.
But Republican Senator Mike Rounds said he voted no because ""they (Democrats) have been spending money on a partisan basis without input from Republicans. So they have the obligation to increase the debt ceiling at this point.""
The break in the legislative deadlock came just two months after Congress agreed on a short-term lift to the debt ceiling, to avert an unprecedented default by the federal government on its obligations, which would have dire implications for the world economy.

In recent years, lawmakers have squirmed over raising the statutory limit on the country's growing debt, fearing voter backlash.
The emergence in 2010 of the conservative, small-government ""Tea Party"" movement increased the rancor in Congress over such legislation, even as lawmakers voted for tax cuts and spending increases that contribute to the debt.

GRIFFIN, Georgia (Reuters) - Protesters filled the meeting room of the Spalding County Board of Elections in October, upset that the board had disallowed early voting on Sundays for the Nov. 2 municipal election. A year ago, Sunday voting had been instrumental in boosting turnout of Black voters.
But this was an entirely different five-member board than had overseen the last election. The Democratic majority of three Black women was gone. So was the Black elections supervisor.
Now a faction of three white Republicans controlled the board – thanks to a bill passed by the Republican-led Georgia legislature earlier this year. The Spalding board’s new chairman has endorsed former president Donald Trump’s false stolen-election claims on social media.
The panel in Spalding, a rural patch south of Atlanta, is one of six county boards that Republicans have quietly reorganized in recent months through similar county-specific state legislation. The changes expanded the party’s power over choosing members of local election boards ahead of the crucial midterm Congressional elections in November 2022.
The unusual rash of restructurings follows the state's passage of Senate Bill 202, which restricted ballot access statewide and allowed the Republican-controlled State Election Board to assume control of county boards it deems underperforming. The board immediately launched a performance review of the Democratic-leaning Fulton County board, which oversees part of Atlanta.
The Georgia restructurings are part of a national Republican effort to expand control over election administration in the wake of Trump’s false voter-fraud claims. Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas and Arizona have enacted new curbs on voter access this year. Backers of Trump’s false stolen-election claims are running campaigns for secretary of state - the top election official - in battleground states. And some Republicans in Wisconsin are seeking to eliminate the state’s bipartisan election commission and threatening its members with prosecution.
The stakes are high in Georgia, which last year backed a Democrat for president for the first time since 1992. Its first-term Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock will be up for reelection in 2022, a contest that could prove pivotal to which party controls Congress. The governor’s race next year pits incumbent Republican Brian Kemp against Trump-endorsed candidate David Perdue in a primary. The winner will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, a voting rights advocate. Both Warnock and Abrams are Black.
The county board restructurings and statewide voting restrictions, Democrats and voting-rights groups say, represent the most sweeping changes in decades to Georgia’s electoral system. Until 2013, Georgia elections operated under federal oversight to ensure fair participation for Black voters in this once-segregated Southern state.
Democrats say Republicans are trying to expand their control over election administration functions that should be nonpartisan. That could result in suppression of votes, they said, and could give Republicans control over certification of results, along with recounts and audits of contested elections.
“We are talking about a normalization of Republican takeovers of local functions,” says Saira Draper, director of voter protection for the Georgia Democratic Party.
Republicans say the changes aim to restore public trust in elections after many problems during the 2020 elections.
""What we want to make sure is that we have election integrity,” said Butch Miller, the No. 2 Republican in the Georgia Senate, a leading advocate for Senate Bill 202 and a sponsor of the bill to reconstitute the Lincoln County election board.
In five of the Georgia counties that restructured election boards - Troup, Morgan, Pickens, Stephens and Lincoln - the legislature shifted the power to appoint some or all election board members to local county commissions, all of which are currently controlled by Republicans. Previously, the appointments had been split evenly between the local Democratic and Republican parties, sometimes with other local entities controlling some appointments. The intent of the old system: To ensure a politically balanced or nonpartisan board.
In the sixth county, Spalding, the parties still choose two members each, but the fifth member is now chosen by local judges. (It used to be decided by a coin flip.) Those judges tend to be politically conservative; they appointed a white Republican to replace a Black Democrat on the election board, giving Republicans a 3-2 majority.
In Morgan County, the majority-Republican county commission reconstituted its election board, ousting two outspoken Black Democrats. In Troup County, a Black Democratic member claims the board shake-up was aimed at ousting her after she fought to increase voting access.
Reuters could not determine the exact split of Democrats and Republicans in the five counties that handed control to county commissions before and after their restructurings. That’s because board members’ party affiliation is not public information in Georgia, and board representatives declined to identify their allegiances.
RESTRICTING ACCESS
The county election boards have broad authority over voter access, such as polling locations and early-voting procedures. They also have considerable sway over post-election provisional-ballot tallies, audits and recounts.
Reconstituted boards in two of the six counties have already moved to restrict voting access. In addition to Spalding’s termination of Sunday voting, Lincoln County has proposed consolidating its seven precincts into one voting center, which critics say would discourage voting by people traveling from remote areas. Proponents say it would make voting more efficient and secure. The proposal is set for a vote on Thursday.
In Lincoln County, the new law removes appointments by political parties and gives the Republican-led county commission discretion to appoint the board's three-member majority. County Republicans say the changes are meant to comply with a 2018 state Supreme Court ruling, which dictated that private entities cannot appoint members to government bodies. That decision, however, involved boards of ethics, not elections, and many other Georgia counties continue to allow political-party appointments to election boards.
The changes come in the wake of Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Trump won Spalding County with 60% of the 2020 vote. But his margin of victory declined by 4 percentage points from 2016 as turnout among Black voters jumped 20% in a county where the population is 35% black.
Trump supporters rifled through the dumpsters behind Spalding’s election office, looking for tossed ballots. None were found. Others demanded to watch the vote-counting. Sheriff’s deputies had to escort election workers to their cars. In Georgia and nationwide, some Trump supporters have threatened election officials with violence.
With conservative judges now choosing the county election board’s fifth member, the previous fifth member, Vera McIntosh, a Black Democrat, has been ousted. She was replaced by James Newland, who is also vice-chair of the county Republican Party. In September, he voted to end Sunday voting.
The board’s new chair is Ben Johnson, a former official of the county Republican party. Johnson declined to comment on his social media posts endorsing Trump’s false voter-fraud claims. He would not answer questions about whether he acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election fairly.
McIntosh, the ousted Democrat, called the changes a “power grab” by local Republicans who wanted to “go back and prove the ‘Big Lie’ was real,” referring to Trump’s election-fraud claims.
“They wanted control,” she said. “They got control.”
The law restructuring Spalding’s board also required the elections supervisor to live in the county, a change that forced out the incumbent supervisor, Marcia Ridley. Two other Black Democrats on the board quit: Margaret Bentley and Glenda Henley, who cited objections to the law and harassment from Trump supporters.
Henley said the board’s meetings were increasingly attended by Trump supporters crying fraud. She called the tensions “exhausting” and said: “I have never been afraid in this town, but I am now.”
The restructured board still includes two Democrats, one of whom is Black.
Republican state representative David Knight from Spalding, who co-sponsored a bill to reconstitute the board, said the changes had nothing to do with race or partisanship. They aimed, he said, ""to restore the integrity of our election board and voter confidence.""
On Election Day in 2020, voting machines malfunctioned in all 18 precincts, resulting in long waits. Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called for Ridley’s resignation, and the Republican-controlled State Election Board referred her handling of the problems to the state attorney general, who has to date not taken any action.
Ridley denies any mismanagement, saying her staff “worked hard to ensure that no voter got disenfranchised and all were able to vote.”
FREE AND FAIR?
In western Georgia’s Troup County, the Republican-controlled county commission now appoints all election board members, a power previously shared by three cities and the two political parties.
Lonnie Hollis, one of two Black female members, will leave the board at year-end. Hollis, who has served since 2013, said the restructuring was aimed at unseating her because she fought to increase voter access. Her efforts included advocating for the first voting location in a predominantly Black church in the county, which she said has multiple precincts in predominantly white churches.
Patrick Crews, the Republican chairman of Troup County commissioners, denied Hollis was targeted for removal.
“Our goal is to be inclusive and appoint members who are concerned about having fair and honest elections,” Crews said.
In Morgan County, two Black Democrats on the board, Helen Butler and Avery Jackson, were removed after the new law eliminated political-party appointments and handed appointment power to the Republican-dominated commission. Butler and Jackson sought reappointments but were denied.
The commission chair, Philipp von Hanstein, did not respond to a comment request.

Butler has long advocated for voting rights and social justice. Testifying before a special U.S. Senate subcommittee in July, she said she was ousted for fighting the closure of polling locations and advocating for ballot drop boxes.
Butler warned that the restructurings could “enable members of the majority party to overturn election results they do not like.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department sued Texas on Monday alleging the state violated the Voting Rights Act by creating redistricting plans that intentionally discriminate against Black and minority voters by minimizing their voting strength.
""The complaint we filed today alleges that Texas has violated section two by creating redistricting plans that deny or abridge the rights of Latino and Black voters to vote on account of their race, color or membership in a language minority group,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters at a news conference.
In its complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, the Justice Department said the 2020 Census showed that Latinos are on track to become the state's largest population group, and that non-white Latino voters account for less than 40% of the state's population.
""Soon after the release of 2020 Census data, the Texas Legislature enacted redistricting plans for the Texas Congressional delegation and the Texas House through an extraordinarily rapid and opaque legislative process,"" the complaint says.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) defended the state's actions, saying, ""The Department of Justice's absurd lawsuit against our state is the Biden Administration's latest ploy to control Texas voters.""
The lawsuit is the first filed by the Justice Department during President Joe Biden's administration taking aim at redistricting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/redistricting-gets-under-way-democrats-prospects-looking-brighter-2021-10-02, the once-a-decade process that state legislatures use to redraw congressional districts. 
Texas will gain two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after next year's election due to population growth, the most of any state this cycle.
TEXAS VOTER LAWS
This is the Justice Department's second lawsuit against Texas this year over voting rights.
It in early November sued Texas https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-doj-files-lawsuit-against-texas-over-voting-curbs-law-2021-11-04 over a new law that curbs mail-in voting, alleging it improperly restricts disabled voters or voters who cannot read or write from being able to receive adequate assistance at voting locations.
That lawsuit challenged a law making it tougher to cast ballots through the mail by preventing officials from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications. It also adds new identification requirements for mail-in voting, prohibits drive-through and 24-hour voting locations, limits early voting and restricts who can help voters requiring assistance because of disabilities or language barriers.
Earlier this year, the department sued Georgia https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-sue-georgia-over-restrictive-new-state-voting-law-source-2021-06-25 after it enacted a new election law that the Justice Department said infringes on the rights of Black voters.
The two states are among a growing number of Republican-led U.S. states passing new laws restricting voting access amid former President Donald Trump's continued false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.

The Justice Department's authority over redistricting issues has been weakened in recent years, after the conservative-majority Supreme Court in 2013 gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states to get pre-clearance from the Justice Department before re-drawing their districts.
Garland told reporters that while the department no longer has the power to examine re-districting before it goes into effect, it can still evaluate it for discriminatory impacts afterwards.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and Israel increased pressure on Iran on Thursday as nuclear talks stalled, with Israel's visiting defense chief raising the issue of joint military readiness to be able to halt Iran's nuclear aspirations, if necessary.
Reuters exclusively reported https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-diplomacy-stutters-us-israel-discuss-military-drills-iran-scenario-us-2021-12-09 that Thursday's U.S.-Israeli agenda was expected to include discussions about possible military exercises that would prepare for a worst-case scenario to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities should diplomacy fail and if their nations' leaders request it.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the start of the meeting with his Israeli counterpart, Benny Gantz, that Iran had failed to offer constructive diplomatic engagement in talks that President Joe Biden had hoped would revive a 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by his predecessor, Donald Trump.
Austin said Biden was ""prepared to turn to other options"" if the current American policy on Iran fails.
""We are completely aligned in our commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This is a national security interest of the United States and Israel and the world,"" Austin said.
Gantz described Iran, Israel's arch foe, as ""the biggest threat to the global and regional peace and stability."" After meeting Austin, he held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. But sweeping demands by Iran's new, hardline government in talks have heightening suspicions in the West that Iran is playing for time while advancing its nuclear program.
With the 2015 deal's nuclear benefits now badly compromised, some Western officials say there is little time left before the foundation of the deal is damaged beyond repair. Under the accord, Iran curbed its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
DETERRENCE
The Pentagon declined comment on the Reuters report, which also disclosed an Oct. 25 briefing by Defense Department officials to U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the full range of military options to ensure that Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon.
""I know there's interest in a certain Reuters report,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told a news briefing.
""I will tell you this: We routinely conduct exercises and training with our Israeli counterparts and I have nothing to announce to or speak to or point to or speculate about today.""
State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters he would not want to ""speak to contingency planning"" if diplomacy isn't viable in the short term.
Drills by the United States and Israel could address calls by Dennis Ross, a former senior U.S. official and Middle East expert, and others to signal openly to Tehran that the United States and Israel remain serious about preventing it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 
""Biden needs to disabuse Iran of the notion that Washington will not act militarily and will stop Israel from doing so,"" Ross wrote last month.
Ross also suggested the United States could signal a willingness to give the Israelis the U.S. military's bunker-busting Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound (13,600-kg)bomb.
Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns said on Monday that the CIA does not believe Iran's supreme leader has decided to take steps to weaponize a nuclear device but noted advances in its ability to enrich uranium, one pathway to the fissile material for a bomb.
Burns cautioned that, even if Iran decided to go ahead, it would still require a lot of work to weaponize that fissile material before attaching a nuclear weapon to a missile or other delivery system.

""But they're further along in their mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle and that's the kind of knowledge that is very difficult to sanction away or make disappear,"" he said.
U.S. officials have also long worried about America's ability to detect and destroy dispersed components of Iran's nuclear weaponization program once enough fissile material for a bomb were produced.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is seeking to question former President Donald Trump under oath as part of a fraud investigation, said on Thursday she was suspending her campaign for New York governor, weeks after announcing a run.
Her decision to abandon the campaign comes after news that her office aims to depose Trump regarding allegations that his namesake business manipulated the valuations of its real estate properties, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming a report in the Washington Post. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
""I have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general. There are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job,"" James said in a statement on Thursday.
In October, James announced her campaign to challenge Governor Kathy Hochul for the state's highest elective office in next year's election. Formerly lieutenant governor, Hochul took over from Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned after James' office issued a scathing report accusing him of sexual abuse and harassment.
Elected to a first term in 2018, James said in a statement on Thursday that she would instead seek re-election as attorney general. 
Soon after James said she was running for governor, Cuomo's lawyer Rita Galvin called on the attorney general to recuse herself from decisions in several ongoing investigations of Cuomo, saying her gubernatorial campaign created a conflict of interest.

The New York attorney general had led a rush of candidates challenging Hochul, the state's first female governor and a seasoned politician who has already secured important endorsements. 
Jumaane Williams, New York City's public advocate since 2019, is also seeking the Democratic nomination. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose term expires at the end of the year, is also believed to be considering a run for governor.

545,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate advanced legislation creating a fast-track path to raise the federal debt ceiling, moving another step closer to closing off the risk of a government default.
The 64-36 vote enables the full Senate to take up legislation giving the Democratic majority one-time authority to raise the country’s borrowing authority without threat of a GOP filibuster. It marks an about-face for Senate Republicans, who had vowed not to cooperate with Democrats on increasing the debt limit.
“It was the right thing to do because the last in the world this country needs is a default,” Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, who voted to advance the bill. “And so we’ve set up a process to avoid default. It’s not ideal, but it allows us to avoid the catastrophe that would come if we default.” 
The legislation is expected to pass later Thursday or early Friday. It will be followed by action on a separate measure to raise the debt limit by a level that hasn’t been announced but is likely to cover borrowing through 2022. Timing for a vote on that bill, which can be passed by a simple majority, hasn’t been set.
The House, on a 222-212 vote Tuesday, cleared the same legislation, which also cancels automatic cuts to Medicare, farm subsidies and other programs triggered by deficit spending earlier this year. Final Senate action would send the measure to President Joe Biden for his expected signature.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could hit the debt limit and have difficulty meeting its obligations after Dec. 15, though outside analysts have said the government has a bit more time.
Congress added $480 billion to the U.S. debt ceiling in October after weeks of partisan sniping that rattled financial markets. Republicans demanded that Democrats use their slim majorities in both chambers to approve a debt ceiling increase on their own using a budget process Democrats said was too cumbersome and designed to impede their work on Biden’s nearly $2 trillion economic package.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ultimately pivoted and proposed the short-term increase approved in October. Eleven Republicans joined Democrats to pave the way for a floor. At the time, McConnell vowed it would be the last time Republicans would come to the aid of Democrats on the debt ceiling.
Negotiations
But McConnell began discussions with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in November to move the next increase. On Tuesday the two said they had agreed on the one-time procedural maneuver that likely will result in a higher debt ceiling by this weekend or early next week. Schumer declared that “Democrats would carry the burden” of voting for it.
“I think this is in the best interests of the country,” McConnell said of their accord, adding that it also was in “in the best interests of Republicans.”
The compromise still allows all Republicans to cast a “no” on raising the debt ceiling while default is averted. It comes a week after McConnell and Schumer agreed on a stop-gap spending bill that extends current agency spending levels until Feb. 18, averting a government shutdown. 
All but one Republican in the House voted against the compromise and some GOP senators were critical of the approach.  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the longest-serving current GOP senator, said “it’s a gimmick to get around the filibuster” that could lead to other attempts to bypass the minority party on debt limit increases.
“I think it’s a bad precedent,” Grassley said on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” program.
McConnell’s allies say the GOP leader is looking toward next year’s midterm elections and is more interested in keeping the focus on Biden’s lower approval ratings and the soaring inflation that is crimping household budgets throughout the nation.
“Democrats aren’t going to escape that, regardless of the process stuff here,” GOP Senator Mike Braun of Indiana said. “Most people at home aren’t going to understand this anyway. They’re going to understand gas being at close to four bucks a gallon and food prices at record highs.”
The debt-ceiling bill under consideration in the Senate would tie the temporary process with other language that would stave off nearly 10% in mandatory cuts to Medicare payments under the so-called Paygo law set to go into effect on Jan. 1. The looming cuts have alarmed hospital and doctors groups that say Medicare fee-for-service payments could be reduced by $14.1 billion in 2022 unless there’s action to stop them. These cuts would also affect trade adjustment assistance, which helps workers who have lost their jobs due to trade-related circumstances, and farm price supports. Congress has previously waived the Paygo rule, which is designed to contain the federal deficit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a Republican measure that would overturn President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine-or-test mandate for private businesses, with two Democrats joining Republicans to back the initiative.
The 52-48 vote sends the legislation to the Democratic-led House of Representatives, where it faces strong headwinds, while Biden has threatened to veto it.
The legislation would overturn administration rules ordering businesses with 100 workers or more to require vaccinations or coronavirus testing for millions of employees.
The measure was not subject to Senate rules that require 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation, meaning it could pass with just a 51-vote simple majority. Two Senate Democrats - Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana - joined 50 Republicans in voting for the bill.
The initiative underscores the intense political opposition facing administration efforts to combat COVID-19 at a time when health officials are trying to contain the highly contagious Omicron variant.
""I have always supported a vaccine mandate for federal employees and the military because maintaining essential services and military readiness the federal government provides is a matter of national importance,"" Manchin said in a statement following the vote.
""However, I do not support any government vaccine mandate for private businesses. It is not the place of the federal government to tell private business owners how to protect their employees from COVID-19 and operate their businesses,"" he said. 
Manchin added he was fully vaccinated and had received a booster shot, and encouraged all Americans to do the same.
Republicans have said they were inundated with calls from businesses with up to 500 workers that are concerned about having to fire employees who oppose COVID-19 vaccines and testing. 
""It's got Main Street America scared,"" Republican Senator Mike Braun, who was spearheading the legislative drive, said before the Senate vote.
The White House said in a statement on Tuesday that employers would face no burden from the mandate because the vast majority of American adults are fully vaccinated and noted that the rule exempts small businesses.
Biden's private business mandate has already been put on hold by a federal appeals court https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-appeals-court-affirms-stay-biden-vaccine-mandate-2021-11-12. A U.S. judge https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-judge-blocks-last-remaining-biden-admin-covid-19-vaccine-rule-2021-12-07 in Georgia also blocked a Biden vaccine mandate aimed at federal contractors on Tuesday. 
""We are in the middle of a public health crisis. Everyone sees the damage it causes,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat, said in a speech. ""The way to solve this is to be driven by science.""
The United States has the world's highest daily average of new reported coronavirus infections. The virus has infected 49.5 million Americans and killed more than 794,000, the highest death toll of any country, according to the Reuters COVID-19 Tracker.

Republicans touted the measure's bipartisan support as a clear message of public concern about the mandate's potential impact on workers, businesses and the economy. 
The chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, branded the Biden mandate as an ""illegal"" and ""absurd"" government effort to micromanage the lives of private citizens.

The justices ordered a lower-court judge to hold further proceedings on three lawsuits filed by Democrats and civil rights groups over the redrawn maps, citing the great public interest in the subject matter of these cases.""

Tim Moore, speaker of the Republican-controlled state legislature, said in a statement posted to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that he was disappointed in the court's ruling.
""To throw this process into chaos in the middle of filing leaves North Carolinians with uncertainty ahead of the election,"" Moore said. ""Despite this delay, we are confident that we will prevail at trial and our maps will stand.""

The revised political maps, which were approved by the legislature, gave Republicans advantages over Democrats in the majority of districts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows could become the third person to face a criminal contempt https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-stake-trump-allies-facing-contempt-congress-2021-10-14 charge for refusing to cooperate with the U.S. House of Representatives panel probing the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the committee said on Wednesday.
Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Select Committee, said in a letter to Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, that Meadows - a former House member - had failed to cooperate https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-ex-chief-staff-meadows-no-longer-cooperating-with-capitol-riot-panel-2021-12-07 with the panel.
""The Select Committee is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution,"" Thompson wrote in the letter, which was released by the committee.
Thompson later told reporters he expected the committee to meet next week on whether to cite Meadows for contempt. ""We have every intention to move forward with a contempt citation on Meadows and we'll go from there,"" he said.
Terwilliger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Meadows refused to appear for a deposition scheduled on Wednesday, instead filing a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the nine members of the Select Committee. The suit alleges that subpoenas sent to Meadows violate legal protections for senior advisers to a president, and charge the committee with using excessively broad subpoenas to obtain Meadows' mobile telephone data.
""Mr. Meadows's flawed lawsuit won’t succeed at slowing down the Select Committee's investigation or stopping us from getting the information we’re seeking,"" Thompson and Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican, said in a statement.
The Justice Department, at the House's request, has already brought similar charges https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-indicts-bannon-not-complying-with-jan-6-subpoena-2021-11-12 against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is also considering similar action against former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.
Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told the committee that he would not testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, his lawyer said.
'I LOVE IT'
Meadows told the committee last week that he would hand over some documents and appear for a deposition. He changed his mind by https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-ex-chief-staff-meadows-no-longer-cooperating-with-capitol-riot-panel-2021-12-07 Tuesday.
Thompson said documents were handed over but that Terwilliger also argued that hundreds of emails and text messages are subject to privilege.
On Jan. 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent formal congressional certification of the then-president's 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Before the riot, Trump, speaking at a rally, repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Thompson said documents the committee has received from Meadows' attorney include communications with organizers of that rally and with a member of Congress, who was not identified, about the possibility of replacing some state electors with handpicked candidates to keep Trump in power.
In response, Meadows apparently said: ""I love it,"" according to Thompson's letter.

While more than 250 witnesses have testified to the committee, Trump has urged associates not to cooperate, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege. Many legal experts have said, however, that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
Thompson has noted that even as the committee and Trump’s attorneys battle in court over executive privilege issues, Meadows disclosed details about circumstances surrounding the Jan. 6 attack, including conversations with Trump, in a new book Meadows is currently promoting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, one of three measures backed overwhelmingly as Washington continues its pushback against Beijing's treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority.
The House backed the ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" by an overwhelming 428-1. To become law, it must also pass the Senate and be signed by President Joe Biden.
The Uyghur measure would create a ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has set up a vast network of detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, were made with forced labor.
China denies abuses in Xinjiang, but the U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.
Republicans have accused Biden's White House and his fellow Democrats in Congress of slow-walking the legislation because it would complicate the president's renewable energy agenda. 
Xinjiang supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels.
The White House - and congressional Democrats - deny delaying the bills.
Citing China's human rights ""atrocities,"" the Biden administration on Monday announced that U.S. government officials would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The Democratic-led House also passed two other measures related to China and rights by huge margins on Wednesday. The House voted 428-0 for a resolution saying that the International Olympic Committee violated its own human rights commitments by cooperating with China's government.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden visited a bus depot on Wednesday to spotlight the $1 trillion infrastructure bill's investments in public transit as the administration sought to boost the popularity of his agenda with a new communication strategy.
Biden toured the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority which will be among the beneficiaries of the spending bill's $89 billion for public transit over five years, including $5.6 billion to buy low- and no-emission transit vehicles like electric buses.
""It's gonna be infrastructure decade, now man. No more talking. Action,"" Biden said. Kansas City, which has two electric buses, hopes to build a fully electric fleet. 
The Kansas City trip came as the White House launched a website, Build.gov, to describe the infrastructure law and ask supporters to upload videos explaining how the law impacts their lives.
The White House also unveiled a new branding phrase, “Building a Better America,” to promote it. The White House is testing whether investment in infrastructure can boost Biden's sagging poll ratings.
The administration wants Americans to know about the president's efforts ""to make their lives easier, to deliver for them,"" spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Biden has faced challenges in all directions. Biden told the crowd he ran for president in part to unite the country, but that is “turning out to be one of the most difficult things.”
Biden's legislative efforts have been stymied by Republican opposition along with infighting between the progressive and moderate wings of his own party. 
Despite a bipartisan win in Congress on infrastructure, Biden's opinion poll numbers have sunk as Americans fret about the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation.
The White House wants to highlight Biden's accomplishments ahead of mid-term elections next year, when Democrats are seeking to fend off Republican efforts to win control of Congress. 
The White House is also looking to win passage for the second part of Biden's economic agenda, an even larger spending package.

The Democrat-led House has passed the $1.9 trillion package, which includes funding for universal pre-kindergarten, child care, healthcare insurance subsidies and climate-change initiatives. But the legislation's path in the Senate, where Democrats have the smallest of margins, remains uncertain and revisions are expected.
""We're going to help rebuild the economy, but this time from the bottom and the middle out. This bill is a blue-collar blueprint for working Americans,"" Biden said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday narrowly confirmed a progressive district attorney branded by Republicans as soft on crime to become Massachusetts' top federal prosecutor, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.
The 51-50 vote to confirm Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL) followed fierce Republican opposition to her stances on criminal justice reform and marked the first time in more than four decades the Senate was forced to hold a roll-call vote on a U.S. attorney nominee.
She is part of a movement of ""progressive prosecutors"" that supports eliminating racial disparities in the justice system and rejects a traditional ""tough on crime"" culture that they say has led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black men.
Rollins, 50, took office in 2019 as the first Black woman elected to serve as the district attorney in Suffolk County, which covers Boston.
She campaigned on a promise to decline prosecution for some low-level crimes and was vocal about the need for police reform even before the nationwide protests prompted by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
Democratic President Joe Biden nominated Rollins in July to join the U.S. Justice Department and head the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts, which gained prominence investigating the ""Varsity Blues"" college admissions scandal.
Republicans objected to a list of 15 crimes Rollins pledged not to prosecute from shoplifting to drug possession. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said she was ""vocal and aggressive against prosecuting crime.""

Supporters including Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have countered by citing research showing that declined prosecutions and Rollins' policies contributed to reductions in offenders facing a new criminal complaint.
Rollins said in a statement her policies helped improve trust in law enforcement and ""the fairness and equity of the criminal legal system."" She said she looked forward to bringing those ""data-driven, evidenced-based approaches"" to her new role.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives late on Tuesday approved a measure allowing Congress to fast-track legislation raising the federal government's debt limit and stave off a potential unprecedented default.
The Senate is expected to take up the measure, which prevents the use of stalling tactics, on Thursday.
That would speed the way for Congress to consider separate legislation to actually increase the current $28.9 trillion limit on federal borrowing authority to a still-to-be-determined level.
The House voted 222-212 in favor of the measure designed to speed approval of a debt limit increase in the often-plodding Senate. Only one Republican backed it.
""Increasing the debt ceiling will prevent us from defaulting on debt we already owe. It's about investments that the Congress previously approved,"" Democratic Representative Steven Horsford said during House debate.
Earlier in the day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned of dire consequences without fast action by Congress.
""We must address the debt limit to stave off an unnecessary and catastrophic drop of trillions of dollars of GDP and a devastating downgrade to our credit rating,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement.
But House Republicans argued against any action, knowing Democrats intended to shoulder the burden on their own under a deal privately negotiated by both parties.
""Make no mistake. This debt ceiling is being lifted to pay for trillions of wasteful socialist spending,"" said Republican Representative Kevin Brady.
He was referring in part to President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" domestic investment bill that Democrats hope to pass in the Senate this month. 
Democrats say the increased borrowing authority is needed largely to cover the cost of tax cuts and spending programs during former Republican President Donald Trump's administration, which congressional Republicans supported.
' BEST  (NYSE:BEST) INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY'
Normally, many bills need the support of at least 60 senators to clear procedural hurdles. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell sent a clear message that his party will help facilitate a debt limit increase even though its members aim to vote against the actual bill implementing it.
""This is in the best interest of the country by avoiding default,"" McConnell told reporters, adding: ""We'll be voting on it Thursday,"" as he expressed confidence in its passage.
Congress is expected to complete action on the long-running tussle between Democrats and Republicans by Dec. 15, the date Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen requested to soothe financial markets and ensure there would be no default - an event that would have catastrophic economic consequences.
The debt limit increase, if passed, is expected to provide Treasury with enough borrowing authority through next November's congressional elections. 
Tuesday's breakthrough strategy, brokered by Democratic and Republican congressional leaders following months of political infighting, would establish a two-step approach for raising Treasury's borrowing authority.
If the Senate passes the House-approved bill, a second measure raising the debt limit under the expedited procedure would then be debated for a maximum of 10 hours in the Senate, instead of the open-ended debate that can delay or kill many bills in the chamber.
Senate passage by a simple majority would clear the way for a final vote by the House. Both chambers are narrowly controlled by Democrats.

The expedited procedure for the debt limit was included in a bill to postpone cuts to the Medicare healthcare program for seniors that would otherwise take place starting Jan. 1. 
By facilitating passage of a debt limit increase but not actually voting to implement one, Republicans would give themselves ammunition to attack Democrats in the 2022 congressional election campaigns for raising the $28.9 trillion debt limit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate rejected a resolution on Tuesday that would have prohibited the proposed sale of advanced medium range air-to-air missiles, missile launchers and other weapons and support to Saudi Arabia.
The vote was 67 to 30 against the resolution, which was introduced by Republicans Rand Paul and Mike Lee, as well as Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats.
While many U.S. lawmakers consider Saudi Arabia an important partner in the Middle East, members of Congress also have criticized the country for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.
""Exporting more missiles to Saudi Arabia does nothing but further this conflict and pour more gasoline on already raging fire,"" Sanders said in a speech urging support for the resolution of disapproval. 
They have refused to approve military sales for the kingdom without assurances U.S. equipment would not be used to kill civilians. Backers of the sale noted that President Joe Biden's administration has already barred U.S. sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia.
""I completely agree with the need to hold Saudi leadership accountable for a variety of actions... but I also believe that it is important that our security partners know that we will uphold our commitments,"" said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The weapons package, which was approved by the State Department as well as leaders of the Senate and House foreign affairs committees, would include 280 AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), 596 LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers (MRL) along other equipment and support,
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) makes the missiles.

The Biden administration said earlier on Tuesday it strongly opposed the resolution.
Passage ""would undermine the president's commitment to aid in our partner's defenses at a time of increased missile and drone attacks against civilians in Saudi Arabia,"" the White House Office of Management of Budget said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved an Arizona police chief as the top border official in a near party-line vote, as President Joe Biden deals with record migrant arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border and criticism from both the right and left over his immigration policies.
Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus, 61, will become commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the 60,000-person agency overseeing border security, trade and travel. CBP is parent agency of the U.S. Border Patrol, where many agents oppose what they describe as Biden's more welcoming approach to immigration.
Magnus was approved by a vote of 50-47, with Senator Susan Collins the lone Republican joining Democrats in support.
Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border reached a record 1.7 million in the 2021 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. Republicans have latched onto immigration as a central issue in the run-up to the 2022 congressional elections and blamed the increased crossings on Biden's reversal of some of former President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies.
Migration experts say poverty, violence and food insecurity are factors driving migrants to leave Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Magnus, who worked for police departments in Michigan, North Dakota and California before joining the Tucson force in 2016, will be thrust into the center of that political debate. 
When Biden nominated Magnus for the role in April, the White House touted him as a reformer focused on establishing community trust in law enforcement and holding officers accountable.
Magnus drew media attention in 2014 as police chief in Richmond, California, where he was photographed holding a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign at a protest, later calling it a gesture of goodwill and not a political statement.

In 2017, Magnus penned a New York Times opinion piece that criticized Trump's move to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.
Magnus will be the agency's first Senate-confirmed commissioner since 2018. Mark Morgan, a Trump appointee, was acting CBP commissioner from July 2019 to January 2021, when Biden took office. Troy Miller, a career CBP official, has since served as acting commissioner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Mark Meadows, who served as former President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff, has decided not to cooperate with the congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, and the panel said on Tuesday it is prepared to pursue contempt charges against him.
Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee, said in a statement that the panel would take action if Meadows fails to show up for a deposition scheduled for Wednesday.
""If indeed Mr. Meadows refuses to appear, the Select Committee will be left no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution,"" Thompson said in a statement.
Fox News first reported Meadows' decision not to cooperate earlier on Tuesday. The Democratic-led committee last week said Meadows had provided records https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2021/12/06/defense-and-debt-limit-dominate-capitol-hill-495338 and agreed to appear ""soon"" for a deposition after failing to show up for a previously scheduled one.
Thompson said his committee has questions for Meadows about records he has provided including ""real-time communications"" that occurred as the Capitol riot took place. The panel also wants to hear from Meadows about ""voluminous official records"" in his personal telephone and email accounts, Thompson added.
Meadows served as a Republican House member until he joined Trump's administration last year. If he disregards the committee's subpoena, the panel could pursue contempt of Congress charges, as it has against Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.
On Jan. 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent formal congressional certification of his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""

Trump has urged associates not to cooperate with the committee, calling the investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
Thompson noted that even as the committee and Trump's attorneys battle in court over executive privilege issues, Meadows revealed details about circumstances surrounding the Jan. 6 attack including conversations with Trump in a new book that Meadows is currently promoting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge set a July 18 trial date on Tuesday for Steve Bannon, who served as chief strategist to former President Donald Trump, on criminal charges of contempt of Congress for defying a House of Representatives inquiry into the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. 
The date, announced by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, represented a compromise between timelines sought during a hearing by the prosecution and Bannon's lawyers. Prosecutors wanted a trial in mid-April, while Bannon's lawyers asked for a date in mid-October to give them more time to prepare.
""In the Jan. 6 criminal cases involving the people who were in the Capitol or committed violence in the Capitol, none of those cases have yet gone to trial for indictments that happened in January,"" Nichols said.
The judge noted that the case against Bannon, by contrast, is a misdemeanor and yet prosecutors want to move at ""light speed."" At the same time, Nichols added, a proposal for an October trial would be ""too slow.""
Bannon was indicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-indicts-bannon-not-complying-with-jan-6-subpoena-2021-11-12 last month on one contempt count for refusing to appear for a deposition before the House select committee investigating the riot and a second count for refusing to produce documents as requested. He has pleaded not guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-trump-adviser-bannon-enters-plea-not-guilty-obstructing-jan-6-2021-11-17.
The Democratic-led House voted in October to hold Bannon in contempt, leaving it up to the Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to decide on bringing charges.
A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his 2020 presidential election loss to Biden. The select committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events. 
Bannon has refused to cooperate with the committee, citing Trump's insistence that he has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege. Bannon is the first to face criminal charges arising from the panel's inquiry.

The prosecution anticipates needing only one day of testimony at the trial, but Bannon's lawyers anticipate the trial running at least 10 days, according to a court filing.
Bannon served as a top adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign before becoming White House chief strategist in 2017. He has promoted a variety of right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad.

Harris made the announcements during a White House meeting to promote improvements in maternal health, noting the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any wealthy nation in the world.
""In the United States of America, in the 21st century, being pregnant and giving birth should not carry such a great risk,"" the vice president said. ""But the truth is, women in our nation are dying before, during and after childbirth."" 
These rates have worsened over the past 20 years and are especially high among Black women and Native American women, regardless of their income or education levels, she said.
As part of the first White House Maternal Health Day of Action, Harris said the Department of Health & Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are launching a new initiative to designate hospitals based on the quality of their maternal healthcare.
Harris also announced that more than 20 companies and non-profits have pledged to invest more than $20 million in maternal health efforts in the United States and over $150 million globally.

The White House said CMS will release new guidance to help states provide 12 months of continuous postpartum coverage through Medicaid programs, up from 60 days currently.
President Joe Biden's Build Back Better Act - a $1.75 trillion social policy and climate package that was passed by the House of Representatives in November - includes $3 billion of investments in maternal health.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will warn Russian President Vladimir Putin of severe economic consequences should Russia go ahead with an invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official said on Monday.
Biden and Putin are to hold a video call on Tuesday as the United States tries to head off Russia from launching military action against Ukraine after Moscow massed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukraine border.
Biden spoke to the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain ahead of the call on Monday, discussing their ""shared concern about the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders and Russia's increasingly harsh rhetoric."" They also called on Russia to de-escalate tensions.
The official, in a briefing reporters, said the United States has been working with European allies about a strong response should an invasion go forward. He added that the United States and Europe would impose severe economic pain. 
""We believe there is a way forward to allow us to send a clear message to Russia that there will be enduring and meaningful costs"" should an invasion take place, the official said.
Russia has dismissed https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-dismisses-us-media-reports-about-possible-ukraine-offensive-2021-12-04 U.S. media reports about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine, accusing Washington of trying to aggravate the situation while blaming Moscow.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Monday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and reiterated Washington's ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine in the face of ""Russian aggression,"" the U.S. State Department said.
Zelenskiy said in a tweet that he and Blinken agreed to continue ""joint and concerted action.""
Russia has a potential diplomatic off-ramp through the Minsk agreement if it wishes, the official said. This is a previously negotiated agreement aimed at ending war in the Donbas region of Ukraine.
""We're encouraging Russia to return to dialogue through diplomatic avenues,"" the official said, without detailing the economic sanctions that are ready to be imposed.
But a source familiar with the situation said targeting Putin's inner circle with sanctions had been discussed and no decision had been made. The person added that Biden was not expected to get deep into details of the potential actions with Putin but instead would warn of economic costs.
Another person familiar with the situation said sanctions against Russia's biggest banks were also being considered by the United States and its European allies. Another option was going after Russia's ability to convert rubles into dollars and other currencies, the source said.
CNN reported the United States could include the extreme step of disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international payment system used by banks around the world.
Bloomberg reported that the U.S. and European allies are weighing sanctions targeting the Russian Direct Investment Fund as well as the country's ability to convert rubles for dollars and other foreign currencies should Putin invade Ukraine. 
The U.S. could also restrict the ability of investors to buy Russian debt on the secondary market, Bloomberg added, citing people familiar with the matter.
The White House declined comment.
More than 94,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Friday https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/large-scale-russian-offensive-possible-january-ukraine-says-2021-12-03 that Moscow may be planning a large-scale military offensive at the end of January, citing intelligence reports.
The U.S. official said it was still unclear whether Putin had made a final decision to launch an invasion.
The United States does not seek conflict with Russia but when necessary will impose meaningful consequences for harmful actions, the official added.
CIA Director William Burns said that while Putin's intentions were not clear, he would never underestimate the Russian leader's ""risk appetite.""
""What we do know is that he is putting the Russian military, the Russian security services in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way,"" Burns said at a Wall Street Journal event. 
Russia has said it can move troops around on Russian territory as it sees fit and that they pose no external threat.

Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Moscow-backed forces seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Kyiv wants back. Kyiv says some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting since then.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. Senator David Perdue launched a bid for Georgia governor on Monday, seeking to unseat fellow Republican Brian Kemp and deepening an intraparty rift driven by former President Donald Trump ahead of two critical 2022 elections in the state.
Trump quickly endorsed Perdue's candidacy against Kemp, a target of the former president's ire since the governor refused to help overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in the Southern state that contributed to the Democrat winning the presidency.
Whichever Republican wins the party's nomination will likely face voting rights activist Stacey Abrams https://www.reuters.com/world/us/stacey-abrams-announces-run-governor-state-georgia-again-2021-12-01, a Democrat who said last week she would make a second run for governor in the election battleground state.
""I'm running for governor to make sure Stacey Abrams is never the governor of Georgia,"" Perdue said in a 2-1/2-minute video that labeled Kemp as incapable of defeating Abrams, despite his narrow victory over her in 2018. 
""Look, I like Brian. This isn't personal. It's simple. He has failed all of us and cannot win in November,"" Perdue said. 
Trump's false claims about election fraud after Biden won Georgia by a close margin have been blamed for dividing state Republicans before a pair of U.S. Senate runoffs last January that handed Democrats their current Senate majority.
Perdue, a 71-year-old businessman, narrowly lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff in one of the runoffs.
There was no immediate response from Kemp. Ahead of Monday's announcement, a Kemp campaign spokesman blasted Perdue as ""the man who lost Republicans the United States Senate."" 
But Perdue blamed Republican Party divisions on Kemp and Republican state Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who both refused to block the state's presidential election results.
Multiple recounts and investigations upheld the state's results, despite the baseless allegations of fraud by Trump and some other Republicans. 
""To fight back, we simply have to be united,"" said Perdue, saying that Kemp ""caved"" to Abrams on the 2020 election. 
""Think about how different it would be today, if Kemp had fought Abrams first instead of fighting Trump,"" he said.
Trump predicted last week that his own supporters would not vote for Kemp ""after what he did"" with the election.

In his statement on Monday, he echoed Perdue's argument that Kemp cannot beat Abrams. ""He can’t win because the [Trump] base — which is enormous — will never vote for him,"" Trump said.
Georgia will also be home to a battle over the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Raphael Warnock, who faces a possible 2022 matchup against Republican Herschel Walker, a retired NFL star who has Trump's backing.

Nunes, 48, will assume his new role in January, the Trump Media & Technology Group said in a statement.
Media reports said an early proposal for redrawing the congressional map in California had tilted Nunes' district toward Democrats, possibly giving the 10-term congressman a tougher path to re-election.
Nunes was first elected in 2002, and chaired the House intelligence panel from January 2015 to January 2019. He has been an ardent Trump supporter, voting against certifying Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory following Trump's false claims of election fraud.
He was also among the most vocal defenders of Trump during the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Trump, in the company statement, said Nunes ""understands that we must stop the liberal media and Big Tech from destroying the freedoms that make America great."" The group has yet to roll out the social media app it says it is developing.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/spac-tied-trumps-social-media-venture-receives-us-regulatory-inquiries-2021-12-06 Trump's $1.25 billion deal to float his social media venture on the stock market by merging it with the blank-check acquisition firm Digital World Acquisition Corp, a filing showed on Monday.
Nunes, who had been part of Trump’s 2016 transition team, stepped aside in 2017 from leading the Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation as the House Ethics Committee said it was investigating allegations he had disclosed classified information. He was later cleared.

Nunes joins a growing list of federal lawmakers whose departures could shake up next year's congressional elections.
Republicans only need to pick up five seats in 2022 elections to retake the House of Representatives, which would give them effective veto power over Biden's legislative agenda.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department sued Texas on Monday alleging the state violated the Voting Rights Act by creating redistricting plans that intentionally discriminate against Black and minority voters by minimizing their voting strength.
""The complaint we filed today alleges that Texas has violated section two by creating redistricting plans that deny or abridge the rights of Latino and Black voters to vote on account of their race, color or membership in a language minority group,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters at a news conference.
In its complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, the Justice Department said the 2020 Census showed that Latinos are on track to become the state's largest population group, and that non-white Latino voters account for less than 40% of the state's population.
""Soon after the release of 2020 Census data, the Texas Legislature enacted redistricting plans for the Texas Congressional delegation and the Texas House through an extraordinarily rapid and opaque legislative process,"" the complaint says.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) defended the state's actions, saying, ""The Department of Justice's absurd lawsuit against our state is the Biden Administration's latest ploy to control Texas voters.""
The lawsuit is the first filed by the Justice Department during President Joe Biden's administration taking aim at redistricting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/redistricting-gets-under-way-democrats-prospects-looking-brighter-2021-10-02, the once-a-decade process that state legislatures use to redraw congressional districts. 
Texas will gain two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after next year's election due to population growth, the most of any state this cycle.
TEXAS VOTER LAWS
This is the Justice Department's second lawsuit against Texas this year over voting rights.
It in early November sued Texas https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-doj-files-lawsuit-against-texas-over-voting-curbs-law-2021-11-04 over a new law that curbs mail-in voting, alleging it improperly restricts disabled voters or voters who cannot read or write from being able to receive adequate assistance at voting locations.
That lawsuit challenged a law making it tougher to cast ballots through the mail by preventing officials from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications. It also adds new identification requirements for mail-in voting, prohibits drive-through and 24-hour voting locations, limits early voting and restricts who can help voters requiring assistance because of disabilities or language barriers.
Earlier this year, the department sued Georgia https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-sue-georgia-over-restrictive-new-state-voting-law-source-2021-06-25 after it enacted a new election law that the Justice Department said infringes on the rights of Black voters.
The two states are among a growing number of Republican-led U.S. states passing new laws restricting voting access amid former President Donald Trump's continued false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.

The Justice Department's authority over redistricting issues has been weakened in recent years, after the conservative-majority Supreme Court in 2013 gutted a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states to get pre-clearance from the Justice Department before re-drawing their districts.
Garland told reporters that while the department no longer has the power to examine re-districting before it goes into effect, it can still evaluate it for discriminatory impacts afterwards.

The NDAA, which normally passes with strong bipartisan support, is closely watched by a broad swath of industry and other interests because it determines everything from how many ships or missiles are purchased to pay increases for soldiers and how to address geopolitical threats.

569,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s remaining Federal Reserve picks can expect a tougher grilling than Chair Jerome Powell is likely to get from Senate Republicans, who are already warning about the central bank’s regulatory reach before the nominees are even announced.
The three openings on the seven-member board, including the pivotal vice chair for supervision slot previously held by Randal Quarles, give Biden the chance to dramatically reshape the Fed. He’s under pressure from progressive Democrats, who were disappointed by his renomination of Powell and are clamoring for a diverse slate that would take on the financial risks of climate change and Wall Street speculation with new regulations.
Republicans are wary. Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Banking Committee, has been sharply critical of what he calls “mission creep” at the Fed on issues like climate and racial justice.
Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, another committee member, said Biden’s other picks should get tough scrutiny regardless.
“None of them should be confirmed easily if they have extreme views,” Cramer said. “This isn’t a three for one -- you know, we’ll give you one if you give us three. We ought to fight hard on every single one of them.”
Toomey said last week on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power with David Westin” that he hopes Biden will nominate someone to replace Quarles “who will respect the limited role they should play.” 
“I’ll be looking forward to seeing who that nominee is and grilling that person about what their intentions are,” Toomey said.
With Biden saddled with sub-par approval ratings and the midterm election coming up next year, Republicans won’t be inclined to give the administration the benefit of the doubt. If Biden can’t win over Republicans in a 50-50 Senate, the fate of any nominee will depend on how he navigates the conflicting demands within the Democratic Party of progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren and moderates like Senator Joe Manchin and Jon Tester.
Warren raised the stakes last week when she tried to pin down Powell in a hearing on whether he would allow regulations proposed by a vice chair for supervision that he disagrees with to come up for a vote. Powell told the Massachusetts Democrat that would be his intention and that it conforms to his reading of the law, though he also said he couldn’t account for every situation.
Warren took the exchange as a commitment from Powell.
“When Chair Powell says that he interprets the law as requiring that proposals from the vice chair for supervision to go forward is mandatory, I think that sounds like a guarantee,” she said in a brief interview.
The three Biden picks to come, plus Biden’s pick for vice chair, Lael Brainard, would theoretically have enough votes then to narrowly pass new regulations in the seven-member panel regardless of Powell’s views.
The Warren-Powell exchange, and the math, concerned Cramer.
“I just hope and pray that if it ever comes down to that, Jerome Powell would use whatever little wiggle room he left in the answer to that question to say ‘No, this is a bridge too far, I am the chairman and it doesn’t come up for a vote,’ or whatever it is, whatever tool he can use with the gavel and not allow that,” he said. 
Fight Hard
Cramer said some moderate Democrats might also be concerned about overreach by the Fed too and join him.
Manchin continues to press the Federal Reserve to end its bond-buying program quickly and has recently spoken to both Brainard and Powell. The West Virginia Democrat, who torpedoed a major piece of Biden’s climate legislative agenda earlier this year and has defended fossil fuels, said this week he hasn’t focused on the potential for climate regulations coming from the Fed.
Tester, who is on the Banking Committee, has backed deregulation efforts for smaller banks and has expressed wariness of the push by progressives for sweeping changes at the Fed.
Bloomberg has previously reported several names being considered by the White House for the top regulator spot, including Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor and former deputy Treasury secretary; and Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. 
Other candidates for board slots include Valerie Wilson, director of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute’s Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy; Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University; William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO and Karen Dynan, a former top Treasury official under President Barack Obama and an economics professor at Harvard University.
“We expect any of the nominees who have been widely discussed would likely be confirmed by the Senate, but some would lead to much messier fights with narrower, more partisan confirmation votes and greater risk of failure,” Evercore ISI analyst Tobin Marcus wrote in a note Monday.
Cordray particularly has been a target of GOP ire and his nomination would spark “an unnecessarily grueling fight, for little obvious benefit,” Marcus wrote. “He would be a slightly more exciting pick for progressives, but we believe they would also be satisfied with Bloom Raskin.”

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin have a chasm of mutual distrust to bridge when they hold a virtual meeting on Tuesday in the shadow of what the United States believes is a threatened Russian invasion of Ukraine.
""A lamentable state,"" was how the Kremlin described relations ahead of the extended video conference call, which it expects to start around 1500 GMT/10 a.m. ET.
Washington has accused Russia of massing troops near the border with Ukraine to intimidate an aspiring NATO member, suggesting it could be a repeat of Moscow's 2014 playbook, when it seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. It says the West is ready with tough sanctions if Russia invades.
The Kremlin has rejected the idea that its forces are poised to invade as fear-mongering and has said its troops move around its own territory for purely defensive purposes.
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possiblity of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a ""red line"" it will not allow to be crossed.
Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
""I don't accept anybody's red lines,"" Biden said on Friday.
Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council which is close to the Foreign Ministry, said their positions were unlikely to be reconciled.
""The only thing they can probably agree on - if it turns out to be a good conversation – is that everybody directly or indirectly engaged there in the situation should demonstrate restraint and commitment to de-escalate. But otherwise I see no way how Biden can promise Putin that NATO will not go east.""
A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said Washington wanted to avert a crisis and a negative spiral in the broader relationship through diplomacy and de-escalation.
Some Russian and U.S. analysts have suggested the leaders could agree to set up de-escalation talks and the Kremlin has made clear it wants a new Putin-Biden summit next year.
While U.S. officials have repeatedly said they do not know Putin's intentions towards Ukraine, a Biden administration official told Reuters the United States believed one option he was weighing was a military offensive as soon as early 2022 involving 175,000 troops, armoured units and artillery.
The U.S. estimated that half of those Russian units were already near the Ukrainian border, the same official said.
SAVING FACE
The United States offered last week to mediate between Russia and Ukraine on ending the seven-year-old war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists on the basis of the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow has no objections to that in principle.
But Vladimir Frolov, a foreign policy analyst and former Russian diplomat in the United States, said drawing Washington into that process would look like a defeat for Moscow. Nor was he confident that Putin would settle for a vague promise of talks on the future security architecture of Europe.
""By demanding legally binding guarantees Moscow has narrowed the room for manoeuvre for its diplomacy, which kind of tells you they are not really betting on diplomacy to succeed,"" Frolov said.
In Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine's armed forces were capable of fighting off any attack from Russia as the country marked its national army day on Monday with a display of U.S. armoured vehicles and patrol boats.
'NO MORE STRENGTH'
People interviewed on the streets of the Ukrainian capital had mixed expectations of Tuesday's talks.
""We believe that Biden is a big friend of our country. So far he proved himself as a person who sincerely wants to help Ukraine out of this senseless situation,"" said Volodymyr Pylypyuk, 71.
But Ruslan Lapuk, a 28-year-old bartender, saw little chance of a breakthrough. ""We have nobody to count on but on our own forces, on ourselves first of all,"" he said.
Vladimir Bulatov, 61, told Reuters in Moscow that the leaders should talk about reducing the risk of a ""hot war"", but he doubted whether it was possible. ""I don't believe anything sensible will come out of this meeting.""

Elena, a pensioner interviewed in the conflict region of eastern Ukraine, said she was pinning her hopes on a halt to shelling.
""Things have to change - that's what we are hoping for,"" she said. ""We have no more strength to endure this.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden celebrated artists including Bette Midler, Joni Mitchell and Lorne Michaels on Sunday at the Kennedy Center Honors, bringing back presidential participation to an annual event skipped by Republican Donald Trump.
Singer Justino Díaz and Motown founder Berry Gordy rounded out the group of artists selected by the Kennedy Center for top honors this year at a show that had been upended by politics and the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""To all of the Kennedy Center honorees past and present, thank you for sharing your gift with the nation and ... with the world,"" Biden said at a black-tie reception at the White House.
Trump did not hold such a reception during his four years in office and did not attend the show at the Kennedy Center.
The arts community largely did not object to that absence. Singer and actress Cher, an honoree in 2018 and an outspoken Trump critic, said she would have had to accept the award in a bathroom if Trump had come.
Biden, his wife, Jill, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, all attended the ceremony, as did House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
""It is quite nice, very nice, to see the presidential box once again being occupied,"" comedian David Letterman said at the beginning of the show. The crowd rose in a standing ovation.
The awards recognize a lifetime of achievement in the performing arts. The show did not take place in 2020 because of the pandemic. Instead, last year's honorees were celebrated in a scaled-down event earlier this year. 
Audience members on Sunday had to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19.
Midler, a singer and actress, has received Grammy, Emmy, Tony and Golden Globe awards for a career spanning decades, with over 30 million albums sold around the world. Actresses Goldie Hawn, Scarlett Johansson and Barbara Hershey paid tribute to her at the event. ""Nothing stops Bette,"" Hawn said.
Midler dished to reporters about the reception on her way into the Kennedy Center. ""It was divine at the White House,"" she said. ""Very clean. Lovely. Great staff. Food was excellent. Wine was a little sweet."" 
'I THINK I'M IN A DREAM'
Singer-songwriter Mitchell, a Canadian known for songs such as ""Both Sides, Now"" and ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" is a multi-Grammy recipient and an inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The show opened with performances of her songs ""The Circle Game"" and ""A Case of You"" by Norah Jones and a soaring rendition of ""River"" by Brandi Carlile.
Michaels, also a native of Canada, is the creator and executive producer of the long-running NBC sketch comedy show ""Saturday Night Live.""
Biden noted SNL had used seven comics to play him over the years.
""If you can't laugh at yourself, we're in real trouble, and you make me laugh at myself a lot,"" Biden said during his remarks at the White House, referring to Michaels. Current and former SNL cast members lauded and roasted the producer during the show and singer Paul Simon sang ""America.""
Diaz, a bass-baritone opera singer from Puerto Rico, was celebrated with performances from ""Carmen"" and ""Faust.""
""It's like coming home again,"" Diaz told reporters as he entered the Kennedy Center. ""Except a different part of the house: I'll be in a very easy chair and I don't have to sing.""
Gordy, a songwriter and record producer from Detroit, founded the Motown record label that became synonymous with a jazz- and blues-influenced musical sound popularized by Black artists including Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Lionel Richie, whose careers he helped shape.
Wonder sang and played from the Kennedy Center stage, including ""You are the Sunshine of My Life"" and ""Superstition."" Smokey Robinson also sang and paid tribute to his friend.

""I think I'm in a dream ... and it's a wonderful dream,"" Gordy told reporters.
The Kennedy Center Honors will be broadcast on CBS television network on Dec. 22.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bob Dole, who overcame grievous World War Two combat wounds to become a pre-eminent figure in U.S. politics as a longtime Republican senator from Kansas and his party's unsuccessful 1996 presidential nominee, died on Sunday. He was 98.
Dole, known for a wit that ranged from self-deprecating to caustic, died in his sleep, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation said. Dole announced in February that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and would begin treatment.
""America has lost one of its heroes; our family has lost its rock,"" Dole's family said in a statement. ""He embodied the integrity, humor, compassion and unbounded work ethic of the wide open plains of his youth. He was a powerful voice for pragmatic conservatism.""
Dole sought the presidency three times and was the Republican Party's nominee in 1996 but lost to Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton. Dole was his party's vice presidential nominee in 1976 on a ticket headed by incumbent President Gerald Ford but they lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter and his running mate Walter Mondale.
Dole, known for referring to himself in the third person, made a classic American journey from the poverty of the Great Depression of the 1930s, through World War Two battlefields to the corridors of power with a stoic Midwestern dignity.
He represented Kansas in Congress for 35 years: 1961 to 1969 in the House of Representatives and 1969 to 1996 in the Senate. Dole helped shepherd Republican President Ronald Reagan's legislative agenda as Senate majority leader in the 1980s and spearheaded important legislation of his own.
Dole, who lost the use of his right arm from a war wound, was an advocate for the disabled and worked to shore up the finances of the Social Security retirement program. Dole was instrumental in passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability in employment, public accommodations and transportation. 
He also was a key figure behind building a memorial honoring Americans who served in World War Two on Washington's National Mall, now a popular tourist stop.
President Joe Biden fondly recalled his visit to Dole in February at the Watergate complex in Washington where he lived.
""We picked up right where we left off, as though it were only yesterday that we were sharing a laugh in the Senate dining room or debating the great issues of the day, often against each other, on the Senate floor,"" Biden said in a statement.
""Though we often disagreed, he never hesitated to work with me or other Democrats when it mattered most,"" Biden said in a statement, a contrast to today's bitter partisanship that has made it hard for the major parties to cooperate on legislation.
Former President Donald Trump called Dole ""an American war hero."" In a statement, Trump added, ""the Republican Party was made stronger by his service.""
Dole, who described himself as ""a Trumper"" in support of the former president, in July voiced impatience with Trump's ongoing allegation that the 2020 election had been stolen from him because of massive voter fraud -- a claim that has been rejected by several court challenges and Trump's own Justice Department.
""He lost the election, and I regret that he did,"" Dole told USA Today's Susan Page. ""I'm sort of Trumped out,"" he added.
""When I think of the greatest generation, I think of Senator Bob Dole -- a man who dedicated his life to serving our country. Rest In Peace, my friend,"" Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
American flags were ordered to fly at half-staff at the White House, the U.S. Capitol and other federal buildings.
1996 ELECTION
""To those who believe that I am too combative, I say if I am combative, it is for love of country,"" Dole said in his speech accepting his party's 1996 presidential nomination. ""... And to those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say that in politics honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance."" 
Dole defeated rivals including conservative commentator Pat Buchanan to secure the nomination. At age 73, he found himself facing Clinton, 50 at the time, a charismatic embodiment of the postwar baby boom who already had weathered charges of adultery and military draft evasion.
Dole subtly raised Clinton's past by saying: ""If something happened along the route and you had to leave your children with Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, I think you'd probably leave them with Bob Dole.""
Clinton defeated Dole, capturing 49 percent of the popular vote to Dole's 41 percent and third-party challenger Ross Perot's 8 percent. Dole won 19 of the 50 states, losing the state-by-state Electoral College by a 379-159 count.
Clinton in 1997 awarded Dole the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Dole in 2018 received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow. 
On Capitol Hill, Dole was a pragmatic conservative and an effective legislator liked by Democrats as well as Republicans for his ability to build coalitions and pass broadly acceptable laws. He was Senate majority leader from 1985 to 1987 and then again from 1995 to 1996, and was Senate minority leader from 1987 to 1995.
Dole acquired a reputation for sometimes lashing out at rivals and assumed the role of ""hatchet man"" as Ford's running mate in 1976. 
In a 1976 debate with Mondale, Dole declared: ""If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans, enough to fill the city of Detroit."" Trying to recoup from that statement, Dole displayed a flash of humor, saying, ""They told me to go for the jugular, so I did - mine."" 
When he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, Dole snapped at Vice President George H.W. Bush, saying, ""Stop lying about my record."" Bush won the nomination and the presidency. Dole attended Bush's 2018 funeral service at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, standing up from his wheelchair with the help of an aide and raising his left hand for a final salute.
Dole also sought the 1980 Republican presidential nomination eventually won by Reagan.
Dole's wife, Elizabeth, served as Republican senator from North Carolina from 2003 to 2009, and as Bush's secretary of labor and Reagan's secretary of transportation.
WAR HERO
Robert Joseph Dole was born on July 22, 1923, one of four children of a grain elevator manager and a traveling saleswoman in Russell, Kansas.
As a U.S. Army lieutenant in World War Two, he led an assault on a German machine-gun nest in Italy. A shell wrecked his right shoulder, paralyzed his right arm, broke vertebrae, riddled his body with shrapnel and cost him a kidney. Decorated for heroism, Dole spent 39 months in hospitals before returning to civilian life. 

Dole attended law school, unable to write but getting through with the help of his first wife, Phyllis, who transcribed class lectures he recorded. Dole had one daughter, Robin, from his first marriage.
Dole became involved in the 2016 Republican presidential campaign by endorsing Jeb Bush and joining his campaign. After Bush dropped out, Dole endorsed eventual winner Donald Trump. Former Dole adviser Paul Manafort served as Trump's campaign chairman. In 2017, Dole praised Trump for having ""immensely helped restore our position as leader of the free world.""

Boebert described Omar, a Muslim who was born in Somalia, as a member of a ""jihad squad"" at an event in her home state of Colorado last month and said it was safe to ride with her in a Capitol elevator if she was not wearing a backpack. 
A first-term lawmaker who has vowed to defy Washington's gun laws, Boebert apologized for the comments. But a phone call between the two women ended in rancor with Boebert showing no sign of remorse. Democrats later called for the House to strip Boebert of her committee assignments for what they called anti-Muslim bigotry. 
""I have had a conversation with the speaker, and I'm very confident that she will take decisive action next week,"" Omar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. 
""When I first got to Congress, I was worried that I wasn't going to be allowed to be sworn in because there was a ban on the hijab. She promised me that she would take care of it. She fulfilled that promise. She's made another promise to me that she will take care of this. And I believe her.""
There was no immediate comment from Pelosi or Boebert. 
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy defended Boebert last week, saying she had apologized publicly and personally to Omar. 
Omar did not say what action Pelosi might take.

The Democratic-controlled House censured Republican Representative Paul Gosar last month for an anime video that depicted him killing progressive congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a pair of swords at President Joe Biden. It also stripped Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments earlier this year for past remarks supporting violence against Democrats.
Boebert, Gosar and Greene are all hard-line conservatives and outspoken allies of former President Donald Trump.

574,"<span>Dec 04, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -CNN fired news anchor Chris Cuomo, the network announced on Saturday, after ""additional information"" came to light during an investigation into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, deal with allegations of sexual misconduct.
Cuomo, who hosted CNN's most-watched prime-time news show, had been suspended on Tuesday. He had admitted in May that he had broken some of the cable news network's rules in advising his brother how to handle the allegations from a public relations perspective.
Andrew Cuomo, 63, was forced to step down as governor in August after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.
In a statement on Saturday, CNN said, ""Chris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother's defense."" ""We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately,"" it added. The network did not provide details on the new information.
In a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Cuomo, 51, said he was disappointed. 
""This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother,"" he said. 
In journalism it is considered a breach of ethics to use one's position to advocate for a personal cause or to conduct investigations for personal reasons.
Cuomo was initially suspended after New York Attorney General Letitia James showed text and other messages in which he sought to use his own sources in news media outlets to find out information on the case and the women involved in it.
A criminal complaint charging Andrew Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex offense was filed on Oct. 29 in a New York court.
Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, gained national fame last year during the COVID-19 outbreak for his briefings about how New York was dealing with the outbreak, and would often appear on his brother's show then.

Chris Cuomo, who had tested positive for the coronavirus and at one point was self-isolating in his basement, had virtually participated in a briefing his brother was holding for other reporters.
The two brothers' father, the late Mario Cuomo, also served as governor of New York.

A U.S. congressman on Saturday posted a Christmas picture of himself and what appeared to be his family, smiling and posing with an assortment of guns, just days after four teenagers were killed in a shooting at a Michigan high school.
""Merry Christmas! ps. Santa, please bring ammo,"" U.S. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Ethan Crumbley, 15, on Tuesday carried out the deadliest U.S. school shooting this year, the latest in a decades-long series of mass shootings at U.S. schools. His parents were arrested https://www.reuters.com/world/us/parents-suspected-michigan-school-shooter-themselves-wanted-taken-into-custody-2021-12-04 on Saturday in connection with the slayings.
Massie, who represents a solidly Republican district, posted the picture of himself and six others holding firearms resembling an M60 machine gun, AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and a Thompson submachine gun.
Some semi-automatic weapons are made to look nearly identical to fully automatic weapons like machine guns. Under U.S. law, weapons like machine guns are restricted to the military, law enforcement and civilians who have obtained special licenses for weapons made before May 1986.
Jonathan van Norman, a campaign manager for Massie, did not immediately reply to a request for comment via Twitter.
Democratic U.S. Representative John Yarmuth, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee, condemned his fellow Kentuckian's post.
""I’m old enough to remember Republicans screaming that it was insensitive to try to protect people from gun violence after a tragedy,"" Yarmuth wrote on Twitter, apparently referring to calls for gun control laws.

""I promise not everyone in Kentucky is an insensitive asshole,"" he added.
The shooting in Oxford, Michigan - in which four teenagers were killed and a teacher and six other students were wounded - was the latest in a string of sometimes-deadlier incidents that have prompted fierce debates over school safety, gun control and gun rights.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights inquiry into police practices in yet another city, investigating possible systemic abuses in the New York suburb of Mount Vernon and whether officers targeted Black residents, used excessive force and conducted illegal searches, officials said on Friday.
The department's Civil Rights Division since President Joe Biden took office in January also has launched investigations into police practices in Minneapolis https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-launch-probe-minneapolis-police-after-george-floyd-murder-report-2021-04-21, Phoenix https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-justice-department-launches-probe-into-policing-practices-arizona-2021-08-05 and Louisville, Kentucky https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-launch-review-louisville-kentucky-police-abc-news-2021-04-26, following protests in many U.S. cities last year against racism and police brutality.
Kristen Clarke, assistant U.S. attorney general for the civil rights division, and Manhattan's U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced the investigation into possible abuses by the city of Mount Vernon, which has a population of roughly 70,000, and its police department. 
Clarke said investigators will look at evidence suggesting that Black residents are targeted for ""abuse and excessive force,"" and that police supervisors may be teaching this targeting.
The inquiry, she said, was prompted by tips and publicly available information.
""We have received information about the repeated use of excessive force, often against individuals who are handcuffed,"" Clarke said. ""Similarly, reports indicate that officers routinely conducted searches without sufficient legal basis, including strip searches.""
A statement provided by a city spokesperson said that Mount Vernon officials will fully cooperate with the investigation.
The statement said that since taking office in 2020, Mayor Patterson Howard has ""demonstrated her commitment to transparency and transformation"" by launching an internal investigation into past allegations of abuse and corruption within the city's police department.

Since then, Police Commissioner Glenn Scott has implemented new policies and procedures ""to ensure that every police encounter is equitable and non-discriminatory,"" the statement said. It added that the information from this internal probe was turned over to local prosecutors and the U.S. Justice Department.

577,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration is not lobbying against a U.S. bill that would ban some Chinese imports over concern about forced labor among Uyghurs, which Republicans have accused Democrats of stalling, the White House said on Friday.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region, is set to be considered by the House of Representatives as soon as next week, the bill's sponsor, congressman Jim McGovern, told reporters on Thursday.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded to a Washington Post report https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/02/congress-needs-act-xi-jinpings-genocide-now that suggested the Biden administration was telling lawmakers to slow the bill down while the White House pursues a more targeted approach, rather than a blanket ban on goods from the region, and support from other countries. 
The Post article said Biden administration sources had confirmed that in an October call between Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, a co-sponsor of the bill, Sherman made it clear the administration preferred such an approach. 
It said she told Merkley that getting buy-in of allies was critical and more effective than unilateral action.
Sherman was asked at a Brookings Institution event with the chief of the European Union's diplomatic service on Friday whether the administration supported a bill banning goods from Xinjiang on the assumption they were tainted by forced labor.
""Secretary Blinken, very early on, and I have as well, have called what has occurred in Xinjiang genocide,"" she replied, referring to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
""We are quite concerned, and remain concerned, about the horrific human rights abuses that have taken place. And the particular amendment that you're discussing, the administration does not oppose this amendment,"" she said.
""We need to stand in solidarity with the Uyghurs, with religious minorities all over the world, to make sure that they can live in security and dignity.""
Merkley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Washington Post report and Sherman's remarks. 
Republicans have accused Biden's Democrats of stalling the legislation because it would complicate the president's renewable energy agenda, which requires Chinese cooperation. The Democrats deny this.
If the Uyghur measure becomes law, the sponsors have said it would create a ""rebuttable presumption"" that all goods from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has set up a vast network of detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslims, were made with forced labor.

China denies abuses in Xinjiang, which supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels, but the U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio has been demanding that the measure be included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, delaying the Senate's consideration of the massive annual bill setting policy for the Pentagon.

""Through his attorney, Mr. Clark has informed the Select Committee of a medical condition that precludes his participation in tomorrow's meeting and he has provided ample evidence of his claim,"" the House of Representatives Select Committee said on Friday, adding it had agreed to postpone the deposition until Dec. 16.
The panel had been expected to ask Clark about allegations that he tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election. He was expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which could help stave off contempt charges the committee has already recommended against him.

Several people have said in sworn testimony https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ex-us-justice-official-declines-testify-about-his-advice-trump-election-2021-11-05 that Clark encouraged Trump to oust the acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, and install him as head of the department so he could launch investigations to bolster Trump's false election fraud claims. Trump dropped the idea after discovering that all of the remaining top Justice Department officials would quit if he appointed Clark.
A former head of the Justice Department's Environmental and Natural Resources Division, Clark clashed with his colleagues long before the election drama. According to Reuters reporting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-justice-ally-clark-clashed-with-colleagues-long-before-election-drama-2021-12-03, he tried to block major pollution cases and created a ""Trespass Team"" to find ways to use nuisance laws to go after protesters in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 2020.

The Treasury declined to provide specifics on those facing sanctions. The plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The Treasury will also announce proposals designed to close loopholes that allow corrupt officials to exploit the real estate market and to address gaps in the corporate transparency network that allow corruption to flourish and illicit proceeds to flow into the United States, the spokesperson said.
""Treasury will take a series of actions to designate individuals who are engaged in malign activities that undermine democracy and democratic institutions around the world including corruption, repression, organized crime, and serious human rights abuse,"" the spokesperson said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A lawyer for Donald Trump on Friday urged a U.S. appeals court to find the former president immune from author E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit arising from her allegation that he raped her, an argument Carroll's lawyer said would put him ""above the law.""
Alina Habba, Trump's lawyer, told a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that letting Carroll sue could undermine the presidency by unleashing ""frivolous"" lawsuits when the president speaks on public issues.
""This is not a political matter,"" Habba told the judges. ""This is not about being a Democrat or a Republican.""
Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine columnist, accused Trump in a June 2019 book excerpt of raping her in late 1995 or early 1996 in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in midtown Manhattan.
She sued Trump for defamation in November 2019 after Trump told a reporter he did not know Carroll, said ""she's not my type https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women/trump-denies-womans-sexual-assault-accusation-shes-not-my-type-idUSKCN1TQ24S,"" and accused her of concocting the rape claim to sell her book.
Carroll's lawyer Joshua Matz said Trump acted with ""private motives"" when speaking and was not protected by a federal law that provides immunity to government employees from defamation claims.
""Denying a remedy in the name of the nation's sovereign immunity is at odds with the maxim that nobody is above the law,"" Matz said.
The appeals court did not immediately rule. 
The judges gave strong signals they might defer a decision and ask a Washington-based court for guidance on whether the law there protected Trump.
""I don't know whether D.C. would say 'she's not my type' is part of the job of president,"" Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi said.
'CRUDE AND OFFENSIVE'
Circuit Judge Denny Chin asked Habba: ""You are taking a categorical approach, then: Whatever he does, whatever he says, it's an act of the United States?""
""That is my position to some extent,"" Habba responded, ""and frankly it has never been questioned until this point.""
William Nardini, the panel's third judge, questioned whether there was a ""limiting principle"" against forcing presidents to measure their language whenever they talk, and not risk liability if they ""lose their cool.""
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration sided with Trump in the appeal, despite what Justice Department lawyer Mark Freeman called the Republican businessman-turned-politician's ""crude and offensive comments"" in response to Carroll's ""very serious"" accusations.
""Any president facing a public accusation of this kind in which the media is very interested would feel obliged to answer questions,"" Freeman said.
Trump's Justice Department, acting at the behest of then-Attorney General William Barr, tried to substitute the government as the defendant in Carroll's case, which could doom it. The Biden administration essentially adopted that argument.
Carroll's lawyers have said they want to question Trump under oath and obtain a DNA sample from him to compare against a dress Carroll said she wore during the alleged rape.
Trump said on Wednesday he plans to countersue Carroll under New York state law for interfering with his free speech.

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality television show ""The Apprentice"" who accused him of sexual assault, abruptly ended https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-apprentice-contestant-zervos-ends-lawsuit-against-donald-trump-2021-11-12 her own defamation lawsuit against Trump on Nov. 12. Trump had called her claims a ""hoax.""
The case is Carroll v Trump et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 20-3977, 20-3978.

(Reuters) - The story had a bombshell headline: “Thousands of fake votes” had been discovered in Madison, Wisconsin, two weeks after Democrat Joe Biden narrowly beat then-President Donald Trump in the state.
The bogus report from the far-right website Gateway Pundit drew attention to a set of initials – MLW – inscribed on what it claimed were “fake” ballots. Then a reader posted a comment on the story correctly identifying MLW: Maribeth L. Witzel-Behl, the Madison city clerk, whose duties include administering elections.
Other commenters soon called for Witzel-Behl’s execution. She found one post especially unnerving. It recommended a specific bullet for killing her – a 7.62 millimeter round for an AK-47 assault rifle.
Witzel-Behl was stunned by the threats and the angry calls that poured into her office. Contrary to the story’s insinuation that the initials meant the ballots were fake, in reality she and her staff wrote her initials on all absentee ballots, before they were given to voters, as a matter of policy.
Witzel-Behl is among 25 election officials and workers targeted by more than 100 threatening and hostile communications that have cited the Gateway Pundit since last year’s election, according to a Reuters review of the materials, which included emails, letters and phone messages, as well as comments posted on the website’s stories.
The messages targeted officials and staff in four jurisdictions that featured repeatedly in false or misleading Pundit reports on voter-fraud claims: the Wisconsin cities of Madison and Milwaukee; Fulton County, Georgia; and Maricopa County, Arizona.
At least five of the officials, including Witzel-Behl, received threats they considered serious enough to report to law enforcement. Among those targeted were a municipal election director in Milwaukee and a Republican supervisor in Maricopa County. The targets also included Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, a mother and daughter who staffed a ballot counting operation in Fulton County; their ordeal was detailed this week by Reuters.
After Gateway Pundit ran an Aug. 14 story about them, a commenter posted below the piece: “The two women are traitors to the country and should be hung by the neck until dead.”
Two additional officials, a Fulton County election commissioner and another Maricopa county supervisor, blamed the Gateway Pundit for inciting serious threats of violence they received after the site implicated the officials in baseless claims of election-rigging. Those threats did not reference the website by name.
Most of the 25 officials received harassing messages that were less violent but often intimidating, racist or misogynistic. Many messages accused officials of treason, for instance, or called for their imprisonment.
The threats and harassment inspired by the Gateway Pundit illustrate the central role of disinformation in a campaign of fear being waged by Trump supporters against the frontline administrators of American democracy.
“The Gateway Pundit brought your betrayal of Wisconsin and America to my attention,” said one threat emailed to Claire Woodall-Vogg, the Milwaukee elections director. “I hope you know there are consequences for your actions. I know a lot of information about you. I will have to think about what comes next.”
The harassing communications linked to the Gateway Pundit are among more than 800 menacing messages to election officials documented by Reuters this year, including more than 100 threats that legal experts said could meet the legal threshold for federal criminal prosecution. Such threats are considered crimes if they instill fear of imminent violence or death. Law enforcement, however, has held almost no one accountable.
In more than 10% of those 800 messages, the harassers cited the Gateway Pundit as the source of the information that caused them to lash out at election officials. No other media outlet or social-media platform was mentioned more than a handful of times.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on whether it was investigating any of the Gateway Pundit-inspired messages but said it “takes all threats of violence seriously.” No arrests have been made. The Department of Justice, which in June launched a task force to address threats against election workers, did not respond to a comment request.
The Gateway Pundit has emerged as a major player in an expanding far-right media universe that includes TV broadcasters One America News Network and Newsmax, along with the video-sharing site BitChute and social media platforms Parler and Gab. Since the 2020 election, the Pundit has bolstered Trump’s false stolen-election narrative with coverage that generated outrage and helped grow its audience.
The Pundit’s U.S. web traffic approached 50 million monthly visits in the weeks after Trump’s November loss, up from about 15 million a year earlier, according to Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB), an internet-traffic intelligence service. More recently – from July through September – the audience settled at an average of 33 million monthly visits. That’s nearly double the 17 million monthly visits averaged over the same period by the website for MSNBC, the cable news channel known for left-leaning hosts.
The Gateway Pundit describes itself as a publisher of news and commentary. Launched in 2004 as an opinion blog, it established itself as one of Trump’s most dogged promoters in the 2016 presidential race. During the campaign, Trump regularly cited or retweeted Gateway Pundit stories. Once elected, he quickly granted the site White House press credentials.
A Trump spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Constitution’s free-speech and free-press provisions give news outlets – even those that publish false stories that spur threats – broad protections against any legal liability, especially criminal charges. Media can be sued for defamation, but such cases can be especially challenging to win for public officials, including many election workers and administrators.
Officials must prove not only reputational damage but ""actual malice."" That standard, established by the U.S. Supreme Court, means plaintiffs must prove not only that they were harmed by the publication of false information, but also that the publisher either knew the information was false or operated with “reckless disregard for the truth,” said Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University media law professor.
“Defamation is difficult to win for everybody, but it's more difficult for public figures like most of these plaintiffs,” Gutterman said.
The Gateway Pundit currently faces at least three defamation suits filed by people who allege they faced numerous threats after being vilified in false stories. The first two suits don’t involve public officials; the site is contesting both, asserting it broke no laws and had no responsibility for the threats of violence. The third was filed yesterday by Freeman and Moss, the election workers in Georgia. A lawyer for Gateway Pundit had no comment on that suit.
The Pundit has faced some commercial blowback for its false and incendiary content. In September, it lost a major revenue source when Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stopped placing ads on the site, citing its publication of “demonstrably false” election stories. Over the previous 10 months, the Pundit earned an estimated $1.3 million from ads placed through Google’s AdSense program, according to an analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which combats online extremism.
The Pundit has retained other advertising, mostly “clickbait” promotions placed by ad networks on behalf of hundreds or thousands of companies and products. The site gets paid based on the number of ads clicked.
Reuters asked five ad networks that have appeared prominently on Gateway Pundit if they were concerned about its content. Two, Jeeng and ZergNet, said they reviewed the site in response to the Reuters inquiry and decided to stop placing ads on it. Two others, Revcontent LLC and MGID, said they are reconsidering their relationships with the site. A fifth, LockerDome, did not respond to comment requests.
Gateway Pundit’s owner and editor, Jim Hoft, is an Iowa native with a college biology degree and no previous journalism background. Hoft writes many of the articles, along with his twin brother, Joe Hoft, and a half-dozen or so contributors. After a mass shooting in 2016 killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Hoft wrote a Breitbart News column in which he came out as gay. Noting that the shooter sympathized with radical Islamist groups, he argued that the best way to protect gay people from more attacks was to re-elect Trump because he would be tough on extremists.
Jim Hoft did not respond to interview requests sent to him and his lawyer. Joe Hoft also had no comment.
“We never support any violence,” Jim Hoft said in an August deposition for a lawsuit. The suit alleged that his site defamed and incited threats against a former staffer of Dominion Voting Systems, a voting equipment maker often featured in the Pundit’s coverage. “We report on different individuals every day, and we always consider their safety.”
Hoft is seeking reader support through several online fundraising campaigns on GiveSendGo, a crowdfunding site. Those campaigns have raised more than $250,000 to date, according to the site. On the Pundit site, Hoft urges readers to show support by buying subscriptions. “There’s a battle for survival of the Gateway Pundit,” he says in the message.
""WE'RE COMING FOR YOU, CLAIRE""
The threat that came to Milwaukee election chief Woodall-Vogg – citing the Gateway Pundit on her “betrayal’’ – was sent to the private email address she reserves for friends and family. The subject line: “Hello Marxist Bitch.”
The Pundit began targeting Woodall-Vogg days after the election, when she informed the Wisconsin Elections Commission that a flash drive used with the city’s vote-tabulating machines was inadvertently left at a processing center on election night. The drive was retrieved within minutes and was never unattended, she explained in a letter to the commissioners. The county district attorney reviewed the matter and found no evidence of tampering.
The Gateway Pundit responded with a story headlined: “Milwaukee Elections Chief Lost Elections Flash Drive in Morning Hours of November 4th When Democrats Miraculously Found 120,000 Votes for Joe Biden.”
Woodall-Vogg began getting angry emails almost immediately. The messages continued as multiple audits and reviews confirmed Milwaukee’s results, which had helped Biden win Wisconsin.
In late July, another Pundit headline sparked a new wave of intimidation: “BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Uncovered Email Shows Milwaukee Elections Executive Woodall-Vogg Laughing About the Election Steal on Election Night.” The evidence: a joking email exchange between Woodall-Vogg and Ryan Chew, a staffer with The Elections Group, a nonprofit organization that provided free pre-election guidance to localities on improving 2020 voting processes.
Shortly after Milwaukee’s final votes were reported late on election night, Chew wrote: “Damn, Claire, you have a flair for drama, delivering just the margin needed at 3:00 a.m. I bet you had those votes counted at midnight and just wanted to keep the world waiting!” Woodall-Vogg replied: “Lol. I just wanted to wait to say I had been awake for a full 24 hours.”
Chew and Woodall-Vogg told Reuters the exchange was an unfortunate but meaningless joke. Chew said it would have been “absurd” for Woodall-Vogg to stay up late to add drama. “That absurdity was the essence of the joke,” Chew said.
The Pundit characterized the exchange as evidence that Woodall-Vogg was part of a multi-state fraud to manufacture a late-night “drop” of Biden votes. Woodall-Vogg’s inbox exploded with more than 70 furious messages. Many cited the Pundit. Some called for her execution. One asked if she had private security. Some people left threatening voicemails. One said: “We’re coming for you, Claire.”
Woodall-Vogg left town with her two children, working remotely for 10 days. She referred a half-dozen threatening messages to Milwaukee police. The department told Reuters it had referred the communications to the FBI after police determined they could not be prosecuted under state or local law.
At the elections office, security glass and other protections are being added.
“The threats where I truly was concerned – the ones specific to me and my family – those didn’t happen until the Gateway Pundit article,” she said.
'TICK, TICK, TICK'
In June, Vernetta Nuriddin, a Democratic member of Georgia’s Fulton County election board, was starting her summer vacation when her inbox filled with two dozen hostile emails. One subject line: “Tick, Tick, Tick.”
“Not long now...,” the email read.
Nuriddin said she found the email “frightening,” suggesting a bomb or other “imminent danger.”
That morning, the email addresses of Nuriddin and other board members were published in a Gateway Pundit report that said they were named in an activists’ lawsuit seeking a review of county absentee ballots. The suit was later dismissed.
Other outlets had reported on the suit days earlier, but the hostile messages to Nuriddin and other board members didn’t start until the Pundit published their email addresses. Some of the messages cited the Gateway Pundit specifically; others, including the tick-tick email, did not. Nuriddin, who left the board this summer when her four-year term ended, said the Pundit’s reports often sparked messages from “people wishing the absolute worst on you, who don’t even know you.”
Nuriddin referred the tick-tick email to the Fulton County Police Department. It dropped the case after deciding the message was not an “articulated threat” that constituted a crime under Georgia law, said Fulton’s chief, Wade Yates.
Reuters identified the sender of the “Tick, Tick” threat: Brian Lohman, of Jacksonville, Florida. He was among nine people who said in interviews for a Nov. 9 Reuters report that they had harassed or threatened election officials.
Lohman told Reuters he didn’t mean to suggest a bomb. He said he had read that Nuriddin was named in the lawsuit over Fulton County ballots and meant to suggest time was running out before she “had to go in front of a judge.” He declined to say whether he got the news – or Nuriddin’s email address – from the Gateway Pundit story.
'HANGING OR GUILLOTINE?'
After the 2020 presidential election, the Pundit ran a slew of stories alleging voter fraud in Arizona’s Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the state’s largest city.
Many of these reports were false, including a May 9 article claiming the county deleted voting-machine data needed for a state audit. An hour after the story was published, county Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Bill Gates and other members received an email with a link to the article.
“You dirty mother f***ing ass holes,” the subject line read. “You all have eyes in the back of your heads?” the message continued. “People have a limit.”
The Pundit continued publishing stories with false voter-fraud claims as multiple audits confirmed the results and Maricopa supervisors defended their accuracy. On Aug. 9, an email landed in the supervisors’ public inbox, asking: “Hanging or Guillotine?” The message cited a debunked Gateway Pundit story that claimed completed ballots from the 2020 election were shredded before they were counted.
Over the next month, Gates and his fellow supervisors would get at least nine more emails from the same sender, several of them citing Gateway Pundit stories and all repeating the warning: “TREASON Hanging or Guillotine?”
The supervisors were already on edge. Gates’ fellow Republican board member, Clint Hickman, had received a voicemail on Aug. 4 that warned: “People are going to be coming and visiting the homes of the board of supervisors and basically executing their families. Should be fun.”
The voicemail did not mention the Gateway Pundit. But Hickman and Gates said they blamed the Pundit’s bogus reporting for inspiring many of the threats and harassing messages against board members. “There’s no question this blog has generated threats toward me, my colleagues, and even my family’s 77-year-old business,” Hickman said, adding that the site conjures “ridiculous scenarios” with “no fact-checking.”
Gates told Reuters he has referred about a dozen hostile messages to police. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office said it has been assessing threats against the supervisors. It has made no arrests.
THREATS OF HANGING AND SHOOTING
Days after the election, Gateway Pundit posted a false story that targeted election officials in Rock County, Wisconsin, about an hour south of Madison.
The site reported that a software glitch led to 10,000 votes being “moved” from Trump to Biden “in just one Wisconsin county.” Such glitches, it said, were a Democratic scheme to “steal” the race.
That article was tweeted by Eric Trump, the former president’s son. He did not respond to an interview request sent through the former president’s office.
In reality, the vote count never changed. The Associated Press had made an error in an election-results table it published and quickly corrected it.
The next morning, County Clerk Lisa Tollefson got a call about the story around 7 a.m. and raced to work, finding the phone lines jammed with enraged Trump voters yelling at her staff. The furor lasted four days, and “was bad enough that we let the sheriff know, and he put protection on us,” Tollefson said.
Two weeks later, on Nov. 28, the Gateway Pundit turned its sights on Maribeth Witzel-Behl, the clerk in Madison, Wisconsin, whose initials appeared on the thousands of absentee ballots that the Pundit had wrongly characterized as “fake.”
Concerned by the story’s inaccuracies and the threats they provoked, she consulted with City Attorney Michael Haas, who sent Hoft an email requesting the Pundit correct the piece and remove the threatening comments.
“If there are additional threats or actual harassment against our employees we will be holding you accountable,” Haas wrote.
The next day, the story was updated: The references to “fake votes” were changed to “suspect votes.” All the comments also were removed from the page. The story was marked as “updated,” but contained no correction.

Joe Hoft, the brother of site founder Jim Hoff, wrote a follow-up story about Haas’s warning. Haas, he asserted, was attacking the Pundit’s free-speech rights.
“We found the City Attorney’s response threatening,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed C. B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger to be the U.S. representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations air safety body.
Sullenberger rose to fame in 2009 as a commercial pilot who safely landed an Airbus A320 on New York's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River after hitting a flock of geese - known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight.
In September, Sullenberger said Belarus should be temporarily barred from voting at the council in response to its May diversion of a Ryanair flight.
One big issue at ICAO for Sullenberger, whose post carries the rank of ambassador, will be global efforts to reduce aviation emissions.
Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would not rewrite the first-ever standards regulating greenhouse gas emissions from airplanes finalized in the last days of former President Donald Trump's administration.
Sullenberger said in September he ""would underscore the administration’s commitment to meaningful action on carbon offsets, sustainable aviation fuels, and gradual direct emissions reductions.""
The Biden administration said it will press for ambitious new international emissions standards at the upcoming round of international negotiations in February at ICAO.

Airplanes have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. In 2016, ICAO agreed on global airplane emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which both endorsed the rules.
Last month, the United States set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050. The White House said in September it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030, as airlines facing pressure from environmental groups to lower their carbon footprint pledged to use more sustainable aviation fuel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans face unprecedented barriers to having their voices heard in the upcoming 2022 and 2024 elections, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said on Wednesday.
In a panel at the Reuters Next conference, Griswold warned of multiple dangers to democracy in the United States, including bills designed to suppress voting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/un-expert-decries-gerrymandering-parts-us-that-denies-minority-voting-rights-2021-11-22, death threats against election officials and mistruths perpetuated by politicians both nationally and on a state level.
Democrats and Republicans are battling for control of the U.S. Congress next year and the presidency in 2024. Democrats hold a slim majority in the House of Representatives now and control in the divided Senate through Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
""Warning lights are blinking red. We are seeing January 6, the attempted stealing of an American presidency, just in slow motion right now,"" Griswold, a Democrat, said.
""What we're seeing right now is no longer about 2020. It's about 2022 and 2024, making what was attempted on January 6 more feasible the next time around. So I believe we are at an incredibly urgent time in terms of things that we have to do, that we must do,"" she said.
Former President Donald Trump has claimed, falsely, that the result of the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and urged a group of loyalists to march on the U.S. Capitol after a rally on Jan. 6. His supporters did so, invading the Capitol, leading to five deaths https://www.reuters.com/world/us/officer-who-responded-us-capitol-attack-is-third-die-by-suicide-2021-08-02.
James Glassman, chairman and CEO of the Glassman Advisory and former Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in former President George W. Bush's administration, called for structural reforms to the voting system, including changing to a popular vote for the presidency rather than the Electoral College.
Glassman also advocated for ranked-choice voting, which he said would help enable third parties to ""have a chance.""
Griswold called for the Senate to pass legislation, whether the Freedom to Vote Act or the ""John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-return-voting-rights-with-eye-filibuster-2021-11-03,"" to counter voter suppression.
Both bills have faced Republican opposition and have stoked calls from Democrats to alter a Senate rule that would make it more difficult for the minority party to erect barriers to election reform legislation. Democrats have not yet coalesced around such a plan.
Reuters in September reported https://www.reuters.com/world/us/backers-trumps-false-fraud-claims-seek-control-next-us-elections-2021-09-22 that a group of Republican secretary-of-state contenders in U.S. swing states have embraced Trump's false claims that he lost a ""rigged"" election. Their candidacies have alarmed Democrats and voting-rights groups.

Secretary-of-state candidates face primary elections next spring and summer and general elections on Nov. 8, 2022.

(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' senior adviser and chief spokesperson Symone Sanders is leaving by the end of the year, the latest high-profile departure from her office amid growing concerns over her communication strategy and how well the first woman to hold the job is being positioned for future political roles.
Sanders, who previously worked for President Joe Biden's campaign, often traveled with Harris on domestic and foreign trips as the vice president navigated the complex social and political issues Biden has assigned her to tackle. 
Harris was tasked in June with leading the Democratic White House's push to increase voting rights at a time when Republicans are passing dozens of laws that civil rights experts say will make it harder for minorities to vote. She was asked in March to address the root causes of migration from Central America to the U.S. southern border, a problem that has bedeviled multiple presidents.
""It's natural for staffers who have thrown their heart and soul into a job to be ready to move on to a new challenge after a few years,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said of Sanders' departure on Thursday. ""It's also an opportunity, as it is in any White House, to bring in new faces, new voices and new perspectives,"" she said. 
The vice president ""values Symone and she is beloved,"" said a White House official who did not wish to be identified.
Earlier this month, Ashley Etienne, Harris' communications director, also left the administration.
A separate White House official familiar with the situation said the departures come amid concerns Harris is not being adequately prepared or positioned for the next natural step in her career, replacing Biden as president, and instead is being sidelined.
Harris has struggled to show she's making an impact on voting, immigration or other policy priorities during the first year of the Biden administration. At the same time, some Republicans and conservative news outlets have made her a target of personal attacks. 
Her approval ratings have been underwater for months. 
Sanders, who did not respond to a request seeking comment, sent a note to staff on Wednesday announcing her decision. 
""From my first days on the president's campaign to traveling with the VP when she joined the ticket, to witnessing the historic swearing in of the President and Vice President. It's been an honor,"" she said.

Sanders worked for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016 before becoming an adviser on Biden's 2020 presidential campaign. She frequently defended Biden on television and helped him build support with Black voters.
She also made it known, both privately and in her memoir, that she was interested in becoming the White House Press Secretary and the first Black woman to hold the job, but was passed over for the role earlier this year.

589,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday presided over the first White House Hanukkah celebration with the Jewish spouse of a vice president, commemorating the Festival of Lights with a significant milestone. 
Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and married to Vice President Kamala Harris, took the opportunity to draw parallels between Jewish and American ideals. 
""As the first Jewish spouse of an American President or Vice President, celebrating Hanukkah...it is humbling,"" he said. ""Our history, our values as Jews, are an essential part of who we are as Americans. Jewish values are American values.""
Hanukkah, Hebrew for “dedication”, commemorates the 2nd century BC victory of Judah Maccabee and his followers in a revolt in Judea and the ensuing restoration of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.
Light is a main theme of the eight-day festival because, Jewish tradition says, the Maccabees found only enough ritually pure oil to fuel the temple’s ceremonial lamp, The Menorah, for one day, but it burned for eight days.
The Menorah featured at the White House event commemorating the fourth night of the holiday was known as the Liberty Bell menorah, designed by Holocaust survivor Manfred Anson in honor of the iconic bell in Philadelphia, the White House said.
Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, also Jewish, participated in the event. 
In his remarks, Biden quoted Dr. Rabbi Aaron Glatt who described Hanukkah as ""Thanksgiving on steroids"" but also took a more somber tone to touch on recent flare-ups of anti-semitism in the United States.

""We need to stand against a resurgence of this type of anti-semitism and other forms of intolerance and hate,"" he said. 
Former President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both Jewish, celebrated Hanukkah in the White House when Trump lived there.

The small increase, which would go well beyond the 5% required by law, is part of a bid to harness the federal government's hefty buying power to boost equity, the White House said. 
""President Biden's committed to leveraging every tool available to him and helping level the playing field for small and underserved businesses ... as a way to narrow the racial wealth gap,"" a senior administration official told reporters on a briefing call prior to the announcement. 
He said the federal government is the single largest buyer of goods and services in the world with $600 billion a year.
""Federal government can be a powerful driver of equity and wealth building in underserved communities,"" he added, noting that the overall goal was to reach 15% by 2025.

Small disadvantaged businesses are a category under federal law for which Black-owned, Latino-owned and other minority-owned businesses ""are presumed to qualify,"" the White House said. 
The move comes after a recent report found that the number of new small business entrants to federal procurement decreased by 60% over the past decade, the White House said.

(Reuters) - Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams said on Wednesday that she is running again for governor of Georgia, setting up a potential rematch against Republican Governor Brian Kemp in a state that has become a key battleground in U.S. elections.
""Opportunity and success in Georgia shouldn't be determined by your ZIP code, background or access to power,"" Abrams, a Democrat, said in a video https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1466140248887418885?s=20 launching her campaign. ""If our Georgia is going to move to its next and greatest chapter, we're going to need leadership.""
Abrams, 47, a former member of the Georgia House of Representatives, lawyer, entrepreneur and romance novelist, became a national Democratic figurehead after losing a hard-fought governor's race to Kemp in 2018 by just 55,000 votes. 
Since that defeat, which many Democrats blamed on voter suppression, Abrams has built a national reputation as a voting rights advocate, founding the organization Fair Fight. She was credited by many Democrats with boosting the party's turnout in 2020, when President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election in nearly three decades.
Two months after Biden's victory, Democrats swept two Senate races in Georgia to give them control of the U.S. Senate. A matchup between Abrams and Kemp next year would offer a test of whether those wins reflect a more permanent Democratic edge in a diversifying and growing Southern state or whether they were driven by antipathy toward Republican former President Donald Trump.
Georgia hasn't had a Democratic governor since Roy Barnes left office in 2003. If she wins next November, Abrams, whom Biden at one point considered as a potential running mate, would be the first Black woman elected governor of a U.S. state.
Kemp, who is running for re-election, reacted on Wednesday by saying that Abrams would have shut down the state over COVID-19 and allowed ""woke politics"" to be part of school lessons. 
""I'm in the fight against Stacey Abrams, the failed Biden agenda, and their woke allies to keep Georgia the best place to live, work, and raise a family,"" Kemp said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Kemp could face a difficult primary battle within his own party after resisting Trump's requests that he convince the Georgia state legislature to overturn the 2020 presidential results showing Biden had beaten Trump. 
Kemp has since signed into law sweeping voting restrictions sponsored by Republicans, with potentially big implications for how elections are administered in Georgia in 2022 and the U.S. presidential contest in 2024.
Proponents say the legislation is needed to safeguard elections and restore voters' faith in the process. Opponents say it was born out of the Republican Party's ""Big Lie,"" the false claim that Biden's defeat of Trump in November 2020 was the result of widespread fraud.

In an interview released earlier on Wednesday at the Reuters Next conference, Abrams said she remains optimistic that Congress will pass federal legislation to advance and protect voting rights, despite Republican opposition.
Georgia is set to vote in congressional and gubernatorial general elections next November. Raphael Warnock, a Baptist preacher from Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church who was elected to the Senate in January in a special election, is also up for re-election for a six year-term.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday will unveil an updated national strategy to combat the AIDS epidemic by boosting money for research, increasing access to treatment, and recognizing the role racism plays in inequitable access to medical services.
The third update to the national AIDS strategy since 2010 sets a lofty target of ending the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030, including a 75% reduction in new HIV infections by 2025 and a 90% reduction by 2030.
HIV/AIDS has killed more than 36 million people around the world - including more than 700,000 in the U.S. - since the virus was first identified in 1981.
During the 2020 campaign, Biden promised to update the national strategy, which was started in 2010 by President Barack Obama.
""President Biden is honoring that commitment by releasing the new national HIV/AIDS strategy on World AIDS Day and providing a framework and a direction for the administration's policies, research, programs and planning,"" a senior administration official said.
Biden is announcing the plan even as the world struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 5.4 million people globally, including more than 700,000 in the United States. It is another illustration of the difficulties world leaders face in stamping out disease.
The new AIDS strategy, outlined in a 98-page document, seeks to address social issues that contribute to HIV risk and health outcomes. It encourages reform of state laws that criminalize HIV transmission and adds a new focus on opportunities to engage the private sector to help fight the HIV epidemic. 

Biden's budget request included $670 million for continued implementation of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative — $267 million more than previous levels.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol voted unanimously on Wednesday in favor of contempt of Congress charges against Jeffrey Clark, a senior Justice Department official under former President Donald Trump.
The seven Democratic and two Republican members of the House of Representatives Select Committee approved a report recommending the criminal charge by a 9-0 vote, after Clark appeared before the committee in early November but declined to answer questions or hand over documents.
The committee's approval of the report paved the way for the entire House to vote on whether to recommend contempt charges, although it also gave him a last chance to cooperate later this week. 
Representative Bennie Thompson, the panel's Democratic chairman, said before the vote that Clark's attorney had contacted them on Wednesday evening and said Clark had invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate and agreed to continue his deposition.
Thompson said the committee nonetheless was going ahead with the contempt proceeding, and had ordered Clark to appear on Saturday. ""We will not allow anyone to run out the clock, and we will insist that he must appear,"" Thompson said.
Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, said the panel would not finalize the contempt process if Clark ""genuinely cures his failure to comply"" on Saturday.
Approval by the full, Democratic-controlled House would send the matter to the Department of Justice for a decision on whether to prosecute.
Clark, former acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, was a proponent of Trump's false claims that his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of fraud.
Clark had argued that he was exempt from having to comply with the Select Committee's subpoena because his communications were protected by legal privilege. 
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE 
Trump has urged former aides to disregard the subpoenas, issuing often-rambling statements insulting its members and arguing that he is protected by executive privilege, a legal principle that shields presidential communications.
Legal experts dispute that argument, saying it does not apply to former presidents. 
The committee has made clear it will force compliance with its subpoenas. 
""There’s nothing extraordinary about Congress seeking the testimony of a former Executive Branch official. Even the former White House chief of staff (Mark Meadows) is now cooperating with our investigation,"" Thompson said.
Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty last month to two counts of contempt of Congress after he defied a committee subpoena.
Nearly 700 people have been charged with taking part in the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 by Trump supporters seeking to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 election loss. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812. 

Four people died the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
The Select Committee has issued at least 45 subpoenas to individuals and organizations and conducted hundreds of interviews with witnesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday signaled a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights in America and perhaps overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide as they indicated they would uphold a restrictive Republican-backed Mississippi law.
The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard about two hours of oral arguments in the southern state's bid to revive its ban on abortion starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy, a law blocked by lower courts. The liberal justices warned against ditching important and longstanding legal precedents like Roe and abandoning a right American women have come to rely upon.
Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, challenged the law and has the support of Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. A ruling is expected by the end of next June.
Roe v. Wade recognized that the right to personal privacy under the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. The Supreme Court in a 1992 ruling called Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed abortion rights and prohibited laws imposing an ""undue burden"" on abortion access. Mississippi asked the justices to overturn the Roe and Casey rulings.
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh voiced a view often expressed by abortion opponents that nothing in the Constitution protects abortion rights.
""The Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice on the question of abortion but leaves the issue to the people of the states or perhaps Congress to resolve in the democratic process,"" Kavanaugh said.
If Roe were overturned, many states ""would continue to freely allow abortion,"" Kavanaugh added. Before the Roe ruling, many states banned abortion. 
Julie Rikelman, arguing for the abortion clinic, said overturning Roe would not mean the court is neutral on abortion as Kavanaugh suggested.
""Women have an equal right to liberty under the Constitution, Your Honor, and if they're not able to make this decision, if states can take control of women's bodies and force them to endure months of pregnancy and childbirth, then they will never have equal status under the Constitution,"" Rikelman told Kavanaugh.
About one in four American women has had an abortion, Rikelman added.
'SURVIVE THE STENCH'
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Mississippi officials sought to bring the issue to the justices only because of the court's rightward shift.
""Will this institution survive the stench this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?"" Sotomayor asked.
Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett - both appointees of Republican former President Donald Trump, who promised to name justices who would overturn Roe - could be key votes in determining how far the court will go. Barrett said overturning a major precedent is justified in certain instances but wondered whether ""public reaction"" should be considered. 
Barrett also asked whether the recent adoption in some states of ""safe haven"" laws, which let women hand over unwanted babies to healthcare facilities without penalty, undermines certain justifications for abortions because women are not forced into motherhood merely by giving birth.
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts suggested the court could uphold Mississippi's law without overturning Roe. It was unclear if the five other conservatives would stop short of toppling Roe.
""Why is 15 weeks not enough time"" for a woman to decide to have an abortion, Roberts asked.
Mississippi's ban is one of a series of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-governed states in recent years. The Supreme Court on Nov. 1 heard arguments over a Texas law banning abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy but has not yet issued a ruling.
Anti-abortion advocates believe they are closer than ever to overturning Roe, a longstanding goal for Christian conservatives. 
'EGREGIOUSLY WRONG'
Conservative justices downplayed the idea that the court must be careful in overturning its own precedents, noting that it has done so in many contexts including overturning a notorious 1895 ruling allowing racial segregation.
""So there are circumstances in which a decision ... must be overruled simply because it was egregiously wrong at the moment it was decided,"" conservative Justice Samuel Alito said. 
U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing Biden's administration, said overturning Roe would be an ""unprecedented contraction"" of individual rights. 
""The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society,"" Prelogar said.
Opinion polls show a majority of Americans support abortion rights.
The Roe and Casey decisions determined that states cannot ban abortion before a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally viewed by doctors as between 24 and 28 weeks. Mississippi's 15-week ban challenges that. Roberts said a ban at 15 weeks is ""not a dramatic departure"" from viability.
Scott Stewart, arguing for Mississippi, said the Roe and Casey rulings ""haunt our country."" 
""They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They've damaged the democratic process. They've poisoned the law. They've choked off compromise,"" Stewart said.
Mississippi is among 12 states with so-called trigger laws designed to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Additional states likely would rapidly curtail abortion access. 

(Graphic: If Roe v. Wade is overturned - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-COURT/ABORTION/jnpweaglgpw/abortion-map.jpg)
If Roe were overturned or limited, in large swathes of America women who want to end a pregnancy could face the choice of having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion, traveling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available or buying abortion pills online. The procedure would remain legal in liberal-leaning states, 15 of which have laws protecting abortion rights.

Here are some key quotes from the oral argument.
SCOTT STEWART, MISSISSIPPI SOLICITOR GENERAL 
Regarding two landmark Supreme Court rulings recognizing abortion rights, in 1973 and 1992 respectively: ""Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey haunt our country. They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They've damaged the democratic process. They've poisoned the law. They've choked off compromise. For 50 years, they've kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve. And 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.""
ELIZABETH PRELOGAR, U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL 
""If this court renounces the liberty interests recognized in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey, it would be an unprecedented contraction of individual rights. ... The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.""
JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR
Regarding passage of Mississippi's law: ""Now the sponsors of this bill, the House bill, in Mississippi, said, 'We're doing it because we have new (Supreme Court) justices.' ... Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?""
""The issue of when life begins has been hotly debated by philosophers since the beginning of time. It's still debated in religions. So, when you say this is the only right that takes away from the state the ability to protect a life, that's a religious view, isn't it?""
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS
Regarding Roe and Casey decisions' determinations that states cannot ban abortion before a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally viewed by doctors as between 24 and 28 weeks: ""I'd like to focus on the 15-week ban because that's not a dramatic departure from viability. It is the standard that the vast majority of other countries have. When you get to the viability standard, we share that standard with the People's Republic of China and North Korea."" 
JULIE RIKELMAN, ATTORNEY FOR JACKSON WOMEN'S HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
""Mississippi's ban on abortion two months before viability is flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent. Mississippi asks the court to dismantle this precedent and allow states to force women to remain pregnant and give birth against their will.""
JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER 
""The problem with a super case like this - the rare case, the watershed case, where people are really opposed on both sides and they really fight each other - is they're going to be ready to say, no, you're just political, you're just politicians. And that's what kills us as an American institution.""
JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN
""There's been 50 years of water under the bridge, 50 years of decisions saying that this is part of our law, that this is part of the fabric of women's existence in this country, and that that places us in an entirely different situation than if you had come in 50 years ago and made the same arguments.""
JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO
Regarding an 1897 Supreme Court ruling allowing racial segregation: ""Would it not be sufficient to say that was an egregiously wrong decision on the day it was handed down and now it should be overruled?""
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
""When you have those two interests at stake and both are important, as you acknowledge ... why should this court be the arbiter rather than Congress, the state legislatures, state supreme courts, the people being able to resolve this? And there will be different answers in Mississippi and New York, different answers in Alabama than California because they're two different interests at stake and the people in those states might value those interests somewhat differently."" 

JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT
Regarding ""safe haven"" laws in states that let women hand over unwanted babies to healthcare facilities without penalty: ""Both Roe and Casey emphasize the burdens of parenting. And insofar as you ... focus on the ways in which forced parenting, forced motherhood, would hinder women's access to the workplace and to equal opportunities, it's also focused on the consequences of parenting and the obligations of motherhood that flow from pregnancy. Why don't the safe haven laws take care of that problem?""

(Reuters) -Democratic politician Stacey Abrams is bullish that the U.S. Congress will pass two key bills to protect voting rights https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/back-future-voting-rights-2021-06-15 - even though her party has already failed to advance voting rights legislation four times this year.
Last month, the Senate voted 50-49 in favor of starting debate on the ""the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-return-voting-rights-with-eye-filibuster-2021-11-03"" but fell short of the 60 votes needed under a procedural blocking maneuver known as a filibuster. 
The party has also repeatedly failed to advance the Freedom to Vote Act in a 50-50 Senate.
Speaking in an interview at the  Reuters Next conference https://reutersevents.com/events/next released Wednesday, Abrams was optimistic about the legislation getting through. 
""I remain very bullish on the possibility of us getting these bills passed,"" she said. ""But that means we have to keep talking about it. And we have to keep amplifying the real effects of these laws.""
This year, Republican lawmakers across the country have passed a series of local laws that have made it harder for people to vote, particularly marginalized communities.
For Abrams, these groups are an inconvenience to the Republican party because of how they voted.
""The rub is that these are inconvenient voters who demonstrated in 2020, that not only would they vote at the top of the ticket, but they changed elections and changed outcomes throughout the country at the federal, state, and local level,"" Abrams said. 
The voting rights activist condemned anyone who tried to limit the voices of marginalized people, no matter what party they support.
""Any party that uses manipulation of the system, as their predicate should be disowned,"" she said. ""We should not allow that.""
According to Abrams, it is not a matter of who people vote for. It is about making sure all who are eligible to vote to get the opportunity to do so, she said.

""If you are a Republican or an Independent or Democrat who doesn't believe that every eligible American should get to vote, then you do not agree with the fundamental premise of our democracy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Georgia man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to attacking a police officer during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot by supporters of then President Donald Trump trying to overturn his election defeat.
Kevin Creek, 46, of Alpharetta, pleaded guilty to a felony charge that he engaged in physical contact with a police officer during the riot. 
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Creek the charge carried a maximum prison term of 8 years and fine of $250,000, but that federal guidelines suggested a prison sentence ranging from 24 to 30 months. 
The judge scheduled a sentencing hearing for March 10. 
According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation report, videos show Creek attacking ""multiple"" police officers during the riot. 
The FBI said that during a subsequent visit to a Georgia hospital, Creek talked about being ""tear gassed"" at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
During an FBI interview in May, Creek was shown videos of a rioter attacking police and ""admitted the videos looked like him,"" while claiming he ""did not remember assaulting any officer."" He confirmed that during the riot he was armed with mace and a knife.
Also on Wednesday, prosecutors announced that they filed Jan. 6 riot charges against a Pennsylvania man who allegedly attacked police with a flagpole.
Prosecutors allege that Howard Richardson, 71, of King of Prussia, charged at a D.C. police officer outside the Capitol with a metal flagpole and ""only stopped swinging after the flagpole broke in his hands."" Richardson faces three riot-related felony charges. 
More than 120 defendants have pleaded guilty to Jan. 6 charges, though fewer than 20 have pleaded guilty to felonies.

Four felony pleas related to assaults on police, according to the Justice Department. At least 65 defendants face charges of using a dangerous weapon or causing injury to police. The department said around 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot. 
A Capitol Police officer attacked by protesters died the following day. Four D.C. police officers who guarded the Capitol later committed suicide. Four rioters also died, including one who was shot by police as she tried to climb through a shattered window inside the building.

598,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The risk of a brief U.S. government shutdown over the weekend rose Wednesday with congressional Republicans and Democrats split over a short-term spending bill needed to keep agencies running and some GOP lawmakers threatening a holdup to protest vaccine mandates.
Majority Democrats are looking to extend current agency funding into January or later given the impasse with Senate Republicans on full-year fiscal 2022 spending bills. While party leaders expressed confidence that the differences would get resolved in time, they have yet to schedule any action on a stopgap bill.
Democrats said they have not gotten a proposal from Republicans on how long the stopgap should last and there are growing concerns that a faction of conservatives will attempt to trigger a shutdown to block funding for President Joe Biden’s initiative requiring large private employers to either mandate vaccinations against Covid-19 or provide weekly testing. 
“We need to point out where the logjam is and right now the logjam is in the U.S. Senate,” Representative Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said. He called any attempt to defund the government over vaccine mandates is “nonsensical.”
“I can’t imagine we would walk back the safety precautions,” he said. 
House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro said she is working to resolve the impasse through bipartisan talks and expressed hope it would get done. 
“Negotiations are underway. There is no interest in shutting the government down. We are not shutting the government down,” he said. She acknowledged that time is running short, however. 
“Nobody knows that better than I do,” DeLauro said.
Senate Roadblock
Meeting the end-of-week deadline will require cooperation from all Senate Republicans. Although there is likely enough support from GOP senators to pass a stopgap, any one senator can demand extra procedural steps in the Senate that can drag on for nearly a week.
That could come from an effort by a group of GOP senators to link support for the stopgap measure to halting funding for the Biden administration’s workplace rule on vaccinations and testing.
Kansas Senator Roger Marshall led a Nov. 3 letter signed by 10 other Senate Republicans pledging to oppose all efforts to implement the vaccine mandate, including by objecting to government funding bills. Marshall’s office pointed to that release when asked Wednesday about whether the senator would hold up the funding bill. 
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that he was confident a break in government funding could be avoided. 
“We won’t shut down,” McConnell said. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he and McConnell were “having good conversations” about the stopgap but warned that the group of conservatives may hold things up. 
“I hope that a small group of Republicans don’t choose obstruction and try to shut down the government,” Schumer said. “It’s always easy to say you want to shut down the government over something I care about, this one cares about, that one. If everyone did that we’d have chaos. We need to come together and keep the government open.”
Unity Test
Some House Republicans, led by the Freedom Caucus, also support the effort to shut down the government to prevent enforcement of the federal vaccine or test requirement for private employers. The group argues the policy infringes on individual liberties. 
“We therefore write to request that you use all procedural tools at your disposal to deny timely passage of the CR unless it prohibits funding – in all respects – for the vaccine mandates and enforcement thereof,” the Freedom Caucus wrote to McConnell on Wednesday. 
For some House conservatives, it’s a test to see if the conference can unite in opposition to Biden.
“You’re not going to be able to stop them from doing everything,” Ohio Republican Representative Warren Davidson said. “They have the majority. But can you pick an issue and unite Republicans and make a difference, even from the minority?”
The Freedom Caucus group wouldn’t be able to delay action in the House and other Republicans aren’t inclined to oppose a stopgap funding measure.
“Probably because they think, somehow, creating chaos -- which they are masters of -- will hurt president Biden,” New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic caucus chair, said. “It’s not going to work. We’re prepared to act.”
If the stopgap doesn’t turn out to have any objectionable policy provisions, Representative Mark Amodei, a Nevada Republican who is a member of the Appropriations Committee, said the GOP conference should support it.
Previous shutdowns have proven unsuccessful, Amodei said.
“The threat of shutting down, in my experience, has never worked to get the side that shut it down what it wanted,” Amodei said. “We shut it down over health care for a long time and when we opened it up, nothing had changed.”
A new stopgap measure is necessary because Congress has failed to pass any of the 12 annual appropriations bills needed to fund ordinary government operations for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Democrats and Republicans have yet to begin serious talks to resolve their differences on the bills, with Republicans demanding Democrats reject an array of policy provisions such as government funding for abortions before talks on funding levels begin. 
The stopgap measure puts agencies on autopilot, freezing in place program funding levels and forbidding new contracts, with few exceptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Wednesday the U.S. Department of Justice ""will vigorously defend"" the government's authority to promote its vaccine requirement in federal contracting after courts blocked the Biden administration from enforcing two vaccine mandates.
A U.S. District Judge in Louisiana on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) from enforcing its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. 
A U.S. District Judge in Kentucky blocked the administration from enforcing a regulation that new government contracts must include clauses requiring that contractors' employees get vaccinated. 
The legal setbacks, spurred by Republican state attorneys general, conservative groups and trade organizations that have sued to stop the regulations, added to a string of court losses for the Biden administration over its COVID-19 policies.
They also come amid concerns that the Omicron coronavirus variant could trigger a new wave of infections and curtail travel and economic activity around the world.
The administration's most sweeping regulation - a workplace vaccine-or-testing mandate for businesses with at least 100 employees - was temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court in early November.
""We know vaccine requirements work...We are confident in the government's authority to promote economy and efficiency in federal contracting through its vaccine requirement and the Department of Justice will vigorously defend it in court,"" a White House spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the Biden administration said a total of 92% of U.S. federal workers have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

President Joe Biden unveiled regulations in September to increase the U.S. adult vaccination rate beyond the current 71% as a way of fighting the pandemic, which has killed more than 750,000 Americans and has weighed on the economy.
Earlier this week, the White House told federal agencies they could delay punishing thousands of federal workers who failed to comply with a Nov. 22 COVID-19 vaccination deadline.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -CNN on Tuesday suspended its top news anchor, Chris Cuomo, for his role in defending his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, over sexual harassment allegations.
The cable news channel said in a statement the suspension followed the release of new court documents on Monday.
""These documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother’s efforts than we previously knew. As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation,” CNN said.
Andrew Cuomo was forced to step down https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-governor-cuomo-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-findings-2021-08-10 as governor in August after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Cuomo, who hosts CNN's most-watched prime time news show, had admitted in May he breached some of the network's rules in advising his brother how to handle the allegations from a public relations perspective. He also pledged not to report on the case on air.
CNN said on Tuesday that at the time it ""appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second"", but said the new documents ""raise serious questions.""

Greene was attacking Mace over a recent CNN interview in which her fellow congresswoman likened Boebert's remarks about Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar to other ""racist tropes and remarks that I find disgusting,"" which she said have come from both sides of the aisle. 
Mace quickly shot back at Greene on Tuesday in a tweet describing herself as an anti-abortion conservative and adding: ""What I'm not is a religious bigot (or racist). You might want to try that over there in your little 'league.'""
Greene, Mace and Boebert are all in their first two-year term.The exchange came a day after a failed effort https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republican-boebert-doubles-down-feud-with-democrat-omar-2021-11-29 to end the feud between Boebert and Omar, a Muslim who was born in Somalia. Boebert - like Greene an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump - had referred to Omar as a member of a ""jihad squad"" and said it was safe to ride with her in a Capitol elevator if she was not wearing a backpack. 
Greene and Mace have clashed before. But their new rift could complicate matters for House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, as he seeks political unity to reclaim the majority in the House in the 2022 congressional midterm elections. 
McCarthy is under pressure from Democrats to discipline Boebert, barely two weeks after the House censured https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republican-who-tweeted-violent-ocasio-cortez-video-face-house-sanction-vote-2021-11-17 Republican Representative Paul Gosar over an anime video depicting him killing progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a pair of swords at Democratic President Joe Biden. 
""We're considering what action ought to be taken,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, told reporters. Hoyer suggested the Republican caucus sanction Boebert on its own to ""cleanse itself"" of such ""toxic"" behavior.
McCarthy's office was not immediately available for comment.
Threatening rhetoric and political division have plagued House Republicans since Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an effort to stop the certification of Biden's 2020 election victory.
Republican Representative Liz Cheney was ousted from a party leadership https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liz-cheney-vote-us-house-republicans-reach-watershed-over-trump-2021-05-12 position after voting to impeach Trump and criticizing his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. 

Greene called for the party to expel Cheney and Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger after they joined the committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot.
Thirteen House Republicans were also criticized for supporting a $1 trillion infrastructure bill opposed by Trump and House party leaders. Some of those lawmakers later reported receiving death threats.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz on Tuesday said he would mount a Republican bid for a U.S. Senate seat for Pennsylvania, shaking up what could be one of the most competitive races in next year's congressional elections.
Oz, who hosts the syndicated ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" brings substantial name recognition to a wide-open Nov. 8, 2022, contest that could determine control of the Senate and the fate of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
Biden narrowly won Pennsylvania in the 2020 election but Republicans made gains in the state legislature. Many observers expect next year's race to be a toss-up following the retirement of Republican Senator Pat Toomey. 
Toomey was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict former President Donald Trump in January following Trump's impeachment.
Oz rose to fame shocking audiences with show-and-tell displays of decaying lungs and rotting livers, telling viewers they should take care of themselves. 
His public image took a blow in 2014, however, when he told https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-senate-oz-idINKBN0ES2RN20140617 lawmakers probing bogus diet product ads that some of the products promoted on his show lacked ""scientific muster."" Senators at the hearing focused on green coffee bean extract, a dietary supplement Oz touted in 2012 as a ""miracle.""
In a statement on Tuesday, Oz said he was running as a ""conservative Republican"" and described himself as a top-notch surgeon and health care advocate.
He enters the race days after another Republican candidate, military veteran Sean Parnell, who had received Trump's endorsement, ended his own campaign. Parnell dropped out following a court ruling that outlined allegations of domestic abuse against his estranged wife, which Parnell has denied.
The Republican field also includes real estate developer Jeff Bartos.

Democrats hold slim majorities in the U.S. Congress ahead of next November's elections. The Senate is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes for Biden's party.
Democrats have yet to pick a candidate for the Pennsylvania Senate race, with Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, a progressive, and U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, a moderate, seen as front-runners for the party nomination.

(Reuters) -The Biden administration was blocked on Tuesday from enforcing two mandates requiring millions of American workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19, a key part of its strategy for controlling the spread of the coronavirus.
U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in Monroe, Louisiana, temporarily blocked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) from enforcing its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers until the court can resolve legal challenges. 
Doughty's ruling applied nationwide, except in 10 states where the CMS was already prevented from enforcing the rule due to a prior order from a federal judge in St. Louis.
Doughty said the CMS lacked the authority to issue a vaccine mandate that would require more than 2 million unvaccinated healthcare workers to get a coronavirus shot.
""There is no question that mandating a vaccine to 10.3 million healthcare workers is something that should be done by Congress, not a government agency,"" wrote Doughty.
Separately, U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove in Frankfort, Kentucky, blocked the administration from enforcing a regulation that new government contracts must include clauses requiring that contractors' employees get vaccinated.
The contractor ruling applied in the three states that had filed the lawsuit, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee, one of at least 13 legal challenges nationwide against the regulation. It appears to be the first ruling against the contractor vaccine mandate.
The White House declined to comment.
The legal setbacks for President Joe Biden's vaccine policy come as concerns that the Omicron coronavirus variant could trigger a new wave of infections and curtail travel and economic activity across the globe.
Biden unveiled regulations in September to increase the U.S. adult vaccination rate beyond the current 71% as a way of fighting the pandemic, which has killed more than 750,000 Americans and weighed on the economy.
Republican state attorneys general, conservative groups and trade organizations have sued to stop the regulations. 
Tuesday's rulings add to a string of court losses for the Biden administration over its COVID-19 policies.

The most sweeping regulation, a workplace vaccine-or-testing mandate for businesses with at least 100 employees, was temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court in early November.
In August, the U.S. Supreme Court ended the administration's pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The House of Representatives committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot said on Tuesday that Mark Meadows, who served as former President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff, has provided it with records and agreed to appear soon for a deposition.
""Mr. Meadows has been engaging with the Select Committee through his attorney. He has produced records to the committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition,"" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House select committee, said in a statement.
Thompson did not rule out future action against Meadows. Noting that the panel expects all witnesses to provide all the information requested that it is lawfully entitled to receive, Thompson said: ""The committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition.""
Meadows had been called to appear before the committee earlier this month, but did not do so.
Trump has urged his associates not to cooperate with the committee, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
On Jan. 6, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Shortly before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""
Trump issued a statement on Tuesday after news broke of Meadows' agreement denouncing the committee and repeating his unfounded assertions that the election was rigged.
'AN UNDERSTANDING' 
Meadows' lawyer George Terwilliger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Terwilliger said in a statement to CNN, which first reported Meadows' agreement, that the two parties had reached an understanding on how information can be exchanged moving forward. Terwilliger stated that Meadows and the committee are open to engaging on a certain set of topics as they work out how to deal with information that could fall under executive privilege.
Meadows was a Republican House member until joining Trump's administration in 2020.
Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon already has been criminally charged with contempt of Congress, pleading not guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-trump-adviser-bannon-enters-plea-not-guilty-obstructing-jan-6-2021-11-17, after defying a select committee subpoena. The committee is meeting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-panel-probing-capitol-riot-moves-toward-contempt-charge-against-clark-2021-11-29 on Wednesday to consider seeking similar charges against Jeffrey Clark, who served as a senior Justice Department official under Trump.
Agreeing to appear for a deposition does not guarantee that Meadows will provide all the information requested in the committee's subpoena. Clark appeared, but committee members said he did not cooperate with investigators.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters he expects the Democratic-led chamber to vote on Clark's contempt recommendation this week, if the panel approves it as expected.
Separately on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit signaled skepticism https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trump-ask-court-keep-records-away-us-capitol-riot-panel-2021-11-30 during a three-hour hearing toward Trump's bid to prevent records on his actions before and during the riot from being turned over to the committee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top Democrat and the top Republican in the U.S. Senate voiced confidence on Tuesday that they would pass legislation raising the federal government's $28.9 trillion debt limit soon, averting a catastrophic default.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he expects to pass the increase ""soon,"" after a ""good conversation"" with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
""The Senate must take action to make sure the United States does not default on its sovereign debt for the first time in its history,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday.
""I recently had a good conversation with the Republican leader about this issue and expect to continue those talks... I look forward to achieving a bipartisan solution to addressing the debt limit soon.""
McConnell also appeared to be optimistic, declaring to reporters later in the day that the federal government would not default on its debt. He described his talks with Schumer as ""useful"" and added that he was also confident Congress would avoid a partial government shutdown this week.
""Certainly, nobody needs to be concerned about a government shutdown,"" McConnell told a news conference. 
Neither said when they expected a vote on the debt limit to be held on the Senate floor.

But Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, noted that Schumer and McConnell discussed the debt limit and other pending issues last week. ""It is a rare moment when you say Chuck and Mitch met and they talked about something,"" he said. ""I hope it's positive.""
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday said that without a prompt increase in the Treasury Department's borrowing authority, it could run out of cash before the end of December if it transfers, as planned, $118 billion to the Highway Trust Fund on Dec. 15.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. appeals court judges on Tuesday signaled skepticism toward former President Donald Trump's bid to keep records about his conversations and actions before and during the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot by a mob of his supporters away from congressional investigators.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard a three-hour oral argument in Trump's appeal of a judge's decision that the records should be turned over to a House of Representatives committee.
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why Trump should be able to challenge and overrule President Joe Biden's determination that the records should be handed over.
""Is there a circumstance where the former president ever gets to make this sort of call?"" asked Jackson, seen as a possible future Supreme Court nominee for Biden.
Trump lawyer Justin Clark argued that a 1978 law called the Presidential Records Act gives Trump that power.
""I don't see that in the statute,"" Jackson responded.
The House select committee investigating the riot has asked the National Archives, the U.S. agency housing Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. The panel has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence.
Judge Patricia Millett also asked why a former president's determination should overrule one by the current president. 
""We only have one president at a time under our Constitution,"" Millett said.
The three judges pressed Clark and another Trump lawyer, Jesse Binnall, over whether courts even have jurisdiction to hear the Republican former president's claims.
""All three branches of government have acknowledged there is a right of former presidents to challenge the designation and release of presidential records,"" Binnall responded.
Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to try to prevent the release. In court filings, Trump's lawyers called the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated, and argued that the requested documents are protected by executive privilege https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-trump-use-executive-privilege-block-jan-6-attack-probe-2021-09-09, a legal doctrine that lets presidents keep private some of their conversations with advisers.
During Tuesday's hearing, Judge Robert Wilkins said Trump is not entitled to the type of document-by-document review he has requested before any records are released.
""It seems to me that your argument is inconsistent with our precedent,"" Wilkins told Clark.
Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 presidential election loss to Biden. Shortly before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Nov. 9 rejected https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-denies-trump-bid-block-jan-6-select-committee-investigation-2021-11-09 Trump's arguments, saying he had not acknowledged the ""deference owed"" to Biden's determination that the committee could access the records and adding: ""Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.""
Trump's lawyers told the hearing they would consider appealing an unfavorable ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They asked that any ruling against them not go into effect immediately so they could seek further review.

The D.C. Circuit put off allowing the committee to access the records while the three judges consider the matter. Jackson, Millett and Wilkins all were appointed by either Biden or former President Barack Obama, both Democrats.
Trump has urged his associates to stonewall the committee. His former chief strategist Steve Bannon already has been charged with contempt of Congress for defying the panel, pleading not guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-trump-adviser-bannon-enters-plea-not-guilty-obstructing-jan-6-2021-11-17.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden intends to nominate a former Obama official who oversaw the acquisition of the F-35 fighter, the troubled KC-46 tanker and the B-21 stealth bomber to be the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, the White House said on Tuesday.
Bill LaPlante, current head of Charles Stark Draper Laboratories Inc., is the Biden administration's pick to be the next Undersecretary of Acquisition and Sustainment at the Department of Defense. 
His nomination process will be closely watched by defense contractors given the vital role the official will have in drawing up the Pentagon's massive annual purchasing budget, the lifeblood of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co,  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD).If confirmed, LaPlante would rejoin a team of former Barack Obama administration alumni, including current Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as well as Andrew Hunter, Biden's nominee for assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics.
Kendall and LaPlante worked together overseeing acquisition for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet, the Boeing (NYSE:BA) KC-46 refueling tanker and the B-21 Raider, a heavy bomber under development for the U.S. Air Force by Northrop Grumman during the Obama administration.
The Pentagon has been without a Senate-confirmed weapons-buyer since January. The Biden administration has struggled to have a candidate for the high-powered position after its first nominee withdrew from consideration this summer. 

Without a leader, professional staff have been forced to act as caretakers for nearly 11 months, delaying big decisions on weapons programs.
If confirmed, LaPlante, who holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the Catholic University of America, would return to the Pentagon's E-Ring corridor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate blocked the National Defense Authorization Act on Monday amid objections from Republicans and some liberal Democrats, although lawmakers will keep working on the massive annual defense policy bill, which has become law for 60 straight years.
The vote was 45-51, meaning the measure could not get the 60 ""yes"" votes needed to advance toward passage in the 100-member Senate.
The NDAA, which normally passes with strong bipartisan support, is closely watched by a broad swath of industry and other interests as it determines everything from how many ships are bought to pay increases for soldiers and how to address geopolitical threats.
This year's legislation authorizes some $770 billion in Pentagon spending, which is one reason some Democrats objected, saying the military budget should not be so large when the country is not adequately addressing issues such as healthcare, education and climate change.
Lawmakers take pride in the NDAA's having become law every year since 1961, saying it reflects their support for the military. Because it is one of the only major bills to become law annually, it is used as a vehicle for legislation on issues from competition with China to cyber policy.
Republicans said they voted no because Democrats, who thinly control the Senate, did not allow enough votes on amendments, including one that would have imposed mandatory sanctions over Nord Stream 2, a Russian-backed natural gas pipeline that opponents believe would be harmful to U.S. allies in Europe.

Senator Jim Inhofe, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the measure would eventually pass. ""I'm still very supportive of this bill and hope we will pass it soon,"" Inhofe said.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the vote ""inexplicable and outrageous"" and accused Republicans of voting against the troops. ""Just because a few Republicans didn't get every single concession they insisted on they are halting the process,"" he said.

Watkins confirmed that Chansley had asked him to withdraw from the case.

614,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Congress returns from its week-long Thanksgiving recess facing urgent deadlines to avoid both a federal government shutdown and a debt limit default, pass the annual defense bill and finalize President Joe Biden’s signature tax and spending bill. 
Missteps on the funding bills or debt ceiling would have profound consequences for the country and party in power, while failure to agree on a final form of the $2 trillion House-passed Build Back Better bill could cement voter perceptions that Democrats are too preoccupied with infighting to legislate. 
The Senate will be the major focus of activity on the stacked December to-do list, given the need for Republican cooperation on the regular funding bills and unanimous Democratic caucus agreement to pass the separate economic agenda bill using a special budget process to avert a GOP filibuster. 
The House’s priority will be the Dec. 3 deadline to avoid a shutdown while also attempting to raise the debt ceiling around Dec. 15. House Democrats are considering proposing a fresh stopgap spending measure that would keep the federal government funded through mid-to-late January, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Here are the items on Congress’s jam-packed December calendar:
Spending Stopgap
The House will need to take up some kind of stopgap spending bill this week to avoid a partial government shutdown after midnight Friday, Dec. 3. None of the 12 annual appropriations bills funding federal agencies for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 have been enacted. 
Some lawmakers have talked about a stopgap bill lasting to Dec. 17 to pressure all sides to negotiate full-year spending bills, while others worry that a longer one into February or March should be enacted. The person familiar with the matter said Monday that a measure running through mid-to-late January was emerging as the likeliest scenario. 
House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro told reporters that Democrats are willing to strike a deal with Republicans on funding levels and urged them to make a counteroffer to Democratic proposals. Senate Democrats last month proposed a 13% increase to domestic social programs and a 5% increase for defense. 
Republicans want equal increases for defense and non-defense, but have so far demanded that Democrats drop a slew of policy provisions known as riders before talks begin. Democrats have proposed ending a ban on federal funding for abortions and rescinding several limits of workplace regulations.
DeLauro said that Democrats will not give those riders up as a pre-requisite to starting talks. 
Debt Ceiling
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned Congress the U.S. is at risk of failing to meet all of its payment obligations sometime after Dec. 15. 
Democrats in Congress haven’t settled on a plan to raise the debt ceiling, although using the same fast-track budget reconciliation process they are using to enact Biden’s economic agenda appears more and more likely. Republicans have resisted voting to allow Treasury to pay its bills.  
Some Senate Republicans helped pass a $480 billion increase in October to give Democrats more time to use the budget reconciliation process but Minority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed not to do so again.
If Democrats use the budget process, they would need to amend the 2022 budget resolution and then pass a limit increase either as a standalone bill or as part of the $2 trillion tax and spending bill. Republicans have indicated they could forgo some of the procedural delays involved in amending the budget to expedite the process. 
Any debt limit increase would likely last into December 2022, after the midterm election but before a possible Republican takeover of Congress which could allow the GOP to demand budget cuts or other concessions from Biden for a new increase. 
Build Back Better
The House this month passed its version of Biden’s tax and spending bill. The Senate plans to take up and pass its version before the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday. 
Moderate Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the key players. Manchin has objections to the overall price tag, spending in early years paired with offsets in later years, as well as the bill’s four weeks of paid family leave and Medicare hearing coverage. Sinema has kept her specific objections largely private. 
The White House has said the two would agree to about $1.75 trillion in spending, a cut from the House-passed bill which likely totals more than $2.2 trillion. 
Wrangling over the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, will be one of the most contentious issues for Democrats as they re-shape portions of the House’s version of the Build Back Better Act. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is taking a lead on SALT, says the House’s approach to allow taxpayers to write off up to $80,000 regardless of income would give too many tax benefits to millionaires. Instead, he and Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey want to limit full SALT deductibility to those earning less than $400,000, and phasing out the tax break so that the highest earners can only qualify for the $10,000 deduction currently in the tax code. Senator Michael Bennet has opposed any lifting of the SALT cap. 
Senators could also revise the corporate minimum tax, which would require large companies to pay at least 15% of their financial statement profits in taxes even if they have credits or deductions that could cut their IRS bills. Some proponents for renewable energy projects say the minimum tax could decrease the value of those credits for companies.
There is no hard deadline for completing the BBB bill, so it could slip into January. 
Defense Bill
Congress has passed a defense authorization bill for 60 consecutive years, though last year it hit a snag when the House and Senate voted to override then-President Donald Trump’s veto of the bill on Jan. 1, two days before the new Congress started. 
This week, the Senate will vote to cut off debate on the latest annual measure, likely setting up final passage in early December. There are impasses over several provisions, including blocking funds to the Taliban and removing a requirement for women to sign up for the military draft. And if the National Defense Authorization Act doesn’t make it over the finish line, troop pay raises could be added to a continuing resolution or passed on its own. DeLauro has said that until there’s agreement on full-year appropriations, she will not back a pay increase in a CR.
China Bill
Schumer announced just before the break his signature counter-China legislation -- the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act -- would ride to victory on the defense bill. In an abrupt about-face a few days later, Schumer said that he would seek to negotiate with the House an agreement on a stand-alone China bill. 
There’s still a few items to be ironed out there, however, as the House doesn’t have its own comprehensive bill. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Gregory Meeks says he wants to tackle climate change -- China is one of the world’s leading emitters of greenhouse gases -- and Republicans are concerned the bill isn’t tough enough on Beijing. 
If there’s no agreement on the broader package, some lawmakers want the $52 billion in the bill to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing passed separately. But doing so could risk fracturing the bipartisan coalition that wrote the broader bill.

615,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense for withholding parts of a memoir about the time he spent in the administration of Donald Trump.
The book, ""A Sacred Oath"", sheds light on events that occurred during the second half of Trump's presidency, Esper said.
The Department ""arbitrarily"" redacted the manuscript after he submitted it to DoD officials for review, he said in a statement. 
""Significant text is being improperly withheld from publication ...under the guise of classification. The withheld text is crucial to telling important stories discussed in the manuscript,"" Esper's lawsuit, filed in a federal court, said. 
Esper served as Trump's defense secretary from June 2019 to November 2020, when he was fired over a range of differences on policy issues.

They included Esper's public opposition to Trump's threats to use active duty military forces to suppress street protests over racial injustice after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The DoD did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment sent during overnight hours.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. infectious disease official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told President Joe Biden on Sunday it will take about two weeks to have definitive information on the new coronavirus variant Omicron that has sparked new travel restrictions and shaken financial markets. 
Biden, returning to Washington following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, was briefed in person by his coronavirus response team on Sunday afternoon as officials expect the new variant to reach the United States despite an impending ban on travelers from Southern Africa, where it was first detected.
Fauci said he believes existing vaccines are likely to provide ""a degree of protection against severe cases of COVID"", and officials reiterated their recommendation for vaccinated Americans to get booster shots, according to a readout of the briefing.
Biden was due to update the public on the new variant and the U.S. response on Monday, the White House said. 
Omicron, which was first detected in Southern Africa, has now been confirmed in Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Britain, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, and the United States' neighbor to the north, Canada.
Earlier on Sunday, Fauci told ABC News' ""This Week"" that the new variant would ""inevitably"" reach the United States.
""It clearly is giving indication that it has the capability of transmitting rapidly. That's the thing that's causing us now to be concerned,"" he added on NBC. 
U.S. officials were seeking more information from South Africa about the new variant. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra spoke to South Africa Health Minister Joe Phaahla on Sunday, praising the country's transparency, according to a readout of the meeting. 
Its appearance in the United States, where 30% of the population has not received a single dose of vaccine https://tmsnrt.rs/3FSkZ03, could threaten to undermine the nation's recovery nearly two years after COVID-19's emergence and further pressure local healthcare systems already taxed by the recent Delta variant.
Rising cases as colder weather forces more people indoors has also caused some hospital systems and U.S. states, including New York, to declare emergencies.
So far, nearly 782,000 people have died in the United States from COVID-19 since early 2020, the most of any country in the world, amid over 48 million infections, Reuters data show. 
TRAVELERS BANNED, NOT FLIGHTS 
The United States is joining other nations in seeking to block transmission by imposing travel restrictions. 
Beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Monday, it will bar entry of nearly all foreign nationals who have been in any of eight southern African countries within the last 14 days and has warned Americans against traveling to those nations.
U.S. citizens and lawful U.S. permanent residents who have traveled to the countries will still be able to enter the United States and no new screening or tracing requirements have been introduced.
Flights by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines have continued https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/delta-united-not-revising-south-africa-flights-amid-variant-concerns-2021-11-26 from South Africa to the United States since the variant was discovered. 
Fauci and other top officials said the sudden burst of cases made Omicron worrisome and it remained unclear how current vaccines or therapeutics could be impacted. 
""We need more data there before we can say confidently that this is not a severe version of the virus, but we should find that out in the next couple weeks,"" outgoing National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told ""Fox News Sunday.""
Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have said they expect more information soon. 
""We have to go through a couple of weeks yet of uncertainty,"" Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Burton told CNN, saying Omicron's transmissibility and severity were also still unknown along with current vaccines' effectiveness against it. 
'CLARION CALL' FOR SHOTS
Fauci pressed Americans to continue to get COVID-19 vaccines and boosters while experts evaluate Omicron.
""This is a clarion call ... (to) get vaccinated,"" he told NBC.
The United States has recorded over 1.1 million new COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days, up 9% from the prior two weeks, Reuters data shows, with Michigan and Minnesota leading the nation in new cases, based on infections per 100,000 residents.
The proportion of COVID-19 tests coming back positive in New York state had doubled since last month to 4.23%, underscoring the need for vaccinations, Governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement. 

""Cases are rising throughout New York State, and the new Omicron variant poses a very real threat to the progress we've made,"" Hochul said.
The variant could cast a pall over the rest of the U.S. holiday season and potentially impact companies' return-to-office plans.

""I think we will probably make a decision this week on our course of conduct with that particular witness and maybe others,"" Schiff said on CNN, referring to Meadows.
""I can't get into what communications that we're having or haven't had with particular witnesses but we are moving with alacrity with anyone who obstructs the committee,"" said Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Jan. 6 panel. ""And that was certainly the case with Mr. Bannon, and it will certainly be the case with Mr. Meadows and Mr. (former Justice Department official Jeffrey) Clark or any others.""
Former U.S. President Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon was indicted by a federal grand jury earlier this month, the first to be criminally charged for defying a subpoena issued by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.
Bannon is one of more than 30 people close to the former Republican president who have been ordered by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee to testify about what happened in the run-up to Jan. 6, when thousands of people stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn Trump's election defeat.

House investigators hope the action against Bannon will motivate other witnesses, such as Meadows, to testify. 
Bannon has refused, citing Trump's insistence - already rejected by one judge - that he has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the United States would continue to push for World Trade Organization members to agree on an intellectual property framework for COVID-19 vaccines after a major WTO ministerial meeting set for next week was postponed on Friday. 
The delay of the in-person meeting in Geneva https://www.reuters.com/business/wto-postpones-major-meeting-over-covid-19-concerns-sources-2021-11-26 over travel restrictions and concerns about the spread of the new Omicron COVID-19 variant complicates Tai's plans to push her vision for WTO reform and rekindling the spirit of dynamism and compromise that led to the trade body's creation in 1995.
In a pair of tweets https://twitter.com/ambassadortai/status/1464400123681820675?s=21, Tai said the postponement ""is a reminder that we still have much work to do to end the pandemic.""
""The United States will continue working with @WTO members to achieve a multifaceted outcome on trade and health, including an international IP framework, that supports the global pandemic response and puts the WTO in a stronger position to meet the needs of regular people,"" Tai said.
The WTO's director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said she wanted negotiations to continue despite no in-person travel, while Geneva-based country delegations should be empowered to reach deals, especially on vaccines.
""This new variant reminds us once again of the urgency of the work we are charged with,"" she said in a statement. 
No matter the venue, Tai's main problem in reforming the WTO is getting past entrenched positions and competing national interests - including those of the United States - that have kept the organization from evolving over the past quarter of a century, trade experts say.
Tai recently told reporters that the WTO, which was established to regulate and facilitate international trade, cannot return to its status quo https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-wto/u-s-trade-chief-tai-says-wto-needs-infusion-of-energy-vision-idUSKBN2HV2UX and needs new vision and energy to stay relevant in a rapidly changing global economy.
""My vision for WTO reform is that WTO members come to Geneva or wherever it is that they might convene and bring their honest selves,"" Tai said. Members should ""be prepared to fight for the vision of the WTO that"" they want.
The latest round of WTO ministerial-level talks was set to take place against the backdrop of a global trading system scarred by the coronavirus pandemic and the tumult of the trade wars launched by former U.S. President Donald Trump during his four years in office.
Trump, who was skeptical about free trade and multilateral agreements, had threatened to withdraw from the organization https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-wto/wto-chief-says-no-panic-over-trump-withdrawal-threat-idUSKCN1LG27C. The WTO's dispute settlement system was paralyzed two years ago by U.S. opposition to Appellate Body judge appointments, with Washington arguing that the body had overstepped its mandate.
Tai has repeatedly voiced the Biden administration's commitment https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-committed-wto-wants-it-succeed-trade-rep-tai-says-2021-10-14 to the WTO and has sought to engage with U.S. allies on reforms for the organization.
""She's saying all the right things. She's underscoring the importance of a well-functioning WTO,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former USTR negotiator and current director of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington. ""The question is whether the U.S. is playing the leadership role to help broker these deals, as it has done in the past, and perhaps that's not as evident as it used to be.""
ELUSIVE CONSENSUS
Pressure from India https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-push-patent-waiver-covid-19-vaccines-wto-2021-11-26, other developing countries and activist groups has been building for an IP waiver that would allow more widespread manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines in developing countries, with some WTO members said to be threatening to block progress https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/non-profit-groups-tell-wto-reverse-vaccine-apartheid-before-any-meeting-2021-11-24 on other issues without a waiver. 
Tai in May announced U.S. support for the waiver, and President Joe Biden repeated the call on Friday in response to news about the new variant discovered in South Africa. 
Negotiations over the waiver had deadlocked https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/year-after-covid-vaccine-waiver-proposal-wto-talks-are-deadlocked-2021-10-04 amid opposition from Switzerland, Britain and some other European countries.
In the fishery subsidies negotiations, Tai is pushing a U.S. proposal to ban subsidies for fishing fleets that use forced labor, including an explicit recognition that it is a problem. The demand has drawn opposition from India and other developing nations.
Jamieson Greer, who was USTR chief of staff during the Trump administration, said he doesn't see Tai backing down from that demand given the Biden administration's focus on workers' rights, so his expectations are low.

""We're looking at the WTO ministerial that doesn't have many, if any, consensus documents or outcomes,"" said Greer, who is now a trade lawyer with King & Spalding in Washington. He added that these may be replaced by plurilateral statements, which would not necessarily be considered a failure.
""I think it probably will underscore that the WTO cannot solve a lot of these intractable problems.""

""I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep. Omar. I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly. There are plenty of policy differences to focus on without this unnecessary distraction,"" Boebert said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Her apology came after a video surfaced on Twitter of her speaking at an event in her home state of Colorado where she said she was getting into an elevator at the Capitol when she saw a Capitol police officer running toward her.
""I see fret all over his face, and he’s reaching, and the door’s shutting, like I can’t open it, like what’s happening. I look to my left, and there she is. Ilhan Omar. And I said, ‘Well, she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine,'"" she said.
She said it was ""not my first 'jihad squad' moment.""
Boebert is part of a group of Republican House lawmakers who say they are staunch supporters of Trump, and who frequently attack their own Congress colleagues with slurs and insults. She is in her first term in office.
Omar said on Twitter the event described by Boebert in the video never happened, and that ""Anti-Muslim bigotry isn’t funny & shouldn’t be normalized.""
""Saying I am a suicide bomber is no laughing matter,"" Omar tweeted. She called on House Republican leader Kevin McCarty and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take ""appropriate action.""

In a statement, Pelosi and other senior Democratic leaders of the House said Boebert's ""repeated, ongoing and targeted Islamophobic comments and actions against another member of Congress, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, are both deeply offensive and concerning.""
""Leader McCarthy and the entire House Republican leadership's repeated failure to condemn inflammatory and bigoted rhetoric from members of their conference is outrageous,"" they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's move to release oil from strategic reserves in coordination with top oil consuming nations including China represents a unique bet that finding common ground with the United States' biggest economic rival can help lower fuel prices for Americans.
The rare moment of possible cooperation comes as inflation, and especially high gasoline prices https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gasoline-guzzling-us-high-pump-prices-can-be-political-poison-2021-11-22, eat at Biden's popularity at home. In China, high energy prices have led to power rationing, hurting industry and sparking concern about winter heating supplies.
It is a risky proposition. Biden is trying to craft a more constructive relationship on climate change and trade out of complex ties between two nations with opposing political systems that are locked in an economic arms race. The two countries have just emerged from a trade war in 2020.
""This is a new era of oil diplomacy for the U.S. to coordinate with India and China"" said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and the vice chairman of IHS Markit. Cooperation with China is likely to stick to energy and environment. 
""Climate and energy are in a separate category from all the tough issues that need to be dealt with between the two countries,"" Yergin said.
China has yet to detail when and what it would release from its strategic reserves, a day after the U.S. announced the coordinated release. Oil markets have anticipated action from China, where officials have said they are working on a release to meet China's domestic demand.
The risk for Biden was clear on Wednesday, when Chinese state media declared https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-has-upper-hand-us-asks-beijing-release-oil-reserves-global-times-2021-11-24 Beijing had the ""upper hand"" in the oil reserve plan. Japan and India, in contrast, were quick to detail their plans after the U.S. announcement.
The Biden administration's diplomatic inroads with China first surfaced in Glasgow, Scotland this month where the two countries hammered out a surprise deal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-un-usa-china-idAFKBN2HV2GG on boosting action on climate change including reducing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
""Glasgow showed that there is some level of common interest and diplomacy that can be successful between the United States and China,"" said Amy Myers Jaffee, a research professor at Tufts University and expert on global energy markets and climate. 
Jaffee said both countries recognized the importance of a global climate agreement. ""I would say 'Ditto' on the oil market,"" Jaffee said. 
Washington has stark differences with Beijing on trade issues and human rights concerns related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan. Beijing has backtracked from agreements with the United States before, including an extensive trade deal with the Trump administration that was nixed https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html at the last minute. 
But the world's top two economies would benefit from energy cooperation given their need to keep fuel and power costs down for consumers and industry.
China has already released oil from reserves this year. Beijing held the first ever release of oil from its reserve in September, which aimed to stabilize prices and deal with localized supply shortages.
Combined, the United States and China consume nearly 35 million barrels of oil a day, more than a third of global demand. Even though the United States has become one of the world's largest oil producers, it is still the second-largest importer of crude, trailing only China. 
As the top oil importers, their roles in international politics coincide to some degree and place them in an adversarial relationship with the leaders of OPEC and its allies: Saudi Arabia and Russia. 
The world's top oil-importing nations https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OI/lbpgnbezdvq/chart.png 
China now imports more than 10 million barrels of oil a day, The United States imports about 6 million barrels per day, though in recent years it has sharply reduced its dependency on OPEC producers, with most of its imports now from Canada.
The broader group of countries that are working with the United States to release oil from their reserves - India, Japan and South Korea - rank third, fourth and fifth among global oil importers, respectively. 
U.S. oil prices hit a seven-year high in late October driving inflation and hitting Biden's approval rating ahead of midterm elections next year. With razor thin majorities in both chambers of Congress, Biden's fellow Democrats can ill afford to lose seats in 2022. 
U.S. gas prices at seven-year high U.S. gas prices at seven-year high https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-GASOLINE/PRICES/znvnekmrbpl/chart.png 
REPEAT DEAL TRICKY 
Biden could take additional action in coordinating with other countries to maintain supply as the COVID-19 pandemic eases, the White House in a statement Tuesday. 
Actually doing so may not be easy. 
""Not only could U.S.-China tensions complicate further cooperation, but the U.S. stands apart from other strategic reserve holders in that its legislature has ordered the
selling off of strategic stockpiles"" to finance government programs, ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan research group, said in a note to clients. 
Some 18 million barrels of the U.S. release was simply a front-loading of required sales that were mandated by Congress in recent years. 
There's a risk that consumer countries and producing countries could keep upping the ante with opposing announcements on global oil supplies, a prospect that would likely make oil prices even more volatile, or what Yergin calls a ""bloc versus bloc,"" scenario.

But in the short term, the action by consuming countries is likely to put pressure on oil prices, Yergin said.
""This also comes at a time when the supply/demand balance is on a course to improve over the next few months, and this oil deal will add to that. What it means at least for now is you’ll hear a lot fewer predictions about $100 oil.""

FTC Commissioners Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson asked the administration to share the evidence ""so that we might consider how to proceed.""
Last week, Biden told FTC Chair Lina Khan there was ""mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies"" and he urged the commission to ""further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets.""
“I do not accept hard-working Americans paying more for gas because of anti-competitive or otherwise potentially illegal conduct,” Biden said in a letter to Khan.
The White House said in a statement that the price at the pump normally moves with the price of wholesale gasoline. 
""But recently there has been a split where the price of refined gas is going down but prices at the pump are going up. The split is now nearly 30 cents larger than its historical average,"" a White House official said.
The two Republican commissioners said they shared the concern of all Americans about current gasoline prices, but noted the FTC had been asked to probe gasoline prices during previous administrations and found no evidence of collusion or other illegal behavior.
""The FTC has a long history of studying the oil and gas industries,"" they wrote. ""For example, our agency's work has highlighted the fact that prices at the pump may not correlate immediately with the price of crude.""
Crude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago. 
The United States said on Tuesday it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices after OPEC+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
Biden said the move would help lower gasoline prices.

""I told you before that we're going to take action on these problems. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Biden said in remarks broadcast from the White House. 
""It will take time, but before long you should see the price of gas drop where you fill up your tank,"" he said.

Warren said she was concerned about ""the extent to which these price increases are being driven by energy companies’ corporate greed and profiteering.""
She called on the companies to detail, for the past 10 years, their natural gas exports, percentage of total natural gas production exported, average profit margin for exported natural gas, average profit margin for domestic sales of natural gas, and the amount invested in clean, renewable energy. Warren asked for replies by Dec. 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and his wife Jill will travel to Nantucket, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, on Tuesday to spend Thanksgiving with their family, resuming a decades-long tradition that was interrupted last year due to the pandemic.
Biden has celebrated Thanksgiving on Nantucket nearly every year since 1975. The island, about 30 miles (48 km) south by ferry from Cape Cod, has long been a favored vacation spot of the wealthy, though more during the summer months than Thanksgiving.
Biden broke with family tradition in 2015, after the death of his son Beau from brain cancer and in 2020 after his election as president because of the pandemic when he followed public health guidance to avoid travel and large gatherings.
The President spoke about reuniting with family this Thanksgiving in remarks earlier this month while encouraging people to take their COVID-19 vaccines.
""Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us - my wife and I, our daughter and her - and my son-in-law.  Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines."" 
On Monday, the president and the first lady helped serve Thanksgiving meals to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, thanking them for their service and dedication to country.
Biden chose to visit U.S. forces within the United States rather than go abroad, unlike his predecessors, since he has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan and is set to end the U.S. combat mission in Iraq by year's end.
Former presidents including Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush all traveled to visit troops in either Iraq or Afghanistan during the holiday season.
Continuing a Thanksgiving tradition that dates back decades, last week Biden pardoned two giant white turkeys from Indiana - Peanut Butter and Jelly - in the White House Rose Garden.

Americans are gearing up to celebrate the annual holiday amid rising food and gas prices as the pandemic snarls global supply chains and the economic drag from the summer wave of COVID-19 infections fades.
The American Farm Bureau Federation said last week the annual Thanksgiving dinner will cost U.S. consumers an average of 14% more this year in the biggest annual increase in 31 years, though shoppers can still find deals in grocery stores.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol said on Monday it issued subpoenas to Alex Jones, founder of the right-wing website Infowars, and Roger Stone, an ally of former President Donald Trump.
The committee also issued subpoenas seeking documents and testimony from Dustin Stockton, a political activist linked to longtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and Stockton's fiancee, Jennifer Lawrence.
Stockton and Lawrence were members of the group We Build the Wall, which was raided by federal agents in August 2020 as part of a fraud investigation.
It also issued a subpoena to Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Trump.
The panel has now issued more than three dozen subpoenas and received testimony from more than 200 witnesses.
Stone said in a statement he had not yet seen the subpoena, adding: ""I had no advance knowledge of the events that took place at the Capitol on that day.""
The four others who were issued the latest subpoenas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bannon, who defied a subpoena from the House Select Committee, was indicted earlier this month on two counts of contempt of Congress.

A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events. Bannon is the first to face criminal charges arising from the panel's inquiry.

The decision came after Parnell lost a battle over the custody of his three children amid allegations of physical and verbal abuse of his estranged wife, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Parnell, an Army veteran, was attempting to win the seat held by conservative Republican Senator Pat Toomey, who is retiring after next year.
The Pennsylvania Senate race is seen as one of the most competitive races in the November 2022 congressional elections and could help determine whether Republicans succeed in their drive to win majority control of the chamber.
According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, a judge granted Parnell's wife primary custody of their children following allegations of past physical abuse and uncontrolled anger.

FORT BRAGG, N.C. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, on Monday helped serve Thanksgiving meals to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, thanking them for their service and dedication to country.
Biden told the service members he knew how much their loved ones missed them, especially during holiday celebrations, reflecting on his son Beau's service in the U.S. Army in Iraq and Kosovo before his death of cancer in 2015.
""I know how hard it is to have someone who's not at the table,"" Biden told the hundreds of troops before donning an apron with a presidential seal and doling out stuffing. ""You do so much and your families give so much.""
Biden said he was ""damn proud"" to serve as commander in chief of what he called the finest military ""the world has ever seen.""
It was Biden's first visit to Fort Bragg since becoming president in January. He was joined at the event by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.
The first lady also invoked Beau Biden's memory, telling the troops, ""We're so grateful for everything that you do. And Joe and I feel like, you know, you're family to us. And we cannot thank you enough.""
Before leaving the base, Biden met with special operations forces who often serve as the ""tip of the spear"" in U.S. military operations, the White House said. 
Biden joins many of his predecessors in spending some time with the troops during the holiday season.
Since he has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan and is set to end the U.S. combat mission in Iraq by year's end, Biden chose to visit U.S. forces within the United States rather than go abroad.
Former presidents including Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush all traveled to visit troops in either Iraq or Afghanistan during the holiday season.
Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan prompted a chaotic withdrawal that has been heavily criticized.

Many troops who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan have been stationed at Fort Bragg.
Biden on Tuesday will travel to Nantucket, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, to spend Thanksgiving with his family, resuming a decades-long tradition that was interrupted last year due to the pandemic. He spent the holiday at his Delaware home with family instead.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States does not need to impose a lockdown or shut down its economy to curb the spread of COVID-19 and will rely on other tools, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Monday.
""We are not headed in that direction. We have the tools to accelerate the path out of this pandemic; widely available vaccinations, booster shots, kid shots, therapeutics,"" Zients told reporters at a White House briefing.
""We can curb the spread of the virus without having to in any way shut down our economy.""
U.S. regulators expanded eligibility for booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to all adults on Friday, and 3 million people received them since, Zients said.
""In fact, just across Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we got 3 million booster shots into arms. A million booster shots per day,"" he said. ""Don't delay, get your booster shot so you can have enhanced protection for COVID as we head into the winter."" 
Separately, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said U.S. health officials are not currently recommending lockdowns or economic restrictions to curb rising COVID-19 cases.
Europe is once again the epicenter of the global pandemic with Austria reimposing full lockdown, riots breaking out in cities across the Netherlands over a partial lockdown, and many other countries imposing restrictions.
The current seven-day average of COVID-19 cases in the United States rose 18% from last week's average to 92,800 per day, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said at the briefing. 

U.S. hospitalizations rose 6% to an average of 5,600 per day and average daily deaths are about 1,000 per day, she said. Around 47 million eligible American adults and over 12 million teenagers are still not fully vaccinated, Walensky added.
As of Sunday, COVID-19 had killed 776,188 people in the United States, according to a Reuters tally.

""This onslaught of threats against election workers is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about the ability to recruit and retain election workers needed to administer future elections,"" the Rules Committee's Democratic chairwoman, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and top Republican, Senator Roy Blunt, said in a letter to the U.S. agency overseeing election administration.
The senators asked the agency to provide state and local election officials with information on how to use federal election funds to improve security. They also asked it to provide guidance on other resources available ""for identifying and responding to potential threats.""
The letter follows a series of Reuters stories documenting a campaign of fear waged against frontline election administrators inspired by former President Donald Trump's relentless false claims that the 2020 vote was ""rigged"" against him. Reuters has documented nearly 800 intimidating messages to election officials in 12 states, including more than 100 that could warrant prosecution, according to legal experts.
""Reuters' ongoing reporting on this issue has helped expose the extent and nature of threats against election workers and officials,"" a Rules Committee staffer said.
The independent, bipartisan agency was created under a law passed by Congress in 2002 to help states modernize elections after problems during the 2000 presidential vote. The agency distributes federal funds to help states run elections, provides guidance on federal election law and certifies voting machines.
""We must ensure that election workers are able to do their jobs free from threats, intimidation or other improper influence,"" the committee leaders said in the letter.

The senators said the committee has heard from state and local election officials seeking guidance on how to use federal funds to help with costs such as hiring security after being targeted by threats or employing firms to investigate threats on social media and share that information with law enforcement.
An agency spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden intends to run for re-election in 2024, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday.
Biden, 79, has suffered a dip in his job approval ratings in recent months, leading some Democrats to wonder whether he might not seek another four-year term.
""He is. That's his intention,"" Psaki said as Biden flew aboard Air Force One for a Thanksgiving event with U.S. troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
Democrats were rattled by Republican victories in Virginia's state elections earlier this month and a narrow Democratic victory in New Jersey. 
Questions have arisen about the viability of Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 should Biden decide not to run again. A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found her with a 28% job approval rating.

Biden underwent his first physical examination on Friday since taking office in January and doctors found he has a stiffened gait and attributed frequent bouts of coughing to acid reflux. Doctors said he was fit to serve.
Biden's political prospects appeared to have been buoyed last week by congressional passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Still being debated is another $2 trillion in spending on a social safety net package.

By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal on murder charges on Friday opened yet another front in America's longstanding fight over gun rights: Is it acceptable for a teenager to bring an assault-style rifle to a protest?
Conservatives hailed Rittenhouse as a hero for exercising his right to self-defense when he fatally shot two demonstrators and wounded a third who he said attacked him last year at a racial justice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Gun control advocates warned the jury's verdict could inspire a new wave of armed vigilantism, after Rittenhouse traveled in August 2020 from his Illinois home to Kenosha after demonstrations erupted following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.
Guns have long been a potent political issue in the United States, where permissive laws have led to the highest rate of civilian firearm ownership in the world. Mass shootings, which are far more rare in other wealthy nations, have plagued the country for decades.
Rittenhouse's decision, at age 17, to roam the streets of Kenosha toting a weapon in the name of protecting private property from rioters struck a particular nerve about just how far gun rights should extend.
""As the tragic events on that night in August showed, a 17-year-old arming himself with an AR-15 makes no one safer,"" top officials at Giffords, the gun safety group, said in a statement. ""Today's verdict sends a troubling message that will encourage further vigilante violence and murder.""
Gun rights organizations and Rittenhouse supporters celebrated the outcome as a major victory.
Within minutes of the verdict, the National Rifle Association posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) the language of the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""
Brandon Lesco, who was standing outside the Kenosha courthouse holding a ""Free Kyle!"" sign, said the verdict was just.
""Someone needs to be there to defend the American towns that people try to burn. I respect that he was there, I respect he carried a weapon, he used it properly, he used it legally. The jurors agree,"" said Lesco.
The trial judge earlier this week had dismissed a misdemeanor charge against Rittenhouse for illegally possessing the rifle he used in the shootings, citing vagueness in the law.
'UNACCEPTABLE MESSAGE'
Liberals denounced Rittenhouse's acquittal as further evidence of a racially biased criminal justice system. Rittenhouse, like the men he shot, is white.
""That a white male youth can travel across state lines, armed with an assault rifle, and engage in armed confrontation resulting in multiple deaths without facing criminal accountability, is the all too familiar outcome in a country where systemic racism continues to rot the system,"" Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement.
Some legal experts were careful to draw a distinction between the specific facts of Rittenhouse's case and the broader message it might send.
Prosecutors had a high bar to clear to convince jurors that Rittenhouse did not reasonably fear for his life at the time he fired, according to Janine Geske, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice. Under state law, he was legally permitted to carry his weapon openly.
But Geske said she worried the trial will teach the wrong lesson: ""When you're out protesting or counter-protesting, it is perfectly fine to bring loaded weapons to 'protect yourself.' We're going to have substantial issues of who's defending themselves, when you've got two people with a gun?""

That sentiment was echoed by Karen Bloom and John Huber, the parents of Anthony Huber, one of the men killed by Rittenhouse.
""It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,"" they said in a statement.

633,"<span>Nov 20, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a key centrist who is often a holdout on major elements of President Joe Biden's agenda, reiterated she does not support modifying or eliminating the filibuster to ease the passage of voting rights legislation, she said in an interview with the Washington Post.
Sinema, who is a co-sponsor of Democratic voting rights bills aimed at prohibiting racial discrimination and ensuring ballot access, told the newspaper that she continues to oppose efforts by fellow Democrats to eliminate the filibuster, a Senate rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority to pass most legislation.
“My opinion is that legislation that is crafted together, in a bipartisan way, is the legislation that’s most likely to pass and stand the test of time. And I would certainly encourage my colleagues to use that effort to move forward,” she told the Post.
She also brushed off the possibility of supporting an exception to the filibuster to enable passage of voting rights legislation, saying she was not sure it is a viable option.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had hinted at a change in Senate rules earlier this month to circumvent the filibuster, at least for some legislation.
""That caveat — ‘if it would even work’ — is the right question to ask,” Sinema, who rarely gives interviews, told the Post.
Senate Democrats earlier this month failed to advance voting rights legislation for the fourth time this year due to overwhelming Republican opposition, raising potential ramifications for the 2022 congressional and 2024 presidential elections.
The Senate voted 50-49 in favor of starting debate on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act but fell short of the 60 votes needed. 
Named for the late civil rights activist and congressman, the legislation would restore state voting requirements to prohibit racial discrimination that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 2013.

Democrats have made election reform a priority in light of Republican state balloting restrictions passed in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election.

(Reuters) - Under the laws of self-defense in Wisconsin, prosecutors in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse faced a tricky legal challenge: proving a negative.
Rittenhouse's testimony that he acted in self defense when he killed two men and wounded another during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year required the state to convince a jury that the then-17-year-old did not have a reasonable belief his life was in danger, legal experts said.
""It's one thing to affirmatively prove an element. It's another to prove the nonexistence of something, which is what the prosecutors had to show,"" said former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske, now a law professor.
A jury acquitted Rittenhouse on Friday of five charges, including two counts of homicide, in a case that renewed debate about firearms in the United States and the scope of self-defense law in court. 
Wisconsin is among at least 15 states that put a burden on prosecutors to disprove a defendant’s self-defense claim, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. Also, there is no ""stand your ground"" law in Wisconsin. Under such laws, a person does not have to exhaust all other options before resorting to deadly force in self-defense.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger argued at trial that Rittenhouse was an aggressor in the Aug. 25, 2020 confrontation and created an ""active shooter"" scenario that resulted in the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28.
The defense argued that Rittenhouse, who was lawfully carrying an AR-15 style rifle, had been repeatedly attacked after bringing it to Kenosha to protect private property and had shot the men in fear for his life.
Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer Daniel Adams, who closely followed the trial, called the verdict ""very dramatic but not entirely surprising."" 
""In each of the three shootings, the victims were postured in a very adversarial position to Rittenhouse,"" Adams said. ""These weren't people just walking down the street. These were not people just protesting. They were actively engaging in an adversarial way with Rittenhouse.""
Rittenhouse's risky decision to take the stand in his own defense made it even tougher for prosecutors to disprove his self defense claim, the lawyers said.
Rittenhouse told the prosecution during cross examination: ""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me.""
Some legal observers said the prosecution was also hampered by its own mistakes. 
Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer Benjamin Van Severen said prosecutors could have focused their questioning of witnesses, particularly of Grosskreutz, to elicit more favorable testimony. Grosskreutz testified that Rittenhouse did not fire until after he was pointing his own gun at Rittenhouse. 
Paul Applebaum, a criminal defense lawyer practicing in Minnesota, said the jury also was likely sympathetic to self-defense arguments.
""I think the climate in the country is much more self-defense friendly"" than even 10 years ago, Applebaum said, citing a rising public perception of crime and self-disorder. ""There's a lot more appetite for people claiming that they were in fear of their lives and they used guns to resolve the situation."" 

The Rittenhouse trial was the highest-profile U.S. civilian self-defense case since a man named George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida in 2013.
Geske, the former justice, praised the jury's extensive deliberation over more than three days but said she was concerned the verdict will send a broader message that ""when you're out protesting or counter-protesting it is perfectly fine to bring loaded weapons to 'protect yourself.'""

""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's physician wrote in his summary.
O'Connor said the colonoscopy found a polyp that appeared to be benign and was easily removed.
""Histologic evaluation is anticipated to be completed early next week,"" the physician said. ""The president has never had colon cancer.""
O’Connor highlighted two areas that he said deserved investigation — specifically Biden’s recent “throat clearing” and what he described as a stiffened gait.
O’Connor wrote that Biden is experiencing “throat clearing” with “increasing frequency and severity” and said that he attributed it to a digestive disorder known as gastroesophageal reflux, or GERD. 
O'Connor noted Biden’s broken foot he suffered roughly a year ago could contribute to the awkward walk, but he more broadly said Biden was dealing with spinal arthritis and “peripheral neuropathy,” or some loss of sensation in the feet.
“The President’s gait appears to be perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it has been in the past. He does specifically acknowledge early morning stiffness that improves throughout the day,” the doctor said.
The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70.
The president takes five medications, O’Connor wrote, including Crestor to address high cholesterol; Dymista nasal spray for allergies; Allegra for allergies; Eliquis as a blood thinner; and Pepcid to treat GERD.
The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, ahead of the presidential campaign, when the same doctor described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""

Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, had not released a full report on his health since.
Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-transfer-power-harris-during-colonoscopy-friday-white-house-2021-11-19 to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.

The jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, found Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges after more than three days of deliberations, in a decision that ignited fierce debate about gun rights and the boundaries of self defense in the United States.
Amid a heavy law enforcement presence, several dozen protesters lined the steps outside the courthouse after the verdict was read, some carrying placards in support of Rittenhouse and others expressing disappointment.
Biden said in a statement he had spoken with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers to offer support and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.
""While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,"" Biden said.
""I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law. Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy,"" he said.

Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and fired a bullet that tore a chunk off the arm of another man during protests in August 2020 in Kenosha after the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion social-policy bill offers hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize child care and expand pre-kindergarten, but millions of kids could be frozen out if Republican governors decline to use the money.
The ""Build Back Better"" package making its way through Congress provides $390 billion for nationwide pre-kindergarten and subsidized child care, but requires states to pay up to 40% of the cost. Costs could rise further if Congress fails to extend the two programs when they would expire in 2028.
That could be a deal-breaker for conservative states reluctant to spend money on safety-net programs -- even though some of the biggest per-capita benefits would go to poor, Republican-led states including Mississippi and West Virginia. 
""We're talking about completely overhauling and disrupting the entire system of childcare and pre-K for a plan that's on a knife's edge,"" said Matt Bruenig, of the left-leaning People's Policy Project, who is pushing for a larger federal role. 
It would not be the first time that Republican-led states balk at a federal program on concerns over cost and government overreach. Many did so when they rejected billions of dollars in federal aid over the past decade to expand the Medicaid health plan for the poor under President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act. 
""The Biden administration wants to insert itself into the most intimate family decisions and tell parents how to care for their toddlers,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said this month.
Republicans oppose the Build Back Better bill, and Democrats in Congress are trying to pass it on a straight party vote.
The Biden plan's initial rollout gives more childcare subsidies to states with lower incomes and higher rates of child poverty -- a formula that benefits Republican-leaning states, according to a Reuters analysis of funding estimates by the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates for low-income Americans. https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/zjvqkwmmrvx
States with lower incomes and higher rates of child poverty would get more money per capita in the first three years of the program to overhaul childcare networks and expand access to subsidized childcare. States that voted for Donald Trump in 2020 would get about $4,600 for every child under 6, while states that voted for Biden would get about $3,600, according to the Reuters analysis.
Mississippi and West Virginia, both of which backed Trump, would get the highest per-capita amount. New Mexico would get the highest amount among states that backed Biden.
PRIOR REJECTION
At least one state recently walked away from federal dollars over ideological concerns.
Idaho's Republican-led state legislature earlier this year rejected $6 million in federal aid for early childhood education. Conservative lawmakers said they were worried the money would advance liberal teachings on race relations and encourage mothers to work outside the home. 
Some backers of Biden's child-care proposals say it could be difficult to get state buy-in.
""It will be a huge struggle,"" said Beth Oppenheimer, executive director of the Idaho Association for the Education of Young Children. 
The measure provides a Plan B if states decline to participate, as local governments could work directly with the federal government to set up programs.
The plan, which the Democrat-led House of Representatives approved on Friday in a first step in seeking approval from both the House and the Senate, aims to create universal free schooling nationwide for children age 3 and 4 and subsidize child care for most families with children under age 6. 
States would receive federal funding to get programs running but would have to start covering some of the cost within a few years: 10% for the child-care subsidies starting in 2024, and up to 40% for pre-K. 
An earlier version of the legislation would have kept federal subsidies in place for longer, but was scaled back to satisfy centrist lawmakers who said the bill's original $3.5 trillion price tag was too high.
States that already have robust pre-K programs, such as Vermont and Florida, would find it easier to participate than those like Idaho and South Dakota, which would have to create programs, said Angela Rachidi, a senior fellow in poverty studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

""States have different budgets and funding priorities,"" said Rachidi, who opposes the Biden plan. 
Advocates point out that many Republican-led states already have pre-K programs in place, while others like Alabama and Arkansas have used federal coronavirus aid to expand their early-childhood programs.

In 1947, President Harry Truman was the first recipient of a bird gifted by America's turkey farmers, a tradition that continued. In 1963, President John Kennedy decided to send his gift back to the farm where it came from.
George H.W. Bush was the first president to officially offer a turkey pardon at the White House in 1989. Barack Obama's pardons featured jokes that often had his daughters rolling their eyes at his side.

""Her office must recuse as she is campaigning for governor,"" said Rita Galvin, a lawyer for Cuomo, calling attention to James' campaign announcement a day after the Albany County Sheriff's Office charged Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex offense.
""Her judgment in those months was absolutely compromised by her political motivations,"" Galvin said, referring to the weeks before James' office issued a report that found Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women. 
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing. He said in August he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous, but said he would resign for the good of the state.[nL1N2PH1JI]
James' office says it is standing by the sexual misconduct report and the women who came forward with allegations against the former governor.
In a statement, the office characterized Cuomo's tactics as ""school yard bullying"" and a way for the former governor to keep his name in the spotlight.
""Today’s embarrassing press conference was simply dramatics and faux outrage,"" the statement said. ""If Andrew Cuomo didn’t want to be accused of sexual harassment, he shouldn’t have sexually harassed multiple women in the first place.”
James, 63, announced on Oct. 29 that she would challenge fellow Democrat Kathy Hochul, the former lieutenant governor, who replaced Cuomo when he stepped down on Aug. 24 after more than 10 years in office. The gubernatorial election is to be held next November.
James said the five-month independent investigation concluded that Cuomo had engaged in conduct that violated multiple federal and state laws.
Galvin called the report's contents into question, saying that James had personal motivations to redact certain parts of transcripts and evidence.
The redactions had motivations to cause less damage to some and more damage to others, she said. Galvin also requested that tens of thousands of documents used in the investigation be released.

A criminal complaint charging Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex offense was filed on Oct. 29 in a court in Albany, the state capital. 
Galvin also called for James to recuse herself from any investigation that is looking into whether Cuomo and his administration misused state resources to write and promote a book he published last October about his leadership during the early months of the pandemic.

643,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell met Thursday to discuss the need to boost the nation’s debt ceiling sometime around mid-December.
The meeting comes two days after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen indicated to lawmakers that they risked a U.S. government default if they failed to lift the legal debt ceiling by Dec. 15, telling them that “there are scenarios in which Treasury would be left with insufficient remaining resources to continue to finance the operations of the U.S. government beyond this date.”
“We had a good discussion about several different issues that are extent here as we move toward the end of the session, and we agreed to keep talking to try to get somewhere,” McConnell said as he left Schumer’s office.
The meeting suggests that Schumer and McConnell are seeking a smoother path to addressing the debt ceiling following a clash last month that had started to rattle financial markets. Congress ultimately approved a short-term debt limit hike.
Republicans have demanded that Democrats use the tedious budget reconciliation process to raise the debt limit without GOP votes, while Schumer continues to insist that any boost in the nation’s limit on borrowing authority be bipartisan. Schumer reiterated that on Tuesday. McConnell, when asked about his position, simply said he’s sure the ceiling will be increased.
“We’ll figure out how to avoid default,” McConnell said. “We always do.”
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said Democrats are taking the same position they took last time: The Republicans should give their consent to let a debt limit increase pass with just a simple majority without any filibuster, allowing Democrats in the 50-50 Senate to then clear it quickly on their own.
“As of today, it’s still do the right thing or get out of my way,” Van Hollen said.
‘Good-Faith Efforts’
The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, said on Thursday that the two leaders already have had some informal talks about the next debt-limit hike, and sounded optimistic about their prospects.
“We’ll see how this thing ends up getting landed, but I think there are good-faith efforts being made to try and create a process where Democrats can deliver the votes to raise the debt limit and Republicans have the opportunity to vote against it,” Thune said.
Yet several senior GOP lawmakers on Thursday indicated Republicans aren’t ready to budge from their insistence on Democrats using the reconciliation process.
“We cannot default,” Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio said on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power.” “The Democrats control the White House, the House and effectively the Senate,” so “they have the ability to do it on their own,” he said of a debt-ceiling increase. “They should, and they know that.”
October Clash
Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, pointed to an earlier proposal he had in October that would expedite the reconciliation process so that an increase could happen on a more rapid timetable, limiting the time taken away from other Senate work.
“My proposal is that Democrats can pass the debt limit all by themselves and that’s what they should do,” Toomey said. “What they don’t want to do is use the tool that’s readily available to them, because it requires them to disclose the massive amount of debt that they want to inflict upon the American people.”
When the Senate voted to raise the debt ceiling in October, it was marked by brinkmanship that ended when McConnell offered a proposal that had Republicans clear the way for Democrats to extend the ceiling until a Dec. 3 projected deadline. McConnell then faced sharp criticism from fellow Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former President Donald Trump, who argued that the minority leader had capitulated to Democrats.
McConnell produced enough Republican votes to help ensure that the measure moved to final passage -- but only after a struggle that transpired even after the debt limit bill was under debate on the Senate floor on Oct. 7. After the vote, he sent a terse letter to President Joe Biden warning that “I will not provide such assistance again if your all-Democrat government drifts into another avoidable crisis.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican lawmakers who were stripped of their committee assignments over threats against Democrats can expect to be reinstated, if their party wins control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next year's elections, the chamber's top Republican said on Thursday. 
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Representatives Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who were punished by the current Democratic majority, would have the right to serve on committees with Republicans in charge.
""They may have other committee assignments. They may have better committee assignments,"" McCarthy told reporters a day after the House censured Gosar for posting an anime video that depicted him killing Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a pair of swords at President Joe Biden.
Greene, a first-term lawmaker, was stripped of her committee assignments in February over incendiary remarks that included support for violence against Democrats. 
Gosar lost seats on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, while Greene was removed from the Budget Committee and the Education and Labor Committee. 
The Gosar and Greene cases underscore the growing intensity of threatening rhetoric in Congress, 10 months after thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to certify his election defeat. 

McCarthy has refused to discipline either Gosar or Greene, both staunch Trump allies. But on Wednesday he said Republicans might prevent certain Democrats from serving on committees if they win control of the chamber.
In 2019, House Republicans removed Republican Representative Steve King from his committees after he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive in an interview. He was defeated by another Republican in a primary election in 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives censured one of its members for the first time in over a decade on Wednesday, rebuking a Republican over an anime video that depicted him killing progressive Democrat Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and swinging two swords at President Joe Biden. 
After the 223-207 largely party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled House, Representative Paul Gosar was called to the stand in the well of the chamber to hear his censure and to be stripped of two committee assignments. The move drew just two votes of support from Republicans, who largely portrayed the Democrats' action as partisan politics.
Gosar posted an anime video https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-gosar/u-s-democrats-move-to-censure-republican-gosar-for-violent-video-idUSKBN2HX1UV this month that showed him killing Ocasio-Cortez. He rejects accusations it was threatening and after initially deleting the video from his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, Gosar retweeted it on Wednesday evening following the censure. 
It was the latest instance of escalating violent rhetoric in Congress, 10 months after thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers prepared to certify his election defeat.
""What is so hard about saying this is wrong?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked in debate before the vote. ""Will we live up to the promises that we make our children, that this is a place where we will defend one another regardless of belief, that our core human dignity matters?""
Gosar, a staunch Trump ally and hardline conservative, said:
""There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country,"" he said, adding he did not advocate violence toward anyone.
The 62-year-old Arizona Republican has described the Trump followers who assaulted the Capitol as ""peaceful patriots,"" voted against certifying Biden's 2020 election victory in January and backed Trump's false claims of a stolen election.
Democrats said the censure was necessary because House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has refused to discipline Gosar. A censure is a symbolic reprimand that carries no fines or other penalties.
House Republican leaders recommended but did not require their members vote no on the motion.
SUPPORT FROM TWO REPUBLICANS
The resolution drew support from two Republicans who oppose Trump: Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who both sit on a House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
""It's really important for us to be very clear that violence has no place in our political discourse,"" Cheney told reporters after the vote. ""I don't think this should be an issue about party, about partisan politics.""
During debate, Democrats said no other workplace in the United States would permit one employee to post threatening videos of another.
McCarthy repeatedly described Democrats' actions as ""rules for thee but not for me"" in arguing against the motion on the House floor.
""The speaker is burning down the House on her way out the door,"" he said of Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
Threats of violence are becoming more frequent in the U.S. political arena.
Some of the 13 House Republicans who voted to pass Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill have reported receiving death threats over their votes, and dozens of state-level election workers have reported receiving threats https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats from Trump supporters angered by his baseless allegations that his November 2020 defeat was the result of fraud.

House Democrats stripped firebrand Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-republicans/u-s-house-punishes-republican-congresswoman-over-incendiary-remarks-idUSKBN2A42IF of her committee assignments this year for incendiary remarks that included support for violence against Democrats.
The last time a U.S. House member was censured was 2010, when the action was taken against then-Democratic Representative Charles Rangel after he was found guilty of several ethics violations, including improper fundraising and inaccurate financial disclosure reports and federal tax returns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he defied a congressional subpoena from a U.S. House panel investigating the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to court documents.
Bannon, who made his initial appearance in federal court on Monday, was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress. 
Bannon has vowed to fight the congressional subpoena, telling reporters outside the courthouse on Monday that he believes the prosecution is a politically motivated attack against him by President Joe Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
He was due to be arraigned in court on Thursday, but agreed to waive his right to a formal reading of the indictment, according to court documents filed on Wednesday. 
He is still expected to take part on Thursday in a virtual status conference hearing on the case before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols.
The U.S. House of Representatives, led by the Democrats, voted on Oct. 21 to hold Bannon in contempt, leaving it up to the Justice Department, headed by Garland, to decide on any charges.
A Republican, Trump has sought to stonewall the House committee and directed his associates not to cooperate, claiming that a former president has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.
Bannon, a prominent figure in right-wing media circles, was an architect of Trump's 2016 presidential victory and served as White House chief strategist in 2017.
He faces one contempt count for refusing to appear for a deposition before the House Select Committee and a second for refusing to produce documents. 

Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison along with a fine of up to $100,000.
In a fiery speech before the riot, Trump told followers to ""fight like hell."" Four people died in the riot. A Capitol Police officer attacked by protesters died a day later and four officers later took their own lives. About 140 officers were injured.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will likely decide on who he will nominate to head the U.S. Federal Reserve before Thanksgiving, a White House spokesperson said on Wednesday, a day after Biden said he would come to a decision in about four days.
""The president continues to engage with his senior economic team,"" Deputy White House Press Secretary Chris Meagher told reporters aboard Air Force One. 
The president has been weighing whether to keep current Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a second term or promote Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the post, a Biden administration official said last week.

Whoever he selects - Powell, a Republican elevated to the role by then-President Donald Trump, or Brainard, a Democrat and Ph.d. economist on the Fed board since 2014 - the next Fed chief will face tough decisions on how to handle supply bottlenecks, whether to raise interest rates and how to address inflation.
Asked about his timeline for a decision on Tuesday, Biden told reporters: ""As my grandfather would say, with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, you're gonna hear that in about four days.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's plan to attach a measure to boost U.S. competitiveness with China to a massive defense policy bill faces new hurdles in Congress.
The Senate in June passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which includes $52 billion to dramatically increase U.S. semiconductor chip production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research. But the bill never received a vote in the House of Representatives, and supporters have been working for months to find a way to pass it and get it signed into law.
Schumer said Tuesday he hopes to include USICA as part of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that will be put on the Senate floor Wednesday.
""The chip shortage is not some abstract issue – it’s impacting the daily lives of Americans,"" Schumer said. ""Cars, refrigerators and other household appliances require chips. Supply shortages means Americans are left waiting a long times for these essentials.""
But Senator Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, on Tuesday criticized the chips proposal, calling it ""corporate welfare, with no strings attached, for a handful of extremely profitable microchip companies.""
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday he thinks the House should pass its own version of USICA first ""and then we can have a conference with the Senate.""
Senator Mark Kelly, also a Democrat, noted the United States relies largely on imported semiconductors. ""This plan has sat idle,"" Kelly said. ""There is no more time to waste on this.""
In the evenly divided Senate, every Democratic vote is critical.

Once the Senate approves its version of NDAA, Senate and House negotiators will work on a compromise.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters in an interview last week that the administration was pushing hard to win USICA approval. ""It has to happen by the end of this year. It's essential,"" Raimondo said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives prepared to take up a resolution on Wednesday to censure a Republican member for a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post depicting himself killing a prominent progressive and attacking President Joe Biden with swords.
Prominent Republicans criticized the Democratic move to discipline Representative Paul Gosar for the video, even as some suggested they strip another Republican of his seat on a prominent House committee for his vote this month in favor of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill to fix roads and bridges and expand broadband access.
Gosar posted an anime video https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-gosar/u-s-democrats-move-to-censure-republican-gosar-for-violent-video-idUSKBN2HX1UV this month that showed him killing Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was the latest instance of escalating violent rhetoric in Congress, 10 months after thousands of Donald Trump supporters launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol.
The resolution, which appeared on the House Rules Committee website on Tuesday evening, also proposes to remove Gosar from the Committee on Oversight, where Ocasio-Cortez serves, and the Natural Resources Committee.
""Not talking,"" Gosar told reporters on Tuesday. He said last week he would fight for Trump's “America First agenda.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told reporters: “Why go after (Gosar)? Because he made threats, suggestions about harming a member of Congress.""
""We cannot have members joking about murdering each other as well as threatening the president of the United States,"" Pelosi said. 
Republican Representative Tom Cole said Gosar's action had been ""inappropriate,"" but noted that Gosar had made a public statement saying the video was intended to be symbolic and that he had not intended to espouse violence. Gosar also told Republicans at a closed-door meeting earlier on Tuesday that he does not condone violence, Cole said.
""As far as I'm concerned that should have been the end of the matter,"" Cole told a meeting of the rules panel on Tuesday night, which was discussing the censure resolution ahead of floor action. The censure vote was planned for Wednesday, a congressional source said.
House Democrats stripped firebrand Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-republicans/u-s-house-punishes-republican-congresswoman-over-incendiary-remarks-idUSKBN2A42IF of her committee assignments this year for incendiary remarks that included support for violence against Democrats.
But top House Republican Kevin McCarthy has not taken action to punish his own members. Republicans say Democrats have gone unpunished for inflammatory rhetoric that they blame for anti-racism protests in U.S. cities in 2020. Some said there could be consequences for Democrats if Republicans retake the House majority in 2022. 
UNDAUNTED
At the same time, some conservative Republicans called for Representative John Katko to be removed as top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee for backing the infrastructure bill, which was opposed by House Republican leaders and Trump, the former president.
House Republicans have struggled internally since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, which prompted 10 lawmakers including Katko and Representative Liz Cheney to vote for Trump's second impeachment https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-int/u-s-house-impeaches-trump-for-a-second-time-10-republicans-vote-yes-idUSKBN29J092.

Katko was one of 13 House Republicans who backed the infrastructure legislation, a bipartisan measure that had passed the Senate with support from 19 Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
He appeared undaunted by the criticism. 

""I'm focused on securing our border, supporting law enforcement, and stopping Democrats' reckless spending in the Build Back Better Act. Our conference is united behind these efforts. I intend to continue leading on them,"" Katko said in a statement emailed to Reuters. 
At a Tuesday party meeting, McCarthy urged members not to seek punishment against Katko and the other 12 House Republicans, according to a person familiar with the discussion.

In his confirmation hearing, Kanter pledged to enforce antitrust law in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and the labor market, as well as in Big Tech.
The Senate confirmed him on a vote of 68 to 29.
Kanter is the third of three people, who all have tech expertise and were backed by progressives, to be chosen for key antitrust posts. The other two were Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
Kanter takes the reins of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division at a time of calls for tougher enforcement and bipartisan criticism of internet platforms like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which the Justice Department sued last year alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble search engine rivals. The government is preparing to file a second lawsuit focused on the company's digital advertising business. Google has also denied wrongdoing.
The department is also investigating Apple for alleged violations of antitrust law.

The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which share the work of enforcing antitrust law, have seen a surge in deals in the past year.
In the past year, the department also sued to stop Penguin Random House's $2.2 billion deal for Simon & Schuster and to halt a partnership between American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp. It also stopped a deal between Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Donald Trump's lawyers on Tuesday urged a judge to block a House of Representatives panel from getting the former U.S. president's tax returns, calling it an invasive and politically motivated request.
Trump was the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.
The House Ways and Means Committee sued in 2019 to force disclosure of the tax returns, and the dispute lingers nearly 10 months after Trump left office.
Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge told U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden the committee has no legitimate reason to see the tax returns, and asked for them in hopes of learning information that will hurt Trump politically.
McFadden said that Democratic Representative Richard Neal, the committee's chairman, and other Democratic lawmakers have made contradictory statements about why they want Trump's tax returns. 
Some of the public statements suggest the committee wants Trump's tax returns to consider legislation, which is a valid reason, McFadden said. Other public statements, he added, ""could certainly be taken to suggest there's something else going on.""
McFadden also said he was reluctant to second-guess Neal's motivations, signaling he may allow the case to move forward. The judge said he will issue a written decision within three weeks on whether the lawsuit should progress.
The case has moved slowly, partly because the U.S. Justice Department has reversed positions.
In 2019, under Trump, it said the request for his taxes by the committee was based on a ""disingenuous"" objective.

Six months after President Joe Biden took office, it released a memo saying the House panel had offered ""sufficient reasons"" for the request.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled against Trump in an unrelated case on whether a Manhattan prosecutor could see Trump's tax returns as part of a criminal investigation of his business.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pressed his Chinese counterpart on human rights in a video call lasting more than three hours, while Xi Jinping warned that China would respond to provocations on Taiwan, according to official accounts of the exchange.
The closely scrutinized conversation between the leaders of the world's biggest economies was described by both sides as frank and direct as the two sides tried to lower the temperature and avoid conflict.
The talks, which began on Monday evening in Washington - Tuesday morning in Beijing - appeared to yield no immediate outcomes, but gave the two leaders opportunity to nudge their relations away from icy confrontation, even as they stuck to entrenched positions.
They discussed North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran, global energy markets, trade and competition, climate, military issues, the pandemic and other areas where they frequently disagree.
Xi, who has not left his country since COVID-19 spread worldwide from the central Chinese city of Wuhan nearly two years ago, compared the two countries to ""two giant ships sailing in the sea"" that needed to be steadied so they didn't collide, Chinese state media reported. 
""I hope that, Mr. President, you can exercise political leadership to return the United States' China policy to a rational and pragmatic track,"" Xi told Biden, according to Xinhua, a reference to tough-on-China policies that Beijing hoped would be rolled back after Biden came to office.
Biden spoke of avoiding conflict as well. 
""It seems to me our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that our competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended,"" Biden said during a short exchange observed by reporters at the start of the meeting. ""Just simple, straightforward competition.""
The leaders had a ""healthy debate"", a senior U.S. official said afterwards. Biden stressed the importance of China fulfilling its commitments under a trade pact negotiated with Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, the U.S. official said.
China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services, but Xi told Biden that it was important to avoid politicizing the issue.
The two also discussed taking measures to address global energy supplies, U.S. officials said.
The contentious issue of whether the United States will send White House envoys to the Beijing Winter Olympics in February did not come up, the U.S. official said.
Chinese state media struck an upbeat tone.
""The summit could be taken as a sign that the two economic and political heavyweights could at least avoid a further deterioration in their ties after four years of damage caused by the reckless Trump administration,"" Wen Sheng, a Global Times editor, wrote in a commentary. 
RED LINE FOR TAIWAN 
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) differences over the self-ruled island of Taiwan remain. 
While Biden reiterated long-standing U.S. support for the ""One China"" policy https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-says-he-chinas-xi-have-agreed-abide-by-taiwan-agreement-2021-10-05 under which it officially recognises Beijing rather than Taipei, he also said he ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"", the White House said. 
Xi said those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the United States, were ""playing with fire"", according to Xinhua.
""China is patient and seeks peaceful reunification with great sincerity and effort, but if Taiwan secessionists provoke, or even cross the red line, we will have to take decisive measures,"" he said.
A U.S. official said ""there was nothing new established in the form of guard rails or any other understandings"" on Taiwan, though Biden raised ""very clear concerns.""
China claims the island as its own. Beijing has vowed to bring the island under Chinese control, by force if necessary, and tensions across the Taiwan Strait have escalated in recent months.
Beijing objects to Washington's efforts to carve out more space for Taiwan in the international system, and recent comments by Biden that the United States would defend Taiwan in certain cases also inflamed tensions. 
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, responding to Xi's remarks, denounced China's ""pressure and intimidation"", saying the island's people would not give in to threats.
Biden raised other issues that Beijing regards as domestic concerns, including its handling of Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, where China's policies face frequent censure by foreign rights groups.
Biden and Xi have not had a face-to-face meeting since Biden became president and the last time they spoke was by telephone in September. The U.S. president smiled broadly as the Chinese president appeared on a large screen in the White House conference room.

The tone of the meeting lifted investor sentiment, with global stocks hitting new peaks.
""At least they are talking,"" economist Wellian Wiranto of OCBC Bank in Singapore wrote during the talks. ""That seems to be the main expectation by global markets when it comes to any concrete outcome – or a lack thereof.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Pentagon racked up its fourth comprehensive audit failure, reflecting problems in systems and accounting as the vast bureaucracy makes ""steady progress"" towards a passing grade, the department's chief financial officer said on Tuesday.
The legally required audit has helped sharpen the Pentagon's systems and controls and has regularly helped the Department of Defense find misplaced inventory helping save money.
About 1,200 auditors tested the systems and record-keeping processes on weapons systems, military personnel and property around the world with 278 site visits and 1,069 virtual visits.
The process led to 26 standalone audits that comprised the overall exercise.
Eight units were expected to receive clean opinions from the auditors, the same as last year, said Mike McCord, the Pentagon's CFO. 
""The department continues to make steady progress toward achieving a favorable audit opinion,"" McCord told reporters as he released the results of the audit of more than $3.2 trillion in assets and $3 trillion in liabilities.
The Pentagon added, ""As the audits mature and testing expands, Department of Defense leaders expect findings to increase in number and complexity,"" since successive sweeps could expose more profound problems. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security took a decade to pass a comprehensive audit, and Pentagon officials have said the DoD could take just as long, making 2027 the possible date for its first clean audit.

Travel curbs over the coronavirus hampered auditing in situations that required in-person access, the Pentagon said, but virtual site visits yielded some efficiencies in the due diligence effort.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden signed into law a $1 trillion infrastructure bill at a White House ceremony on Monday that drew Democrats and Republicans who pushed the legislation through a deeply divided U.S. Congress.
The measure is designed to create jobs across the country by dispersing billions of dollars to state and local governments to fix crumbling bridges and roads and by expanding broadband internet access to millions of Americans.
The bill-signing ceremony, held in chilly weather on the White House South Lawn to accommodate a big crowd, was an increasingly rare moment when members of both parties were willing to stand together and celebrate a bipartisan achievement.
Biden, whose job approval ratings have dropped because of his handling of the economy and other issues, heard supportive chants of ""Joe, Joe, Joe"" from some in the crowd and got a standing ovation as he stepped to the microphone.
Biden said the bill's passage showed that ""despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results."" He called the bill a ""blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.""
""Too often in Washington, the reason we don’t get things done is because we insist on getting everything we want. With this law, we focused on getting things done,"" Biden said.
Speakers included Senator Kyrsten Sinema, the centrist Arizona Democrat whose opposition to some tax increases has forced a scaling back of a companion piece of legislation, Biden's $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" social safety net plan.
Sinema and fellow Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who also attended, have angered some in their party for resisting a number of items sought by progressives in the social spending bill. Sinema appeared to refer to the criticism in her remarks.
""Delivering this legislation for the American people – this is what it looks like when elected leaders set aside differences, shut out the noise and focus on delivering results on the issues that matter most to everyday Americans,"" she said.
Republicans attending included Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan.
Some Republicans who drew fire from their party's right wing for backing the legislation stayed away.
Biden signed an executive order before the ceremony directing that materials made in the United States be given priority in infrastructure projects, the White House said.
It also established a task force made up of top Cabinet officials to guide implementation of the legislation, co-chaired by former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.
The bill had become a partisan lightning rod, with Republicans complaining that Democrats who control the House of Representatives delayed its passage to ensure party support for Biden's $1.75 trillion social policy and climate change legislation, which Republicans reject.
BATTLE OVER SOCIAL SPENDING LOOMS 
There was a festive atmosphere at the ceremony. Biden joked that Portman, who is not standing for re-election and does not have to face critics within his own Republican Party, is a ""hell of a good guy. I know I’m not hurting you, Rob, because you’re not running again.”
Representative Don Young, an 88-year-old Alaska Republican, teased Biden about the hour-plus length of the ceremony when he sat down to sign the bill.
""We were wondering when you were gonna stop. We damn near froze to death,"" he said.
How long the bipartisan spirit will last is unclear as both sides expect a big battle over the social safety net plan.
Biden's Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.

The White House is hoping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the bill to a vote this week. That will only be a first step, however, as the Senate has not yet taken up the legislation, and Democratic divisions could threaten its chances in that chamber.
Biden and top officials in his administration are hitting the road to promote the infrastructure plan. He visits New Hampshire on Tuesday and Michigan on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon on Monday sought to portray the criminal charges over his defiance of a congressional inquiry into the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot as politically motivated, lashing out at President Joe Biden and others.
Bannon, indicted by a federal grand jury https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-indicts-bannon-not-complying-with-jan-6-subpoena-2021-11-12 on Friday on two counts of contempt of Congress, made his first court appearance, with Magistrate Judge Robin Meriweather releasing him on his personal recognizance after a brief hearing. Hours earlier, Bannon turned himself in at an FBI field office in Washington, flanked by black-clad bodyguards.
The conditions set by Meriweather for Bannon's release did not include an order not to talk about the case publicly. Bannon moments after the hearing addressed a throng of journalists outside the federal courthouse.
""I'm never going to back down. They took on the wrong guy this time,"" said Bannon, Trump's one-time chief strategist and one of more than 30 people close to the Republican former president called to testify to the Democratic-led House of Representatives select committee probing the Jan. 6 attack.
Bannon took aim at Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
""I'm telling you right now, this is going to be the misdemeanor from hell for Merrick Garland, Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden,"" Bannon said.
""We're going to go on the offense. We're tired of playing defense,"" Bannon said, who claimed without offering evidence that Biden ordered Garland to bring the charges.
Bannon was indicted on one contempt count for refusing to appear for a deposition before the committee and a second count for refusing to produce documents. The House voted on Oct. 21 to hold Bannon in contempt https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-edges-toward-contempt-charges-against-trump-aide-bannon-2021-10-21, leaving it up to the Justice Department, headed by Garland, to decide on bringing charges.
Before surrendering to the FBI, Bannon told reporters, ""We're taking down the Biden regime,"" though he did not specify what he meant by ""taking down."" A demonstrator standing behind him held a sign that read ""Coup Plotter."" 
A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Biden. The committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events. Bannon is the first to face criminal charges arising from the panel's inquiry.
Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail along with a fine of up to $100,000, according to the Justice Department. The department on Friday had said Bannon faced a fine of up to $1,000. 
Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail along with a monetary fine. 
Meriweather imposed several conditions on Bannon including surrendering his U.S. passport. Bannon did not enter a plea, with an arraignment scheduled for Thursday.
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE
Trump has sought to stonewall the House committee and directed his associates not to cooperate. In defying his subpoena, Bannon cited Trump's insistence - already rejected by one judge - that the former president has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-trump-use-executive-privilege-block-jan-6-attack-probe-2021-09-09.
Bannon, a prominent figure in right-wing media circles, was an architect of Trump's 2016 presidential victory and served as White House chief strategist in 2017. The former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) banker and Navy veteran has promoted right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad. 
Bannon separately was charged last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-bannon/steve-bannon-key-to-trumps-rise-charged-with-defrauding-border-wall-supporters-idUSKBN25G1J4 with defrauding donors to a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump's pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. Trump pardoned Bannon before the case could go to trial.
The House committee has said Bannon made public statements suggesting he knew in advance about ""extreme events"" that would occur on Jan. 6. Bannon said on a Jan. 5 podcast that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.""
Shortly before the riot, Trump gave a speech to supporters near the White House repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal.""
House investigators hope the Bannon charges will motivate other witnesses including former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who on Friday refused to appear for a deposition, to testify. 

Bannon's attorney David Schoen after Monday's hearing emphasized that his client's actions toward his subpoena were guided by Trump's invocation of executive privilege.
""You can't put the genie back in the bottle,"" Schoen said. ""Mr. Bannon acted as his lawyers counseled him to do by not appearing and by not turning over documents in this case.""

659,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump has endorsed challengers to six congressional Republicans, part of his effort to assert dominance over the party after losing his re-election bid last year to Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump's fire has been focused on the handful of Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, or to convict him on that charge in a Senate trial that ultimately ended in his acquittal.
Below are notable Republicans whom Trump has targeted through his endorsements.
REPRESENTATIVE PETER MEIJER
Meijer, a first-term member of Congress from Grand Rapids, Michigan, said he voted for impeachment with a ""heavy heart.""
Trump on Nov. 15 endorsed John Gibbs' primary challenge of Meijer, calling him ""a fabulous talent who loves the State, our Military, and our Vets."" Gibbs served in Trump's administration.
REPRESENTATIVE ANTHONY GONZALEZ
Gonzalez, a two-term U.S. representative from Ohio who voted to impeach Trump for inciting supporters to launch a deadly assault on the Capitol, in September became the first of Trump's targets to withdraw https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-congressman-who-voted-impeach-trump-wont-seek-re-election-2021-09-17 from a re-election bid after the former president endorsed a Republican challenger. 
Gonzalez' impeachment vote had drawn rebuke from the Ohio Republican Party, which in May called on him to resign his seat in Congress. In a statement, Gonzalez said ""the toxic dynamics inside our own party"" played a role in his withdrawal. Trump has endorsed former White House aide Max Miller for Gonzalez's seat.
REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY
Cheney was the highest-profile lawmaker of the 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump. A U.S. representative for Wyoming since 2017, she was ousted from her role as the No. 3 House Republican following the impeachment vote. A scion of a storied Republican family, Cheney's father Dick Cheney served as U.S. vice president from 2001 to 2009. In a Sept. 9 statement endorsing Wyoming attorney Harriet Hageman https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-endorses-challenger-republican-cheney-wyoming-house-race-2021-09-09, who is challenging Cheney, Trump called Cheney ""disloyal."" 
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI
The U.S. senator for Alaska was one of seven Republican Senators who voted to convict Trump and remove him from office. The vote failed and Trump was acquitted. Murkowski, known for her long independent streak, is the only one of the seven Republicans up for re-election this year. Trump has endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner, to challenge Murkowski for her seat.
REPRESENTATIVE JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER
The U.S. representative from Washington state not only voted to impeach Trump, she submitted evidence in his Senate trial against the former president. Herrera Beutler said in a statement that the top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, had told her about a call he had with Trump on Jan. 6, during the riot when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, in which Trump said, ""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are."" Trump has endorsed Army veteran Joe Kent's bid to unseat Herrera Beutler, who has been in Congress since 2011.

REPRESENTATIVE FRED UPTON
Upton, who has represented Michigan in the House since 1987, was an early critic of Trump's false claims that he lost the November presidential election due to widespread fraud. Upton said in January his vote for impeachment was to ""send a clear message"" that the country will not tolerate a president impeding the peaceful transfer of power. Trump has endorsed Michigan state lawmaker Steve Carra's bid to challenge Upton.

(Reuters) -Beto O'Rourke, the former U.S. congressman from Texas whose surprisingly close 2018 loss to Senator Ted Cruz made him a Democratic star, said on Monday he will challenge Republican Greg Abbott in next year's race for governor of the state.
O'Rourke has been seen as his party's best option for the 2022 gubernatorial race even after his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination failed to garner much support amid a crowded field of candidates.
No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas, the second most populous U.S. state, in three decades, despite Democratic hopes that its diversifying population and rapidly growing urban centers will eventually transform it into a true swing state.
O'Rourke is likely to face some political headwinds, as well. President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, has seen his job approval ratings falter, while O'Rourke assumed a number of liberal positions on hot-button issues such as gun rights and immigration during his presidential campaign that could hurt him in a Texas race.
Abbott, who is facing two Republican challengers for his party's nomination in the race, has amassed an enormous campaign war chest, with more than $55 million as of June. 
As governor, Abbott has overseen a sharp turn to the right https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-moves-state-sharply-right-ahead-2022-election-2021-10-13 in lockstep with the Republican-controlled legislature, including the nation's most restrictive abortion law, new limits on voting rights, expanded gun rights and orders barring private companies and public school districts from taking COVID-19 mitigation measures. Democrats hope those moves will energize their base to vote out Abbott.
O'Rourke has spent much of the past year criticizing the two-term governor for his handling of several crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and a fierce winter storm that caused the state's electric grid to fail and left hundreds of Texans dead.
In an announcement video, O'Rourke blamed the state's Republican-controlled government for mishandling the storm and argued that it was symptomatic of a larger issue.
""Those in position of public trust have stopped listening to, serving and paying attention to and trusting the people of Texas,"" O'Rourke said.
In his run against the Republican Cruz, O'Rourke proved to be a formidable fundraiser and a tireless campaigner, visiting every one of the state's more than 250 counties. He lost to Cruz by less than three percentage points.
But O'Rourke has since taken on some political baggage, after carving out left-wing stances as part of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. In particular, during a Democratic debate in 2019, he memorably defended his proposal to ban assault-style rifles by saying, ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.""
Abbott's campaign had attacked O'Rourke as too liberal for Texas even before he announced his entry into the race.
""The last thing Texans need is President Biden's radical liberal agenda coming to Texas under the guise of Beto O'Rourke,"" an Abbott campaign spokesperson, Mark Miner, said in a statement on Monday.

The national political atmosphere could also pose a challenge for O'Rourke. Strong Republican performances in Virginia and New Jersey's governor races this month suggest the party holds an early advantage ahead of next year's elections.
""Abbott is potentially vulnerable, but any Republican starts off a race in Texas with somewhere between an eight or 10-point advantage,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.

Trump said in a statement he was backing John Gibbs, a software engineer who was a housing official in Trump's administration, over Meijer.
Trump has now endorsed six challengers to Republican incumbents who joined Democrats efforts to boot him from office on a charge he incited the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 and tried to reverse Trump's election defeat to Joe Biden.
One of them, Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, has already bowed out of his race. 

Meijer, a freshman member of Congress from Grand Rapids, Michigan, in January said he was voting to impeach Trump with a heavy heart but that ""he bears responsibility for inciting the violent acts of insurrection.""
While Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives, the Senate acquitted him.

663,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation on Monday that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level and eliminate legal hazards facing many cannabis-related businesses while regulating its use like alcohol.
Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who is spear-heading the legislative effort, described the bill as a ""compromise"" with less onerous regulations than measures proposed earlier by other lawmakers including Democrats.
The legislation's path in the Democratic-controlled House was uncertain. Mace, a first-term lawmaker, said the measure has five Republican co-sponsors.
Adult use of cannabis is legal https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx in 18 U.S. states and allowed medically in 36 states. But it remains illegal under federal law, which has deterred banks and other investors from involvement with companies that sell marijuana or related products.
""This bill would also support businesses, in particular small businesses. That's very important,"" Mace told a news conference. ""If we were to pass this bill today ... businesses would operate and be legal and regulated just like alcohol."" 
Titled the States Reform Act, the Republican legislation would defer to state authorities on matters of prohibition and regulation.
It would prohibit marijuana use by those under 21, restrict advertising, protect access to hiring and benefits for veterans who have used cannabis and expunge the records of people convicted on nonviolent, cannabis-only related offenses. 
The bill diverges in several important ways from draft legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-release-discussion-draft-federally-legalize-cannabis-2021-07-14 proposed in July by Senate Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 

Mace's bill would impose a 3% excise tax on cannabis, compared to an increasing Senate tax proposal that would top out at around 25%.
Where the Senate proposal would give the Food and Drug Administration a primary oversight role, the Republican legislation limits FDA involvement to medical marijuana and makes the Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau the primary regulator for interstate commerce.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sweeping legislation to boost U.S. competitiveness with China and fund much-needed semiconductor production passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June but has stalled in the House of Representatives as backers struggle to find a way to pass it.
Although President Joe Biden's Democrats control both chambers of Congress, House members said they wanted to write their own bill, not consider the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA.
Five months later, the House has not voted on its own bill nor taken up USICA. And with a packed legislative agenda https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congress-november-agenda-not-faint-heart-2021-11-01, there is scant time to do so in 2021.
The Senate passed USICA https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-set-pass-sweeping-bill-address-china-tech-threat-2021-06-08 by 68-32. The measure was a rare legislative foray into industrial policy, authorizing $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research, and an additional $54 billion to increase U.S. production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.
China says USICA distorts facts and is based on ""cold war thinking."" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday that it would harm relations. ""China has always resolutely opposed this,"" he said.
Sources told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-chinese-embassy-lobbies-us-business-oppose-china-bills-sources-2021-11-12 that China has been pushing U.S. executives, companies and business groups to fight against USICA and other China-related bills in Congress.
A worldwide shortage of computer chips is crimping production of everything from gaming consoles to vehicles. Money in USICA would help expand manufacturing. 
Many issues addressed in USICA, including trade and human rights, are expected to feature at Monday's virtual summit https://www.reuters.com/world/china/biden-chinas-xi-expected-meet-virtually-monday-sources-2021-11-11 between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
A House Democratic leadership aide would not give a timeline for House consideration of the measure, saying only there are still areas where the House and Senate must resolve differences.
ADDING PROVISIONS TO DEFENSE BILL
Many senators are shifting their focus toward including USICA provisions in other legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senators-propose-adding-boycott-chinas-winter-olympics-defense-bill-2021-10-28 expected to pass within weeks, such as the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual defense policy bill.
On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a letter https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CES%20Dear%20Colleague%2011.14.21.pdf that the Senate would likely take up NDAA this week and ""may add the Senate-passed text of USICA to the NDAA.""
He added that ""would enable a USICA negotiation with the House to be completed alongside NDAA before the end of the year."" 
The House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a China bill in July, but all 20 committee Republicans opposed the ""Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act,"" or Eagle Act. There has been no word on timing of a vote in the full House.
The Eagle Act is narrower than USICA, focusing on foreign policy. It also includes provisions, such as on climate, that Republicans said they will not support.
But generally, the desire for a hard line on China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in Congress. Lawmakers and aides from both parties worry the bill could slip well into 2022 if something does not change quickly.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat on both the foreign relations and armed services committees, expressed frustration. ""I was happy to see this legislation pass the Senate in June on a broadly bipartisan basis and strongly urge the House to take it up swiftly and send it to the president’s desk without delay,"" he said in a statement.
""It is critical Congress pass strong, bipartisan legislation to address the generational threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont on Monday said he will not seek re-election in November 2022, opening up another seat that Democrats will need to aggressively defend if they are to maintain their razor-thin Senate majority.
First elected in 1974, Leahy, 81, serves as the chamber's president pro tempore, a position that places him third in line to the U.S. presidency, after Vice President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
His retirement could open an opportunity for Democratic Representative Peter Welch to run for Senate.
""It is time to pass the torch to the next Vermonter who will carry on this work for this great state,"" Leahy said in making the retirement announcement in his home state.
""I will not run for re-election,"" he added.
The U.S. Senate currently is evenly split with 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who align with Democrats.
Democrats next year will be defending 14 of their currently held seats and Republicans will defend 20, as both parties also attempt to expand their Senate turf. While it marks a steeper climb for Republicans, mid-term elections generally favor the party that does not hold the White House, where Democratic President Joe Biden resides.
Leahy chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee which oversees federal spending. In that role and previously as the ""ranking"" Democrat under a Republican chairman, he has been at the center of negotiations on deals to avert government shutdowns for lack of funds.
While Leahy's Vermont Senate seat is seen as still leaning Democratic, political volatility in next year's congressional campaigns could make this race one to watch as Democrats attempt to hold onto their majority.
With his exit, Leahy joins a growing list of federal lawmakers whose departures could shake up next year's congressional elections. 
U.S. Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona is also retiring, while U.S. Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania has embarked on a difficult U.S. Senate run. Both races might be competitive and their exits could hurt Democrats' chances of maintaining a narrow majority in the House of Representatives.

Democrats were buoyed last week by news New Hampshire's Republican Governor Chris Sununu will run for re-election rather than challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan for her seat next year. Sununu was seen as a strong potential challenger.
During his years in the Senate, Leahy also staked out a small place in popular culture, appearing in five ""Batman"" movies. His best-known appearance was in 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" in which his character stood up to the Joker, telling him, ""We're not intimidated by thugs."" In response, the Joker grabs Leahy by the head and brandishes a knife in his face.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden named former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to oversee implementation of the $1 trillion infrastructure plan, the White House said on Sunday.
Landrieu, also a Democratic former Louisiana lieutenant governor, led New Orleans from 2010 to 2018. He played a key role in helping the city rebound from the devastating Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Biden, who will sign the infrastructure bill into law on Monday, named Landrieu senior adviser responsible for coordinating implementation of the bill that includes big jumps in spending on roads, bridges, rail, airports, transit, ports, broadband internet and removing lead pipes.
Biden held a similar role as vice president under then-President Barack Obama, overseeing an $800 billion 2009 economic stimulus package. Biden said on Friday: ""We owe it to the American people to make sure the money ... (is) used for purposes it was intended.""
Landrieu said the ""work will require strong partnerships across the government and with state and local leaders, business and labor to create good-paying jobs and rebuild America for the middle class.""
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August.
Biden has vowed to build 500,000 EV charging stations with $7.5 billion in the bill and use $65 billion to make ""high-speed Internet accessible to every American, rural and urban.""
A separate $1.75 trillion proposal aims to expand the social safety net in the United States and boost climate-change policy.

Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation. The White House has said they will not add to inflationary pressures.
The infrastructure bill had become a partisan lightning rod, with Republicans complaining that Democrats who control the House delayed its passage to ensure party support for the social policy and climate change legislation, which Republicans reject.

(Reuters) - Stephen Bannon, a prominent adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been criminally charged for defying a subpoena issued by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the Justice Department said on Friday.
Bannon has refused to cooperate with the House of Representatives select committee seeking testimony and documents from him, citing Trump's insistence - already rejected by one judge - that he has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.
Bannon, 67, was charged with one count of contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a deposition and a second count for refusing to produce documents. Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $1,000, the Justice Department said.
Justice Department spokesperson Bill Miller said Bannon is ""expected to self-surrender"" on Monday in Washington and make his first court appearance in the case that afternoon.
Trump has sought to stonewall the committee, which is scrutinizing his actions relating to the deadly Capitol riot, and directed his former associates not to cooperate. The charges against Bannon may bolster the committee's efforts to secure testimony and documents from other Trump associates.
Bannon's indictment was announced just hours after Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows refused to appear for a deposition before the committee, risking also being found in contempt of Congress.
As a top adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign who later served as White House chief strategist, Bannon helped articulate the ""America First"" right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that helped define Trump's presidency. 
Bannon, who has promoted a variety of right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad, continued to offer Trump advice after leaving his White House post in 2017. Bannon is a prominent figure in right-wing media circles and previously headed the Breitbart News website.
'CLEAR MESSAGE' 
""Steve Bannon's indictment should send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can ignore the Select Committee or try to stonewall our investigation: no one is above the law,"" Democrat Bennie Thompson and Republican Liz Cheney, the leaders of the committee, said in a statement. 
Bannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It is the second time in 15 months that Bannon has faced criminal charges. Bannon was charged in August 2020 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-bannon/steve-bannon-key-to-trumps-rise-charged-with-defrauding-border-wall-supporters-idUSKBN25G1J4 with defrauding donors to We Build the Wall, a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump's wall project along the U.S.-Mexican border, and arrested aboard a yacht belonging to a fugitive Chinese billionaire. Trump subsequently issued a pardon https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pardons/trump-pardons-ex-aide-bannon-but-not-himself-or-family-idUSKBN29P0BE to Bannon before that case could go to trial.
The Democratic-led House voted to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress in October. Most of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed creating an independent commission or a committee to investigate the events surrounding Jan. 6. 
On that day, a mob of Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. Before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him and urged them to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal."" 
The committee has said Bannon made public statements suggesting he knew in advance about ""extreme events"" that would occur on Jan. 6. Bannon said on a Jan. 5 podcast that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.""
After the House voted to hold Bannon in contempt, it was up to Biden's Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to decide whether to bring charges. Garland in a statement on Friday said his department ""adheres to the rule of law, follows the facts and the law and pursues equal justice under the law.""

Trump on Oct. 18 sued the committee and the National Archives, which holds material dating from his presidency, in a bid to keep hundreds of pages of records secret. A judge rejected Trump's lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the public interest in learning about Trump's actions on Jan. 6 was paramount. Trump appealed that ruling.
The last successful prosecution for contempt of Congress was in 1974 when a judge found G. Gordon Liddy, a conspirator in the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon to resign, guilty.

(Reuters) - Florida lawmakers will meet in a special legislative session Monday, called by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis with the goal of thwarting coronavirus vaccine mandates.
In a week-long session, the lawmakers, largely dominated by the Republican party, are slated to consider four bills that would impose new penalties on businesses and local governments that require workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the agenda released last week by the governor's office.
""No cop, no firefighter, no nurse, nobody should be losing their job because of these jabs,"" DeSantis said in a media release, referring to injections as jabs.
""We're going to be striking a blow for freedom,"" he said. DeSantis has long been a supporter of voluntary vaccines, and has received one himself, according to media reports.
The bills, if passed, would buttress a series of similar rules and state executive orders already put in place by DeSantis, said Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida.
""This is a combination of policy and politics,"" Jewett said, adding that DeSantis is following former President Donald Trump's lead in being staunchly against mask and vaccine mandates.
""DeSantis knows that Trump supporters don't like masks or this vaccine,"" Jewett said. ""There's no denying it's politics with an eye not only on the governor's race, but an eye toward the White House.""
DeSantis has recently announced he is running for re-election in the 2022 governor's race and is seen by political insiders as a potential presidential candidate in 2024.

The bills would impose fines on private businesses that don't allow employee exemptions to any COVID-19 vaccine requirement. 
""This is something that his base will love,"" Jewett said. ""He is establishing himself as a freedom fighter.""

""We're here today because we need immediate relief at the gas pump and the place to look is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Schumer, a Democrat, said at a news conference in New York.
Soaring gas prices and car sales drove a solid increase in U.S. producer prices in October as oil prices hit more than $80 a barrel, with OPEC and its allies rebuffing U.S. pleas for the producers to pump more crude.
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last Monday Biden could act, but there was still no word on whether he would authorize a sale from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is held in a series of caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
Analysts have warned a release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would only produce a short-term effect, as it would not increase U.S. production capacity.
As the U.S. economy reawakens after the coronavirus pandemic, supply and demand cannot keep up, especially with supply chain disruptions, Schumer said.
""No industry is spared. But fuel gasoline is the worst of all,"" Schumer said. ""Let's get the price of gas down right now. And this will do it."" 

Last week, 11 Senate Democrats urged Biden in a letter to tap the SPR and ban crude oil exports to lower gas prices, citing OPEC constraints on supplies and U.S. exports.
""Continued U.S. exports and overseas supply collusion could be devastating to many in our states, contributing to higher bills for American families and businesses,"" the senators, from New England states and Pennsylvania, wrote on Nov. 8.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is planning a big ceremony on Monday for President Joe Biden's signing of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill Monday with Republican lawmakers, amid a toxic political climate in the United States. 
Officials are considering holding the event on the expansive White House South Lawn, where the presidential helicopter lands, to accommodate a large crowd invited to celebrate one of the president's biggest legislative achievements to date, a person familiar with the planning said.
The White House said Biden will be joined by lawmakers who helped write the legislation and ""a diverse group of leaders who fought for its passage across the country, ranging from governors and mayors of both parties to labor union and business leaders.""
The bill was written largely by a core bipartisan group of 10 Senate lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Senator Rob Portman. The House of Representatives passed the measure last week with the aid of 13 Republicans.
It is expected to create jobs across the country by giving out billions of dollars to state and local governments to fix crumbling bridges and roads, and expanding broadband internet access to million of Americans.
But it was unclear how many Republican lawmakers would attend the ceremony. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who helped co-author the legislation, are planning to attend, according to aides.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell does not plan to attend the White House ceremony, saying in an interview this week that he has ""other things I've got to do."" But he made clear his unflinching support for the legislation.
""This bill was basically written in the Senate by a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats – all the House did last week was simply take up the Senate bill and pass it. This bill was crafted in the Senate, 19 Republicans voted for it, I was one of them, I think it was good for the country and I’m glad it passed,"" he told WHAS Radio in Louisville, Kentucky.
HARASSMENT ARREST 
The bill was crafted as a bipartisan achievement for Biden, who had campaigned as a centrist Democrat, and the moderate Republicans who helped write it. 
But it became a partisan lightning rod, with Republicans complaining that House Democrats delayed its passage to ensure party support for Biden's $1.75 trillion social policy and climate change legislation, which Republicans reject. 
The 13 Republicans who broke ranks with their party and ignored the instructions of their leaders to support the measure have been targeted by former President Donald Trump and some of their own colleagues. 
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump loyalist, called them ""traitors"" for giving Biden a political victory in a vote that was opposed by enough House Democrats to sink the measure. 
Many of those Republicans have received death threats against themselves and family members. 
Police in New York state's Nassau County said on Friday they had arrested a man and charged him with aggravated harassment for making an alleged death threat to Republican Representative Andrew Garbarino, who voted for the bill. 

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) of South Carolina, a staunch Trump ally, was censured by a county Republican Party for supporting the bill.
Biden plans a victory lap after the signing ceremony. He will visit a bridge in Woodstock, New Hampshire, on Tuesday to promote the bill as well as a General Motors (NYSE:GM) electric vehicle facility in Detroit on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Friday said he would nominate Robert Califf for a second stint as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and urged the Senate to swiftly confirm him.
Califf, 70, a well-regarded cardiologist and researcher closely linked with the pharmaceutical industry, served as FDA commissioner from February 2016 until the end of then-President Barack Obama's second term in January 2017.
""Dr. Robert Califf is one of the most experienced clinical trialists in the country, and has the experience and expertise to lead the Food and Drug Administration during a critical time in our nation's fight to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic,"" Biden said in a statement issued by the White House.
Califf was confirmed for his first term by the Senate 89-4 with broad bipartisan support, though at the time he faced criticism from some Democrats, like Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who said his ties to the drug industry made him unfit to regulate it impartially. 
At the time, Califf had co-authored papers with industry executives and served as a consultant for drugmakers. He was since hired by Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc in 2019, and currently serves as the head of Clinical Policy and Strategy across its Google Health and Verily Life Sciences enterprises.
He is also on the board of drugmaker  Cytokinetics  (NASDAQ:CYTK) Inc and has received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), Boehringer Ingelheim, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche AG's Genentech unit, and Merck & Co Inc.
""Dr. Califf had strong bipartisan support in the Senate in 2016, and I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Dr. Califf so he can continue the important work being done at this critical moment,"" Biden said in the White House statement.
The leading U.S. pharmaceutical trade association welcomed his nomination.
""We hope the confirmation process will proceed quickly, and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA as we fight the pandemic and other deadly diseases,"" said Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America President Steve Ubl.
SENATE CONFIRMATION
Democrats have a razor-thin majority in the Senate. Manchin said on Friday he would oppose Califf's nomination.
""Dr. Califf's nomination and his significant ties to the pharmaceutical industry take us backwards not forward,"" Manchin said in a statement on Friday.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was confident Califf would be confirmed, pointing to his experience and prior confirmation.
""We feel he's a qualified person who has the exact experience for this moment,"" Psaki said at a briefing, adding that Manchin had ultimately voted to confirm him in 2015.
The FDA has been without a permanent leader since Biden took office in January.
If confirmed by the Senate, Califf will take over from longtime FDA veteran Janet Woodcock, who has been serving as acting commissioner. The FDA oversees everything from medicine and medical devices to food, tobacco and cosmetics.
Woodcock has been in the role since Biden took office but legally could not serve past Monday unless a permanent nominee was named. Biden thanked her for her work over the past year. 
The FDA has been in the spotlight as it reviews vaccines and potential treatments for COVID-19, and came under additional scrutiny for its accelerated approval this year of Biogen Inc's Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, against the recommendation of its outside expert advisers.
Califf is an internationally recognized expert in clinical trial research, health disparities, healthcare quality, and cardiovascular medicine, the White House said. He is a longtime faculty member at Duke University where he founded the Duke Clinical Research Institute, a large academic center that received over half its funding from the drug industry. 

He joined the FDA in 2015 as deputy commissioner for Medical Products and Tobacco and worked closely with then-Vice President Biden on Cancer Moonshot, an initiative aimed at speeding development of cancer treatments.

At a press conference in Raritan, his hometown, Ciattarelli said he had congratulated Murphy on his victory and assured supporters his concession was justified.
""I called Governor Murphy earlier today and congratulated him on his re-election and wished him well in serving people of New Jersey,"" the former state senator said.
""There does not appear to be a path to victory or the basis for a recount. Nor do we know of any systemic or widespread fraud,"" he told his supporters. ""So no, I see no proof that this election was stolen.""
Ciattarelli, 59, prompted cheers from the audience when he announced he would run for governor again in four years.
The Republican candidate had campaigned against high taxes and sought to label Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive, as out of touch.
New Jersey has trended Democratic in recent years. President Joe Biden carried the state over former President Donald Trump last year by more than 15 percentage points.
Murphy, 64, is the first Democratic governor in four decades to win re-election in New Jersey, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million in the densely populated state.

""I will work with anyone from either party to advance Alaska's priorities and I will always stand up to any politician or special interest that threatens our way of life,"" Murkowski, 64, said in a video posted on her website.
Murkowski, a moderate, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, in which his supporters attacked Congress in an effort to stop certification of the 2020 election. The Alaska Republican Party later censured Murkowski and pledged to recruit a challenger to oppose her.
Trump, the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, was narrowly acquitted by the Senate. He has blasted Republicans who criticized him for his false claims that he lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden due to voter fraud.
Still influential in the Republican Party, Trump has endorsed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-endorses-murkowski-challenger-2022-senate-race-2021-06-18 Murkowski's Republican challenger, Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner. 
Next year, Murkowski and Tshibaka will run against all Senate candidates in an open, all-party primary.
Murkowski, who is seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate, lost her 2010 primary race only to then run a successful write-in campaign in the general election. She handily won re-election in 2016.
Tshibaka, in a statement on Friday, accused Murkowski of being ""an enthusiastic enabler of the radical Biden administration"" who ""worked against President Trump.""
Murkowski has raised $4.5 million during this campaign cycle and has $3.2 million cash on hand, compared with Tshibaka's $1.2 million raised and $294,345 cash on hand, according to Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics.

In 2017, Murkowski scored a major legislative victory when she won approval of a measure allowing oil and gas drilling in part of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Biden's Interior Department has since suspended oil and gas leasing pending an environmental review.

(Reuters) - A federal judge overruled Texas Governor Greg Abbott's ban on mask mandates in schools, clearing the path for districts to issue their own rules.
Judge Lee Yeakel of U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled the governor's order violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark 1990 federal law that includes protections for students with special needs. In his ruling, Yeakel said the executive order put children with disabilities at risk.
""The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs,"" the judge said in the order. ""Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital's intensive-care unit."" 
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he ""strongly disagreed"" with the ruling.
""My agency is considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision,"" Paxton said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
The issue of mandates to curb the pandemic has become politicized in much of the United States. Supporters of mandates say they are needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and opponents argue they curb individual liberty.
Some school districts in conservative states where governors have forbidden mask mandates are ignoring the bans, but others feel compelled to enforce them. In Texas, numerous districts including those in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, have flouted the ban since it was first announced in May, but others came into compliance amid state pressure including a public list published by Paxton's office.

In his order, Yeakel said the state could not enforce its ban on mask requirements in school, and also could not levy fines or withhold funds from districts that impose mask-wearing.
The order was challenged by disability rights activists on behalf of several Texas students with special needs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday lost another bid to halt congressional investigators from seeing White House records he wants to keep secret.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan declined to put on hold her ruling from Tuesday allowing a House of Representatives committee to obtain Trump White House records relating to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
""This court will not effectively ignore its own reasoning,"" she wrote.
Trump's lawyers had asked Chutkan to pause enforcement of her ruling while he appeals it to a higher court. Trump made a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has yet to act on his request.
The National Archives, a federal agency that holds Trump's White House records, is scheduled to give Congress hundreds of pages of documents on Friday.
Chutkan's decision allowed the House committee investigating the attack to access telephone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that Trump wants blocked.
The Republican former president had argued that the materials requested by the committee were covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
But Chutkan, in her Tuesday ruling, rejected that argument, in a clear win for congressional oversight powers.

The committee has said it needs the requested materials to understand the role Trump may have played in fomenting the riot in which his supporters aimed to block lawmakers from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential win.
Four people died on Jan. 6, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes, and more than 100 police officers were injured in the attack. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the next day and four other police officers who defended the Capitol later died by suicide.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden is still weighing whether to keep Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve for a second term or elevate Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the post, an administration official said on Wednesday.
The White House is cognizant of pressure from both moderates and progressives within the Democratic Party about the choice. ""There are pressures going both ways for both finalists,"" the official said.
Biden met with both candidates for the job last week, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. 
Powell, 68, who was appointed chair by former President Donald Trump and whose four-year term ends in early February, is seen as the front-runner.
He has backing from moderate Democrats as well as Republicans, and a track record of averting a financial crisis and helping to engineer an unexpectedly rapid and strong recovery from the pandemic recession. 
But he has also drawn criticism as supply bottlenecks have driven inflation to a 31-year high even as millions of Americans cannot find jobs, and for a trading scandal on his watch that resulted in the resignation of two Fed presidents and a rewrite of the central bank's ethics rules.
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren opposes his nomination, and progressives are pushing for Brainard, 59, who was named to the board in 2014 by Democratic President Barack Obama after serving in his administration.
Brainard is seen as more dovish on monetary policy and as a stronger hand on bank regulation. It is unclear how much support her nomination would muster from Republicans.
At the online political wagering site PredictIt.org, Powell remains the odds-on favorite, at about 68%. Brainard's stock trails at 31%.

Regardless of his choice for the top Fed job, Biden will have a chance to shape the rest of the seven-member board. One seat is currently vacant. Governor Randal Quarles, until recently the Fed's vice chair of supervision, plans to resign at the end of the year, and Vice Chair Richard Clarida's term ends in January. 
If Biden passes over Brainard for the Fed chairmanship, he could put her in Quarles' old job, which she could use to write stricter rules for Wall Street and potentially take a more active approach on climate change, both important priorities for progressives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten Republican state attorneys general sued on Wednesday to stop the Biden administration's requirement that millions of U.S. health workers get vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying it would worsen staff shortages.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said last Thursday he will enforce the mandate starting Jan. 4. 
The attorneys general of Missouri, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Wyoming, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and New Hampshire jointly filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis.
""Placing this additional mandate on healthcare facilities and employees will exacerbate this problem and will likely lead some facilities – particularly those in underserved, rural areas – to close due to an inability to hire sufficient staff,"" Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt said in a statement.
The lawsuit said the federal mandate intruded on states' police power and is unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act because there was no comment period before its release.
On Nov. 4, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the regulator for the two federal health programs, issued an interim final rule it said covers over 10 million people and applies to around 76,000 healthcare providers including hospitals, nursing homes, and dialysis centers.
An interim final rule is effective immediately without the standard comment period that follows publication. There is a 60-day comment period following its publication, however.
Providers that fail to comply with the mandate could lose access to Medicare and Medicaid funds. Medicare serves people 65 and older and the disabled. Medicaid serves the poor.
The lawsuit said the CMS rule was heavy handed and did not take local factors and conditions into account.

CMS has said there have not been widespread resignations within healthcare providers that have already mandated vaccines, including 41% of U.S. hospitals, and that applying the mandate to all healthcare settings ensures staff cannot quit one setting to seek jobs in another.
""With many employers already mandating vaccination, and with nearly all local (and distant) healthcare employers requiring vaccination under this rule, we expect that such effects will be minimized,"" the agency said in introducing the rule.

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday called on the state's education regulatory agencies to investigate the presence of what he called pornographic books in school libraries. 
In a letter addressed to Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath, Abbott wrote that he expected the agency to notify him of any ""instance of pornography being provided to minors under the age of 18 for prosecution to the fullest extent of the law."" 
""I am directing the Texas Education Agency to investigate any criminal activity in our public schools involving the availability of pornography,"" Abbott wrote. 
In a separate letter sent on Monday, Abbott ordered the education agency, along with the State Library and Archives Commission and the state Board of Education, to immediately develop standards ""to ensure no child is exposed to pornography"" in schools.
Abbott is the latest Republican official to weigh in on issues related to gender and sexual orientation, part of a culture war largely pitting Republicans against Democrats. The governor faces re-election next year and is being challenged from the right by more conservative candidates. 
The book issue came to attention in Texas after a suburban Fort Worth school district said last week it had removed a book on gender identity from its school library following complaints by parents that it was obscene. The book is an award-winning graphic novel titled ""Gender Queer: a Memoir.""
Abbott also cited a book entitled ""In the Dream House"" in his Monday letter, one of several books the Leander Independent School District north of Austin removed from classrooms recently. 
The Texas Education Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said after receiving Abbott's first letter on Monday that it takes his complaints seriously and would comply. 
The state's Library and Archives Commission said it looked forward to working with the education agency and board of education ""to support our students and their families.""

In an opinion piece in the Washington Post last month, Maia Kobabe, author of ""Gender Queer: a Memoir,"" noted the book had been targeted by school districts in a number of states.
""Removing or restricting queer books in libraries and schools is like cutting a lifeline for queer youth, who might not yet even know what terms to ask Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to find out more about their own identities, bodies and health,"" Kobabe wrote.

The indictment alleges that Matthew Tunstall, Kyle Davies and Robert Reyes solicited contributions to two PACs by using robocalls and written solicitations implying that they supported 2016 presidential candidates.
The two political action committees were called Liberty Action Group PAC and Progressive Priorities PAC, the Justice Department said.
""Between January 2016 and April 2017, the defendants obtained approximately $3.5 million from unwitting donors based on false and misleading representations and used those funds to enrich themselves and to pay for additional fraudulent advertisements soliciting donations,"" the Justice Department said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump is seeking hundreds of pages of records from the Republican former president's final months in the White House.
Trump is fighting the requests and has appealed a U.S. judge's decision to allow the National Archives to release the documents, citing executive privilege.
Here is an explanation of what the congressional committee is seeking, and what could happen next.
WHAT RECORDS HAS THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ASKED FOR? 
The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee has requested a trove of documents including White House visitor logs, schedules, call records and handwritten notes from Trump's then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
The committee is also seeking emails between Trump advisers about contesting the 2020 presidential election and planning the Trump rally near the White House on Jan. 6.
Additionally, the committee has requested photos and video relating to Trump's public comments on Jan. 6, when he made a fiery speech to the rally falsely claiming that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the Select Committee, told CNN on Tuesday that the ruling allows it to see outtakes of a video Trump filmed on Jan. 6 as the riots were unfolding.
In that video, Trump urged supporters to ""go home in peace,"" but also ""we love you, you’re very special."" He also repeated multiple false claims about the election being stolen.
Thompson told CNN Trump filmed the video six times because his advisers thought he was not forceful enough in telling the rioters to go home.
WHAT TIMEFRAME DO THE WHITE HOUSE RECORDS COVER?
Most of the Trump White House records are from the final weeks of his presidency. But the committee has also sought communications from as early as April 2020 that would shed light on when and why Trump decided to spread false claims that the November 2020 election was rigged against him.
During a court hearing last week, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan questioned whether some records from April 2020 were necessary to the committee's investigation.
But the judge said in her decision that, while the Committee has ""cast a wide net,"" its requests ""do not exceed the Committee’s legislative powers.""
WHAT DOES TRUMP ARGUE?
Trump has invoked executive privilege, a legal doctrine that presidents have used to keep their communications confidential. Executive privilege is rooted in the idea that presidents should have some privacy in their discussions with advisers so they can receive the most candid advice possible.
Chutkan said in her decision that the public interest in figuring out what happened on Jan. 6 outweighs Trump's privilege claim, adding that deference must be showed to President Joe Biden's determination that the Trump records should be released.
""The legislative and executive branches believe the balance of equities and public interest are well served by the Select Committee’s inquiry,"" Chutkan wrote in her decision. ""The court will not second guess the two branches of government that have historically negotiated their own solutions to congressional requests for presidential documents.""
She added: ""Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.""
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Trump has asked an appeals court to issue a temporary ruling, known as a ""stay,"" blocking the National Archives from turning over the documents to the Select Committee. The purpose of the requested stay would be to allow Trump to appeal Chutkan's decision.
The National Archives has said it will send the documents to the committee on Friday, Nov. 12, unless there is a court order instructing it not to.

Biden met Putin in Geneva in June with relations at post-Cold War lows and troubled by an array of issues including Ukraine, Syria and Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's jailing. 
The Kommersant report said the two sides had not yet agreed the details of a new round of talks, but that the preliminary plan was to hold a video conference by the end of this year, followed by a meeting in-person early next year. 
The newspaper said the two leaders would discuss a set of agreements they reached at the Geneva summit and that the talks would have a wide-ranging agenda. 

The Kremlin told reporters on Tuesday there was no firm timeframe yet for a new round of talks, but that both Moscow and Washington agreed they were needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol can access former President Donald Trump's White House records, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday in a clear win for congressional oversight powers.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in the District of Columbia rejected an argument by Trump's lawyers that telephone records, visitor logs and other White House documents should be hidden from the committee.
""While broad, these requests, and each of the other requests made by the Committee, do not exceed the Committee’s legislative powers,"" Chutkan said in her decision.
Trump had argued that the materials requested by the House committee were covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-trump-use-executive-privilege-block-jan-6-attack-probe-2021-09-09 that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
He requested an injunction blocking the National Archives, a federal agency that holds his White House records, from complying with the committee's requests for hundreds of pages of documents.
Jesse Binnall, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump quickly filed a court notice indicating he would appeal the decision.
The committee has said it needs the requested materials to understand the role Trump may have played in fomenting the riot.
""That's a big deal,"" U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House of Representatives select committee, said in an interview on CNN. ""I look forward to getting this information. I look forward to our investigators going through it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our government was not weaponized against its citizens."" 
Chutkan said Trump had not acknowledged ""the deference owed to"" President Joe Biden's determination that the committee could access the materials.
""His (Trump's) position that he may override the express will of the executive branch appears to be premised on the notion that his executive power ‘exists in perpetuity,'"" Chutkan said. ""But Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.""
Trump gave an incendiary speech before the assault on the Capitol, repeating his false claims that the November 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging his supporters to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal."" 

His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's election victory. Biden, a Democrat, took office on Jan. 20.
About 700 people face criminal charges stemming from the riot.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. government agency on Tuesday said 13 senior members of former President Donald Trump's administration violated a law that limits political campaigning by government employees, faulting them for creating a ""taxpayer-funded campaign apparatus"" within the White House.
In a 65-page report https://osc.gov/News/Pages/21-02-Hatch-Act-Report-RNC.aspx, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) identified instances in which Trump advisers, including Jared Kushner and Kellyanne Conway, used their official authority to promote Trump's 2020 presidential election campaign.
A spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
OSC said discipline was ""no longer possible"" because the Trump administration officials have left office, but said it was issuing the report to highlight enforcement challenges and to deter future violations. 
""Taken together, the report concludes that the violations demonstrate both a willingness by some in the Trump administration to leverage the power of the executive branch to promote President Trump's reelection and the limits of OSC's enforcement power,"" OSC said in a news release.
“This failure to impose discipline created the conditions for what appeared to be a taxpayer-funded campaign apparatus within the upper echelons of the executive branch,” OSC wrote in the report.
OSC is an independent federal watchdog within the U.S. government that investigates violations of the Hatch Act, a law limiting the political participation and speech of federal employees.
The report was the culmination of an investigation that began while Trump was in office following his decision to hold the 2020 Republican National Convention at the White House.
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf both violated the Hatch Act by appearing at the political convention, the report found. Wolf's consulting firm and Pompeo's political action committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The report said several Trump advisers — including Kushner, Conway, and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows — violated the Hatch Act by criticizing now-President Joe Biden's campaign during media appearances.
Representatives of Kushner and Meadows did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol said on Tuesday it had issued subpoenas seeking documents and testimony from more associates of former President Donald Trump, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.
The 10 people subpoenaed include White House aides and other officials, including some senior officials, who the committee said were around Trump as thousands of his supporters marched on the seat of the U.S. government as then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress met to certify the Republican president's defeat in the November 2020 election.
U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House of Representatives select committee, said in a statement that it wants to ""learn every detail of what went on in the White House"" on Jan. 6 and the days immediately preceding the attack.
""We need to know precisely what role the former President and his aides played in efforts to stop the counting of the electoral votes and if they were in touch with anyone outside the White House attempting to overturn the outcome of the election,"" Thompson said.
The committee asked those subpoenaed to produce documents by Nov. 23 and to appear for depositions behind closed doors from late November until mid-December.
Trump said in a statement that the subpoenas were politically motivated from a select committee of ""politically ambitious hacks.""
The panel has now issued at least 35 subpoenas and received testimony from more than 150 witnesses. It had announced six https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-16-committee-issues-subpoenas-trump-associates-2021-11-08 - for Trump associates including top aides from the Republican's failed 2020 re-election campaign - on Monday. 
More than 670 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812 and the only time power in the United States has not been transferred peacefully.
Trump has filed suit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-hear-trump-bid-stonewall-us-capitol-riot-investigation-2021-11-04 to avoid turning over White House documents and urged former aides to reject panel subpoenas, claiming the right to withhold information because of executive privilege, a legal principle that protects many White House communications. 
Legal experts have disputed his claim that the principle applies. 
The House voted last month to hold longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon in contempt https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-edges-toward-contempt-charges-against-trump-aide-bannon-2021-10-21 over his refusal to cooperate. The Department of Justice has not yet said whether it would pursue criminal contempt charges against Bannon.

Among the others subpoenaed were John McEntee, who was White House personnel director, and Christopher Liddell, a White House deputy chief of staff.
The former Trump aides could not immediately be reached for comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House and Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday condemned an anime video tweeted by Republican congressman Paul Gosar that depicted him swinging swords at President Joe Biden and killing Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
""This should not be happening, and we should be condemning it,"" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called on a congressional ethics panel and law enforcement officials to investigate. 
""Threats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States must not be tolerated,"" Pelosi said in a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's office did not respond to requests for comment.
The 90-second video shared by Gosar on Sunday appears to be an altered version of a Japanese animated series.
A House Ethics Committee staff official declined to comment.
One ethics expert said that threatening behavior could violate both House ethics rules and federal criminal statutes. 
""He is putting his real feelings out there, and his real feelings look very threatening,"" said Craig Holman, ethics lobbyist for Public Citizen. 
Under House rules, ethics violations can result in reprimands, fines, censure or removal from office. Threats can also constitute felony violations punishable by imprisonment. 
But Gosar appeared unbowed. ""I will always fight for the rule of law, securing our borders and defending the America First agenda,"" the lawmaker said in a statement.
The Arizona Republican, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, voted against certifying Biden's 2020 election victory in January, has backed Trump's claims of a stolen election and has described Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 as ""peaceful patriots."" 
Twitter added a warning label to the video, saying it violated its ""hateful conduct"" policy. It also restricted engagement with the tweet. But Twitter said in a notification attached above the tweet that it had determined ""it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""
Ocasio-Cortez responded to Gosar's tweet with a Twitter https:// thread noting the video posted by a ""creepy member I work with,"" and said she expected no consequences for Gosar from the House Republican leader. 

Other Democrats called for Gosar to leave office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol issued subpoenas seeking documents and testimony from six more associates of former President Donald Trump, including top aides from his re-election campaign.
They are William Stepien, manager of the Republican president's 2020 re-election campaign; Jason Miller, senior adviser to the campaign; Angela McCallum, national executive assistant to the campaign; John Eastman, an attorney for Trump; Michael Flynn, who was briefly Trump's national security advisor, and Bernard Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives Select Committee wants those subpoenaed to sit for depositions scheduled for between Nov. 30 and Dec. 13.
The panel has now issued 25 subpoenas and received testimony from more than 150 witnesses. More subpoenas are expected as soon as this week.
The subpoenas announced on Monday focus on Trump associates believed to have strategized about ways to overturn the results of the November 2020 election, including those who spent time at a ""command center"" at Washington's Willard Hotel set up to steer efforts to deny Democrat Joe Biden his victory.
Eastman in particular has been under intense scrutiny. He spoke at the Jan. 6 rally where Trump gave a fiery speech alleging election fraud and urging supports to march on the Capitol. Eastman also wrote a memo outlining how, in his view, then-Vice President Mike Pence could thwart formal congressional certification of Trump's re-election loss. Pence ultimately declined to follow Eastman's advice.
""In the days before the January 6th attack, the former president's closest allies and advisors drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Select Committee, said in a statement.
""The Select Committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all,"" Thompson said. 
HUNDREDS OF ARRESTS
Miller declined comment. Kerik issued a statement accusing the committee of deciding to ""publicly defame"" him and demanded that it retract its press release. The other Trump associates could not immediately be reached for comment or did not respond.
More than 670 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol as Congress and Pence were to certify Biden's defeat of Trump. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812 and the only time power in the United States has not been transferred peacefully.
Trump has filed suit to avoid turning over White House documents and urged former aides to reject panel subpoenas, claiming the right to withhold information because of executive privilege, a legal principle that protects many White House communications. 
Legal experts have disputed his claim that the principle applies. 
The House voted last month to hold longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon in contempt over his refusal to cooperate. 
Four people died the day of the assault, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught, and four officers have since taken their own lives.

The Select Committee was created by House Democrats against the wishes of most Republicans. Two of its nine members - Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger - are Republicans who joined House Democrats in voting to impeach Trump in January on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack in a fiery speech to supporters earlier that day. 
Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected his claims that Biden won because of election fraud.

693,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 09:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard was interviewed for the top job at the U.S. central bank when she visited the White House last week, according to people familiar with the discussions, signaling that Chair Jerome Powell has a serious rival as President Joe Biden considers who will lead the Fed for the next four years.
Powell and Brainard are the only people who have publicly surfaced as being in the running for chair. Powell’s current term in that post expires in February and Biden said on Nov. 2 that he’d make a decision “fairly quickly.” Bloomberg News has previously reported that Brainard was also under consideration for the position of Fed vice chair for supervision.
The White House and Fed both declined to comment.
Biden’s scope to reshape the leadership of the Fed widened further on Monday when Governor Randal Quarles announced he would step down before the end of the year. Quarles’ tenure as vice chair for supervision expired in October, but he could have stayed on as a governor until 2032 and his exit hands Biden another slot to fill.
In addition to the seat vacated by Quarles, Vice Chair Richard Clarida’s term as a governor expires at the end of January and there is an open position on the seven-seat board.
A large majority of economists polled by Bloomberg News expect Biden will renominate Powell.
But the White House has raised the possibility with some Senate Banking Committee members that Powell might not be reappointed, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Discussing the chairmanship with Brainard could signify that the Biden team is weighing how a break with Powell might help advance their goals for the central bank. Brainard and Powell work closely together on multiple issues and are viewed as holding similar views on monetary policy, but she’s favored a tougher stance on big banks.
Appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014, Brainard is currently the only Democrat serving on the Fed Board, and as a governor she leads some of the Fed’s most critical initiatives. She is governor overseeing financial stability surveillance at the Fed, and payments -- an area where the central bank is now innovating with the development of an instant transaction system and consideration of a digital currency.
With a Ph.D. from Harvard University, Brainard is viewed as a highly competent and experienced macroeconomist. She also co-authored new language on the Fed’s longer-run strategy that redefined the full employment mandate to a broad and inclusive goal.

A U.S. federal appeals court issued a stay Saturday freezing the Biden administration's efforts to require COVID-19 vaccines for workers at U.S. companies with at least 100 employees or weekly tests, citing ""grave statutory and constitutional"" issues with the rule.
The ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes after numerous Republican-led states filed legal challenges against the new rule, which is set to take effect on Jan 4.
""We think we people should not wait,"" said White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked what employers should do. ""It is important and critical to do, and waiting to get more people vaccinated will lead to more outbreaks and sickness.""

An average of about 1,100 Americans are dying daily from COVID-19, most of them unvaccinated. COVID-19 has killed over 757,000 people in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday that Republicans in the 2022 congressional elections should focus on the alleged misdeeds of Democrats rather than on former President Donald Trump, saying the campaign should not be ""about the past.""
At an appearance in Covington, Kentucky, the top Senate Republican said his party's strong showing in elections in Virginia, New Jersey and other states last week demonstrated voter concerns about the direction of the country under President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress. 
""The key to ’22 is to have a discussion with the American people about how they feel about the new administration and the Democratic Congress and what they're doing,"" said McConnell, who argued that voters reject the $1.75 trillion social-policy and climate-change legislation that Democrats are now trying to pass in the House of Representatives and Senate. 
Asked if the Republican playbook would be to keep Trump at arm's length during next year's campaign, he said: ""The election will be about the future, not about the past.""
The elections will determine which party sets the agenda in Congress during the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Republican hopes of reclaiming majorities in both chambers have surged since last Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-jolt-biden-with-win-virginia-close-race-new-jersey-2021-11-03, when Republican Glenn Youngkin won Virginia's governorship. 
Youngkin's victory has raised questions about the future role for Trump, who falsely claims the 2020 election was stolen from him through massive voter fraud.
The Virginia Republican won back moderates who had supported Biden over Trump only a year ago, partly by distancing himself from the former president. 

But Trump seems unlikely to fade into the political background. Over the weekend, he lashed out at McConnell and other Republicans who supported the $1 trillion infrastructure https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-sweeping-infrastructure-social-spending-bills-finally-get-vote-2021-11-05 bill that passed the House on Friday after months of delay, calling them ""RINOs"" - a term meaning ""Republican in name only.""

Biden on Saturday called the bill a once-in-a-generation investment. The House of Representatives approved the package on Friday after months of bitter fighting among Democrats. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill, which had passed the Senate in August, would fund a massive upgrade of America's roads, bridges, airports, seaports and rail systems, while also expanding broadband internet service.
The bill will create jobs by modernizing roads and bridges and transforming the transportation system, Biden said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -After a daylong standoff, Democrats set aside divisions between progressives and centrists to pass a $1 trillion package of highway, broadband and other infrastructure improvement, sending it on to President Joe Biden to sign into law.
The 228-to-206 vote late on Friday is a substantial triumph for Biden's Democrats, who have bickered for months over the ambitious spending bills that make up the bulk of his domestic agenda.
Biden's administration will now oversee the biggest upgrade of America's roads, railways and other transportation infrastructure https://www.reuters.com/world/us/roads-bridges-airports-details-bidens-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-11-05 in a generation, which he has promised will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness.
Democrats still have much work to do on the second pillar of Biden's domestic program: a sweeping expansion of the social safety net and programs to fight climate change. At a price tag of $1.75 trillion, that package https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/whats-bidens-175-trillion-build-back-better-package-2021-11-05 would be the biggest expansion of the U.S. safety net since the 1960s, but the party has struggled to unite behind it. 
Democratic leaders had hoped to pass both bills out of the House on Friday, but postponed action after centrists demanded a nonpartisan accounting of its costs - a process that could take weeks. 
After hours of closed-door meetings, a group of centrists promised to vote for the bill by Nov. 20 - as long as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that its costs lined up with White House estimates. 
""Welcome to my world. This is the Democratic Party,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier in the day. ""We are not a lockstep party.""
The $1.75 trillion bill cleared a procedural hurdle by a vote of 221 to 213 early on Saturday, which will enable Democratic leaders to quickly schedule a final vote when the time comes.
The standoff came just days after Democrats suffered losses in closely watched state elections, raising concerns that they may lose control of Congress next year.
The infrastructure bill passed with the support of 13 Republicans, fulfilling Biden's promise of passing some bipartisan legislation. The phrase ""infrastructure week"" had become a Washington punch line during his predecessor Donald Trump's four years in the White House, when plans to focus on those investments were repeatedly derailed by scandals.
""Generations from now, people will look back and know this is when America won the economic competition for the 21st Century,"" Biden said in a statement.
AIM TO MOVE FORWARD
The party is eager to show it can move forward on the president's agenda and fend off challenges in the 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans will seek to regain control of both chambers of Congress, which they lost to the Democrats under Trump.
Congress also faces looming Dec. 3 deadlines to avert a politically embarrassing government shutdown and an economically catastrophic default on the federal government's debt.
With razor-thin majorities in Congress and a united Republican opposition, Democrats need unity to pass legislation.
The infrastructure bill, which passed the Senate https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-infrastructure-idTRNIL1N2PH1MA in August with 19 Republican votes, would fund a massive upgrade of America's roads, bridges, airports, seaports and rail systems, while also expanding broadband internet service.
The ""Build Back Better"" package includes provisions on child care and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration. 
It would bolster the credibility of Biden's pledge to halve U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 during the U.N. climate conference https://www.reuters.com/business/cop taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. 
Republicans uniformly oppose that legislation, casting it as a dramatic expansion of government that would hurt businesses.
""This is potentially a very black day for America,"" said Republican Representative Glenn Grothman, who characterized the legislation's child-care and preschool provisions as a ""Marxist"" effort to have the federal government raise children.

The nonpartisan U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the social-spending bill would raise $1.48 trillion in new tax revenue over the next decade, short of its $1.75 trillion cost.
Pelosi and other top Democrats have said that fails to account for increased tax enforcement and savings from lower prescription drug prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former top Justice Department official Jeffrey Bossert Clark on Friday declined to testify before a U.S. House of Representatives panel seeking to question him about allegations that he tried to help ex-President Donald Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election.
In a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Clark's lawyer said his client's conversations with Trump are confidential and privileged.
""Mr. Clark is subject to a sacred trust,"" his attorney Harry MacDougald wrote in a letter to House Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson. He said Clark's advice to Trump is protected by executive privilege, a legal doctrine that keeps some White House communications confidential.
""Any attempts- whether by the House - or by the current President - to invade that sphere of confidentiality must be resisted,"" he wrote, noting that Clark ""cannot answer deposition questions at this time.""
U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the select committee, called Clark's claim of privilege and refusal to answer questions unacceptable. 
""He has a very short time to reconsider and cooperate fully. We need the information that he is withholding and we are willing to take strong measures to hold him accountable to meet his obligation,” Thompson said in a statement.
Clark, former acting head of the Civil Division and former Assistant Attorney General of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, has come under scrutiny after several people said he encouraged Trump to oust former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Rosen and others said Clark wanted to be installed himself, so he could launch investigations into Trump's false election fraud claims.
In sworn interviews to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Rosen and his former deputy Richard Donoghue told lawmakers that Clark met with Trump behind their backs and repeatedly pressured them to send letters to Georgia and other swing states urging them to convene legislative sessions to contest the presidential election results.
Rosen and Donoghue refused Clark's requests. Trump then considered ousting Rosen and installing Clark, but he was dissuaded after discovering that all of the Justice Department's remaining assistant attorneys general would resign en masse if Clark were to be appointed.
The House Select Committee, which is investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, subpoenaed Clark as part of a broader effort to understand what Trump did to try to stay in power.
Clark's actions are now also under investigation by the Justice Department inspector general, and they are the subject of at least three ethics complaints filed by the Washington D.C.'s Office of Disciplinary Counsel.
Clark is the latest person to defy a request by the House Select Committee to provide testimony, following on the heels of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives on Oct. 21 recommend criminal charges against Bannon, who served as chief strategist for the Republican former president, for refusing to testify in the committee's investigation. 
The Justice Department will decide whether to bring criminal charges against Bannon.

Youngkin, a Republican former private equity executive, defeated former Governor Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday after running a campaign in which he made ""election integrity"" one of his issues.
While Youngkin kept former Republican President Donald Trump at a distance in an attempt to win over moderates offended by Trump's style, his promotion of ""election integrity"" was coded language to appeal to voters who erroneously believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.
Youngkin's 17-year-old son attempted to vote at a polling station inside the Great Falls Library on Tuesday afternoon and showed his driver's license as proof of identity, the Post reported, citing an interview with the precinct captain there, Jennifer Chanty.
She told the young Youngkin he was ineligible to vote until he was 18 and offered to help him register for a future election, but he declined and walked out, the Post said. 
He returned 20 minutes later and tried once again, saying he had a 17-year-old friend who was allowed to vote, but he was again turned away, the Post said.
The teenager broke no laws because he represented himself truthfully and caused no disruption, officials told the Post.
A spokesman for Youngkin characterized reports on the matter as ""opposition research on a 17-year-old kid"" that was being pushed by political opponents who were ""mad that they suffered historic losses this year.""

Youngkin's son ""honestly misunderstood Virginia election law and simply asked polling officials if he was eligible to vote; when informed he was not, he went to school,"" spokesman Devin O'Malley wrote in a statement, the Post reported. 
Fairfax County officials reported the incident in a statement, the Post said. Fairfax County officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for the statement.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Texas on Thursday over a state law that places strict curbs on voting by mail, in the latest effort by the Biden administration to combat new voting restrictions being enacted in Republican-controlled states across the nation.
The department's lawsuit takes aim at Texas Senate Bill 1, which was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in September, saying it violates voters' rights.
The Texas law makes it tougher to cast ballots through the mail by preventing officials from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications. 
It also adds new identification requirements for mail-in voting, prohibits drive-through and 24-hour voting locations, limits early voting, and restricts who can help voters requiring assistance because of disabilities or language barriers. 
The Justice Department complaint alleges that the Texas law improperly restricts disabled voters or voters who cannot read or write from being able to receive adequate assistance at voting locations.
""The challenged provisions will disenfranchise eligible Texas citizens who seek to exercise their right to vote, including voters with limited English proficiency, voters with disabilities, elderly voters, members of the military deployed away from home, and American citizens residing outside of the country,"" the complaint says. 
Abbott has previously defended the law, saying it is aimed at clamping down on voter fraud. Texas officials have previously cited Trump's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in their opposition to expanding voting access. 
On Thursday afternoon, Abbott responded to lawsuit in a tweet, saying ""Bring it. The Texas election integrity law is legal. It INCREASES hours to vote. It does restrict illegal mail ballot voting. Only those who qualify can vote by mail. It also makes ballot harvesting a felony. In Texas it is easier to vote but harder to cheat.""
BIDEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
This is now the second time that the Biden Justice Department has sued a state over voting rights. 
Earlier this year, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the department was filing a lawsuit against the state of Georgia https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-sue-georgia-over-restrictive-new-state-voting-law-source-2021-06-25 after it enacted a new election law that the Justice Department said infringes on the rights of Black voters.
Georgia has asked a judge to dismiss that lawsuit, saying in a court filing that it was ""not a serious legal challenge but a politically motivated effort to usurp the constitutional authority of Georgia’s elected officials to regulate elections.""
This marks the third legal challenge by the Justice Department to Texas state laws and executive orders since Biden took office in January.
Earlier this week, the Supreme Court heard oral https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hears-challenges-texas-near-total-abortion-ban-2021-11-01arguments after the department sued Texas over its near-total ban on abortions.

In the summer, the department also sued Texas to block an executive order aimed at curbing the travel into the state of undocumented immigrants who may pose a risk of transmitting COVID-19.
In August, a judge issued a preliminary ruling in favor of the Biden administration, saying Abbott's executive order ""conflicts with, and poses an obstacle to, federal immigration law.""

(Reuters) -A former senior Trump administration Justice Department official will testify on Friday before the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, a congressional aide familiar with the probe said.
Last week, the House of Representatives Select Committee delayed testimony by Jeffrey Clark because he had retained a new lawyer.
Clark did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As with previous witnesses, Clark's testimony will be behind closed doors.
The congressional aide spoke on condition of anonymity.
Clark, the former acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, was a proponent of Trump's unfounded claims that Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November 2020 election was the result of fraud.
On Oct. 13, the committee announced it had issued a subpoena to Clark asking him to produce records and testify at a deposition by Oct. 29. 
In announcing it had subpoenaed Clark, the panel said it needed to understand all the details about efforts inside the previous administration to amplify misinformation about election results.
In January, the Justice Department's inspector general announced his office was launching an investigation into whether Clark plotted to oust then-Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen so he could take over the department and help pursue Trump's baseless claims by opening an investigation into voter fraud in Georgia.

A U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee report found Clark also drafted a letter he wanted Rosen to approve which urged Georgia to convene a special legislative session to investigate voter fraud claims.
Clark's plan ultimately failed after senior department leaders threatened to resign in protest, the Senate investigation found.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The political rebuke voters delivered to Democrats in Virginia has not given the White House second thoughts about President Joe Biden's ambitious policy agenda but is making some Democrats in swing states nervous.
Since the Republican victory in the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday, the White House message to Democrats facing competitive elections has been simple: Pass the social spending and infrastructure bills soon, or face defeat in the more consequential battle to keep control of the House of Representatives and Senate in 2022, according to administration officials and allied Democrats.
Voters are ""upset and uncertain,"" Biden said on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-returns-sobering-virginia-upset-democrat-battle-congress-2021-11-03, when asked about the Virginia result.
Democratic congressional leaders are seeking to pass a $1.75 trillion budget bill and $1 trillion infrastructure bill this week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi answered: ""No"" when a reporter asked whether the Virginia outcome would cause her to throttle back on Biden's ""Build Back Better"" legislation.
There was still no action on possible votes on Thursday, as worries persisted, especially among moderate Democrats, about whether the bills include the right mix of social spending, taxes and climate programs to provide political cover in next year's elections.
Democratic Representative Jared Golden of Maine is one of several moderates who will not vote for the social spending bill without an estimate confirming it is fiscally responsible from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
He expressed concern on Wednesday that the bill's tax provisions, including a credit for parents, are not sufficiently targeted to low-income people.
Centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a major roadblock to getting Biden's agenda passed, reiterated on Wednesday that Democrats should ""take our time"" on the spending bill, which has already been cut back from an original $3.5 trillion price tag.
A New Jersey Democratic consultant who works on congressional races said Democrats ""need to pass infrastructure as soon as humanly possible and start from scratch on a spending bill and run as far away from the left as they can.
""If somebody has, especially in New Jersey, the gumption or wherewithal to side with Manchin, they are going to be a lot better off,"" said the consultant, requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly.
New Jersey Democratic Governor Phil Murphy won re-election on Tuesday in an unexpectedly close contest in a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million.
AN EYE TOWARD 2022
For their part, liberal Democratic lawmakers are telling the White House they want more social programs and tax hikes on the wealthy in the spending package as well as action on voting rights, immigration and gun rights even if it means barreling past Republicans, who are united in opposition to such measures.
An even more vocal group of Democratic moderates has been in regular touch with White House policy and political aides amid concerns that while many of the proposals poll well, the sheer size of the package could give Republicans political ammunition at the polls next year.
Still, most Democrats expressed confidence publicly in the Biden agenda's power to improve the party's political standing once it is passed.
In a New Jersey district that Republican then-President Donald Trump narrowly carried in 2020, Democratic Representative Andy Kim said constituents are focused on the coronavirus pandemic, the need to repair 40 structurally deficient bridges, delivery of broadband services to rural areas and ""how do we get back to work.""
He said in an interview that the latter issue ties directly into Biden's proposed social investments that include federal benefits to help defray the high costs of childcare so that parents can hold down jobs.

Democratic Representative Matt Cartwright, whose Pennsylvania district is considered a toss-up next year, said that once the two bills are enacted and voters realize the benefits from them, poll numbers will rise for Biden and congressional Democrats.
""The current issues are evanescent,"" Cartwright said. ""They go away. By the time of the 2022 election, they will be a distant and dim memory.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge questioned Donald Trump's lawyers on Thursday about their effort to hide hundreds of pages of his White House records from a House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot by a mob of his supporters.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is considering the Republican former president's arguments that phone call records, visitor logs and other materials requested by the Democratic-led committee should be kept confidential.
Chutkan said at the end of the two-hour hearing that she would issue a written decision ""expeditiously."" 
""This is not only a monumental argument, but it's one that will have consequences down the line for generations,"" Trump lawyer Justin Clark said in his opening remarks.
Clark said the committee's requests were invalid because they were unrelated to any legislation being considered by Congress.
Chutkan signaled skepticism of that argument, saying ""the Jan. 6 riot happened in the Capitol"" so Congress had an interest in investigating the attack.
Chutkan seemed particularly inclined to let the committee see Trump's visitor logs from his final weeks in office.
""We're not talking about your client's banking records from before he became president,"" the judge said to Clark. ""We're talking about documents that are quintessentially about government business.""
In a potentially positive development for Trump, the judge said some of the committee's document requests ""seem to be very, very broad"" and may need to be narrowed.
Chutkan asked House lawyer Douglas Letter why the committee needed Trump campaign polling data from as early as April 2020.
Letter said the data would shed light on when and why Trump decided to amplify false claims that the November 2020 election was rigged against him. But Chutkan responded that there ""must be some limit"" to the documents the committee can seek.
Trump on Oct. 18 sued the nine-member select House committee, arguing that the requested materials were covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-trump-use-executive-privilege-block-jan-6-attack-probe-2021-09-09 that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
The committee requested the materials from the U.S. National Archives, which holds the records.
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, and Republican Representative Liz Cheney, its vice chair, said in a statement after the filing of the lawsuit that Trump was seeking to ""delay and obstruct"" the investigation.
""It's hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election,"" Cheney and Thompson said.
Trump gave an incendiary speech before the deadly riot repeating his false claims that the November 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urging his supporters to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to ""stop the steal."" His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Joe Biden's election victory. Biden entered the White House on Jan. 20.
The committee has said it needs the requested materials to understand the role Trump may have played in fomenting the riot. It has said the requests are within its powers and driven by the legislative purpose of understanding the facts and causes surrounding the riot and developing legislation to guard against a similar assault in the future.
About 700 people face criminal charges stemming from the riot.

The House on Oct. 21 voted to hold Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, in contempt of Congress https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-edges-toward-contempt-charges-against-trump-aide-bannon-2021-10-21 for refusing to cooperate with the investigation, citing Trump's insistence - disputed by some legal scholars - that his communications are protected by executive privilege. 
The Justice Department must now decide whether to bring criminal charges against Bannon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hoping to retake both houses of Congress in elections a year from now, Republicans plan to follow a strategy Glenn Youngkin used to win Virginia's governor's race, making schools the front line in U.S. culture wars, several lawmakers said on Wednesday.
Youngkin, a former  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc chief executive, defeated former Governor Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday, partly by focusing on - and fueling - parental anger over the way schools have addressed race and gender and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The approach belies the criticism Republicans faced under former President Donald Trump for seeking cuts in education and trying to pay for a proposed Trump border wall with Mexico using funds budgeted for schools and childcare centers.
Several leading Republicans said on Wednesday they valued a campaign message aimed at parents. 
""The one thing you will find is, the Republican Party will be the party of education,"" said House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. He said House Republicans would soon roll out a ""parents' bill of rights.""
Republicans have been heartened by Youngkin's victory in Virginia, a state that has drifted toward Democrats in recent years, and by strong Republican performances in other states on Tuesday.
Democrats hold razor-thin majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate. Historical trends and President Joe Biden's flagging poll numbers give Republicans an advantage in next year's contest to determine which party controls Congress.
McCarthy predicted that more than 70 Democratic-controlled House seats will be competitive next year.
    Youngkin latched onto concerns from parents that schools are teaching left-wing ideas to fight racism at the expense of more traditional subjects.
    He vowed to ban the teaching of ""critical race theory,"" a legal framework that examines how racism shapes U.S. laws and policies. Virginia school officials say critical race theory as a subject is not taught in classrooms.
Republicans also tried to direct anger over schooling at Biden's emerging $1.75 trillion social-spending and climate-change legislation, which offers universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.
""Democrats should listen to the voters. Drop this reckless taxing and spending spree,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a floor speech on Wednesday.
Democrats dismissed the Republican rhetoric.

""Republicans can say it shows Democrats are overreaching, and Democrats can say it shows we should have enacted this prior to the election and run on it,"" said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. ""Everybody has an easy spin here.""
Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said the Youngkin message on education resonated with parents who became immersed in schooling issues during months spent at home with their children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

709,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 04:12PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican lawmakers introduced legislation on Thursday seeking to provide $2 billion per year and other assistance to bolster's Taiwan's defenses as it faces rising pressure from China.
The legislation, reviewed by Reuters, would authorize $2 billion a year in Foreign Military Financing - U.S. grants and loans that enable countries to purchase weapons and defense equipment produced in the United States - through 2032 for the self-ruled island.
While the bill is sponsored only by Republicans, the minority party in the Senate, it adds to pressure from Congress on Democratic President Joe Biden for bolder action to strengthen ties with diplomatically isolated Taiwan.
The United States is the main military supplier for the democratic island nation. 
The bill's lead sponsor is Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Co-sponsors include Republican Senators Mike Crapo, John Cornyn, Bill Hagerty, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio.
It was not immediately clear how Democrats view the bill. Support for Taiwan is a rare issue that garners bipartisan backing in the deeply divided Senate.
The funding would come with conditions, including Taiwan committing to match U.S. spending, and whether Taipei and Washington agree to conduct joint long-range planning for capacity development.
The United States has urged Taiwan to pursue defense reforms to focus on capabilities to make its military forces more mobile and harder to attack, as well as to ensure it maintains a strong reserve force.
The ""Taiwan Deterrence Act"" also would amend the existing Arms Export Control Act, which governs foreign military sales, to make it easier for U.S. firms to sell arms to Taiwan. It also would require an annual assessment of Taiwan's efforts to advance defense strategy toward China.
The bill also would improve military exchanges with Taiwan and expand professional military education and technical training opportunities in the United States for Taiwanese military personnel.
""The defense of Taiwan is critical to retaining the credibility of the United States as a defender of the democratic values and free-market principles embodied by the people and government of Taiwan,"" the bill's text says.
China recently has ramped up military pressure, including repeated missions by Chinese warplanes near democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force.
Biden has confirmed a ""rock-solid"" commitment to Taiwan and criticized China. Beijing blames Washington's policies of supporting Taiwan with arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait for raising tensions.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Defense in its annual report to Congress on China's military reiterated concern about increasing pressure on Taiwan.
The report renewed concerns about China's development of options to take Taiwan, although a defense official declined to speculate to reporters about whether that scenario was likely or say if the department sees a near- or even medium-term risk of armed conflict.

PRINCETON, N.J. (Reuters) -Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy narrowly fended off an election challenge from Republican former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli, returns showed on Wednesday, a day after voting ended in an unexpected nail-biter for the incumbent.
Murphy, 64, became the first Democratic governor in four decades to win re-election in New Jersey, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million in the densely populated northeastern coastal U.S. state.
The incumbent struck a triumphant but politically inclusive tone in a brief victory speech he delivered at an Asbury (NYSE:ABG) Park convention hall to supporters chanting, ""Four more years!""
""If you want to be governor of all of New Jersey, you must listen to all of New Jersey. And New Jersey, I hear you,"" he told the crowd.
Unofficial returns posted by the Associated Press and cited by the New York Times and other media outlets pronouncing the victory for Murphy showed him clinching 50.03% of the vote, compared with 49.22% for Ciattarelli, with 90% of ballots counted.
There was no immediate word from Ciattarelli conceding defeat, and his campaign spokesperson, Sami Williams, posted a tweet criticizing the media for calling the race when it did.
""With the candidates separated by a fraction of a percent out of 2.4 million ballots cast, it’s irresponsible of the media to make this call when the New Jersey Secretary of State doesn’t even know how many ballots are left to be counted,"" she wrote. 
Murphy has presided over a political shift to the left in the state, including new taxes on millionaires, tougher firearms restrictions, a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave. He has also defended his robust public health measures aimed at curtailing the coronavirus pandemic, which emerged as a key point of contention in the race.
Ciattarelli, 59, who had trailed Murphy by up to 10 percentage points in some opinion polls, capitalized on widespread unpopularity with Murphy's aggressive mask requirements for schoolchildren. 
The Republican had also focused much of his campaign on the state's high taxes, while accusing Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive, of being out of touch with the electorate.
New Jersey has trended steadily Democratic in recent years. The party won 10 of the state's 12 U.S. House of Representatives seats in 2020, and President Joe Biden carried the state over then-President Donald Trump last year by more than 15 percentage points.

Still, Ciattarelli's unexpectedly strong performance in New Jersey, and a Republican victory on Tuesday in Virginia's hard-fought gubernatorial race spelled trouble for Biden's party heading into next year's congressional elections.
Murphy trailed overnight in the returns but squeaked into the lead on Wednesday morning as the tabulation of the vote unfolded in several heavily Democratic counties.

By Catarina Demony
LISBON (Reuters) - As concerns grow over racial bias in artificial intelligence, Black Lives Matter (BLM) co-founder Ayo Tometi urged the tech sector to act fast against perpetuating racism in systems such as facial recognition.
Artificial intelligence is transforming the world and can be applied in diverse sectors, from improving the early detection of diseases to sorting out data and solving complex problems, but there are also concerns around it.
""A lot of the algorithms, a lot of the data is racist,"" U.S. activist Tometi, who co-founded BLM in 2013, told Reuters on the sidelines of Lisbon's Web Summit.
""We need tech to truly understand every way it (racism) shows up in the technologies they are developing,"" she said. 
The tech industry has faced a reckoning over the past few years over the ethics of AI technologies, with critics saying such systems could compromise privacy, target marginalised groups and normalise intrusive surveillance. 
Some tech companies have acknowledged that some AI-driven facial recognition systems, which are popular among retailers and hospitals for security purposes, could be flawed.
On Wednesday, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced it was shutting down its facial recognition system citing concerns about its use. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said last year it would await federal regulation before selling facial recognition technology to police.
Police in the United States and Britain use facial recognition to identify suspects. But a study by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology found the technology is not as accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.
Last year, the first known wrongful arrest based on an incorrect facial recognition occurred in the United States. The United Nations has cited the case, attributed to the fact that the tool had mostly been trained on white faces, as an example of the dangers posed by a lack of diversity in the tech sector.
'SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE'
""They (tech companies) have to be very careful because technology has the ability to expedite values that otherwise would come about more slowly,"" Tometi said. ""But technology speeds everything up so the impact will be worse, faster."" 
Urging software developers to ""pay attention to all details"", she said they should hear Black people more.
""Unfortunately I feel like tech companies have a long way to go to build a bridge with the community,"" she said. 
According to the digital advocacy group Algorithmic Justice League, one of the reasons why AI systems are not inclusive is the predominantly white male composition of developer teams. 
One of the hundreds of AI-driven startups that attended the Web Summit, Europe's largest tech event, was Brazil's NeuralMind, which specialises in product development.
CEO Patricia Tavares echoed Tometi's concerns, saying that although AI brings benefits to society, there was a need for ""legislation to make sure companies use it in a responsible and ethical way"". 
Not far from NeuralMind's stand, the CEO of health tracking platform Revolab, Kalinas Ovidijus, said his startup's market was Nordic and Baltic nations and that most of the data they have access to, provided by local hospitals and health centres, was on white people.

They were unsure if the platform would be able to meet the health needs of people of colour. 
""We need solutions for the future, for future challenges, but those solutions need to be very inclusive,"" Tometi said. ""They need to protect marginalised and vulnerable communities - that's their duty.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Glenn Youngkin's victory in this week's Virginia governor's race could signal that Republicans are poised to seize control of Congress in next year's elections.
Following are five themes to watch ahead of the midterm contests, which will determine whether Democrats can hold onto their slim congressional majorities during the second half of President Joe Biden's term.
EDUCATION
Republicans in Washington are taking notice of Youngkin's success in appealing to voters who disapproved of COVID-19 health rules and how public schools include race and gender issues in their curricula.
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said she expects that her party next year will use the messages that helped Youngkin, such as education.
Across Virginia, Youngkin won higher shares of voters than former President Donald Trump did in 2020 after latching onto concerns from parents that schools are teaching left-wing ideas to combat racism, at the expense of more traditional subjects. 
Youngkin vowed to ban the teaching of ""critical race theory,"" a legal framework that examines how racism shapes U.S. laws and policies. Virginia school officials say critical race theory as a subject is not taught in classrooms.
Rights activists said Republican messaging on education was a cloaked appeal to exploit America's racial tensions.
Youngkin also opposed rules requiring students wear masks in school as a COVID-19 safety measure.
SENATE CONTESTS
The retirement of Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in January following his impeachment, could make the contest for his successor among the most closely fought congressional campaigns. 
In 2020, Biden narrowly won the state but Republicans made gains in the state legislature, and many observers expect next year's Senate race will be a toss-up. Democrats have yet to pick a candidate, with Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, a progressive, and U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, a moderate, seen as front-runners for the party nomination. The Republican field includes military veteran Sean Parnell and real estate developer Jeff Bartos.
In Georgia, also widely expected to be a close race, Trump has already endorsed retired football star Herschel Walker. Trump's pick of a political neophyte could expose a risk Republicans face in following Trump's instincts. Unlike Youngkin, Walker openly supported Trump's false claims of widespread election fraud and urged Georgia's election officials to avoid certifying Biden's victory in the state.
Close U.S. Senate races are also expected in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Ohio and New Hampshire. 
TRUMP'S REVENGE ENDORSEMENTS
Trump has pledged to help Republicans win next year and is also asserting his dominance in the party by endorsing challengers to the small group of Republicans who supported removing him from office for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Already, two Republican incumbents who voted to impeach Trump have dropped out of their races after the former president backed their challengers in party nomination contests. Further exits could signal a consolidation of Trump's control over the party.
Trump also plans to hold rallies across the country to stump for his allies, although if candidates in competitive congressional races take a page from Youngkin's campaign, Trump might need to find new ways to help. Youngkin kept Trump at arm's length as he courted moderate voters.
MODERATE DEMOCRATS
Many key House races will be in suburban districts where moderate Democrats could face Republican attacks in the vein of Youngkin's schools-focused approach.
Of the 43 Democrats who flipped Republican House seats in 2018, 30 remain in office. Most of that largely moderate group is seeking re-election next year and their suburban areas could remain competitive even after state governments redraw congressional district boundaries following the 2020 census.
Signs of an expected close fight include the decisions by some moderates elected in 2018 not to seek re-election. Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona is retiring, while Lamb has embarked on a difficult U.S. Senate run. A surge of Democratic lawmaker retirements in the coming weeks could be a sign the party faces long odds in holding its congressional majorities.
REDISTRICTING
Democrats currently have a tiny 220-212 advantage in the House, and the redistricting process looks likely to yield Republicans a seat or two, according to The Cook Political Report. 

Republicans control many of the state institutions redrawing the congressional district boundaries. Strong population growth in urban areas dominated by Democrats has made it more difficult, however, to draw maps that favor Republicans.
The redistricting process will extend into 2022. Only a handful of states have approved new maps and many will end up in court.

Nides, who is the managing director and vice chairman of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), was confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.

Nides has also held senior positions at other major banks and served as deputy secretary of state for management and resources from 2010 to 2013.

FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) -Republicans pushed Democrats out of the Virginia governorship and came up just short of an upset in heavily Democratic New Jersey on Wednesday, signaling trouble for President Joe Biden's party heading into next year's congressional elections.
In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/republican-youngkins-win-virginia-plots-partys-path-2022-elections-2021-11-03, a former private equity executive, defeated former Governor Terry McAuliffe in Tuesday's vote, with the Democrat conceding on Wednesday morning. Youngkin had distanced himself just enough from former President Donald Trump to win back moderates who had supported Biden only a year ago.
In New Jersey, incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy squeaked by Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans there by more than 1 million. The result had been in doubt until the Associated Press called the race for Murphy on Wednesday evening, sparing the Democrats a humiliating defeat.
Ciattarelli, 59, a former state lawmaker, had trailed by as much as 10 points in some opinion polls but gained ground by criticizing Murphy's unpopular mask requirements for school children.
Both Republican candidates saw strong gains in the suburbs https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/VIRGINIA/gkplgdmzavb from independent voters who had been turned off by Trump's style of politics. The results in states that Biden won easily in 2020 suggest that Democrats' razor-thin majorities in Congress are highly vulnerable in the 2022 elections.
If Republicans gain control of both, or even one, chamber of Congress, the party would win the ability to block Biden's legislative agenda in the final two years of his term.
The Democratic loss in Virginia gives Trump an opportunity to portray it as a repudiation of Biden as the Republican sets the stage for another possible presidential run in 2024.
But Biden, whose approval ratings last week were at the lowest level of his presidency according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national poll, avoided taking direct responsibility for the disappointment.
""People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things, from COVID to school to jobs to a whole range of things and the cost of a gallon of gasoline. And so if I'm able to pass and sign into law my Build Back Better initiative, I’m in a position where you’re going to see a lot of things ameliorated, quickly and swiftly,"" he said.
The top Democrats in Congress vowed to push ahead on Biden's legislative agenda, hoping to pass twin bills worth a combined $2.75 trillion to rebuild roads and bridges as well as bolster the social safety net and fight climate change. They have been held up by months of infighting between progressive and moderate Democrats.
REPUBLICAN ROADMAP
Youngkin, 54, declared victory after a campaign in which he focused on parents' anger over schools' handling of COVID-19, as well as teaching on race and gender issues. He walked a fine line on Trump, taking care not to alienate the former president's hardcore base and not offering a full-throated endorsement of his false claims about widespread 2020 election fraud.
McAuliffe's efforts to paint his rival, a former chief executive of the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, as a Trump acolyte fell flat with voters.
""Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth,"" Youngkin told a rally in Chantilly, Virginia, early on Wednesday.
Republican congressional campaigns may follow Youngkin's model of focusing on culture wars and promising to give parents more control over public schools.
Youngkin and other Republicans latched onto concerns from parents that schools are teaching left-wing ideas to combat racism, at the expense of more traditional subjects.
He vowed to ban the teaching of ""critical race theory,"" a legal framework that examines how racism shapes U.S. laws and policies and is linked to anti-racism concepts such as ""white privilege."" Virginia school officials say critical race theory as a subject is not taught in classrooms.
TRUMP FACTOR
Republicans also appeared to erase the Democrats' 10-seat lead in Virginia's House of Delegates, appearing to gain a 50-50 split or perhaps a one-seat advantage.
Virginia Republicans picked Youngkin in an unusual convention format in May, rather than by a statewide primary. That format was designed to pick a more moderate candidate, rather than one more closely allied with Trump.
Even so, Trump sought to claim credit, thanking ""my BASE"" in a statement for putting Youngkin over the top.
In New Jersey, Murphy, 64, ran as an unabashed liberal and became the first Democratic governor to win re-election in New Jersey in four decades. He sought to strike a tone of political unity in brief victory remarks before cheering supporters at an Asbury (NYSE:ABG) Park convention hall on Wednesday.

""I renew my promise to you, whether you voted for me or not, to work every single day of the next four years to keep moving us forward,"" he said.
Besides hammering Murphy over the governor's aggressive pandemic response, Ciattarelli campaigned on cutting taxes and supporting law enforcement. In an unusual position for a Republican, he supports abortion rights, at least for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee plans an oversight hearing on the airline industry after she asked the major carriers in July to explain worker shortages despite receiving billions in pandemic bailout.
Senator Maria Cantwell, who in July sent letters to the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), told Reuters in an interview Wednesday she plans a hearing tentatively set for Dec. 8 that will include airline participation.
""We're going to continue to do our oversight role and I think the public wants to know,"" Cantwell said.
Congress approved three separate rounds of taxpayer funding totaling $54 billion to pay much of U.S. airlines' payroll costs through Sept. 30 as a result of COVID-19.
Staffing shortages have recently hit American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), as they ramp up flights ahead of the holiday season but face hurdles finding enough pilots and flight attendants.
Airline unions did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday but the head of Southwest's pilots union Casey Murray told the Dallas Morning News last month the airline had said it was reducing its fall schedule to account for staffing shortages, but since added flights resulting in problems. 
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, declined comment on the upcoming hearing.
Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson told Cantwell's committee Wednesday the difficulties with some airline operations are ""due more to changes in consumer behavior"" like a jump in leisure travel. ""They probably don't have as much buffer in their schedule as they had previously,"" he added.
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told customers https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1456027335111725056?s=20 Wednesday it gradually added flights back even if it meant ""sacrificing some possible short-term profits to ensure a reliable operation.""
Cantwell's letters asked questions about ""workforce shortages, flight cancellations, and delays, creating havoc and frustrating consumers as more Americans resume travel.""
In the letters, Cantwell said at best each airline ""poorly managed its marketing of flights and workforce as more people are traveling, and, at worst, it failed to meet the intent of tax payer funding and prepare for the surge in travel that we are now witnessing.""

Airlines were not allowed to issue involuntary layoffs or cut worker pay as part of government assistance.
Cantwell asked the airlines in July, which also included Republic Airways and Allegiant Airlines, for answers about workforce management, and steps to address anticipated or current labor shortages due to increased consumer flight demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Wednesday confronted a sobering defeat for Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election, and new pressure to resolve Democratic bickering and pass his social and climate agenda. 
In Virginia's closely watched election for governor on Tuesday, Republican newcomer Glenn Youngkin defeated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/too-close-to-call-virginia-governors-race-headlines-us-elections-2021-11-02 Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a state Biden won by 10 points in the presidential election a year ago. 
The loss raised red flags for Democrats over midterm elections in November 2022 that could see them lose control of Congress, making it tough for Biden to advance his agenda in the second half of his presidency. 
Biden told reporters the results were a sign that voters are unsettled. 
“People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things, from COVID to school to jobs to a whole range of things and the cost of a gallon of gasoline. And so if I'm able to pass and sign into law my Build Back Better initiative, I’m in a position where you’re going to see a lot of things ameliorated, quickly and swiftly.""
He said it would have helped if the legislation had passed before Election Day but that not necessarily would have changed the outcome.
Inside the White House, officials took the results as a sign they need to get bills through Congress immediately, and that Democrats need a stronger message than ""We're not Donald Trump."" 
Biden returned from a Europe trip early on Wednesday to the same struggle he has faced for months: Trying to resolve a bitter dispute between progressive and moderate Democrats over an estimated $1.75 trillion social spending plan and $1 trillion infrastructure bill.
Now, though, the stakes are higher. 
""If voters are frustrated with inaction, the obvious response is to be more decisive and pass bills based on an agenda for the middle class that received a record-breaking 81 million votes last year,"" said a person familiar with White House thinking. ""Doing less is plainly the opposite of what people want."" 
Republicans had not won a statewide race in Virginia since 2009. That win foreshadowed congressional election results the following year, in which Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives when Biden was vice president. 
Republicans waged a cultural war https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-governors-race-could-show-way-republican-congressional-campaigns-2021-11-01 partly against ""critical race theory,"" a concept taught in mostly in law schools and universities that maintains racism is ingrained in U.S. law and institutions and that legacies of slavery and segregation have created an uneven playing field for Black Americans. 
Asked how Democrats should fight claims the theory is being taught in elementary schools in coming elections, Biden said, ""Well I think that we should produce for the American people.""
Democrats, who sought to link Youngkin to former President Donald Trump, are relying on Biden's spending package to bolster support. The party's progressive wing and moderate senators from West Virginia and Arizona need to agree for that to happen.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told CNN that Democrats' inability to approve the infrastructure bill and give McAuliffe a talking point on the campaign trail contributed to his defeat.
“I think it was on the shoulders of Democrats here who have the majority,” he said. “People had a lot of hope for Joe Biden and the Joe Biden agenda, but Democrats didn't want to give Biden a win,"" he said.
McAuliffe's loss showed there are limits to the use of Trump in Democratic campaigns, the person close to the White House said. 
""It’s incumbent on Democrats to be loud and clear about what we’re for, affirmatively and not just run against Donald Trump,"" the source said.
'CATASTROPHIC' INACTION 
Some Democrats are looking uneasily at Biden's declining approval numbers, which could hurt midterm candidates and may have affected the Virginia race. Reuters-Ipsos' latest polling https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa shows 44% of Americans approve of Biden, down from nearly 60% early in his presidency. 
""It would be catastrophic for us not to start passing some legislation immediately,"" said Democratic strategist Bud Jackson.
""I'm confident that if we can get this stuff passed, the economy starts to turn around and the supply chains improve, there are opportunities for Biden's poll numbers to improve. But they're not going to recover until we get this passed,"" he said. 
A new Reuters-Ipsos poll https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/akpezadwqvr, conducted Friday to Monday, found that 51% said the Democratic-led plan would affect them personally in a positive way, while 26% said it would have a negative impact.

Overall, 56% said they supported the plan as they understood it, while 29% opposed it. Some proposed elements of the plan are even more popular https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/movanjxaapa, including expanding the Medicare healthcare program for seniors and offering universal prekindergarten.
Democrats inched closer to a deal on Tuesday, agreeing to measures they say will lower prescription drug prices, a top wish for many voters.

(Reuters) - Eric Adams, the next mayor of New York City, has his work cut out for him.
The largest U.S. city is in the midst of a halting recovery from a coronavirus pandemic that killed more than 34,000 residents and erased half a million jobs, all while grappling with deep-seated issues such as crime, income inequality and a lack of affordable housing.
""We're having tough times. But winners want the ball when the game is on the line,"" Adams told MSNBC on Wednesday, after cruising past Republican Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday's election to become New York City's second Black mayor. ""We need to move now to make sure we create a safe environment for our city, and on that foundation we can build upon.""
The scale of his challenge is immense. 
The city's unemployment rate in September was 8.9%, double that of some other U.S. metropolitan areas, according to the state's labor department. The return-to-office rate in New York - the country's largest economic center - is also lower than in most other cities.
The city's vital tourism industry remains battered, though visitors from abroad, who spend more than domestic tourists, will finally be allowed back into the United States starting next week as COVID-related travel restrictions ease.
They will encounter a city struggling to address a homelessness crisis exacerbated by the pandemic and higher crime rates. Murders are up more than 40% and shooting incidents have doubled since the same point in 2019, though crime still remains much lower than in the 1980s and 1990s.
Adams, who takes office on Jan. 1, has promised a more moderate approach than his liberal predecessor, Bill de Blasio, in numerous areas, including policing, education and business.
The former police captain put public safety at the center of his campaign, arguing that the city could never fully rebound economically unless it first addressed a spike in violent crime.
He proposed increasing patrols on the subway system to curb assaults and at one point suggested he might return to a limited form of stop-and-frisk, a strategy that a federal judge found illegally targeted minorities.
But he also has said he will increase diversity in the police department's senior ranks, including hiring a female commissioner for the first time, and will not tolerate misconduct.
""He does understand police officers and policing, and the mindset of the NYPD, in ways that no mayor has ever understood it,"" said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. ""He understands that nuance.""
MORE BUSINESS-FRIENDLY
Adams was backed by several major labor unions during the crowded Democratic nominating contest earlier this year. The self-described ""blue-collar"" New Yorker, who grew up poor in the city, has frequently vowed to give voice to the working class and people of color he says have been forgotten.
However, he is also widely seen as far more business-friendly than de Blasio, who often took aim at Wall Street. Adams' campaign took in significant money from wealthy executives, and he spoke often of working closely with big business to help the city recover.
In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, he said he would seek to strengthen ties between City Hall and business leaders. 
""Let's hit reset. We understand we did not have a good relationship,"" Adams said.
Business leaders hope Adams' more conciliatory tone will help drive investment to the city.
""He both understands the critical role that business plays as a source of jobs, tax revenues and economic activity, and he wants to make it as easy and attractive as possible to run a business and put people to work in the city,"" said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the pro-business Partnership for New York City. ""It's a complete reversal of what had been an historic anti-business policy.""
Adams has expressed support for charter schools and said he would preserve the city's gifted program, which critics say funnels predominantly white students into better schools at the expense of Black and Latino children.
Adams also seems likely to work closely with New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over when Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations. At Adams' victory party on Tuesday, Hochul told supporters his election would launch a ""new era of cooperation.""

Cuomo and de Blasio famously feuded for years over issues large and small, and they did little to hide their mutual disdain.
Perhaps Adams' most innovative policy proposal is a new ""MyCity"" app, a clearinghouse portal that his campaign said would allow any New Yorker to access every city service he or she is entitled to, from food stamps to housing to childcare.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday approved legislation calling for more sanctions and other punitive measures to ratchet up pressure on Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega just days before an election there that Washington has denounced as a sham.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill 387-35 with strong bipartisan support following a similar vote by the Senate this week, sending it to President Joe Biden to sign into law.
Congressional action ahead of Sunday’s Nicaraguan election comes amid Ortega’s crackdown on opponents and critical media. 
The arrests of dozens of opposition politicians, including presidential hopefuls, all but guarantees Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla, will win a fourth consecutive term and tighten his grip on the Central American nation while facing increasing international isolation.
The bill calls for sanctions on Nicaraguans deemed responsible for unfair elections, increased coordination of such measures with the European Union and Canada and expanded U.S. oversight of international lending to Managua.
The White House did not immediately respond to a question of whether Biden would sign the legislation, which was introduced by Senator Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But U.S. officials have made clear the president takes a favorable view of many of its provisions.
Known as the RENACER Act, it also requires U.S. government reports on alleged corruption by the Ortega family, human rights abuses by security forces and Russian activities in the country, including military sales.
In addition, the Biden administration is asked to conduct a formal review of Nicaragua’s participation in the Central America Free Trade Agreement, which gives preferential treatment to the region’s exports to the United States.
The Biden administration is already preparing new sanctions that could be levied in response to the election, U.S. officials told Reuters. This would add to sanctions and U.S. travel bans already imposed on dozens of officials.

Ortega said in June that sanctions would not deter him and his government was upholding the law by arresting people conspiring against him. He accused Washington in July of trying to undermine the elections.
Washington has already begun a review of Nicaragua’s membership in the CAFTA-DR trade accord, a senior State Department official told Reuters last week. But U.S. officials would face legal obstacles to any suspension of Nicaragua and are mindful this could hit its struggling economy and possibly spur further migration north to the U.S.-Mexico border.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday failed to advance voting-rights legislation for the fourth time this year due to overwhelming Republican opposition, raising potential ramifications for the 2022 congressional and 2024 presidential elections.
The Senate voted 50-49 in favor of starting debate on the ""John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act"" but fell short of the 60 votes needed under a procedural blocking maneuver known as a filibuster. Named for the late civil rights activist and congressman, the legislation would restore state voting requirements to prohibit racial discrimination that were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013. 
Senator Lisa Murkowski was the only Republican out of 50 to vote with Democrats on advancing the voting rights bill.
Following the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attacked the widespread use of filibusters by minority Republicans to stop Democratic legislation.
Possibly hinting at a change in Senate rules to circumvent the tactic, at least for some legislation, Schumer said: ""We will continue to fight for voting rights and find an alternative path forward."" 
Democrats have made election reform a priority in light of Republican state-balloting restrictions passed in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election. At least 19 states have passed laws making it harder to vote, according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.
Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the laws will make it harder for Black and Hispanic voters - important Democratic Party voting blocs - to cast ballots.
Hours before the vote, Schumer urged Republicans to support debate on the measure and promised a robust amendment process by which they could alter the legislation.
""Across our beloved democracy something indeed is not right. Something malicious is afoot. A lie, a terrible lie spread by the former president of the United States is eating away corrosively at the foundations of our democracy,"" the top Senate Democrat said in a floor speech.
But the chamber's top Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the voting rights measure was little different from legislation rejected by Senate Republicans on three earlier occasions, noting that it would still give the federal government sway over state management of elections. 

""The Senate will reject this go-nowhere bill today, just like we've rejected every other piece of fruit from the same poisonous tree,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. 
President Joe Biden said last month that Democrats should ""fundamentally alter the filibuster,"" after Republicans blocked a bill to thwart restrictive state laws. Moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have objected to its elimination. It was not clear whether they potentially could back reforms that would be short of eliminating the procedure.

Brown declared victory, claiming a fifth four-year term, and thanked his supporters after local media reported Walton had won 41% of the vote while 59% of the votes were for ""write-in.""
The write-in votes, however, will still need to be checked to confirm that Brown's name has been indicated.
""At the very beginning, they said we couldn't win, it was impossible to win as a write-in. But you can't ever count a Buffalonian out,"" Brown said to applause from his supporters.
Walton, however, was not ready to concede.
""This is definitely not a concession speech,"" local TV station WIVB quoted Walton as saying, adding that she said it was still unclear who the ""write-ins"" were.
Asked by WIVB if he thought the number of write-in votes for Brown was greater than the number of votes for Walton, Brown answered: ""That is correct."" 

Walton, a democratic socialist, community activist and nurse, made national headlines when she won the Democratic primary in June over Brown, who has served as the first African-American mayor of New York state's second-largest city since 2005.
But with no Republican on the ballot, Brown, 63, campaigned as a moderate alternative to the 39-year-old Walton, urging voters to write his name on their ballots.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement and security agencies believe domestic extremists, notably white supremacists, pose a violent threat in the United States similar to that of Islamic State militants, top U.S. security officials told Congress on Wednesday.
Concern about racially motivated domestic extremists had prompted the FBI to elevate the threat to a level equal with that posed by the Islamist militants, said Timothy Langan, the assistant director who heads the counterintelligence division.
Langan told a House Intelligence subcommittee the Federal Bureau of Investigation had detected a significant increase in the threat of violence from domestic extremists over the last 18 months. 
He said the bureau was conducting around 2,700 investigations related to domestic violent extremism, and there had been 18 lethal attacks targeting U.S. religious institutions in which 70 people had died in recent years.
The FBI has engaged with tech companies regarding their role in fueling extremism, has successfully disrupted planned acts of violence and will continue to ""try to close the gap"" on its inability to legally decode encryptions on mobile phones.
John Cohen, acting undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis in the Department of Homeland Security, told the subcommittee that racial superiority and ""hatred of immigrants"" were major threat concerns. 
He said his department believes the biggest domestic threat is posed by lone offenders and small groups indoctrinated in extremist ideology. The threat is fueled by a blend of extremist beliefs and personal grievances, he said.

Cohen noted that domestic extremists conduct so much discussion openly on social media that covert collection of intelligence on the threats they pose may often not be necessary to spot the threats. 
Some Republican members of the House subcommittee suggested U.S. spy agencies should not be collecting information on U.S. political activity unless there is a connection to foreign actors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats promised voters sweeping drug price reform in their signature social spending bill, but agreed to move ahead with a far less ambitious proposal after facing opposition from centrist dissenters in Congress.
The plan could still fail as hurdles remain to approving the broader spending package, known as ""Build Back Better."" Should it survive, the plan would authorize the federal government to negotiate drug prices for the first time. 
WHAT WAS AGREED?
The drug pricing agreement allows the federal government's Medicare health insurance program for the elderly to start in 2023 negotiating the prices on 10 of the costliest drugs for diseases such as cancer and diabetes that have only one supplier, with the new prices taking effect in 2025. The number of drugs that will be subject to Medicare negotiations will increase annually until it reaches 20 in 2028.
The government will select from a list of drugs it spends the most on in Medicare Part B, which covers physician-administered drugs such as infusions and most injectables, and Part D, which covers most prescription drugs sold at pharmacies.
Conventional prescription drugs are protected from negotiation for the first nine years after they are launched. More complex biologic drugs, which are made from living cells, are protected for 12 years.
Drugmakers that refuse to negotiate will owe an excise tax.
The agreement introduces a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for people 65 or older, sets a $35 monthly cap on insulin prices, and penalizes companies that raise prices faster than inflation for Part B and D drugs as of Oct. 1, 2021. The inflation cap also applies to private insurance markets.
WHAT HAD BEEN PROMISED?
The agreement leaves out significant provisions from the drug price reform framework Democrats adopted, a law known as The Lower Drug Costs Now Act introduced by Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey.
That bill would have empowered the government to negotiate the price of insulin and the 250 single source brand-name drugs that Americans spend the most on. Crucially, it extended the negotiated prices to those covered by private insurance.
It would have also capped prices at 120% of the average price in other wealthy countries and allow the government to fine drugmakers who refuse to negotiate, fail to agree on a price, or overcharge after agreeing on a price.
Unlike the current agreement, its inflation cap would have also reversed previous price increases by on drugmakers through a one-time retroactive rebate to the government.
WHY DID IT FAIL?
Republicans oppose allowing the government to negotiate drug prices, echoing the pharmaceutical industry's main argument that federal pressure on prices would lead companies to curb investment in research and kill innovation. They have supported efforts to bring more competing drugs into the market, including cheaper generic versions, as a way to bring down prices.
They were joined in their opposition to The Lower Drug Costs Now Act by dissenting Democrats, some of whom advocated alternative scaled-back reforms. Several of those Democratic lawmakers are among the largest recipients of industry campaign donations.
Four centrist House Democrats - Scott Peters of California, Kathleen Rice of New York, Kurt Schrader of Oregon, and Stephanie Murphy of Florida - voted against the bill.
It also faced opposition from Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Democrats have razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress; one senator or three representatives are enough to kill a bill.

Peters and Schrader introduced their own drug price reform bill, The Reduced Costs and Continued Cures Act, which covered Medicare Part B drugs only and would have generated lower savings. Rice and Murphy backed it. 
The final agreement between the White House and congressional Democrats is largely based on it, but expands it to make Medicare Part D drug prices negotiable and add other provisions like the insulin and inflation caps. Peters, Rice, Schrader, Murphy, Menendez and Sinema all back it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Glenn Youngkin's upset victory in the Virginia governor race is likely to embolden and energize Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. 
In edging out Democrat Terry McAuliffe, Youngkin may have provided a model for Republican candidates in 2022, while Democrats must now fret over President Joe Biden's sagging approval ratings and stalled agenda in Congress. 
Here are some takeaways from Youngkin’s victory: 
As Biden struggles, so does his party
Biden and his Democrats have had a rough year. The spread of COVID-19 and pockets of resistance to vaccines continue. The military pullout from Afghanistan was widely viewed as chaotic and mismanaged. 
The president has struggled to cohere moderates and progressives around his big-ticket legislative agenda. At the same time, prices for consumer goods, food and fuel have shot up – with voters largely blaming the party in power.
Youngkin capitalized on those troubles, running up the score in rural Virginia and squeezing McAuliffe’s margins in critical suburban areas. While Biden won independents handily in 2020, 57% to 38%, Youngkin won them 54% to 45%, according to CNN exit polls.
McAuliffe, a former governor, brought his own baggage to the race. A well-known figure in Virginia with strong ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, he did not give voters the fresh voice that political newcomer Youngkin offered.
But the losses by McAuliffe and other down-ballot Democrats in a state Biden won by 10 percentage points in November - along with a closer-than-expected New Jersey governor's race - left no doubt that Democrats are now in a weaker position.
Signs are pointing to substantial Republican gains next year, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster.
“Every survey number we are seeing paints a bleak picture for President Biden and Democrats in Congress,” McInturff said.
It remains Trump's party
Youngkin worked hard to separate himself from Donald Trump, but the former Republican president's influence was felt nonetheless.
While Youngkin largely steered clear of endorsing Trump’s bogus claims that he lost last year’s elections due to fraud, he still made sure to back the principle of “voter integrity.” On Wednesday, Trump took credit for Youngkin's win, citing the electoral strength of his passionate base. 
Trump can point to Virginia as a repudiation of Biden while he sets the stage for another possible presidential run in 2024. And now his Republican Party has shown that it might be able to attract some of the suburban voters and independents it lost in the election last year, as long as Trump allows more centrist candidates in the mold of Youngkin to run their own races without constantly pledging fealty to him. 
At the same time, Republicans in more conservative regions remain free to run on Trump's MAGA platform with little risk of blowback. All together, it could make for the kind of coalition that seizes Congress for the party next year.
A non-Trump lane does exist
Even with the long shadow Trump and his false stolen-election claims continue to cast over the Republican Party, Youngkin showed how to keep his distance from Trump without incurring his wrath.
A former CEO of the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), Youngkin ran as an outsider businessman rather than a Trump acolyte. Unlike Trump, Youngkin was a full-throated advocate of vaccines, even as he opposed mandates. He avoided the scorched-earth rhetoric on issues such as immigration that Trump favors. He refused to cast doubt on the trustworthiness of the U.S. election system for fear of dampening turnout. 
While Trump endorsed him multiple times, Youngkin resisted a full embrace to the point that Trump ultimately did not come to the state to campaign on his behalf. 
Youngkin “is providing a model” for Republicans, said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia. “He has separated himself pretty well.” 
No one was hoping Trump would come to the state more than McAuliffe, who spent much of his campaign trying to tie Youngkin to Trump at every turn. It didn’t work. Exit polls by NBC showed voters viewed Youngkin much more favorably than Trump, who remains unpopular in the state. 
Even Trump took note. ""All McAuliffe did was talk Trump, Trump, Trump and he lost!,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. ""I guess people running for office as Democrats won’t be doing that too much longer.""
The culture wars around education are potent
Youngkin gained momentum in the race by focusing on education https://www.reuters.com/world/us/culture-war-education-rages-virginia-governors-race-2021-07-22, a strategy Republicans likely will mimic nationally next year as schools have become ground zero for several U.S. culture wars. 
The Republican seized on tensions between parents and school boards over policies for COVID-19 school closures and safety protocols, gender issues and the teaching of “critical race theory” – a term misused to describe antiracism curricula that Youngkin said was evidence that school districts were drifting too far leftward. 
McAuliffe may have made the largest mistake of the campaign when, at a debate, he said, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” The remark soon became a centerpiece of Youngkin attack ads – and the issue as a whole may have resonated with scores of suburban parents frustrated after seeing their children kept at home for more than a full school year during the pandemic.

Voters who believed parents should have a lot of say over what schools teach went for Youngkin 76% to 23%, according to CNN exit polls. Conversely, of the voters who listed the virus as their top concern, 83% went for McAuliffe and just 17% for Youngkin, CNN said. 
“Youngkin’s massive overperformance was tied to the issues of schools - and an uprising from parents, who became overnight homeschoolers,” said Doug Heye, who worked as a top aide to Eric Cantor, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.

726,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden returned to the U.S. from summits in Europe with his economic agenda still stuck in Congress and his party’s political fortunes darkened by an electoral defeat in Virginia. 
The two bills comprising his agenda, a $550 billion Senate-passed public works measure and a larger package of tax and spending policies he calls “Build Back Better,” are stalled while Democrats hammer out details on health care, immigration, taxes and other issues.
Meanwhile, voters in Virginia delivered a rebuke to the president and his party, electing Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor in a state Biden won by 10 points. In New Jersey, the outcome of Governor Phil Murphy’s re-election fight against a Republican challenger was too close to call, despite a big lead in polls for the Democratic incumbent and close Biden ally as recently as September.
The results suggest public dissatisfaction with the trajectory of the country and with Biden’s presidency. The economy has slowed due to persistent coronavirus transmission, defying the president’s pledge to contain the pandemic, while he has been unable to secure passage of his own legislative agenda. 
His approval rating has fallen significantly, to about 43% of Americans, according to an analysis of polls by FiveThirtyEight.
Biden declared before boarding Air Force One for Rome last week that he’d reached a deal on his agenda, calling it a “historic economic framework.” But in the days since, it’s become clear that his party remains divided over the multi-trillion-dollar plan.
‘Back on Track’
West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a key centrist, on Monday suggested he might not support the legislation, before saying Tuesday that “we’ll get this back on track.”
“I believe Joe will be there,” Biden said of Manchin in a news conference at a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday. “I think we’ll get this done.”
The president also incorrectly predicted that the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor, Terry McAuliffe, would defeat Youngkin.
Biden has made clear to Democrats that passing the two bills comprising his economic agenda are vital to the party’s political prospects in 2022 and beyond. Congressional Democrats have been sparring for months over details of “Build Back Better,” with liberals pushing for more spending and tax increases as centrists try to pare back the measure.
The election results may strengthen the hand of the moderates, who have grumbled that progressives in their party seek to push the country further left than most voters prefer.
Virginia Democrats pleaded with Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to at least clear the infrastructure measure for the president’s signature ahead of the election, warning that the squabbling suggested to voters their party can’t govern. Liberals in the House blocked a vote.
On Thursday, before leaving for Europe, the president characterized the discussions as all but concluded. “No one got everything they wanted, including me, but that’s what compromise is,” he said after revealing his “framework” for the legislation.
Continuing Negotiations
But the negotiations continued in the last five days while Biden met with world leaders in Rome and Scotland on crises including climate change and supply-chain breakdowns. “I can’t think of any two days where more has been accomplished dealing with climate,” Biden said Tuesday, after announcing plans to reduce U.S. methane emissions and increase reforestation at the summit.
Democrats have lately debated whether to include a provision in the legislation aimed at reducing prescription drug prices, revisit paid family leave -- a program dropped from the package last week -- and lift a cap on federal income tax deductions for state and local tax payments, among other issues.
The tax debate, known as SALT, is especially fractious among Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading progressive, said Tuesday he would oppose a five-year repeal of the cap -- a proposal from centrists in high-tax northeastern states. 
Sanders called their plan “beyond unacceptable,” labeling it “more tax breaks to the very rich.”
And the timetable for action on Biden’s domestic agenda is again slipping. Congressional leaders and some liberals had hoped for votes this week, but Manchin said that he isn’t in a hurry.
‘Get It Done’
“It is really critical that we get it done, and I don’t like these deadlines. Let’s just get it done when it gets done before the end of the year,” said Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii.
Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said that if liberal House Democrats had agreed in September to clear the $550 billion Senate-passed infrastructure legislation, the “Build Back Better” plan would probably already be law as well.
“And we’d be in a better place in Virginia,” he said. “Clearly showing we can make progress would have been nice.”
It is not clear whether Manchin or the other Senate holdout on “Build Back Better,” Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, support Biden’s framework.
Manchin told reporters Tuesday he had only just received the latest draft of climate provisions for Build Back Better and had not seen the details of a proposal to reduce prescription drug prices. Manchin said he is “looking at everything” before adding, “it’s going to be a while.”
Delayed Arrival 
The legislative chaos loomed heavy over the president’s Europe trip from the start, with Biden’s ill-fated visit to Capitol Hill on Thursday to announce his “framework” agreement pushing back what had been planned as an early morning departure from Washington past noon. As a result, the president didn’t arrive at Villa Taverna, the fifteenth-century ambassador’s residence where he was staying in Rome, until after 2:30 a.m. on Friday morning. 
There was little rest to come. Leaders and diplomats worked late in the night in Rome on climate provisions of the G-20 communique, only to produce a watered-down declaration that echoed previous commitments and failed to include a push on domestic coal sought by some European nations. While Biden sought to spin a corresponding provision committing nations to cease financing coal projects in other nations as a breakthrough, he faced questions about whether his failure to secure his domestic agenda before departing had weakened his hand.
The president both acknowledged and tried to downplay the credibility gap -- though he often only seemed to accentuate it.
He acknowledged world leaders’ skepticism about the ability of the U.S. to follow through on its commitments, and said his “administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words.”
He predicted his economic agenda would pass before the end of the week, only to concede skeptics “may turn out to be right.” 
Generic Enthusiasm
He shot reporters a thumbs-up when asked if he had secured commitments from Sinema and Manchin to vote for the bill, only for the White House then to issue a statement saying he was exhibiting generic enthusiasm for its prospects. 
After an early morning flight from Rome to Glasgow, the jet lag appeared to set in. Biden’s eyes closed during introductory remarks at the climate summit for 32 seconds, until an aide ran to his seat to get his attention -- earning derisive coverage in Scotland and a mocking rebuke from former President Donald Trump.
The trip was not without its successes: foreign leaders warmly embraced him, in marked contrast to his predecessor. He and French President Emmanuel Macron quashed a spat over Australia’s decision to spurn Paris for a nuclear submarine deal with the U.S. and U.K., and a tariff deal on steel and aluminum offered a major trade victory that addressed not only climate concerns but rising inflation back at home.
The president was also clearly moved by his extended audience with Pope Francis, speaking of his personal bond with the Catholic leader.
But even Biden admitted to reporters that his attention -- and, he suspected, theirs too -- was focused on the legislative and political battles back home.

(Reuters) -Democrat Eric Adams won New York City's mayoral race on Tuesday on promises to boost public safety and give voice to working-class residents, drawing on his experience as a police captain and as a Black man who experienced police brutality as a youth.
Adams, the Brooklyn borough president since 2014, will become the city's second Black mayor after easily defeating Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol.
The 61-year-old Adams takes over in January from Democrat Bill de Blasio, who was term-limited after eight years in office.
Adams will face the task of overseeing the largest U.S. city's nascent recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, as well as confronting wealth inequality, the lack of affordable housing and struggling public schools.
He had been expected to win handily in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. 
""We are so divided right now, and we're missing the beauty of our diversity,"" Adams told supporters on Tuesday night. ""Today we take off the intramural jerseys and we put on one jersey, Team New York.""
Adams' victory could give President Joe Biden's Democrats some signs of where voters stand as the party strives to maintain a fragile alliance between progressives and centrists in Washington.
Adams prevailed in the party's primary election with a coalition that resembled, in some ways, the voters who helped elevate Biden to the Democratic nomination in 2020, especially his support among more moderate Black voters.
Progressives worry Adams will cater too much to the real estate industry, a powerful lobby that gave generously to his campaign.
Democrat Alvin Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday, the Associated Press projected, making him the first Black person to lead one of the country's highest-profile prosecutor's offices. 
Bragg will inherit the criminal investigation into the business empire of former President Donald Trump, a probe initiated in 2018 under the current district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., who is retiring.
RIGHT ON 'STREETS,' NOT 'TWEETS'
Adams has not been shy about suggesting that his triumph can serve as a blueprint for national Democrats. He has been dismissive of critics of his agenda on the left who he says do not speak for mainstream Democrats.
""I say that it's time for us to stop believing that we should have the right tweets. We should have the right safe streets,"" Adams told CNN after winning the party's nomination in July.
Portraying himself as a ""blue-collar"" New Yorker, he said working-class Democrats had been ignored by the party's more liberal wing.
Perhaps no issue has animated Democrats more in the past year than policing, after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis sparked months of demonstrations across the country.
But a spike in crime has prompted mayoral candidates across the country to call for more investment in policing, not less, as public safety has risen to the top of many voters' list of concerns.
Adams has argued the city cannot make a full economic recovery without addressing violent crime. He bluntly rejected the ""defund the police"" movement as a product of left-wing activists. 
Instead, he has sought to strike a balance between calling for more aggressive policing and vowing reforms, including more diversity in the department's senior ranks.
His personal story helped lend credence to his words. Adams has spoken of being beaten by police officers as a teenager. While a member of the New York City Police Department, Adams developed a reputation as an activist after co-founding 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, an advocacy group that spoke out against police brutality.

Adams, who secured key union backing, is seen as labor-friendly. He has also said he will work to connect more low-income residents with city services they are eligible for but do not use.
Adams, who has acknowledged having his eye on City Hall for decades, has sometimes been accused of altering his persona for political expediency. He switched to the Republican Party for several years before running successfully for the state Senate as a Democrat, and he has described himself as both a progressive and a moderate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican Glenn Youngkin's victory in the Virginia governor's election on Wednesday could provide his party with a blueprint for how to retake majorities in Congress next year by wooing suburban moderates without alienating Donald Trump's supporters.
The former private equity executive's approach of rallying parents angry about the way schools have handled COVID-19 and teach about racism and gender may serve as a model for Republicans across the country.
Next year's midterm elections will determine which party controls the U.S. Congress for the last two years of President Joe Biden's term. Democrats have razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate. Control of even one chamber would allow Republicans to block most Democratic legislative priorities.
Youngkin trailed Democratic former Governor Terry McAuliffe in opinion polls for most of the race, but that gap narrowed to a dead heat in the final weeks, at the same time Biden's job approval rating fell to the lowest levels of his presidency. 
Youngkin, 54, walked a fine line on the false claims by Trump, the former president, that his election defeat in 2020 was the result of widespread fraud, avoiding the topic himself but campaigning with Republican state Senator Amanda Chase who has embraced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-republican-tries-thread-needle-election-fraud-claims-2021-10-12 them.
He also backed Republican arguments that school curriculums that discuss racism are promoting ""critical race theory https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/what-critical-race-theory-means-why-its-igniting-debate-2021-09-21,"" a law school concept that maintains racism is ingrained in U.S. law and institutions and that legacies of slavery and segregation have created an uneven playing field for Black Americans. 
Schools say they do not include the theory in elementary and high school curriculums, but are trying to respond to the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population.
""We're going to embrace our parents, not ignore them,"" Youngkin told supporters shortly after U.S. media projected he had won the election. ""We're going to press forward with a curriculum that listens to parents' input.""
At the same time, Youngkin worked to avoid turning off Virginia's moderate voters whose growing numbers - especially in the Washington suburbs - have swung the Southern state Democratic in the past four presidential elections.
'TRICKY PATH'
Youngkin's victory may provide a template for Republicans in competitive congressional races next year. 
""It's a tricky path,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Kondik said Youngkin deftly distanced himself from Trump while also making pledges to improve election integrity as a way to appeal to Trump voters.
The contest was important enough for Democrats that Biden and former President Barack Obama visited the state to campaign for McAuliffe, 64, in its final weeks. Previously, Virginia had elected just one Republican governor in the past two decades and Democrats also control both houses of the state legislature.
Schools were a major focus for Youngkin, who opposes COVID-19 safety rules requiring that masks be worn in Virginia's classrooms as well as anti-racism education.
Campaigners have brawled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/partisan-war-over-teaching-history-racism-stokes-tensions-us-schools-2021-06-23 at school board meetings over the anti-racism issue, prompting the FBI https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-defends-efforts-step-up-monitoring-threats-school-boards-2021-10-05 to step up its response to threats against board members.
A former chief executive of  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, Youngkin also pledged to be tough on crime, rounding off a basket of issues observers see as tailored to Trump supporters without turning off suburban moderates.
McAuliffe tried to link Youngkin closely to Trump, running television ads that juxtaposed his opponent's calls for better election security with images of Trump and the U.S. Capitol riot.

But Youngkin parried those attacks, saying last month it was ""weird and wrong"" when people at a rally supporting him pledged allegiance to a flag carried by Trump supporters at the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the seat of the U.S. government. 
Trump struck a relatively moderate tone when he called in to a pro-Youngkin tele-rally on Monday, telling voters that Youngkin would protect suburbs, while making no mention of his past warnings that Virginia's election could be marred by fraud. Youngkin did not participate in the rally.

FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - Republicans won the Virginia governor's election and were within striking distance in New Jersey on Wednesday, a warning that President Joe Biden's Democrats are in trouble heading into next year's congressional elections.
Glenn Youngkin, a former private equity executive who surged in the polls in the Virginia campaign's final weeks, beat Democratic former Governor Terry McAuliffe, CNN and NBC projected. Youngkin declared victory in a speech before ebullient supporters, while McAuliffe did not publicly concede.
Having never held elected office, Youngkin sold himself as a political outsider while seeking to rally suburban voters around hot-button issues such as how to handle the discussion of racism in schools and COVID-19 mask mandates.
In New Jersey's closer-than-expected governor race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli and incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy were locked in a virtual draw, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million. Democrats clung to hope because more votes were due to be counted in their strongholds.
The results in two states that Biden won easily last year over Donald Trump represent a dire sign for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterms, which will decide control of the U.S. Congress – and with it, the future of Biden's policy agenda.
Polls leading up to Election Day showed that Youngkin closed the gap with McAuliffe by appealing to independent voters - a group alienated in 2020 by Trump's style of politics but more drawn to Youngkin's congenial manner - despite McAuliffe's attempts to link Youngkin to the former president.
""Comparing him to President Trump really didn't resonate with me,"" Jacob McMinn, a program manager at a defense contractor, said after casting his vote for the Republican in Fairfax, just outside Washington. 
White women voters, who favored Biden over Trump by one point in 2020, preferred Youngkin by 57% to 43% over McAuliffe, according to NBC's exit polls.
Trump sought to claim credit for Youngkin's victory.
""I would like to thank my BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning,"" he said in one of three statements about the race on Tuesday.
Youngkin, speaking in Chantilly, Virginia, early on Wednesday, called his victory ""a defining moment.""
""Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth,"" he told the cheering crowd. ""And friends, we are going to start that transformation on Day 1.""
Youngkin will succeed Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat. Under Virginia state law, governors cannot serve consecutive terms. McAuliffe, 64, served as governor from 2014 to 2018.
The Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and state attorney general were also leading their races in Virginia, while Democrats were in a tough fight to keep control of the state House of Delegates after several Republican wins. The state Senate, which Democrats control, did not have a vote.
MINNEAPOLIS POLICE
Murphy, 64, was seeking to become the first Democratic governor to win re-election in New Jersey in four decades.
He has overseen a shift to the left, including new taxes on millionaires, stricter rules on guns, a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave. He has also defended his robust approach to the coronavirus pandemic, including mandating masks in schools.
Ciattarelli, 59, a former state lawmaker, focused much of his campaign on the state's high taxes, while accusing Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive, of being out of touch.
Elsewhere, Brooklyn Borough President and former police Captain Eric Adams, a Democrat, ensured he will become New York City's second Black mayor after easily beating Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian street patrol.
A year and a half after George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by a white policeman, Minneapolis voters rejected a ballot measure that would have replaced the police department with a new public safety agency. 
Virginia's race offered a preview of what may be in store in next year's elections. Culture wars dominated the campaign, with Youngkin promising to give parents more control over how public schools handle race, gender and COVID-19 protocols, and McAuliffe vowing to protect abortion access and voting rights.
Youngkin struck a careful balance when it came to Trump, accepting the former president's endorsement but avoiding frequent mention of him on the campaign trail. The strategy could offer a road map for Republicans trying to woo suburban moderates next year.
Youngkin leaned into the Republican Party's expressions of outrage over the discussion of systemic racism in schools. He vowed to ban the teaching of ""critical race theory,"" a legal framework that examines how racism shapes U.S. laws and policies, while ignoring the fact that Virginia school officials say the subject is not taught in classrooms.

He drew sharp criticism from Democrats when he initially hesitated to denounce Trump's insistence that the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from him, false claims that have continued to rile Trump's supporters and led to a mob of them attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 
Youngkin said later that Biden had won legitimately, but then called for an audit of Virginia's voting machines, prompting Democrats to accuse him of validating Trump's election conspiracy theories.

(Reuters) - Gun control advocacy group Giffords sued the National Rifle Association on Tuesday for allegedly violating campaign finance laws since 2014.
The powerful gun lobby made as much as $35 million in ""unlawful"" and ""unreported in-kind campaign contributions"" to seven federal candidates, including candidates for U.S. Senate in 2014, 2016, and 2018, and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to the allegations.
The lawsuit seeks several forms of relief, including an order preventing the NRA from violating the Federal Election Campaign Act in future, and a penalty equal to the amount of money allegedly spent unlawfully, which the NRA would pay to the U.S. treasury - potentially as much as $35 million.
The lawsuit was filed by campaign finance watchdog Campaign Legal Center on behalf of Giffords in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
The NRA said the lawsuit was ""as misguided as it is transparent"". 
""Another premeditated abuse of the public by our adversaries — who will stop at nothing in their pursuit of their anti-freedom agenda,"" the NRA said in a statement. 
""Suffice to say, the NRA has full confidence in its political activities and remains eager to set the record straight"".

New York's attorney general said in August that the NRA had failed to root out rampant internal corruption.
The association had sought to use Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reincorporate in Republican-dominated Texas and escape what it called a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York, where it was founded in 1871.

""I want to express my thanks to the doctors and nurses at Howard University for giving me the best of service,"" said Jackson, who had a bandage on the left side of his forehead and was surrounded by medical professionals. 
""One of the tendencies when you have Parkinson's is it affects your speech and your stability, so I fell and I came to the hospital, really, more for a check up than anything else.""
Jackson has been a leader of the U.S. civil rights movement since the mid-1960s and was with Martin Luther King when he was assassinated in 1968.
Howard University announced on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday that Jackson was taken to the hospital by a university administrator.
Broadcaster CNN said the results of Jackson's medical tests proved normal, and hospital officials decided to keep him overnight for observation. 
Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a group founded by Jackson, confirmed https://cnn.it/2ZS90jN to CNN that he fell and hit his head on entering a campus building. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Jackson said he planned to continue meeting with university leaders and student protesters, who are demanding better living conditions on campus, in an effort to resolve the dispute. 
Jackson was hospitalized in August after testing positive for COVID-19. He unsuccessfully sought to become the first Black presidential nominee of a major party when he ran in the Democratic Party's primaries twice in the 1980s.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican U.S. senators on Tuesday called for a Senate vote on the National Defense Authorization Act, saying the nearly $780 billion national security policy bill was delayed by Democrats' focus on issues like social programs and climate change.
The NDAA is closely watched by a broad swath of industry and other interests, as it determines everything from how many ships are bought to soldiers' pay and how to address geopolitical threats.
Lawmakers take pride in the legislation having become law every year since 1961, saying it reflects their support for the military. Because it is one of the only major bills to become law annually, they also use it as a vehicle for legislation on issues from competition with China to cyber policy.
""We are in the most dangerous position we have ever been in terms of what China is doing,"" Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told a news conference blasting Senate Democratic leaders for failing to schedule a vote.
Representative Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters at the Capitol he considered the Senate's failure to pass the bill to date an unfortunate error.
""You can mark me down as extraordinarily frustrated,"" Smith said.
Spokespeople for Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed did not respond to requests for comment.
President Joe Biden's Democrats have been focused on passing two major bills https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congress-november-agenda-not-faint-heart-2021-11-01, one expanding social programs and addressing climate change, and another on strengthening infrastructure.
The House passed its NDAA in September. Once the Senate passes its version, the measure would go to conference to settle differences before a final vote in both chambers.

While this year's Senate vote will be later than usual, the NDAA has survived challenges before. Republican former President Donald Trump vetoed it last December, largely over a provision to strip the name of Confederate generals from military bases.

737,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats aren’t planning to include a measure raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of President Joe Biden’s estimated $1.75 trillion tax-and-social-spending bill, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. 
The stance would remove one avenue for averting a showdown with Republicans over the debt ceiling in the coming months that could lead to the U.S. missing payments to workers, beneficiaries or bondholders. Republicans led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have vowed not to cooperate on another short-term debt-ceiling suspension as they did last month and say Democrats must raise the limit on their own given their significant spending plans. 
Adding a debt-ceiling increase to the Biden bill, which may see a House vote this week, could have resolved any uncertainty over a potential U.S. payment default sometime between December and February.
Under Senate rules, the budget reconciliation vehicle that Democrats are using to advance Biden’s economic agenda could also be used to raise the debt ceiling. Addressing the issue in this way would let Democrats, if they stay unified, pass the measure without any Republican votes and avoid a GOP filibuster. 
“At this point in time there is not an expectation that it will be in this reconciliation bill,” Hoyer told reporters. “We should be dealing with it in a bipartisan way.”
House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said lawmakers could still use the budget reconciliation route at a later time to bypass the filibuster. Under Senate rules, Democrats can amend the fiscal 2022 budget and then pass a standalone debt-ceiling bill, but the process would trigger days of unlimited amendment votes and other procedural delays on the Senate floor. 
The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, has estimated that the debt limit will cause the government to “no longer be able to meet all its obligations in full and on time” sometime between mid-December and mid-February. If Congress enacts the bipartisan infrastructure bill, then the risk of a payment default is is the earlier part of the window, because that measure makes a large transfer into the Highway Trust Fund.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican Glenn Youngkin is within striking distance of Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a Virginia governor's election that will test a strategy of trying to woo suburban moderates without alienating the hard-liners who backed Donald Trump.
If the former private equity executive wins on Tuesday, his approach of rallying parents angry about the way schools have handled COVID-19 and racism in the classroom may serve as a model for Republicans across the country looking to unseat Democrats in next year's congressional elections.
The party that wins in 2022 will control the U.S. Congress for the last two years of President Joe Biden's term.
McAuliffe led Youngkin by 5 points in opinion polls in mid-August. But in the final days, the two candidates were locked in a near dead heat, according to polling averages calculated by Real Clear Politics. Over that same period, Biden's approval rating dropped to just over 40% from about 50%.
Youngkin, 54, has tried to walk a fine line on the false claims by Trump, the former president, that his election defeat in 2020 was the result of fraud, avoiding the topic himself but campaigning with Republican state Senator Amanda Chase who has embraced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-republican-tries-thread-needle-election-fraud-claims-2021-10-12 them.
He has also backed Republican arguments that school curriculums that discuss racism are promoting ""critical race theory https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/what-critical-race-theory-means-why-its-igniting-debate-2021-09-21,"" a law school concept that maintains racism is ingrained in U.S. law and institutions and that legacies of slavery and segregation have created an uneven playing field for Black Americans. 
Schools say they do not include the theory in elementary and high school curriculums, but are trying to respond to the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population.
At the same time, Youngkin needs to avoid turning off Virginia's moderate voters whose growing numbers - especially in the Washington suburbs - have swung the Southern state Democratic in the past four presidential elections. 
A Youngkin victory could provide a template for Republicans walking a fine line in next year's congressional races. 
""Spending a lot of your time trying to cultivate the middle might be wise because it might be that the Trump electorate is going to be fired up no matter what,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
The contest s important enough for Democrats that Biden and former President Barack Obama visited the state to campaign for McAuliffe, 64, in its final weeks. Virginia has elected just one Republican governor in the past two decades and Democrats currently also control both houses of the state legislature.
If McAuliffe wins, he would retake the seat he held from 2014 through 2018. The state's laws forbid governors from serving consecutive terms.
SCHOOLS IN FOCUS
Schools have been a major focus for Youngkin, who opposes COVID-19 safety rules requiring that masks be worn in Virginia's classrooms as well as anti-racism education.
Campaigners have brawled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/partisan-war-over-teaching-history-racism-stokes-tensions-us-schools-2021-06-23 at school board meetings over the anti-racism issue this year, prompting the FBI https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-defends-efforts-step-up-monitoring-threats-school-boards-2021-10-05 to step up its response to threats against board members.
""It forces our children to view everything through a lens of race,"" Youngkin said at a campaign stop in Chesterfield, Virginia, on Oct. 8.
A former chief executive of  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc , Youngkin has also pledged to be tough on criminals, rounding off a basket of issues observers see as tailored to appeal to Trump supporters without turning off suburban moderates.
Youngkin said last month it was ""weird and wrong"" when people at a rally supporting him pledged allegiance to a flag carried by Trump supporters at the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Youngkin did not attend the rally, which featured Trump calling in by phone and speaking warmly of the candidate.
Trump also participated in a pro-Youngkin tele-rally on Monday, telling voters that Youngkin would protect suburbs. In his brief call, Trump made no mention of his past warnings that Virginia's election could be marred by fraud.

McAuliffe has tried to tie Youngkin closely to Trump, running television ads that juxtaposed his opponent's calls for better election security with images of Trump and the Capitol riot.
""He wants to bring Donald Trump politics to Virginia,"" McAuliffe said while debating Youngkin on Sept. 28. ""(He) tries to come here to Northern Virginia and pretend: 'Oh, I'm some moderate.' He's not.""

739,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on whether to begin debate on legislation that would restore state voting requirements that were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013, the top Senate Democrat said on Monday. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would set up the procedural vote for a bill known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which Republicans are expected to block from consideration.
The bill, named for the late civil rights leader and longtime congressman John Lewis, would require certain states and counties to get federal approval before they can redraw voting districts. 
Republicans have already blocked multiple attempts by Schumer to advance broader election reform bills that would make it easier for Americans to vote by mail and cast early in-person ballots. 
Schumer said the Senate must act soon in response to restrictive election laws passed by Republican-led states. 
""Time is really getting short for the Senate to take action on voting rights,"" Schumer said in remarks that could foreshadow a move by Democrats to address the Senate's 60-vote threshold known as the filibuster, which empowers Republicans to stand in the way of legislation.
""It is essential that we restore pre-clearance protections before the start of next year, when states are set to consider another round of restrictive voting rights laws,"" Schumer said.
Next year also brings November elections for one-third of the Senate's 100 seats and all 435 House of Representatives seats. Both chambers are narrowly controlled by Democrats.
Republicans argue that the federal government should not meddle in state-run election activities.
But at least one Republican lawmaker, Senator Lisa Murkowski, said she would vote to begin debate on the measure on Wednesday. 
Democrats have tried to override restrictive laws passed this year in a number of states with Republican-controlled legislatures and governors. Those measures, plus others in the pipeline, are part of a Republican narrative that the 2020 presidential election was rife with voter fraud, as former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed since last year.

Various court decisions and Trump's own Justice Department found no substantial voting irregularities to put President Joe Biden's victory in question.
Many Democrats are pressing Schumer to alter or scrap the Senate's filibuster rule to allow voting rights legislation to advance on a simple majority vote that Democrats could more easily win.

(Reuters) -U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders was working on getting a provision to lower prescription drug prices into the $1.75 trillion social spending bill pending in the U.S. Congress before a vote by the House of Representatives, with President Joe Biden expressing optimism the bill will come up for a vote this week.
Biden was dealt a setback on Thursday as the House abandoned plans for a vote on an infrastructure bill before his departure to Europe for an international summit https://www.reuters.com/subjects/g20 with other world leaders, with progressive Democrats seeking more time to consider his call for a separate $1.75 trillion plan to address climate measures, preschool and other social initiatives.
A proposal that would allow the U.S. government's Medicare health plan for seniors to negotiate cheaper prices for prescription medicines was not included in the social spending bill.
""I spent all of yesterday on the telephone ... We are continuing that effort (to include the prescription drug price provision in the bill),"" Sanders told CNN in an interview on Sunday.
""It is outrageous that we continue to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,"" added Sanders, who has championed that cause for years.
In a press briefing in Rome on Sunday, the U.S. president, who left for Europe for the G20 summit as top Democrats raced to close a deal on his economic agenda, expressed optimism for an imminent vote on the social spending bill.
The so-called Build Back Better framework, Biden said, ""God willing, (is) gonna be voted on as early as some time this coming week."" 
House Democrats have previously been signaling a vote could come as soon as Tuesday. 
Biden had sought to unite his fellow Democrats behind the climate and social spending plan with personal appeals on Thursday, and had pressed for a Thursday vote on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, another main plank of his domestic agenda.
He hoped a framework on the larger measure would convince progressive House Democrats to support the infrastructure bill, but their insistence that the two move together led House leaders to abandon a planned vote.
The plan also did not include paid family leave or a tax on billionaires, with some constituencies angered by the absence of key Biden administration pledges from the bill.
The absence of paid family leave, Democrats have noted, left the United States as the only rich country and one of the few nations in the world that does not pay women during maternity leave.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested on Sunday that the fight for paid family leave was not over.
""It's definitely something that we believe in, and so while it is not in this framework, we're gonna keep fighting for it,"" Buttigieg told ABC News in an interview.

Among the information that came officials' way in the weeks before what turned into a riot as lawmakers met to certify the results of November's presidential election was a Dec. 20 tip to the FBI that supporters of then-President Donald Trump were discussing online how to sneak guns into Washington to ""overrun"" police and arrest members of Congress, according to internal bureau documents obtained by The Post.
The tip included details showing those planning violence believed they had orders from the president, used code words such as ""pickaxe"" to describe guns, and posted the times and locations of four spots around the country for caravans to meet the day before the joint session. On one site, a poster specifically mentioned Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, as a target, the Post said.
Romney was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump last February on one charge of inciting an insurrection, which was leveled by the House of Representatives during a second impeachment of the former president.
An FBI official who assessed the tip noted that its criminal division had received a ""significant number"" of alerts about threats to Congress and other government officials. The FBI passed the information to law enforcement agencies in Washington but did not pursue the matter, the Post said. 
""The individual or group identified during the Assessment does not warrant further FBI investigation at this time,"" the internal report concluded, according to the Post.
That detail was among dozens included in the report, which the newspaper said was based on interviews with more than 230 people and thousands of pages of court documents and internal law enforcement reports, along with hundreds of videos, photographs and audio recordings.
A special congressional panel is now investigating the events that day, which exploded into violence after a rally Trump held near the White House to rail against the results of the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Four people died on Jan. 6, one shot to death by police and the others of natural causes. More than 100 police officers were injured, one dying the next day. Four officers have since taken their own lives. 
More than 600 people have been charged with taking part in the violence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As abortion providers backed by President Joe Biden's administration prepare for Monday's U.S. Supreme Court arguments in their challenge to a near-total ban on the procedure in Texas, they have found an unlikely ally: a right-leaning gun rights group.
A ""friend of the court"" brief filed in the case by the Firearms Policy Coalition against Republican-governed Texas illustrates how the law's unique structure - enforcement by private individuals, not the state - has alarmed advocates for all kinds of constitutionally protected rights.
Some conservatives are warning that similar laws could be crafted by liberals targeting issues important to the right.
A law written like the one in Texas to impede courts from ruling on constitutionality before it takes effect could be used, for example, to take aim at constitutionally protected activities including gun rights, religious practice or free speech. Abortion is protected under the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which recognized a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, and subsequent decisions.
""You can't short-circuit the ordinary steps of judicial review for serious constitutional questions,"" said Erik Jaffe, the attorney who filed the Firearms Policy Coalition's brief.
When laws are enacted that restrict constitutional rights, courts have a vital role to play before they take effect, Jaffe added.
""This circumvents that debate. This says, 'Too bad you don't get to have that debate except ... with my foot on your neck,'"" Jaffe said.
The Supreme Court will consider whether the Texas law's structure prevents federal courts from intervening to block it and whether the U.S. government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it.
The measure, one of numerous restrictive Republican-backed state abortion laws passed in recent years, bans the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. There is an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.
MISSISSIPPI CASE
The case reaches the nine justices as the future of abortion rights hangs in the balance. On Dec. 1, the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is due to hear another major abortion case in which Mississippi is seeking to overturn Roe v. Wade https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/mississippi-asks-us-supreme-court-overturn-abortion-rights-landmark-2021-07-22. The Texas attorney general has signaled he also wants Roe v. Wade https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-urges-us-supreme-court-maintain-states-abortion-ban-2021-10-21 overturned.
What is unique about the Texas law is that the state plays no enforcement role. Instead, anyone can sue abortion providers - regardless of whether that person has a personal stake - and potentially win at least $10,000 in damages, a process critics have compared to placing a bounty on abortion providers.
At least three states already are considering legislation mirroring the Texas law's language including one in Illinois targeting gun dealers, said David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey who filed a brief opposing Texas.
The Texas citizen-enforcement provision does not mean such laws can always evade judicial review. But to challenge them someone would have to be sued under the law first and then take aim at the enforcement mechanism in the defense. In the meantime, the fact that the law is on the books may chill the conduct at issue. That is the case in Texas, with abortion clinics complying with the ban since the Supreme Court let it go into effect https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/texas-six-week-abortion-ban-takes-effect-2021-09-01 on Sept. 1.
Lawyers opposing the law have found potential analogies on other issues involving Supreme Court precedents. Laws that would enable people to sue gun owners and seek to prohibit unlimited independent spending in political campaigns are examples cited by Biden's administration in its challenge to the abortion law.
In both instances, ""those statutes, too, would violate the Constitution as interpreted by this court. But under Texas's theory, they could be enforced without prior judicial review, chilling the protected activity - and the effect of any successful constitutional defense in an enforcement proceeding could be limited to that proceeding alone,"" the administration wrote in court papers.
Legislators have enacted other laws that let people bring individual claims on contentious issues including transgender rights. But those are more like earlier statutes that empowered people to sue over matters such as environmental or civil rights violations.
In Tennessee, a law barring transgender students from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity includes a provision that lets individuals sue local school districts if they ""encounter a member of the opposite sex"" in a bathroom.
Some conservative and religious groups that oppose abortion have signaled little concern about the Texas law's structure, feeling that critics have exaggerated potential consequences.
Walter Weber, a lawyer with the American Center for Law and Justice religious rights legal group that filed a brief backing Texas, said there is nothing to stop abortion providers from challenging the law after they are sued.

""Abortion advocates crying wolf can raise a lot of money and give cover to legislative and executive measures to push further support for abortion,"" Weber said.
If the Texas law is so clearly unconstitutional, Weber asked, ""Why are abortionists so terrified?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A sheriff on Friday rejected accusations of political motivations in his office's investigation into Andrew Cuomo, which resulted in the filing of a misdemeanor sex offense charge against the former New York governor.
Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said his office had conducted a ""comprehensive and methodical"" investigation into allegations that Cuomo groped a woman under her blouse at the Executive Mansion. 
""This is my job,"" Apple told a news conference. ""I've been doing this a long time, I've been called much worse."" 
A criminal complaint charging Cuomo with the misdemeanor sex offense of forcible touching was filed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/misdemeanor-complaint-related-sex-crime-filed-against-ex-ny-governor-cuomo-court-2021-10-28 on Thursday in a court in Albany, the state capital. 
Hours after the news conference, Cuomo posted to his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account a statement from his attorney calling into question the accusation made against him and saying that Apple’s handling of the case was politically motivated.
State Attorney General Letitia James - who launched an independent investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Cuomo - made a widely expected announcement earlier on Friday that she would run for governor.
""The timing of this charge, on the eve of Tish James announcing her run for Governor, is highly suspect and should give all of us pause that the heavy hand of politics is behind this decision,"" the statement said.
James, like Cuomo, is a Democrat, 
The misdemeanor charge against Cuomo was the first prosecution stemming from a sexual misconduct scandal that led to his resignation. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to a year in jail.
Thursday's complaint seemed to catch many by surprise, including Albany County District Attorney David Soares.
Asked by reporters why Soares was not notified before the complaint was made public, Apple said his office filed the paperwork for review and intended to meet with prosecutors to determine whether a criminal arrest warrant or a criminal summons would be issued. 
The process, however, moved much more quickly than planned, and the information was leaked to the news media, he said, calling the action ""improper.""
Cuomo is scheduled to be appear in court in Albany on Nov. 17, although Apple said that date is ""fluid."" 
An arrest warrant could be issued should the former governor fail to appear in court, Apple said.
James said in August that the five-month independent investigation concluded Cuomo had engaged in conduct that violated multiple federal and state laws. 
Cuomo, 63, stepped down two months ago under mounting calls for his ouster from prominent fellow Democrats. Like James, 63, Governor Kathy Hochul, 63, who succeeded Cuomo after he resigned, is a Democrat and plans to run in 2022.
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing, though he has said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he called ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous. 
His exit derailed the political career of a man once considered a possible U.S. presidential contender, whose daily briefings early in the COVID-19 pandemic raised his national profile. 

Cuomo's resignation spared him from possible removal from office through impeachment proceedings in the state legislature, which appeared likely even though that body is dominated by fellow Democrats.
The investigation found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made improperly suggestive comments to women, including a state trooper and other current or former government workers, and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a bid by a group of Republican state officials to take over the defense of a hardline immigration rule issued by former President Donald Trump's administration that had barred certain immigrants deemed likely to require government benefits from obtaining legal permanent residency.
The justices took up an appeal by 13 Republican state attorneys general led by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich of a lower court's ruling that rejected their bid to defend Trump's ""public charge"" rule. President Joe Biden's administration dropped the government's defense of the policy. A federal judge in Illinois in a separate case vacated the rule nationwide.
The rule was in effect from February 2020 until last March.
Brnovich was joined in his effort by officials from Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. 
U.S. guidelines in place for the past two decades had said immigrants likely to become primarily dependent on direct cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, in a nursing home for example, at public expense would be barred from legal permanent residency, known as a ""green card."" 
Trump's policy expanded this to anyone deemed likely to receive a much wider range of benefits for more than an aggregate of 12 months over any 36-month period including the Medicaid healthcare program, housing and food assistance. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided in 2020 that Trump's policy impermissibly expanded the definition of who counts as a ""public charge."" Other courts around the country made similar rulings.

Brnovich and the other Republican officials told the justices that they should be able to defend Trump's rule, saying it has been estimated to save all states about $1 billion annually. During the time the policy was enforced, the government issued only three denials of admission under it, according to court filings, all of which have since been reversed.
The Supreme Court in March dismissed another case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-immigration/u-s-supreme-court-dismisses-trump-immigration-rule-dispute-idUSKBN2B123S from New York involving the legality of the rule at the urging of Biden's administration.

The bill, from Senators Ted Cruz, Todd Young and Roger Marshall, would create a 10-year exemption for member countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - Australia, Japan and India - from sanctions imposed by CAATSA, a sweeping 2017 law intended to punish countries that did business with, among others, Russia's military.

""I'm running for Governor of New York because I have the experience, vision, and courage to take on the powerful on behalf of all New Yorkers,"" the Democrat wrote. ""Let's do this, together.""
James, 63, is the first candidate to challenge fellow Democrat Kathy Hochul, the former lieutenant governor who replaced Cuomo to become the state's first woman governor when he stepped down on Aug. 24.
Hochul, also 63, a Buffalo native, has already announced her candidacy for a full four-year stint as governor of the country's fourth most populous state when the remaining portion of the term she inherited from Cuomo expires at the end of 2022.
Other Democrats who may be planning a run include New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose term expires at the end of this year and who the New York Times reported earlier this month has told associates he intends to challenge Hochul.
If James were to win the Democratic nomination and go on to defeat her Republican opponent, she would become the first Black female governor of any of the 50 states. Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly missed reaching that milestone in 2018.
Elected in 2018, James is in her first term as attorney general, an office from which some of her predecessors, including Cuomo, have stepped up to governor, thanks in part to its jurisdiction over high-profile legal cases in the country's financial capital.
This year alone, James joined a probe of former U.S. President Donald Trump's namesake company that led to its indictment on tax fraud charges and asked a federal bankruptcy court to dissolve the National Rifle Association.
She has also joined other state attorneys general in seeking tighter antitrust restrictions of Big Tech companies and challenging the restrictive abortion law of Texas.
But her most prominent move in the state's political arena was her 168-page report on Aug. 3 that found Cuomo unlawfully groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to 11 women, many of them aides in his office.
Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately and decried the report as unfair, even as he prepared to leave the governor's mansion after declaring that remaining in office would paralyze state government.

His attorney, Rita Glavin, accused James of bias, claiming that her report ""purposefully omits key evidence.""
James began her political career as a member of the New York City Council from her native Brooklyn and was elected in 2013 as the city's public advocate, which serves as a watchdog over other municipal agencies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives said they would not vote on Thursday on a bipartisan infrastructure plan as their leaders had suggested after progressives balked.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday that the House will postpone the vote on the infrastructure bill pending in the U.S. Congress, but added that most members of the House had expressed a commitment to support the legislation.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was confident that the infrastructure bill and a more complicated spending measure for social spending and tackling climate change would soon be passed by Congress.
U.S. President Joe Biden earlier on Thursday presented a $1.75 trillion plan for climate measures, preschool and other social initiatives that he said unified Democrats, but some members of his party quickly rebuffed it.
Dozens of progressive Democrats in the House opposed a quick vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill until agreement is reached on a larger social spending bill, their leader said on Thursday.
Pelosi earlier in the day had urged Democrats to vote Thursday to pass the infrastructure bill, giving Biden a legislative victory.
But Representative Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus, said the group was holding out for more of Biden's agenda to be ready to pass.

Progressives had long said they would not vote for the infrastructure bill, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support in August, until the details of the larger bill - once targeted at $3.5 trillion - were worked out.
Democrats said the vote on the temporary transportation funding bill would be the chamber's last vote of the week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Thursday proposed an amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would impose a diplomatic boycott of China's Winter Olympics – less than 100 days away – amid accusations of rights abuses by Beijing.
The amendment, led by Republican Senator Mitt Romney, mirrors language included in sweeping China-related legislation the Senate passed in June, and would prohibit the secretary of state from spending federal funds to ""support or facilitate"" the attendance of U.S. government employees at the Games.
But with the Olympics set to open in February, the fate of that measure is in limbo. With Congress preoccupied with President Joe Biden's domestic agenda, the bill passed by the Senate has stalled in the House of Representatives.
The new amendment, if approved, would add the diplomatic boycott provision to the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a defense bill Congress has passed every year since 1961.
The amendment calls for an ""end to the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing human rights abuses, including the Uyghur genocide,"" but allows U.S. funding for athletes, as well as the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and its employees and contractors.
Such a boycott ""will hurt the Chinese Communist Party, rather than punish our American athletes,"" Romney told Reuters in a statement.
The amendment is co-sponsored by Democrats Tim Kaine and Ed Markey, and Republican Todd Young. All four senators are members of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Members of Congress have been vocal in demanding an Olympic boycott or venue change, and have lashed out at corporations, arguing that their silence about what the State Department has deemed a genocide of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China was abetting the Chinese government.
Chinese officials vehemently deny abuses. 
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also called for a diplomatic boycott.
The White House, which is planning for a virtual meeting between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping this year, has so far largely steered clear of the controversy, saying it hoped to discuss a joint approach with allies.

Countries often send official delegations to partake in Olympic opening ceremonies. First lady Jill Biden led a delegation to the Tokyo Summer Olympics in July, offering support to a key ally despite concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday outlined policy changes aimed at rooting out repeated corporate misconduct and prioritizing prosecutions of individuals, signaling a shift to a tougher stance by the government toward white collar crime. 
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the department's top priority regarding corporate crime is to prosecute the people who commit and benefit from misconduct. 
""Accountability starts with the individuals responsible for criminal conduct,"" Monaco, the Justice Department's No. 2 official, told an industry conference.
When assessing penalties and resolutions, Monaco said the department will take a broader view of a company's misconduct, be ready to install third-party monitors and have new demands for cooperation.
Her remarks signaled a shift in the department's approach toward white collar crime under Democratic President Joe Biden after Republican former President Donald Trump's administration took a much more business-friendly stance. 
White collar prosecutions fell to an all-time low during Trump's administration, according to data compiled by Syracuse University. Even before then, the Justice Department was criticized for failing to hold Wall Street executives accountable for the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The department will require companies to name all people involved in misconduct in order to receive credit for cooperation, as opposed to the previous policy under which companies provided names of people deemed to have been ""substantially involved,"" Monaco said.
The department also will require prosecutors to consider a company's full criminal, civil and regulatory record when considering how to resolve an investigation into wrongdoing, Monaco said. Previously the department focused primarily on similar types of misconduct when weighing a settlement.
Monaco said the department is reviewing whether it is appropriate to enter into agreements with companies that defer or waive criminal prosecutions in exchange for fines and promises of better behavior when the business is a repeat offender. 
Between 10% and 20% of all significant corporate criminal resolutions involve repeat offenders, Monaco said. 
The Justice Department recently notified https://www.reuters.com/technology/ericsson-says-us-doj-advises-it-breached-obligations-under-dpa-2021-10-21 two companies they are in breach of such agreements.
The department also will reverse its shift away from requiring corporate monitors, Monaco said. The use of these independent firms, which tend to be costly for companies, fell out of favor during the Trump administration.

It also will embed a new squad of FBI agents within the department's Criminal Fraud section, which is tasked with pursuing economic crimes, Monaco added.
The policy changes are ""steps in the right direction,"" said Rick Claypool of the watchdog group Public Citizen. Claypool said the Justice Department ""has quite a hill to climb"" to get back to how it handled white-collar crime under Democratic former President Barack Obama, ""let alone try to shift course to a prosecutorial scheme that companies actually fear.""

“I don’t think it’s hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week,” Biden told the lawmakers, according to two people in the room and a third person familiar with the remark.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The president traveled to the Capitol to urge the Democrats to break a deadlock over a pair of bills that comprise his economic policy, a $550 billion Senate-passed public works measure and a package of tax increases and climate and social-welfare measures he calls “Build Back Better.” 
The latter bill would spend about $1.75 trillion, offset by tax increases and other revenue measures totaling about $2 trillion, according to a White House fact sheet.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats struggled on Wednesday to keep paid family leave in President Joe Biden's emerging social and climate-change legislation, saying negotiations would continue despite media reports the benefit could be axed from the bill. 
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has spearheaded efforts to strike a compromise agreement, told reporters that talks would go on with moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has opposed the new social program.
""It's not out. It's not over till it's over. As I said, we are continuing to negotiate in good faith and will try to get a robust paid-leave package in the bill,"" Gillibrand told reporters after talking to Manchin on the Senate floor. 
She spoke after CNN and the Wall Street Journal reported that Democrats had abandoned plans to retain the benefit in effort to move forward with Biden's ""Build Back Better"" package in the Senate and House of Representatives.
Biden's initial proposal called for 12 weeks of paid family leave after the birth of a child. The benefit declined to four weeks, as the legislation shrank to less than $2 trillion from $3.5 trillion to win agreement from Manchin and fellow moderate Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.
""We are not going to allow one or two men to tell millions of women in this country that they can't have paid leave,"" said Democratic Senator Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees human services. 
Manchin showed few signs of being amenable, telling reporters he did not believe such a major policy change should be included in the Biden package.

""I'm just saying we've got to be careful what we're doing. If we're going to do it, do it right,"" he said. 
But Gillibrand insisted that negotiations would carry on in coming days. ""I spoke to Senator Manchin, I presented my idea, he's researching what other countries do, he's looking into the details and he said he would remain open-minded,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Former New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof announced on Wednesday that he is running for governor of Oregon, saying he hopes to address systemic social issues in the state where he grew up on his family's sheep and cherry farm. 
Kristof, 62, who is from Yamhill, a rural community in western Oregon, said in a video announcing his candidacy for the Democratic nomination that he will tackle homelessness, poverty, drug addiction and inadequate education if elected. 
""It's time to do something about a system that's rigged against so many Oregonians,"" he said. 
Kristof retired from the New York Times earlier this month after 37 years at the newspaper, where he worked as a reporter, editor and columnist. He won two Pulitzer Prizes, the highest honor in U.S. journalism, one for his coverage of the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement in China and another in 2006 for his coverage of the genocide in Darfur. 
""I have spent a lifetime shining a light on the darkest corners of the globe and it broke my heart when I returned from crisis abroad only to find crisis here at home,"" he said. 

Kristof, who has never before sought political office, joined a field of at least 10 Democrats and 12 Republicans who have filed papers or announced they are running for governor. Democratic Governor Kate Brown, who has held the office since 2015, cannot seek re-election because of term limits. 
The primary will be held on May 17 and the general election on Nov. 8, 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Wednesday that he has ordered a series of internal reviews of the State Department's planning and execution of the U.S. evacuation of Afghanistan and the relocation efforts, operations that were widely criticized as chaotic.
The United States' two decades-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August in which more than 124,000 civilians including Americans, Afghans and others were evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.
In a speech unveiling new steps to modernize the State Department, Blinken praised the evacuation operation but also said the agency needs to learn from this experience and do better if a similar scenario presents itself in the future.
""There are many things that now, looking back, we can and should ask, 'Could we have done things differently?' 'Could we have taken that step differently?' 'Should we have tried that idea first?' 'Could we have gotten to that decision more quickly?',"" Blinken said in the speech at the Foreign Service Institute in Arlington, Virginia, attended by lawmakers, diplomats and others.
Reuters and other media outlets reported last week that the State Department's inspector general will review the end of the Biden administration's diplomatic operations in Afghanistan, including the emergency evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Kabul.
The department's acting inspector general will also look into its Special Immigrant Visa (NYSE:V) program, the processing of Afghans for admission as refugees, and their resettlement in the United States.

Blinken did not give details about what precise steps of the evacuation and relocation would be reviewed. 
""Now we owe it to ourselves, to our Afghan friends and partners, and to the future State Department employees who might find themselves facing a similar challenge one day to capture all that we learned, to study it, to apply it, to preserve it in a way that it enhances our future planning and helps us prepare better for future contingencies,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats struggled on Tuesday to reach agreement on a massive bill to expand social programs and tackle climate change, with disagreement on multiple major issues reducing the odds of a quick vote.
President Joe Biden's party has spent months fighting over what to include in legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-democrats-2-trillion-spending-plan-what-is-what-is-cut-2021-10-20 forecast to spend at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years - less than half the initial $3.5 trillion target - with moderates and progressives divided over issues including taxes, prescription drug pricing, family leave, climate change and immigration.
Negotiations also have held up passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate with the support of 19 Republicans, as the House of Representatives' large progressive caucus has refused to vote on it until the bigger deal is reached.
The leader of the 95-member Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were at odds on Tuesday on whether to try to vote on infrastructure this week, before a Biden trip out of the country.
""Let's vote both of them out at the same time,"" Representative Pramila Jayapal said as she left a meeting with Pelosi. Referring to the still-under-negotiation social spending measure, the caucus leader added: ""We gotta have the agreement on what it is, so that it can be written up. And then we can vote both bills through.""
Asked about Jayapal's comments that having an agreement in principle would not be enough to justify a vote on infrastructure, Pelosi replied: ""Well, I think it is.""
With razor-thin margins in the House and Senate and a united Republican opposition, Democrats need almost 100% unity to pass either package.
'BILLIONAIRES TAX' IN PLAY
The number of difficult issues still to be resolved appeared daunting.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine ticked off parental leave benefits, Medicare and Medicaid expansions, a possible ""billionaires tax"" and lowering the cost of prescription drugs as some undecided items.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said details of his plan to raise taxes on billionaires, many of whom pay next to nothing, would be unveiled later on Tuesday.
That idea is getting pushback from House Democrats who want to stick with earlier proposals for raising tax rates on the rich and corporations.
Wyden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, alongside Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, also unveiled details https://www.reuters.com/world/us/details-emerge-corporate-minimum-tax-plan-us-senate-democrats-cnbc-2021-10-26 of a plan to enact a 15% minimum corporate tax targeting about 200 firms with more than $1 billion in profits annually over a three-year period.
Democrats were eyeing prompt passage of the infrastructure measure as a way to refresh many surface transportation programs that expire on Sunday. They also think new investments in roads, bridges, airport construction and broadband internet service for rural areas would boost their chances of winning the tight Nov. 2 governor's race in Virginia.
Democrats intend to use a special ""budget reconciliation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senates-reconciliation-process-its-not-way-it-sounds-2021-08-10"" procedure to pass the larger of the two bills by a simple majority in the Senate, without any support from Republicans.
Centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said earlier on Tuesday that the $1.5 trillion he seeks for the larger of the two bills is ""more than fair,"" as progressives push for $2 trillion or more.
Manchin, however, did not outright reject a higher top line during an interview with the Economic Club of Washington. He and fellow moderate Democrat Kyrsten Sinema each hold the power to block legislation in the evenly divided Senate.
Sinema and Manchin were at the White House on Tuesday evening for talks on the legislation.
Manchin questioned progressives' drive for aggressive climate-control provisions, suggesting Biden could push countries at U.N. talks next week in Scotland to take tough actions based on steps the United States already has taken.
Manchin, who represents the coal-producing state of West Virginia, is the top recipient in Congress of campaign contributions from oil and gas interests.
He has opposed https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/democrats-likely-ditch-us-methane-fee-amid-opposition-sources-2021-10-25 two major climate measures in the social spending bill supported by fellow Democrats: a plan that would reward utilities for investing in renewables such as solar and wind power and penalize those that do not, and a fee on oil and natural gas producers for emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.
He also poured cold water on another hot-button initiative with which Democrats were flirting: changing Senate rules to abolish or place new constraints on the filibuster https://www.reuters.com/world/us/could-biden-steer-us-senate-into-changing-filibuster-2021-10-22, which gives Republicans the power to block most bills.

""It makes no sense to me"" to abandon that rule, Manchin said, given that Democrats opposed such action by Republicans when they were in the minority.
Democrats' anger with Republicans' use of the filibuster could come to a head this week if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attempts to pass major voting rights reforms for the fourth time this year.

758,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 05:17PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed two former senators and the widows of two senators to high-level diplomatic posts on Tuesday, including former Republican Senator Jeff Flake as ambassador to Turkey and former Democratic Senator Tom Udall as ambassador to New Zealand.
Both were confirmed by voice vote, as was Cindy Hensley McCain, an Arizona businesswoman and widow of the late Republican Senator John McCain, who will have the rank of ambassador as U.S. Representative to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture.
The Senate also confirmed by voice vote Victoria Reggie Kennedy, an attorney and gun control advocate who is the widow of the late Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, as ambassador to Austria.
The confirmation of four ambassadors was unusual in the bitterly divided Senate, where Republicans have refused to confirm many of the Democratic president's nominees.
Flake, who said he was out of step with the Republican Party during the era dominated by then-President Donald Trump, retired from the Senate when his term ended in 2019. He endorsed Democratic President Joe Biden when Biden ran for the White House against Trump in 2020.

McCain also endorsed Biden in 2020, saying he was a leader who reflected American values and could unite the country.
Trump had repeatedly attacked her late husband, including belittling his military service, which included years in a North Vietnamese prison camp during the Vietnam War.

759,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats are at a decision point on what will be included and what will be left out of their economic agenda in order to move forward with a sweeping social-spending package and a vote on a separate infrastructure bill as soon as this week.
“There’s not that much more time,” Pelosi said after meeting with House Democrats Tuesday morning. “We have to have decisions largely today.”
The California Democrat said she still hoped to have votes on the tax and spending package and the infrastructure legislation by the end of the week, which would give President Joe Biden a political boost as he heads Thursday to summits with other world leaders in Europe.
But that schedule appears unlikely given the differences that remain between House and Senate Democrats on some key issues -- including taxes, healthcare and measures to address climate change, and considering the complexity of the legislation. Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats are continuing to insist that they won’t vote on the infrastructure bill without a firm deal on the larger package.
During the meeting with House Democrats, Pelosi said the party should embrace the compromise tax and spending plan carrying much of Biden’s agenda even though it will be substantially less than the $3.5 trillion originally envisioned, according to lawmakers.
Not ‘Fun’
Pelosi’s message was “this is not going to be fun. It’s not going to be everything we wanted but it’s going to be bigger than what we could have imagined a few years ago,” Michigan Representative Dan Kildee said after the meeting.
Democrats have been inching toward an agreement on a version of the spending plan that can pass Congress with their razor-thin majorities. Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have been insisting that the package shrink. Their votes are pivotal in the 50-50 Senate.
Manchin on Tuesday indicated he may be willing to raise his limit on the overall price tag from $1.5 trillion, which he has held to since the summer.
“You need to keep all options open,” Manchin said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s David Rubenstein at the Washington, D.C., Economic Club.
But Manchin later said that he doesn’t see the price tage rising to the roughly $2 trillion that Biden has suggested would be the compromise figure.
“I’m fighting for 1.5, and I’m trying to see if we’re going to get a piece of legislation,” Manchin said at the Capitol. “We know the outline. But until you see the text it’s hard to make a final decision. So I can’t tell you specifically.”

WASHINGTON/BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden joined Southeast Asian leaders for a virtual summit on Tuesday, the first time in four years that Washington has engaged at the top level with a bloc seen as key to countering an increasingly assertive China. 
The United States had not met with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the presidential level since Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, attended an ASEAN-U.S. meeting in Manila in 2017. During that time, U.S. relations with China deteriorated to their worst level in decades. 
In his opening remarks to the summit, Biden said the United States was committed to the central role of the 10-nation ASEAN in the region and ASEAN nations can expect him to personally show up in the region in future.
""The relationship between the United States and ASEAN is vital, vital for the future of all one billion of our people,"" Biden said. ""Our partnership is essential to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, which has been the foundation of our shared security and prosperity for many decades.""
On Wednesday, Biden will participate in the broader East Asia Summit, which brings together ASEAN and other nations in the Indo-Pacific region.
Analysts say Biden's meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration's efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China.
In his remarks, Biden referred to a ""shared vision for a region where every country can compete and succeed on a level playing field and all nations, no matter how big or powerful, abide by the law.""
However, he avoided specific mention of China, as have U.S. officials in the run-up to the meetings as they work to set up a virtual summit between the U.S. president and Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this year.
The White House said Biden will announce plans to provide up to $102 million to expand the U.S. strategic partnership with ASEAN, which is currently chaired by Brunei, with funding going towards health, climate, economic and education programs. 
Biden is also expected to assure ASEAN that a recent U.S. focus on engagement with India, Japan and Australia in the so-called Quad grouping and a deal to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines are not intended to supplant ASEAN's regional role.
Edgard Kagan, senior director for East Asia at the White House National Security Council, stressed last week that Washington does not see the Quad as ""an Asian NATO"" and that it was not intended to compete with ASEAN.
He said Washington had an interest in working with ASEAN to ensure supply-chain resilience, on climate, and to address ""common challenges on maritime issues"" - an apparent reference to China's broad claims in the disputed South China Sea.
While planning to provide a modest sum to promote trade with ASEAN, Biden has given no sign of any plan to return to a regional trade framework Trump withdrew from in 2017.
Analysts said ASEAN leaders would be anxious to hear how Washington plans to engage further on trade, investment and infrastructure and of any U.S. plans to step up provision of COVID-19 vaccines to the region, which has been hard hit by the pandemic.
An Asian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the lack of an economic element in U.S. regional engagement was a major gap at a time when countries were expanding economic ties with China.

Kagan said it was critical for the credibility of the Quad that it deliver on a pledge it made in March to supply a billion COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asia by the end of 2022.
That plan stalled after India, the world's largest vaccine producer, banned exports in April amid a massive domestic COVID outbreak.

The U.S. funding will go towards health, climate, economic and education programs, a White House factsheet said.
Of the total, $40 million will go to an initiative to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen ASEAN's ability to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks of infectious diseases, it said.
A further $20.5 million will go to help tackle the climate crisis and up to $20 million to support cooperation on trade and innovation. Another $17.5 million is earmarked for education projects and $4 million to promote gender equality and equity, it said.

Biden's participation in the virtual summit will mark the first time in four years that Washington will engage at the top level with a bloc that it sees as key to its strategy of pushing back against China.
On Wednesday, Biden will also take part in the broader East Asia Summit, which brings together ASEAN and other nations in the Indo-Pacific region, a senior official of the U.S. administration said.

KEARNY, N.J. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden held out hope on Monday for an agreement on his major spending plans before he attends a climate summit in Scotland, while the White House said Democratic negotiators were closing in on a deal.
""Let's get this done. Let's move!"" said Biden.
Biden visited New Jersey to sell his ""Build Back Better"" agenda after talks on Sunday with moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, whose vote is critical to the package, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow Democrat.
With negotiators zeroing in on a tax on billionaires https://www.reuters.com/world/us/with-corporate-tax-off-table-us-democrats-turn-billionaires-fund-spending-bill-2021-10-25 to pay for the legislation, Biden used a speech in Kearny, New Jersey, to criticize past Republican plans that largely benefited the wealthy, and the economic theory that if people at the top did well, everyone would benefit.
""I'm tired of 'trickle-down,'"" said Biden.
Whatever the final price tag ends up being, the legislation will be paid for, Biden said.
""You hear these numbers, $3.5 trillion, $1.7 trillion - we pay for it all. It doesn’t increase the deficit one single cent. So let’s get to work,"" he said.
Democrats are seeking to coalesce around two key pieces of legislation - an up-to-$2 trillion social spending and climate change package and a $1 trillion infrastructure bill - to make good on Biden's campaign promises.
A plan for the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to vote on the infrastructure bill this week appeared in doubt, without an agreement on Biden's larger spending package.
We want to have an agreement so that we can go forward,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters, when asked about the prospects for an infrastructure vote. 
Manchin, one of two Democratic holdouts along with Senator Kyrsten Sinema, told reporters at the Capitol that he believed a deal on a framework for the social spending bill could be reached this week. But he remained opposed to spending more than $1.5 trillion.
Manchin and senior Democrats, including Schumer, failed to reach agreement at a meeting later on Monday. Participants said discussions would continue. 
Differences remained on proposals to expand the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly, to lower prescription drug prices and address climate change. A proposal to impose a methane fee https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/democrats-likely-ditch-us-methane-fee-amid-opposition-sources-2021-10-25 on oil and gas producers was not expected to be included in the final package. 
""There are a few issues still out there. But we're working each one of them,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting. 
TAX ON BILLIONAIRES
Manchin said earlier in the day that he supported the idea of a tax on the nation's roughly 700 billionaires https://www.reuters.com/world/us/with-corporate-tax-off-table-us-democrats-turn-billionaires-fund-spending-bill-2021-10-25 to fund the programs. 
""I support basically everyone paying their fair share of taxes,"" he said. ""I’m open to any type of thing that makes people pay that’s not paying now.""
Democrats are expected to unveil the tax proposal within the next few days. 
The prolonged debate on the spending plans comes as Biden prepares to attend two major summits: a G20 gathering of world leaders in Rome that starts on Saturday and a climate summit in Glasgow, kicking off on Sunday.
Biden expressed desire for a deal before he leaves on Thursday.
""That’s my hope,"" Biden told reporters as he departed Wilmington in his home state of Delaware en route to neighboring New Jersey. 
The White House said Biden was not concerned he might have to leave the country without the legislative work completed, saying he could still work on the issues while on the road.

""We believe we're going to get it done and we're making progress every day,"" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Biden visited an elementary school in Plainfield, New Jersey, to promote provisions of his plan, and was to deliver a speech later in the Newark area before returning to Washington.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Barack Obama urged Virginians to re-elect Terry McAuliffe as governor at a rally on Saturday, emphasizing the race's significance as an indicator of the country's political direction and a reflection of its values. 
Obama and McAuliffe, who served as the state's governor from 2014 to 2018, spoke before a cheering crowd at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond with just 10 days to go before the closely watched, tight Nov. 2 election.
The off-year race is seen as a barometer of how the country might decide the 2022 midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress, and a referendum on Democrat Joe Biden's presidency.
Obama told the crowd the Virginia election represented a national ""turning point,"" where Americans could either become more embattled in the divisive politics that characterized Republican Donald Trump's presidency and which culminated in an attack by Trump's supporters on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, or ""pull together"" to ""solve big problems.""
""I believe you, right here in Virginia, are going to show the rest of the country and the world that we're not going to indulge in our worst instincts,"" Obama said. ""We're not going to go back to the chaos that did so much damage. We're going to move forward with people like Terry leading the way.""
McAuliffe told the crowd the election was too important to sit out, with several key issues on the ballot.
""This election is about the next chapter of Virginia and our country. ... It's about leading us out of this pandemic, keeping our economy strong, protecting voter rights, protecting abortion rights and so much more,"" he said. 
Opinion polls show McAuliffe, 64, and Republican Glenn Youngkin, 54, nearly tied. A poll this week by Monmouth University https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_VA_102021 showed Youngkin had closed McAuliffe's 5-point lead since September by gaining ground with independent and women voters.
Youngkin's strength in the polls during the first weeks of early voting has worried Democrats, who anticipated a comfortable lead in a state that has trended blue in recent years. Democrats flipped the Virginia legislature in 2019 and Trump lost the state by 10 percentage points in November 2020, double his margin of defeat in 2016.
Melody Pearce, 50, a clinical nurse investigator who attended Saturday's rally for McAuliffe, said the polls made her nervous.
""After the election of President Biden I thought we would be able to exhale for a minute,"" she said. ""I'm afraid people will not come out to vote and lose enthusiasm.""
Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison told reporters at Saturday's event he was confident that Virginians would go to the polls and deliver a victory for McAuliffe.
""At the end of the day, it's about turnout,"" he said. ""If we get the Democrats to turn out, we win.""
The serving governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, cannot seek re-election because the state bars governors from serving consecutive terms. McAuliffe can run because he left office in 2018.
Both candidates for governor have dug into hotly contested cultural issues to stir up voter engagement, including abortion rights and how schools address the topics of race and racism with students.
McAuliffe has sought to paint Youngkin as a far-right extremist and align him with Trump, who has endorsed the Republican candidate.
In turn, Youngkin has suggested that McAuliffe is trying to advance a far-left agenda. A former private equity executive, Youngkin has focused in part on education - especially the right of parents to have a say in their children's schooling - which has proven popular with suburban women, a key demographic.
Youngkin has walked a fine line between welcoming Trump's endorsement and distancing himself from the former president's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
Obama condemned Youngkin on Saturday for walking that line, and said it reflected poorly on his character.
""Either he actually believes in the same conspiracy theories that resulted in a mob, or he doesn't believe it but he's willing to go along with it to say or do anything to get elected. And maybe that's worse,"" Obama said. 

Last week, Youngkin dissociated himself from a rally held to support him, which was headlined by longtime Trump aide Steve Bannon and Trump himself, who spoke by phone. At the event, attendees pledged allegiance to a flag that event leaders said was present on Jan. 6 when Trump supporters led an assault on the U.S. Capitol.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrats are closing in on a deal on President Joe Biden's social and climate-change agenda by narrowing their differences over healthcare and other issues, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a White House meeting on Friday.
""We had a very positive meeting this morning. I'm very optimistic,"" Pelosi told reporters on her return to the Capitol.
Democrats in the House, Senate and White House hope an agreement on a framework of $2 trillion or less will allow the House to move forward next week on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and set the stage for passage of Biden's larger ""Build Back Better"" social package.
Pelosi said there were only a few outstanding issues on the legislation's healthcare provisions and that decisions also remained on which revenue provisions to include.
""There are many decisions that have to be made, but more than 90% of everything is agreed to and written,"" Pelosi said. ""We're narrowing the differences.""
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, meanwhile, floated a ""billionaires income tax"" proposal that congressional sources said would apply to around 700 taxpayers and would raise hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh revenues to help offset the cost of the Biden plan.
""The Billionaires Income Tax is about fairness and showing the American people taxes aren't mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country,"" Wyden said in a statement.
A source familiar with the White House's thinking on the billionaires tax said: ""The president is favorably disposed towards this tax, as well as a series of other options that would ensure the wealthy pay their fair share and make the price tag.""
The plan aims to clamp down on some billionaires who find loopholes to avoid or significantly lower their tax payments.
The congressional sources said the tax would apply to taxpayers with more than $1 billion in assets or over $100 million in income for three consecutive years.
Wyden's proposal aims to lure moderate Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema into supporting the legislation after balking at raising tax rates on the wealthy and corporations.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal sounded less optimistic about getting an agreement soon, after Biden said the social spending and climate change legislation was unlikely to include a higher U.S. corporate tax rate. Omitting the tax hike would require alternative revenue sources to pay for the legislation.
""One of the complicating factors here is that if you take up some of these new revenue measures, they're going to have to be vetted,"" Neal, whose panel oversees tax policy, told reporters. ""Right now, it's hard to go back and revisit all of that.""
The ""Build Back Better"" and infrastructure bills are at the heart of Biden's domestic agenda and could provide signature legislation to bolster both his presidency and Democratic hopes of retaining control of the House and Senate in the 2022 elections. Democrats hold razor-thin majorities in both chambers.
Biden, who took office nine months ago, said at a CNN town hall event in Baltimore on Thursday that he was close to striking a deal to pass both bills, after weeks of bickering among his fellow Democrats.
""I do think I'll get a deal,"" the president said.

Disagreements over the scale of the larger package have held up Biden's domestic agenda, with progressive Democrats in the House refusing to vote for the infrastructure bill, which has already been passed by the Senate, until a deal is reached on social programs and climate change.
Moderate Democrats, most notably Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin, had objected to the original $3.5 trillion price tag and some provisions of the latter bill. Republicans oppose the measure, but 19 in the Senate voted in support of the infrastructure legislation.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on Nov. 1 a challenge to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it - a case that could dramatically curtail abortion access in the United States if the justices endorse the measure's unique design.
The justices took up requests by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to immediately review their challenges to the law. The court, which on Sept. 1 allowed the law to go into effect, declined to act on the Justice Department's request to immediately block enforcement of the measure.
The court will consider whether the law's unusual private-enforcement structure prevents federal courts from intervening to strike it down and whether the federal government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it. 
The measure bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.
Liberal Justice Sotomayor dissented from the court's deferral of a decision on whether to block enforcement of the law while the litigation continues. Sotomayor said the law's novel design has suspended nearly all abortions in Texas, the second most populous U.S. state, with about 29 million people. 
""The state's gambit has worked. The impact is catastrophic,"" Sotomayor wrote. 
The Texas dispute is the second major abortion case that the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has scheduled for the coming months, with arguments set for Dec. 1 over the legality of a restrictive Mississippi abortion law. 
The Texas and Mississippi measures are among a series of Republican-backed laws passed at the state level limiting abortion rights - coming at a time when abortion opponents are hoping that the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade that legalized the procedure nationwide.
Mississippi has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the Texas attorney general on Thursday signaled that he also would like to see that ruling fall.
Lower courts already have blocked Mississippi's law banning abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy.
The Texas measure takes enforcement out of the hands of state officials, instead enabling private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the state.
Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Critics have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterization its proponents reject.
Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the abortion providers, said Friday's decision to hear their case ""brings us one step closer to the restoration of Texans' constitutional rights and an end to the havoc and heartache of this ban."" 
Alexis McGill Johnson, president of healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood, said it is ""devastating"" that the justices did not immediately block a law that already has had a ""catastrophic impact"" after being in effect nearly two months.
""Patients who have the means have fled the state, traveling hundreds of miles to access basic care, and those without means have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will,"" she added.
Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Texas Right to Life anti-abortion group, praised the court's action, saying it ""will continue to save an estimated 100 babies per day, and because the justices will actually discuss whether these lawsuits are valid in the first place.""
The Supreme Court only rarely decides to hear cases before lower courts have ruled, indicating that the justices have deemed the Texas matter of high public importance and requiring immediate review. 

The Justice Department filed its lawsuit in September challenging the Texas law, arguing that it is unconstitutional and explicitly designed to evade judicial review.
Rulings in Texas and Mississippi cases are due by the end of next June, but could come sooner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday offered a strong signal that it is preparing to seek changes soon to a long-standing Senate tradition that has allowed Republicans to block voting rights legislation and other major Democratic initiatives.
Democratic President Joe Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, has previously opposed any significant overhaul of a Senate rule known as the filibuster, which requires 60 of the 100 senators to agree on most legislation.
His opposition has angered Democrats and activists who say an arcane rule should not stand in the way of important issues such as voting rights and immigration.
""I expect you'll hear more from the president about it in the coming weeks,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday about the filibuster. Asked what more he would want to address with filibuster reform beyond voting rights, Psaki said to ""stay tuned.""
During a televised town hall event on Thursday, Biden said the Senate should ""fundamentally alter"" the filibuster process, but did not offer specifics on how. 
The White House's potential shift on the issue comes after the latest successful effort by Republicans to block Democratic legislation aimed at thwarting restrictive new voting laws enacted in Republican-led states. On Wednesday, Republicans used the filibuster to block beginning a debate on the measure.
When Republicans control the White House and the Senate, Democrats have used the filibuster as well. 
Psaki suggested Biden had lost patience with Republican resistance to Democrats' ideas on voting rights, saying the president is ""frustrated"" and ""disappointed.""
""When a hand has been extended by Democrats to work together to protect the fundamental right, Republicans have not only recoiled, they have blocked the ... ability to make any semblance of progress,"" Psaki said. 

While Democrats are united on voting rights, they are not unified in whether to overhaul the filibuster. U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, has publicly opposed eliminating the filibuster, even for specific issues.
With a 50-50 split in the Senate, Democrats would need all of its members to support changes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday reiterated that Joe Biden was not signaling a change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan when he said the United States would come to the island's aid if it was attacked by China, and analysts dismissed the president's remark as a gaffe.
While Washington is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, it has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.
Biden called that into question when he was asked at a CNN town hall in Baltimore on Thursday night whether the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if it was attacked by China and he replied: ""Yes, we have a commitment to do that.""
Shortly after he spoke, a White House spokesperson said there was no change in policy and analysts said it appeared the president misspoke. 
Asked at a Friday news briefing whether it was Biden's intention to move away from strategic ambiguity to make an unambiguous statement about how the United States would respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: ""Our policy has not changed. He was not intending to convey a change in policy, nor has he made a decision to change our policy.""
Psaki added that, as stated in Brussels earlier on Friday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, ""nobody wants to see cross-strait issues come to blows, certainly not President Biden, and there's no reason that it should.""
Psaki said the U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan was guided by the long-established Taiwan Relations Act, under which Washington would ""continue assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.""
Another principle of the act was that Washington ""would regard any efforts to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States,"" she added.
Bonnie Glaser, a Taiwan expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, called Biden's remark a ""gaffe"" and said it was ""patently not true"" that Washington has a commitment to defend Taiwan.
""Some are suggesting a deliberate effort to send unclear signals, but in my view, that makes no sense. A confused U.S. policy weakens deterrence,"" she said, noting that Biden's Asia policy czar, Kurt Campbell, had rejected ""strategic clarity"" over Taiwan. 
Another Taiwan expert, Douglas Paal, a former U.S. representative in Taipei, said Biden was focused at the town hall on selling his domestic economic agenda.
""Despite his reputation on foreign affairs, he can be occasionally sloppy when distracted,"" Paal said. ""The White House was right to issue a speedy 'no-change-in-policy' correction, because that is where policy is.""
Biden's remark comes at an awkward time, while White House officials are gearing up for a virtual meeting between him and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which, sources say, they hope will show the world Washington can responsibly manage tense relations between the rival superpowers. 
China, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, expressed its displeasure, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying Beijing has no room for concessions on its core interests.

China urges the United States ""not to send the wrong signals to the forces of Taiwan independence, to avoid seriously harming Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
Taiwan's presidential office said its position remained the same, which is that it will neither give in to pressure nor ""rashly advance"" when it gets support.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge will consider on Nov. 4 former President Donald Trump's claim of executive privilege in response to a document request from a congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol.
Trump on Monday sued the Jan. 6 Select Committee, alleging members made an illegal request for his White House records as part of their investigation.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Trump asserted that materials sought by the House of Representatives committee are covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who was designated by random assignment to hear the lawsuit, on Friday signed off an agreement by Trump and the committee to expedite the case for a Nov. 4 oral argument.

BALTIMORE (Reuters) - The United States would come to Taiwan's defense and has a commitment to defend the island China claims as its own, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday, though the White House said later there was no change in policy towards the island. 
""Yes, we have a commitment to do that,"" Biden said at a CNN town hall when asked if the United States would come to the defense of Taiwan, which has complained of mounting military and political pressure from Beijing to accept Chinese sovereignty.
While Washington is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, it has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.
In August, a Biden administration official said U.S. policy on Taiwan had not changed after the president appeared then to suggest the United States would defend the island if it were attacked.
A White House spokesperson said Biden was not announcing any change in U.S. policy at the town hall and ""there is no change in our policy"", but declined further comment when asked if Biden misspoke.
""The U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act. We will uphold our commitment under the Act, we will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo,"" the spokesperson said.
China expressed its displeasure anyway, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying Beijing has no room for concessions on its core interests.
China urges the United States ""not to send the wrong signals to the forces of Taiwan independence, to avoid seriously harming Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
Taiwan's presidential office said its position remained the same, which is that it will neither give in to pressure nor ""rashly advance"" when it gets support.
Taiwan will show a firm determination to defend itself, presidential office spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement, adding that the Biden administration's continued concrete actions show its ""rock-solid"" support for Taiwan.
Bonnie Glaser, a Taiwan expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, called Biden's remark a ""gaffe"" and said it was ""patently not true"" that Washington has a commitment to defend Taiwan.
""Some are suggesting a deliberate effort to send unclear signals, but in my view, that makes no sense. A confused U.S. policy weakens deterrence,"" she said, noting that Biden's Asia policy czar, Kurt Campbell, had rejected ""strategic clarity"" over Taiwan.
'MOST POWERFUL MILITARY'
Biden said people should not worry about Washington's military strength because ""China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we're the most powerful military in the history of the world."" 
""What you do have to worry about is whether or not they're going to engage in activities that would put them in a position where they may make a serious mistake,"" he said.
""I don't want a cold war with China. I just want China to understand that we're not going to step back, that we're not going to change any of our views.""
Military tensions between Taiwan and China are at their worst in more than 40 years, Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said this month, adding that China will be capable of mounting a ""full-scale"" invasion by 2025.
China says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States and has denounced what it calls ""collusion"" between Washington and Taipei.
Earlier on Thursday, China's United Nations Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters China was pursuing ""peaceful reunification"" with Taiwan and responding to ""separatist attempts"" by its ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party.

""We are not the troublemaker. On the contrary, some countries - the U.S. in particular - is taking dangerous actions, leading the situation in Taiwan Strait into a dangerous direction,"" he said. 
""I think at this moment what we should call is that the United States to stop such practice. Dragging Taiwan into a war definitely is in nobody's interest. I don't see that the United States will gain anything from that.""

771,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 11:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden conferred Friday morning with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as Democrats struggle toward agreement on the president’s economic agenda.
The high-level meeting comes as Democrats strive to wrap up negotiations on roughly $2 trillion compromise version of Biden’s spending plan by the end of this weekend. Pelosi had breakfast with the president, with Schumer participating virtually, according to people familiar with the meeting.
“We had a very positive meeting this morning. I’m very optimistic,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol afterward. “Much of the bill has been written, we just need some decisions.”
A deal on the social-spending package could allow the House to vote on a separate $550 billion bipartisan infrastructure bill that has been held up by progressive lawmakers who first want the agreement on the larger bill. Leaders have said they hope to vote on the infrastructure bill before the Oct. 31 expiration of current highway funding.
Schumer earlier this week said he wanted to strike an agreement on a framework for Biden’s plans by Friday, but numerous disagreements on both revenue and spending remained. Democrats said they planned to continue negotiating through the weekend.
Getting a resolution this weekend will be a heavy lift. There’s not yet agreement on the top line for spending or on a range of revenue-raising measures to pay for it. Opposition by Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema to raising the corporate and individual tax rates has forced Democrats to scramble to search for alternatives.
“I don’t think we’re going to be able to get the vote,” Biden said in response to a question about individual and corporate rates at a CNN town hall on Thursday in Baltimore. 
The White House has been directly negotiating with Sinema to find ways to raise revenue to come up with enough money to fund the climate, health care and early childhood programs central to Biden’s economic agenda.
Sinema has agreed to raise tax revenue from companies and the wealthy, according to a person familiar with the matter. But that’s posed a challenge to craft potential alternatives to rate increases.
How to raise revenue isn’t the only obstacle. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who supports increasing tax rates for corporations and high-income individuals, has said he can’t support a clean power program favored by Biden. There are still a host of other provisions that also remain unsettled.
Pelosi said committees were working on the tax portion and that there were “a couple of outstanding issues” on health care.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has sounded increasingly open over the past month to changing the Senate's filibuster tradition to bypass a Republican roadblock that has imperiled key aspects of the Democratic agenda.
After long opposing change, Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, said on Thursday the chamber should ""fundamentally alter"" the long-standing process requiring 60 of the 100 senators to agree on most legislation, which Republicans have used to block voting-rights bills and which brought the country perilously close to a crippling debt default earlier this month.
Democrats could use their razor-thin Senate majority to eliminate or change the rule, though it would require the agreement of all of their members, including moderates Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have voiced objections.
WHAT IS THE FILIBUSTER?
To ""filibuster"" means to delay action on a bill or other issue by talking.
The Senate filibuster first captured the American imagination in Frank Capra's 1939 movie ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" when Jimmy Stewart's character spoke for more than a day, and more recently in 2013 when Texas state Senator Wendy Davis spoke for 13 hours to try to block a bill imposing new restrictions on abortion.
The popular image of a lone lawmaker mounting an impassioned hours-long argument belies the reality in today's Senate, where a mere threat is enough to initiate a filibuster and hold up a bill.
A filibuster can only be stopped if a supermajority of 60 senators votes to end debate in a process called cloture.
WHY IS THE RULE A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS?
With just 50 senators in their caucus, Democrats currently can't overcome filibusters unless at least 10 Republicans vote with them.
Democrats were able to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus plan without a supermajority through another Senate maneuver called ""reconciliation,"" with the help of Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking 51st vote. But the rules limit the use of that process.
Though they did get 19 Republican votes for a $1 trillion package to revamp the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure, Republicans have blocked many other Democratic priorities, including a voting-rights measure.
Senate Republicans this year have used the filibuster to block voting rights legislation that Democrats want to counter new restrictions passed in Republican-led states by supporters of Donald Trump's false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was due to widespread fraud.
They are also warning that they could filibuster a vote later this year to avoid a catastrophic debt default. A prior roadblock on that measure prompted Biden earlier this month to say he was open to changing the filibuster.
But he went further at a CNN town hall on Thursday, saying he would support changing the rule to pass the voting rights measure ""and maybe more,"" though he said he would not make any moves until after Congress passes a pair of bills that contain the bulk of his domestic agenda.
WHEN DID THE SENATE ADOPT THE FILIBUSTER RULE?
Although the Constitution makes no mention of filibusters, long-winded Senate speeches became an increasingly common tactic in the 19th century.
By 1917, most senators had had enough, agreeing that a vote by a two-thirds majority could end debate.
But getting two-thirds of the Senate was hard, so filibusters continued. Notoriously, they were used by Southern senators who sought to block civil rights laws.
In 1975, the Senate reduced the requirement for limiting debate to three-fifths of the Senate - currently 60 senators.
In that decade, Senate leadership began agreeing to allow measures that were facing a filibuster to be put aside while the chamber acted on other bills.
The move was intended to prevent opposition to a single bill from bringing all work in the chamber to halt, but it also meant that the filibuster changed from an energy-draining maneuver involving lengthy speeches to a mere objection, or threat to object.
Over time the number of filibusters skyrocketed. A count of votes to try to overcome a filibuster, the nearest reliable proxy, shows 298 such votes in the 2019-2020 legislative session. That's up from 168 such votes in the previous two years. From 1969 to 1970 there were six.
CAN THE FILIBUSTER BE CHANGED?
There have already been changes.
In 2013, Democrats removed the 60-vote threshold for voting on most nominees for administration jobs, apart from the Supreme Court, allowing them to advance on a simple majority vote.
In 2017, Republicans did the same thing for Supreme Court nominees. Both the 2013 and 2017 changes were made by simple majority votes.
Several filibuster reform ideas have been floated that could stop short of ending it. They include an exemption just for voting rights bills, limiting the number of filibusters against any one bill or forcing those waging a filibuster to remain standing and speaking on the Senate floor until one side relents.
WHO OPPOSES CHANGE?
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for one. At the start of this year he tried but failed to get an explicit promise from Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to protect the filibuster.

""Nobody serving in this chamber can even begin ... to imagine what a completely scorched-earth-Senate would look like,"" McConnell said in March, adding that Republicans would require votes on all parliamentary moves, drastically slowing the pace of business.
His move earlier this month to allow a vote temporarily raising the debt ceiling was in part motivated by a desire to protect the filibuster, according to aides and lawmakers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Neera Tanden, whose bid to be White House budget chief was derailed by opposition from Republicans after her sharp critiques of them on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), was named White House staff secretary on Friday, putting her in a key behind-the-scenes role.
The appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, was announced during a morning staff call, a White House official said.
The staff secretary job manages the paper flow, circulates documents among senior staff for comment as part of the decision-making process and is often known as the ""nerve center"" of the White House.
It is a job once held by current Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was staff secretary for Republican George W. Bush's White House. Jessica Hertz has held the position in the Biden White House until now.
Tanden will report to White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.
""Neera has over two decades of experience in policy and management which are critical elements of the role. Her experience across domestic, economic and national security policy will be a key asset in this new role,"" the White House official said.
Tanden, previously an adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had been serving as president of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning think tank, until she became a senior adviser to President Joe Biden in May.

Tanden drew criticism from Republicans for her tweets, and her nomination to be director of the White House Office of Budget Management became imperiled after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not vote to approve her in the U.S. Senate, which is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.
She had withdrawn her name from consideration for the OMB job in March due to the opposition.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday said the United States should ""fundamentally alter"" the Senate filibuster on ""certain issues"" as his administration faces growing pressure from activists and Democrats to act on voting rights legislation.
The filibuster requires 60 of 100 U.S. senators https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-10-06 to agree on most legislation, a hurdle that has left the Democratic party powerless on key social issues given their narrow majority. In recent months, many Democrats have urged a carve-out to exempt a voting rights bill, after Republicans enacted dozens of state laws that Democrats say could restrict voting for many Americans, especially minorities.
""We're going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster,"" Biden said during a CNN townhall.
Support to alter the rule has grown among Democrats, as a splintered Republican party unites around a plan to block Biden's agenda in Congress by opposing his appointees and fiscal measures that usually get bipartisan support.
""The idea, for example, that my Republican friends say that we're going to default on the national debt because they're going to filibuster that and we need 10 Republicans to support us is the most bizarre thing ever heard,"" Biden said.
Biden, a former senator, has previously voiced objections to altering or abandoning the filibuster. He suggested he was open to considering it during the showdown over hiking the debt ceiling.
Several filibuster reform ideas have been floated in this administration that could stop short of a ban. Those include an exemption just for voting rights bills, limiting the number of filibusters against any one bill, or forcing those waging a filibuster to remain standing and speaking on the Senate floor until one side relents.

Privately, Biden has also suggested to top lawmakers in recent weeks that he might be open to discussing the issue once his infrastructure and social-spending bills pass, according to a person familiar with the matter.
On Wednesday, Senate Democrats tried to advance https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-republicans-poised-stop-democrats-voting-rights-bill-2021-10-20 a voting rights bill aimed at thwarting restrictive new voting laws enacted in Republican-led states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress blasted a U.S. Justice Department initiative to protect local school board officials from threats of violence by people angry at anti-racism curriculum and masking mandates, with one calling the policy a ""snitch line"" to report parents.
At a House Judiciary Committee hearing, they assailed Attorney General Merrick Garland about his Oct. 4 memo telling the FBI and federal prosecutors to address, with local law enforcement, a rising number of violent threats directed at members of school boards, fueled by claims that school curricula addressing racism are attacks on America.
""They're going to open up a snitch line on parents. Think about this,"" said Republican Representative Jim Jordan. He said the Justice Department was ""going to go after parents who object to some racist hate America curriculum.""
In his testimony Garland rejected the charge, saying the department aimed to prevent violent threats against members of school boards - typically low-profile and sometimes volunteer posts.
""We are only concerned about violence,"" Garland told lawmakers repeatedly. ""The Justice Department supports and defends the First Amendment right of parents to complain as vociferously as they wish about the education of their children."" 
The National School Boards Association in a Sept. 29 letter to President Joe Biden urged federal law enforcement to provide assistance to local boards to deal with the threats.
The letter cited a series of incidents, including an arrest during a board meeting in Illinois for aggravated battery and another in which someone shouted a Nazi slogan in Michigan during a meeting to protest the use of masks in schools to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Among the school boards across the country facing the most scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/world/us/partisan-war-over-teaching-history-racism-stokes-tensions-us-schools-2021-06-23 is one in Loudoun County, Virginia, located about an hour's drive from Washington, D.C. 
One board member there recently resigned, after months of accusations the school was teaching ""critical race theory,"" an academic doctrine that maintains racism is ingrained in U.S. law and institutions and that legacies of slavery and segregation have created an uneven playing field for Black Americans. 
Critics argue there is no evidence the theory, developed in law schools, is being taught in most - if any - primary schools.
Members of the Loudoun County School Board have received thousands of ""derogatory and threatening"" messages since May, a spokesman said.
A June 23 email used a racist slur against Black Americans, adding: ""Not in my school, not with my kids, keep your dirty ... hands away from my kids.""

Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin accused Republicans of deliberately misconstruing Garland's memo.
""Not a single member of this committee has recited a single sentence from your memo as violating anyone's rights,"" Raskin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden, standing beneath the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, called for patience on Thursday amid a political stalemate on getting Democratic proposals on voting rights and police reform through a divided Congress.
""I know the progress hasn't been fast enough,"" Biden told hundreds of people gathered to mark the 10th anniversary of the opening of the massive granite monument to the civil rights leader assassinated in 1968.
But Biden said he would keep the focus on ""discrimination, racial discrimination and discriminatory laws."" 
The Democratic president has set a strong agenda for Black Americans, but since taking office in January has not been able to push through voting rights and police reform laws in the face of solid Republican opposition.
Biden spoke a day after U.S. Senate Republicans blocked https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-republicans-poised-stop-democrats-voting-rights-bill-2021-10-20 a voting rights bill. It was the third time this year that Senate Democrats had tried to advance such a bill in response new state balloting restrictions fueled by Republican former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen 2020 presidential election.
Biden on Thursday made a rare allusion to those claims, saying legislators in Republican-led states that have passed restrictive voting laws were ""following my predecessor, the last president, into a deep, deep black hole and abyss.""
He singled out Martin Luther King Jr.'s native Georgia, a state that Trump falsely said he lost due to voter fraud.
""This struggle is no longer just over who gets to vote, and making it easier for eligible people to vote. It's about who gets to count the votes, or whether they should count at all,"" Biden said. 
""Jim Crow in the 21st century is now a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion,"" Biden said, referring to 19th- and 20th-century laws that violated Black Americans' civil rights.

Biden appeared at the memorial tribute with Vice President Kamala Harris - the first woman, Black and Asian American to win the United States' second highest office. 
The memorial stands near where King gave his famed ""I have a dream"" speech in 1963 during the modern-day struggle for civil rights.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A prosecutor on Thursday urged jurors in federal court to hold former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas ""accountable"" for campaign finance violations, in a trial over allegedly illicit efforts to conceal donations.
In his closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten said the government had demonstrated that Parnas used funds from Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev to contribute to U.S. candidates in various state and federal elections. Scotten said Parnas was trying to obtain licenses to operate cannabis companies.
""You saw the wires from Muraviev,"" Scotten told the jury. ""You saw how that money came out on the other side, finding its way into American elections, where the defendants thought they had bought influence to further their business.""
A Muraviev associate, Andrey Kukushkin, is being tried alongside Parnas. 
Defense attorneys also made closing arguments in the trial's ninth day in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
In his closing statement, Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, characterized his client as a passionate proponent of marijuana legalization who was ""in well over his head."" He argued that Muraviev's money funded business operations, not campaign contributions.
Parnas and Kukushkin face two counts of conspiring to make donations from a foreign national, and making the donations. Parnas alone faces four other counts, including making false statements to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).
Parnas, a 49-year-old Florida resident, and Kukushkin, who lives in California, have both pleaded not guilty. Both men are Ukraine-born U.S. citizens.
Prosecutors also accused Parnas of making two contributions through a shell company to conceal that his onetime business partner Igor Fruman was the true source of the funds, and of lying to the FEC about the funds. 
Bondy characterized Fruman's funding as a ""bona-fide capital investment"" in an energy company that Parnas and Fruman started together.
""There was no effort to make a contribution in the name of another, whatsoever,"" Bondy told jurors. 
Fruman, a Belarus-born U.S. citizen who lives in Florida, pleaded guilty in September to one count of soliciting campaign contributions from a foreign national. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 21.
The trial has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and Fruman played in helping Giuliani - former President Donald Trump's former personal attorney - investigate Democrat Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. Biden won the November election, denying Trump a second term in the White House.

Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas case is separate from a probe into whether the former New York City mayor violated lobbying laws while representing Trump. 
Giuliani, a former New York mayor, has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday announced he had appointed as the state's next top election official an attorney who represented former U.S. President Donald Trump in a Pennsylvania lawsuit challenging the 2020 presidential election.
John Scott, Abbott's appointee to be Texas' Secretary of State, briefly served as Trump's counsel in a November lawsuit that sought to block certification of Pennsylvania's election results. Scott withdrew from the case after a few days, according to court records. 
The case was one of dozens of lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed around the country, seeking to delegitimize President Joe Biden's resounding November victory by falsely claiming the election was stolen through widespread voting fraud. 
Abbott's press release announcing the Texas appointment did not mention Scott's involvement in the Pennsylvania election challenge. The Republican governor said Scott's ""decades of work in election law and litigation make him the ideal choice"" for the job. 
Scott did not immediately return calls for comment. When asked about Scott's work on the Pennsylvania lawsuit, a spokesperson for Abbott declined to comment beyond the governor's press release.
The Texas Senate must confirm the appointment. The state legislature just adjourned and will not meet again until 2023, so Scott will serve as interim secretary of state until then.

He will oversee next year's elections in Texas, in which Abbott himself will be up for reelection. Abbott will face two far-right Republican rivals in the primary, both of whom have challenged his conservative bona fides.
Abbott has moved farther to the right in recent months. In September, he signed into law a host of Republican-backed voting restrictions in the name of combating voting fraud and defended an audit that Trump demanded of 2020 presidential election results in four Texas counties.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump will launch his own social media app, TRUTH Social, that he said would ""stand up to Big Tech"" companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that have barred him from their platforms.
TRUTH Social will be created through a new company formed by a merger of the Trump Media and Technology Group and a special acquisition company (SPAC), according to a press release https://www.tmtgcorp.com/press-releases/announcement-10-20-2021 distributed by both organizations.
“We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced. This is unacceptable,"" Trump said in a written statement included in the release.
""I am excited to send out my first TRUTH on TRUTH Social very soon. TMTG was founded with a mission to give a voice to all. I'm excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech,"" he said.
The social network, set for a beta launch next month and full rollout in the first quarter of 2022, is the first of three stages in the company's plans, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release.
In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS cloud service and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud.
A Trump representative who declined to be named confirmed the contents of the TMTG news release to Reuters. Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington also tweeted a copy.
""For so long, Big Tech has suppressed conservative voices,"" the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., told Fox News in an interview. ""Tonight my father signed a definitive merger agreement to form what will ultimately be the Trump Media and Technology Group and TRUTH Social - a platform for everyone to express their feelings.""
Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms banned Trump from their services after hundreds of his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
That protest came after a speech by Trump in which he falsely claimed that his November election loss was due to widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.
The deal will list Trump Media & Technology Group on Nasdaq through a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp, a blank-check acquisition firm led by former investment banker Patrick Orlando.
Trump Media & Technology Group will receive $293 million in cash that Digital World Acquisition Corp had in trust, assuming no shareholder of the acquisition firm chooses to redeem their shares, according to the statement.
Orlando, who has worked at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and BT Capital Markets, has launched at least four SPACs and has plans for two more, according to his firm's website and regulatory filings.
But none of the SPACs have completed a deal yet. A China-based SPAC that Orlando led failed last month to complete a merger with Giga Energy Inc that would have valued the transportation solutions provider at $7.3 billion, because it could not deliver the cash required, according to regulatory filings.
Shareholder redemptions reduce the amount of cash that Digital World Acquisition Corp will have available to give to Trump Media & Technology Group at the closing of the deal.

The companies said in the statement that the completion of the merger is subject to redemptions not exceeding an agreed minimum cash requirement. The statement did not disclose what the requirement is, though that detail is typically contained in a regulatory filing that should follow on Thursday.
The deal values Trump Media & Technology Group at $875 million, including debt, according to the news release.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fundraising arms of the two major U.S. political parties poured money into Virginia last month ahead of a Nov. 2 election for governor that will signal whether Republicans have momentum in their bid to win control of the U.S. Congress next year.
Campaign finance disclosures filed on Wednesday showed that the Democratic National Committee (DNC), one of the main fundraising bodies for President Joe Biden's party, gave $1.1 million to the Democratic Party of Virginia.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) gave close to a half million dollars to the Republican state party in Virginia during the same period, a separate disclosure showed.
Biden won Virginia by 10 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election. But this year's race between Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin and former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is widely seen as a dead heat.
That has fueled Republican hopes - already bolstered by a recent drop in Biden's approval ratings - that the party could triumph in November 2022 congressional elections. Democrats currently control both congressional chambers by slim margins.
Virginia is also closely followed as a test of how Republicans will fare when former President Donald Trump - who lost to Biden last year but is still widely seen as the party's leader - is not on the ballot.
McAuliffe holds a marginal lead on Youngkin in opinion polls, according to a Real Clear Politics polling average. Current Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, cannot seek re-election because of a state rule barring governors from serving consecutive terms.
The DNC and RNC transferred smaller sums to their state parties last month in New Jersey, which also will hold a gubernatorial election on Nov. 2.

New Jersey Democratic Governor Phil Murphy has a large lead in opinion polls over Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator. 
Wednesday's disclosures, filed with the Federal Election Commission, showed the RNC raised $12.7 million in September, higher than the DNC's haul of $11.4 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Congressional Democrats and the White House scrambled on Wednesday to find agreement on measures to tackle climate change as part of President Joe Biden's centerpiece spending legislation ahead of coming UN climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland.
Democrats have negotiated for weeks over a spending bill on social and climate programs that, among other things, will invest in cleaner energy. But West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, whose support is vital to passing the bill in the U.S. Senate, opposes certain proposals, such as a plan to reward utilities that invest in renewable fuels and penalize those that do not. 
Instead, Democrats are considering a flurry of options, including boosting production tax credits for nuclear power and enhancing credits for carbon sequestration projects, according to three congressional sources involved in the discussions. 
Biden told lawmakers on Tuesday he wants agreements on both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the wider spending bill ahead of the UN talks. ""He was very clear that is the deadline he cares most about, is having something to take to Glasgow,"" one source said. 
Biden said he believed Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, another centrist Democrat, could agree to a spending bill in the range of $1.75 trillion to $1.9 trillion, down from $3.5 trillion, the source said.
Democrats need Manchin's vote in the 50-50 Senate to pass the spending bill with a simple majority. But he has opposed a $150 billion Clean Energy Payment Plan (CEPP), backed by Biden to reward power utilities for investments in renewable energy. West Virginia is a major producer of fossil fuels coal and natural gas.
Manchin also said this week https://www.reuters.com/world/us/manchin-says-carbon-tax-not-board-us-spending-bill-talks-2021-10-19 that a carbon tax is in not in play, a mechanism backed by several Democrats in the Senate. 
Biden floated putting $300 billion toward tax incentives for solar and wind and electric vehicles, one of the sources added. Then, instead of $150 billion for the Clean Energy Payment Plan that Manchin opposed, that amount would go to nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage.
The source said he did not think that alternative would be acceptable to some progressive Democrats. ""That has to be worked out,"" he said.

Representative Pramila Jayapal, a leading progressive, told reporters that Democrats have not yet nailed down exactly how to replace the clean energy plan. But she said they were looking at ways to ensure U.S. competitiveness and the reliability and resilience of energy systems. 
Boosts for hydrogen production were also being debated, two of the congressional sources said. Democrats are also considering providing block grants to states to encourage more green energy production, the sources said.

(Reuters) - U.S. authorities arrested 1.7 million migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border this fiscal year, the most ever recorded, according to a U.S. government source familiar with the numbers, underscoring the stark political and humanitarian challenges the Biden administration faces on immigration.
The current numbers for the 2021 fiscal year, which began last October, topped a previous high in 2000. The numbers were first reported by the Washington Post.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office in January, reversed many of the hard-line immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, promising a more ""humane"" approach to immigration policy. 
Biden's nominee to head U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Tucson, Arizona, Police Chief Chris Magnus, faced questions on Tuesday from Republican lawmakers who referred to the situation at the border as chaos and a crisis.
Adding to concerns was an influx of thousands of mostly Haitian migrants last month who crossed the Rio Grande river from Mexico and set up a makeshift camp under an international bridge in Del Rio, Texas. 
On the other side of the aisle, Democrats and immigration advocates have slammed Biden for his swift expulsions of many of those migrants back to Haiti, a country that has been devastated by violence, political crises and natural disasters. The administration also launched an investigation into the tactics of border patrol agents on horseback photographed and filmed in Del Rio trying to push back Haitian migrants along the river bank.
Many of the Haitians were returned under one sweeping Trump policy that Biden has kept in place. Known as Title 42, it was implemented in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to curb infections and allows most migrants to be quickly expelled https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/MEXICO/mopankddwva/index.html without a chance to seek asylum. 

Many of the arrests this fiscal year were repeat crossings, with some people expelled to Mexico turning around and trying again. 
A federal court has also ordered the Biden administration to reinstate another Trump-era policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which forced thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. immigration court hearings. The administration said it is taking steps to restart the program in November https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prepares-resume-trump-remain-mexico-asylum-policy-november-2021-10-15, pending agreement from Mexico.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Testimony concluded on Wednesday in the campaign finance trial of a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, a case that has provided a glimpse into the inner workings of political fundraising in the United States.
Prosecutors say Lev Parnas used money from a foreign national to donate to U.S. candidates and sought to conceal his identity for other contributions in the 2018 election cycle. 
The Ukraine-born Parnas has pleaded not guilty. 
A co-defendant on two of the counts, Andrey Kukushkin, has also pleaded not guilty.
Closing arguments are expected in Manhattan federal court on Thursday. 
The case has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and a former business partner, Igor Fruman, played in helping Giuliani, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, investigate Joe Biden's activities in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election. Biden, a Democrat, defeated Republican Trump's bid for re-election.
Prosecutors say Fruman and Parnas used funds from Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev to donate to candidates in states where the group sought licenses to operate cannabis businesses. Fruman pleaded guilty in September to one criminal count of soliciting campaign contributions from a foreign national. 

Over six days of testimony, prosecutors called as witnesses two politicians who solicited donations from Parnas, only to reject them due to doubts about the funds' origins. Parnas' defense has argued Muraviev's funds were used for business investments, not campaign contributions.
Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas trial is separate from a federal probe into whether the former New York City mayor violated lobbying laws while representing Trump. Giuliani has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing.

The district attorney in Westchester County, a suburb north of New York City, has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization property in recent months under a criminal investigation, the report said.
Also subpoenaed were records from Ossining, the town that sets property taxes on the opulent Trump National Golf Club Westchester, according to the New York Times.
Westchester District Attorney Mimi Rocah seems to be examining whether the company misrepresented the value of the private club to reduce its taxes, but it was unclear if Trump's own conduct was under scrutiny, the report said.
A spokesperson for Rocah's office declined to comment, as did Kerry Lawrence, a lawyer for Trump's golf club.
Trump's business has faced mounting accusations of financial misconduct since he took office, with the latest investigations threatening to undermine the Trump Organization's business relationships and complicate his political future as the Republican mulls a 2024 White House run.

The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, pleaded not guilty to tax fraud after Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance indicted the company in July, following a three-year investigation. 
New York Attorney General Letitia James in May joined Vance's probe, which Trump has referred to as a politically motivated ""witch hunt."" Vance, James, and Rocah are all Democrats.

788,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The move by Democrats to shrink President Joe Biden’s vision for the economy into a smaller package is turning to a debate over whether key benefits should be restricted to fewer, needier families -- potentially blunting both their impact and political support in suburban districts that will be battlegrounds in next year’s midterm election.
The White House has indicated Biden is open to stricter income caps for some programs, and a growing number of Democrats are warming to the idea as a way to cut the price tag to meet the demands of fiscal conservatives such as Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both pivotal votes in the Senate.
But lawmakers representing suburban areas on the coasts, where the cost of living can leave even higher-earning families feeling financially squeezed, warn that narrowing coverage risks undermining public support for programs central to the Democratic agenda. Those include an expanded child tax credit, assistance with child care expenses and tuition-free community college.
“Many of my constituents would be considered high income in West Virginia but still struggle in Westchester and Rockland counties to afford high-quality child care and higher education,” Representative Mondaire Jones, who represents suburban areas of New York’s Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Valley, said. “The federal government has historically done a bad job of defining poverty.”
To fit what started out as a $3.5 trillion package of taxes and spending into a framework of roughly $2 trillion, Democrats are mostly working with options that include eliminating components. One example: jettisoning a plan championed by Senator Bernie Sanders to add hearing, dental and vision benefits to Medicare.
Delaying programs or having them expire early and reducing benefit levels are other options. Lawmakers also can restrict who is eligible for new or expanded benefits.
Manchin has focused on means testing -- limiting benefits to people whose incomes are below a certain level -- and work requirements, saying the country must avoid “an entitlement mentality.” He also is seeking to cut some programs as he tries to reduce the cost of the economic package down to $1.5 trillion.
The struggle reprises a long-standing tension among advocates of social benefits between helping those most in need and more broadly supporting Americans as they confront financial stresses. Universal entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare are among the costliest government benefits, but politically sacrosanct because of their reach across society. Other assistance -- such a food stamps and Pell Grants for college -- are limited to poorer Americans, and historically have faced battles for funding.
The conflict can supersede ideological divisions within the Democratic party. The Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus joined with swing-district colleagues including New Jersey’s Representative Mikie Sherrill -- who in 2018 became the first Democrat in more than three decades elected to represent her affluent suburban constituency outside New York City -- to lift an income ceiling on the Democratic plan’s child-care benefit.
Economic Differences
The divisions reflect differences in the economic circumstances at home. In West Virginia, fewer than 10% of households had incomes above $100,000 in 2019, according to a U.S Census survey. In New Jersey, more than a quarter did, and the portion is higher still in the suburban regions surrounding New York and Philadelphia.
Jones and Representative Katie Porter, whose district is in California’s suburban Orange County, rejected any means testing, arguing in a Washington Post opinion article that broad-reaching programs “build solidarity” that “can withstand changing political winds.” 
“Republicans have been very effective historically at pitting groups of people against each other, particularly against lower-income people of color as being undue recipients of government relief,” Jones said in an interview. “We avoid those problems when everyone is covered by a social safety net.”
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden’s campaign, said she hasn’t tested public opinion on the impact of stricter means testing, but the resonance across society of family-life challenges such as child care, college tuition and health coverage is central to the Democratic agenda’s political appeal.
‘Secret Sauce’
“The secret sauce of the ‘Build Back Better’ program is that people think it helps them, that it deals with real problems and things that could happen to anyone, and Covid more than anything has shown that,” Lake said.
Biden and other Democrats have long promoted his economic agenda as geared toward bolstering the middle class, a broad category that surveys show as many as 90% of Americans consider themselves as a member.
The centrist House New Democrat coalition, a group of 95 lawmakers who in many cases represent higher-income areas, homed in on those promises as it pushed back against calls to lower the income limits for the child tax credit.
“Scaling back or limiting the accessibility of this critical pillar of President Biden’s agenda would hurt middle-class families and our children’s futures,” said the group’s chair, Representative Suzan DelBene, whose Washington state district includes suburban Seattle. She added that members of the coalition from battleground districts are “majority makers in the House, and it is our constituents who would be left behind.”
Middle Class
Couples earning up to $150,000 annually have been eligible under Biden’s March pandemic-relief bill for an expanded child tax credit of $250 or $300 per month per child, depending on the child’s age. Couples earning up to $182,000 can receive part of the credit. The New Democrats want the expanded child tax credits, which otherwise would expire at year-end, continued as is, and highlight it as a marquee middle-class tax cut.
Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser to former President Barack Obama who favors more aggressive means testing, said it is “the least-bad trade-off” and will keep a scaled-down package focused on areas where it is most effective. For instance, financial help for preschool is most effective in promoting education and future economic growth when it goes to families that otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford it or been forced into a low-quality school, he said.
Furman rejects arguments that targeting pieces of the package at the neediest will imperil them over time, citing the durability of means-tested benefits such as Medicaid and Pell Grants.
“I do not have reason to doubt a member of Congress’s view that they will benefit more in the next election by giving more money to more people,” Furman said. “But I seriously doubt that the long-term political survival of a program is impaired by means testing.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol voted unanimously on Tuesday in favor of contempt-of-Congress charges against Steve Bannon, a longtime aide to former President Donald Trump.
The seven Democratic and two Republican members of the House of Representatives Select Committee approved a report recommending the criminal charge by a 9-0 vote, calling it ""shocking"" that Bannon refused to comply with subpoenas seeking documents and testimony.
Approval of the report paved the way for the entire House to vote on whether to recommend contempt charges https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-stake-trump-allies-facing-contempt-congress-2021-10-14. That vote is set for Thursday, when the full, Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to approve the report.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said prosecutors there would ""evaluate the matter based on the facts and the law"" if the full House approves the recommendation.
""It's a shame that Mr. Bannon has put us in this position. But we won't take 'no' for an answer,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the panel's chairman, said in his opening remarks.
Bannon's attorney did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday evening.
Before leaving office in January, Trump pardoned Bannon https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pardons/trump-pardons-ex-aide-bannon-but-not-himself-or-family-idUSKBN29P0BE of charges he had swindled the Republican president's supporters. Trump has urged former aides subpoenaed by the panel to reject its requests, claiming executive privilege.
Bannon, through his lawyer, has said he will not cooperate with the committee until Trump's executive privilege claim is resolved by a court or through a settlement agreement.
At Tuesday's meeting, Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the select committee's vice chair, said: ""Mr. Bannon's and Mr. Trump's privilege arguments do appear to reveal one thing, however: They suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of Jan. 6th. And we will get to the bottom of that."" 
Thompson said Bannon ""stands alone"" among those subpoenaed in his refusal to cooperate.
More than 670 people have been charged with taking part in the riot, the worst attack on the U.S. government since the War of 1812. The select committee has issued 19 subpoenas.
""It's shocking to me that anyone would not do everything in their power to assist our investigation,"" Thompson said.
'ALL HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE'
In its report, the committee argued that Bannon made statements suggesting he knew ahead of time about ""extreme events"" on Jan. 6, when Congress was scheduled to certify Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election.
Bannon said on a Jan. 5 podcast that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow."" The next day, thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol.
Four people died on the day of the assault, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained in defense of the seat of Congress. Hundreds of police officers were injured and four have since taken their own lives.
Trump filed suit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sues-us-house-panel-investigating-jan-6-attack-court-document-2021-10-18 on Monday, alleging the committee made an illegal, unfounded and overly broad request for his White House records, which committee leaders rejected.. 
The U.S. Supreme Court said in 1821 that Congress has ""inherent authority"" to arrest and detain recalcitrant witnesses on its own, without the Justice Department's help. But it has not used that authority in nearly a century.
In 1927, the high court said the Senate acted lawfully in sending its deputy sergeant at arms to Ohio to arrest and detain the brother of the then-attorney general, who had refused to testify about a bribery scheme known as the Teapot Dome scandal.
It was not immediately clear how the Justice Department would respond to a House recommendation - there have been few accusations of contempt of Congress - but some House members have argued that letting Bannon ignore subpoenas would weaken congressional oversight of the executive branch.
""No one in the United States of America has the right to blow off a subpoena by a court or by the U.S. Congress,"" panel member Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, told reporters after the meeting. 

The select committee was created by House Democrats against the wishes of most Republicans. Two of the committee's nine members - Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger - are Republicans who joined House Democrats in voting to impeach Trump in January on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack in a fiery speech to supporters earlier that day. 
Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected Trump's claims that Biden won because of election fraud.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers are edging toward a deal on the scope of their cornerstone economic revival package and hope to reach a compromise as soon as this week, people briefed on the negotiations said on Tuesday.
Scrambling to broker an agreement, Biden met with 19 lawmakers on Tuesday in an unusually busy day of legislative negotiations. He aimed to secure what may be the signature effort of his administration, a multitrillion-dollar, two-bill legislative package that expands social safety net programs and infrastructure spending.
One source said a deal could be announced midweek if things go well; two others said the White House was hoping for an announcement in coming days. 
""After a day of constructive meetings, the President is more confident this evening about the path forward to delivering for the American people on strong, sustained economic growth that benefits everyone,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a written statement issued on Tuesday evening.
The talks centered on a ""shared commitment to the care economy, ensuring working families have more breathing room, addressing the climate crisis, and investing in industries of the future so that we can compete globally,"" Psaki said.
""There was broad agreement that there is urgency in moving forward over the next several days and that the window for finalizing a package is closing,"" she said.
A spending package that was originally estimated at $3.5 trillion over a decade could be reduced to $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion, said Representative Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus in the House of Representatives, after meeting with Biden.
Biden told Democrats in a private meeting that he believed a deal could be reached between $1.75 trillion and $1.9 trillion, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday evening.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also said Democrats aim to reach a framework deal this week. Speaking to reporters following a closed-door lunch with fellow Democrats, he said: ""There was universal agreement in that room that we have to come to an agreement, and we want to get it done this week.""
A deal is likely to be far less ambitious than Biden's original plan. Initiatives in that proposal that may see cuts include $322 billion for affordable housing, money for paid family leave and some $400 billion earmarked to increase home-based care for the elderly and disabled, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Biden has told lawmakers that a program providing free community college is on the chopping block and a child tax credit may be extended for fewer years than planned, according to people familiar with the discussions. 
All of the people who spoke to Reuters warned that negotiations were fragile, still under way and that a deal could still collapse.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has set Oct. 31 as the deadline for the House to pass a $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal that the Senate has already approved and has broad bipartisan support.
Biden met on Tuesday with House progressives, who have been unwilling to pass the infrastructure bill unless it is coupled with the larger budget bill that would fund Biden's campaign pledges on climate, inequality and social programs.
""We all feel still even more optimistic about getting to an agreement,"" to get a large measure of what they wanted months ago, Jayapal said.
She said there still weren't ""final"" details on major portions of the initiative, including on climate change. Another progressive, Representative Ro Khanna, said Biden's plan for universal preschool remained a priority.
The president also met Tuesday with moderate Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have voiced concern about the size of the bill and pushed Biden to reduce the original cost. They have a virtual veto over his agenda because both chambers of Congress are controlled only narrowly by Democrats. Republicans largely oppose the larger social-spending bill.
Asked about the size of the spending bill, Manchin yelled, ""I'm at $1.5"" trillion to reporters in Congress on Tuesday evening. 
Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who attended a White House meeting with another group of moderates, said afterward, ""I think we're making really good progress, better progress than I ever thought we were making.""

One of Biden's major selling points in last year's presidential campaign was his ability to find a middle ground at a time of deep political polarization, touting his 36 years as a moderate Democratic U.S. senator from Delaware.
Weeks of negotiations nonetheless failed to bridge the gap on the spending bill. Biden said on Oct. 1 that he would find an agreement ""whether it's in six minutes, six days or in six weeks,"" but White House officials were increasingly concerned as the weeks ticked by.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol voted unanimously on Tuesday in favor of contempt-of-Congress charges against Steve Bannon, a longtime aide to former President Donald Trump.
The seven Democratic and two Republican members of the House of Representatives Select Committee approved a report recommending the criminal charge by a unanimous 9-0 vote, calling it ""shocking"" that Bannon refused to comply with subpoenas seeking documents and testimony.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A $325,000 donation by a company run by two former associates of Rudy Giuliani triggered an internal inquiry at a group supporting former President Donald Trump, a former official for the group testified in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. 
The testimony by Joseph Ahearn, who worked as finance director for the America First Action super PAC, came on the sixth day of the trial of Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate who is accused of breaking campaign finance laws. Closing arguments in the case are expected on Thursday.
Prosecutors say Parnas and a business partner, Igor Fruman, made the May 2018 donation to America First Action in the name of the company the pair created in order to conceal that they were the true source of the funds - a violation of campaign finance law. Parnas pleaded not guilty, while Fruman pleaded guilty in September. 
Ahearn, the first witness called by the defense after prosecutors rested their case on Tuesday, said he sought contributions from Parnas because of his prior donations to Trump. He did not elaborate on why America First Action's internal compliance unit became suspicious of the gift.
Super PACs are groups that can raise and spend unlimited funds as long as they do not coordinate with candidates' campaigns.

The case has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and Fruman played in helping Giuliani - Trump's former personal attorney - investigate Joe Biden's activities in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election. Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump in last year's presidential election.
Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas case is separate from a federal inquiry into whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - The chair of the Iowa Democratic Party said on Tuesday he received racist messages and emails, including a threat of lynching, after writing an opinion piece critical of Republican former President Donald Trump.
Ross Wilburn, who is Black and sits in the state legislature, told reporters that after his piece ran in the Des Moines Register on Oct. 9, the same weekend Trump was in town for a rally, he received two phone messages and an email that used racial epithets and, in one case, threatened him with violence.
""Unfortunately, these kinds of threats are not uncommon for myself or other people of color serving in public roles,"" Wilburn said.
The incident, which he said is being investigated by Ames, Iowa, police, is the latest example of threats and harassment against public officials in the highly polarized U.S. political environment.
On Monday, the National Association of County and City Health Officials asked the U.S. Department of Justice for help protecting public health officers targeted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by opponents of measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home orders, mask-wearing and vaccines. 
The organization said at least 300 public health department leaders had left their positions since the pandemic began, many because of threats and verbal abuse.
Educators are also coming under fire, amid protests and violent rhetoric over claims fueled by right-wing media that schools are teaching critical race theory, an academic model for describing systemic racism that is little used in public schools but that opponents say makes white children feel bad about themselves.
Educators have also been threatened over public health measures, including mask-wearing at school.
In Iowa, the threats and harassment against Wilburn were condemned by state Republican leaders.
""This type of hate must never be tolerated,"" Republican Governor Kim Reynolds wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Whoever is responsible should be held accountable. Racism of any kind is unacceptable and not who we are as Iowans.""

Iowa Republican Party Chair Jeff Kaufmann said he is pleased that authorities are investigating the threats.
""I strongly condemn the racist threats made toward Chair Wilburn,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We can have a spirited debate on issues and candidates without threats of violence.""

The spill killed wildlife, blackened the coastline and forced officials to close beaches south of Los Angeles. On Friday, the Coast Guard said about 588 barrels (25,000 gallons) of crude oil was spilled, about a fifth as much as it initially estimated.
In its statement on Saturday, the Coast Guard said an investigation had determined that the MSC DANIT was involved in the anchor-dragging incident ""during a heavy weather event"" that impacted Long Beach and Los Angeles ports in January. 
As a result, it said, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A., which operates the vessel, and Dordellas Finance Corporation, the ship's owner, have been designated by the Coast Guard as parties of interest in the investigation. 
The designation allows the companies to be represented by counsel, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and call witnesses who are relevant to the investigation, the Coast Guard said. 
MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Dordellas Finance Corporation could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Coast Guard said the investigation was ongoing and that ""multiple pipeline scenarios"" as well as additional vessels of interest continue to be investigated. 
 Amplify Energy  (NYSE:AMPY), which owns the pipeline, has said it was ""pulled like a bowstring"" about 105 feet (32 meters) from where it should have been.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump on Monday sued the U.S. congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, claiming members made an illegal request for his White House records.
Trump, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asserted that materials sought by the House of Representatives committee are covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
""The Committee's requests are unprecedented in their breadth and scope and are untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,"" Trump's lawyer Jesse Binnall wrote in the lawsuit.
Committee members Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, and Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said in a written statement issued in response to Trump's lawsuit that the former president was seeking to ""delay and obstruct"" their investigation.
""It's hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election,"" Cheney and Thompson said in the statement.
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the seat of Congress on Jan. 6 in a failed bid to prevent lawmakers from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory. More than 600 people face criminal charges stemming from the event.
Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House on a charge of inciting the attack on the Capitol in a fiery speech at a rally earlier that day. He was acquitted by the Senate.
Biden earlier this month authorised the National Archives to turn over an initial batch of documents requested by the select committee. The Archives has said it would turn over the requested material next month, according to Trump's lawsuit, which seeks an injunction halting that process.
Michael Stern, a former congressional lawyer, said Trump's strategy may be to use litigation to stall the select committee's work.
""If he is willing to pay for the lawyers, Trump could delay the production of records for some time,"" Stern said.
The Jan. 6 committee has also issued subpoenas demanding testimony from Trump advisers, including political strategist Steve Bannon.
Bannon has refused to provide testimony until Trump's assertion of executive privilege has been resolved by a court or through negotiations with the committee.

The committee said last week it would formally ask the U.S. Justice Department to bring criminal charges against Bannon because of his defiance of the subpoena.
The committee has subpoenaed other officials including former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, Trump former chief of staff Mark Meadows, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and former Defense Department official Kash Patel.

798,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats are proposing requiring banks to disclose to the IRS those accounts that have total annual inflows or withdrawals of at least $10,000, in an attempt to catch tax evasion by the wealthy and boost federal revenues.
The plan would help fund President Joe Biden’s multi-trillion dollar economic agenda, potentially raising $700 billion and reducing the need for tax increases to offset the cost of new social spending. 
Lawmakers are rejiggering the proposal after a wave of criticism by Republicans and bank lobbyists. The $10,000 threshold replaces the $600 proposed by the Biden administration. It would exclude wage deposits and payments under federal programs -- so that only accounts with “opaque” income streams would be reported to the government, according to a fact sheet from the Treasury Department released Tuesday.
Democrats say there is precedent for requiring banks to report account information to the federal government. The Treasury is proposing two new data points -- the sum of all the deposits and the total value of withdrawals -- to add to a tax form where banks already report interest amounts and other account data to the IRS.
“Today’s new proposal reflects the Administration’s strong belief that we should zero in on those at the top of the income scale who don’t pay the taxes they owe, while protecting American workers by setting the bank account threshold at $10,000 and providing an exemption for wage earners like teachers and firefighters,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement Tuesday.
Caucus Appeal
Increasing IRS enforcement to collect taxes that are already owed is an idea with widespread support among Democrats. Moderates, including Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, have both backed giving the IRS more ability to go after tax cheaters. However, the bank account idea was ultimately left out of the House version of the legislation drafted last month.
It has faced strong criticism from Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it is tantamount of giving the IRS “new snooping powers” and treating “normal American households like everybody is under audit.”
The Treasury has said it would help them find high-income taxpayers who earn money from small businesses, rental properties and other ways that aren’t directly reported to the IRS. The IRS estimates that taxpayers pay 99% of their taxes owed when there is third-party reporting, like there is for wages and salaries. That figure drops to 45% when there isn’t such verification. The Treasury estimates that uncollected taxes could total as much as $7 trillion over the next decade.
The Treasury said the information will only be used to target high-income taxpayers and that audit rates among those earning less than $400,000 a year won’t increase. Wealthy individuals, according to the fact sheet, have much more “discretion of whether they pay their taxes” because they are more likely to earn “less visible streams” of income that aren’t automatically reported to the IRS, as is the case for wages and Social Security recipients.
Two Numbers
The Treasury estimates that tax compliance rates are far higher among low- and middle-income households compared with top-earning ones and that tax evasion by the top 1% of taxpayers exceeds $160 billion annually. 
“If you don’t have $10,000 above your paycheck, Social Security income or the like coming in or going out, there’s no additional reporting,” Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden said in prepared remarks for a press call Tuesday afternoon. “This proposal is about reporting only two numbers once per year. The total amount going into an account, and the total amount going out of it.”
Wyden is also slated to say that the plan has carve-outs for when an individual spends a significant amount for a major purchase and does not create any new surveillance for digital currency, according to the prepared remarks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday said he would support allowing the U.S. Treasury secretary to unilaterally extend the limit on federal borrowing, with Congress then empowered to vote on vetoing such decisions.
""It's a good option,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters in a weekly press conference. He said the Treasury secretary should be allowed ""to make a judgment.""
Hoyer's remarks come as Congress faces an early December deadline for either raising the borrowing limit or pushing the federal government into an unprecedented default on its debt. 
The task has been complicated by Republicans, who say they do not want to see a default but at the same time have voted against a debt limit increase, hoping Democrats figure out a way of passing such legislation on their own in the deeply divided Congress.
Legislation to alter the way Washington increases its borrowing authority, which now has a $28.9 trillion limit, likely would face opposition in the Senate, where 60 out of the chamber's 100 votes are needed to advance most legislation.
Democrats have been opposed to using a ""budget reconciliation"" tool to approve a debt limit increase without any Republican input, saying the complex procedure is both too time consuming and would set a bad precedent.
On a related matter, Hoyer said the House was still aiming to pass by the end of this month a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure investment bill along with a Democrats-only multi-billion-dollar measure expanding social programs and tackling climate change.
""We are committed to meeting the deadline of Oct. 31. We're working very hard to have both of those bills ready to be passed by the House of Representatives before that date,"" Hoyer said.

However, the House has failed to meet a previously set end-of-September deadline for these bills, as moderates and progressives in the Democratic Party fight over the size and scope of the larger bill.
Republicans have attacked the large spending initiatives being sought by Democrats and have argued that is the reason they will not vote for a debt limit increase, even though it mainly finances spending they voted for during the Trump administration.
