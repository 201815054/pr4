WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Colin Powell, the first Black U.S. secretary of state, a top military officer and a national security adviser, died on Monday at age 84 due to complications from COVID-19. He was fully vaccinated, his family said.
Powell had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and early-stage Parkinson's disease, said a close friend who asked not to be named. The blood cancer reduces the body's ability to fight infection and puts people at higher risk for a severe case of the virus.
Powell served three Republican presidents in senior posts and ascended to leadership of the U.S. military as it was regaining its vigor after the trauma of the war in Vietnam, where he served two tours as an Army officer. 
""We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American,"" his family said, thanking the staff of the military hospital near Washington who treated Powell but providing few details about his illness. 
He was the top U.S. military officer when American-led forces drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991 and the chief U.S. diplomat in 2003 when Washington relied on erroneous intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify its invasion of Iraq.
The son of Jamaican immigrants who rose to the top of the national security establishment, Powell himself acknowledged that his presentation of that spurious U.S. intelligence would stain his record. 
In a brief statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the Powell family said he had died on Monday morning from COVID-19, had been fully vaccinated against the disease and thanked the medical staff at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who treated him.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said hospitalization and death are ""extremely rare"" among the fully vaccinated and said Powell's death underscored that underlying health issues and other diseases can lead to greater risk from the virus.
“He had two very serious underlying conditions. And unfortunately, (vaccination) didn’t work. God love him,” President Joe Biden told reporters at a White House event on education. He again implored all Americans to get vaccinated. 
Biden earlier praised Powell in a statement. 
""Colin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat,"" Biden, describing Powell as a ""patriot of unmatched honor and dignity"" and a man who ""could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobody's business.""
Former President George W. Bush, a Republican who named Powell as U.S. secretary of state, noted that ""many presidents relied on General Powell's counsel and experience.""
""He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice,"" Bush said, referring to a medal viewed as the U.S. government's highest civilian award.
IRAQ WARS
Powell served as U.S. national security adviser under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1987 to 1989. As a four-star Army general, he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Republican President George H.W. Bush during the 1991 Gulf War in which U.S.-led forces expelled Iraqi troops from neighboring Kuwait.
The New York native considered running for president in 1996, but his wife Alma's worries about his safety helped him decide otherwise. In 2008, he broke with his party to endorse Democrat Barack Obama, who became the first Black person elected to the White House.
Illustrating his deep misgivings about the evolution of the Republican Party as it has moved to the right, Powell endorsed Democrats Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Biden last year against Donald Trump. Powell called Trump a liar who presented a danger to the United States.
Biden, who painted his 2020 presidential candidacy against Trump as a fight for the United States' soul, thanked Powell for bucking his Republican Party to back him.
""I am forever grateful for his support of my candidacy for president and for our shared battle for the soul of the nation,"" Biden said.
Powell will forever be associated with his controversial presentation on Feb. 5, 2003, to the U.N. Security Council, making Bush's case that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein constituted an imminent danger to the world because of the country's stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.
He admitted later that the presentation was rife with inaccuracies and twisted intelligence provided by others in the Bush administration and represented ""a blot"" that will ""always be a part of my record.""

Richard Boucher, one of Powell's closest aides at the State Department, praised him for admitting the mistake.
""The honorable thing is to say 'I made a mistake.' Powell did that. He owned it. He owned his mistakes as much as his incredible successes,"" Boucher said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol said on Monday that it rejected Steve Bannon's arguments for failing to cooperate with the probe, as the panel pursues a contempt of Congress charge against the long-time adviser to former President Donald Trump.
Trump has claimed that materials and testimony sought by the House of Representatives Select Committee are covered by executive privilege, a legal doctrine that protects the confidentially of some White House communications.
Bannon, through his lawyer, has said he will not cooperate with the committee until Trump's executive privilege claim is resolved by a court or through a settlement agreement.
In its report released on Monday making the case for criminal contempt charges against Bannon, the committee said Bannon ""relied on no legal authority to support his refusal to comply in any fashion,"" and said his testimony is critical because he appears to have ""had some foreknowledge about extreme events that would occur"" on Jan. 6.
According to the report, Bannon in a podcast on Jan. 5 told his listeners, ""All hell is going to break loose tomorrow... So many people said, 'Man, if I was in a revolution, I would be in Washington.' Well, this is your time in history.""
The Select Committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday evening to vote on the report recommending that the House cite Bannon for criminal contempt of Congress and refer him to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution.
The U.S. Justice Department has not said whether it plans to prosecute Bannon for contempt of Congress, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
Bannon's attorney, Robert Costello, did not respond to a request for comment on the committee's argument.
The attack on the Capitol by thousands of Trump supporters took place as Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election victory over Trump, delaying that process for several hours as then-Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress, staff and journalists fled. More than 600 people face criminal charges stemming from the event.

The committee also said that Bannon has ""had multiple roles"" relevant to its investigation, including helping to construct and participate in the ""stop the steal"" public relations effort that helped motivate the Jan. 6 attack.
""Stop the steal"" refers to Trump's false claims that Biden's victory was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration rejected those claims as false.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on abortion, calling the Republican-backed measure plainly unconstitutional and specifically designed to evade judicial scrutiny.
The administration asked the Supreme Court to quickly reverse a decision this month by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a judge's order blocking the law while litigation over the statute's legality continues. The justices in a 5-4 Sept. 1 decision let the law take effect in a separate challenge brought by abortion providers in the state.
The Texas measure, one of a series of restrictive abortion laws passed at the state level in recent years, bans the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant.
The Justice Department, which filed suit last month in a bid to stop the law, told the Supreme Court in a filing that the 5th Circuit's action enables the ongoing violation by the state of Texas ""of this court's precedents and its citizens' constitutional rights."" 
""Texas's insistence that no party can bring a suit challenging S.B. 8 amounts to an assertion that the federal courts are powerless to halt the state's ongoing nullification of federal law. That proposition is as breathtaking as it is dangerous,"" the Justice Department added, using the formal name of the Texas law.
The filing also said that the Supreme Court could decide to take up and hear arguments in the case even before lower courts have issued their own final rulings ""given the importance and urgency of the issues"" involved. 
The Supreme Court signaled that it will consider resolving the dispute quickly. In addition to asking Texas officials for a response to the Justice Department's request by midday on Thursday, the justices also fast-tracked their consideration of whether to immediately take up a separate https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abortion-providers-ask-us-supreme-court-intervene-challenge-texas-law-2021-09-23 challenge to the law by abortion providers in the state. 
The Texas measure makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest. It also gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the fetus. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked by making it more difficult to directly sue the state. 
Under the law, individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits. Critics have said this provision lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters, a characterization its proponents reject.
The Biden administration's lawsuit argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy as recognized in the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. It also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.
In his Oct. 6 ruling blocking the law, U.S. Judge Robert Pitman found that the measure was likely unconstitutional and designed to avoid judicial scrutiny. Pitman said he would ""not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.""
The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. When the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts dissented along with the three liberal justices, expressing skepticism about how the measure is enforced.

Roberts said he would have blocked the law's enforcement at that point ""so that the courts may consider whether a state can avoid responsibility for its laws in such a manner.""
The Supreme Court already is set to consider a major abortion case on Dec. 1 in a dispute centering on Mississippi's law banning abortions starting at 15 weeks of pregnancy, Mississippi has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling in the Mississippi case is due by the end of next June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiators of a U.S. bill to invest up to $3.5 trillion to expand social programs and attack climate change gave hints of progress on Monday, but some Democrats were resigned to the increasing likelihood that a proposal to reduce carbon emissions will be weakened or scrapped.
""Over the last weekend I held many productive conversations"" with lawmakers and the White House, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said. ""We still have work to do,"" he added, without providing details in a Senate floor speech.
The legislation is a pillar of President Joe Biden's domestic agenda. He was set to speak on Monday with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, whose support for the wide-ranging proposal is key to its passage.
Manchin, a moderate from West Virginia, has been an outspoken critic of the bill, saying it spends too much taxpayer money and contains climate change provisions that would hurt his state's coal mining industry.
Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a leading voice for reducing emissions blamed for the wildfires, floods and other natural disasters now confronting the warming planet, was asked by reporters whether the Clean Energy Payment Program (CEPP) included in Biden's $3.5 trillion initiative was in jeopardy.
""It remains to be seen but I think it's worth planning for that,"" Whitehouse said.
Several Democratic senators were already touting other steps contained in the bill aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions in a sign that the CEPP, which would reward utilities that add more clean energy capacity like solar and wind power and fine those that do not, was in trouble.
""I think it makes the methane pollution fee and the carbon pollution fee all the more essential,"" Whitehouse added.
Moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner urged prompt House of Representatives passage of a separate, $1 trillion infrastructure investment bill already approved by the Senate, while awaiting a deal on the larger bill.
""People want us to put points on the board,"" Warner told reporters. He gave as examples the need to pass the infrastructure measure or a bill making major high-tech investments so that the United States can compete more effectively with China.
The Virginia Democrat added that doing so would boost the candidacy of Democrat Terry McAuliffe's gubernatorial bid in that state in next month's election. 
With virtually no chance of winning over any of the Senate's 50 Republicans for the larger bill, Democrats are employing a special ""budget reconciliation"" strategy that would allow them to waive a 60-vote threshold required to advance most bills in the 100-member U.S. Senate.

All 50 Democrats would have to vote ""yes"" on the bill, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on hand to break any 50-50 ties. Another Democratic moderate, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, also has voiced opposition to the bill as currently written.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is aiming for passage of the social investment bill and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill by the end of this month.

(Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump testified under oath on Monday as part of a civil lawsuit brought by protesters who allege they were assaulted by his security guards in New York in 2015, a lawyer for the protesters told a news conference.
Trump sat for a videotaped deposition on Monday morning at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, said Benjamin Dictor, a lawyer who sought Trump's testimony in the long-running dispute.
""The president was exactly how you would expect him to be, he answered questions the way you would expect Mr. Trump to answer questions, and conducted himself in a manner that you would expect Mr. Trump to conduct himself,"" Dictor said.
New York Supreme Court Justice Doris Gonzalez last week ordered Trump to sit for the videotaped deposition. In New York state, a trial-level court is called a Supreme Court.
Trump said in a statement he was pleased to have provided testimony in the case.
""After years of litigation, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to tell my side of this ridiculous story—Just one more example of baseless harassment of your favorite President,"" Trump said. 
A group of protesters brought the lawsuit in 2015, alleging that Trump's security guards attacked them while they were demonstrating outside Trump Tower in September of that year over the then-presidential candidate's comments that Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists.
“They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists,” Trump said during the June 16 speech announcing his candidacy.
Trump faces several civil lawsuits over conduct from before and during his 2017-2021 presidency.
Earlier this month, a New York state judge gave Trump a Dec. 23 deadline to undergo questioning in a defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on ""The Apprentice."" 
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Zervos had accused Trump of subjecting her to unwanted kissing and groping when she sought career advice in 2007, two years after her appearance on his reality television show.
Zervos had sued Trump in January 2017, but the case remains unresolved in part because Trump argued while in the White House that a sitting president could not be sued.

That issue became moot after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, which made Trump a private citizen, New York's highest court ruled in March.
Trump's lawyer in that case, Alina Habba, has denied Zervos' allegations, calling the lawsuit frivolous.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Russian businessman funded an account used by two ex-associates of Rudy Giuliani to donate to U.S. political campaigns, according to documents shown in court on Monday. 
Prosecutors presented the financial records to a Manhattan federal court jury in the second week of the trial of one of the former associates, Lev Parnas, on charges of violating campaign finance laws. 
Prosecutors say the Ukraine-born Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, illegally funneled money from Moscow-based businessman Andrey Muraviev to candidates in U.S. states where the group was seeking licenses to operate cannabis businesses. Parnas pleaded not guilty. 
Two Muraviev-owned firms wired $1 million to an account held by Fruman's FD Import & Export Corp between June and December 2018, bank statements showed. 
That account then paid off more than 99% of the balance on a credit card account Parnas, Fruman and a company they founded used to make more than $150,000 in donations to candidates and committees ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election, the records showed. 
Fruman pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws in September. 
Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, said in opening arguments last week that Muraviev's money was used for business ventures, not Parnas' campaign contributions. 

The case has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and Fruman played in helping Giuliani - Donald Trump's former personal attorney and a former New York City mayor - investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. Biden, a Democrat, defeated Republican Trump's re-election bid. 
Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas case is separate from a federal inquiry into whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer. Giuliani has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing

U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
""Colin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He was committed to our nation's strength and security above all. Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity...
""From his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation's policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else - in uniform and out - and it earned him the universal respect of the American people.
""Having repeatedly broken racial barriers, blazing a trail for others to follow in federal government service, Colin was committed throughout his life to investing in the next generation of leadership.""
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
""General Powell was an exemplary soldier and an exemplary patriot. He was at the center of some of the most consequential events of our lifetimes.... And although he'd be the first to acknowledge that he didn't get every call right, his actions reflected what he believed was best for America and the people he served.
""Along the way, General Powell helped a generation of young people set their sights higher. He never denied the role that race played in his own life and in our society more broadly. But he also refused to accept that race would limit his dreams, and through his steady and principled leadership, helped pave the way for so many who would follow.""

""He was a great public servant, starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam. Many presidents relied on General Powell's counsel and experience. 
""He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend.""
FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR
""Colin Powell was one of the finest men I ever met. And, perhaps, one of the finest Americans never to be president.
""Both in the military and in government he led with calm authority, and was an inspiration to all those who served alongside him.
""During the first Gulf War – as Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff – we could not have wished for a stronger ally, nor one who commanded such affection and respect from our own Armed Forces.
""Throughout his long and exceptional career, Colin served with honor and distinction. He was a true public servant, who I was proud to call a friend.""

""If there's anything worthy of debate in this chamber, it should be protecting and strengthening our democracy,"" Schumer, a Democrat, said of the bill to expand voters' access to mail-in ballots and other steps.
If Republicans prevent debate on the bill, some Democrats are likely to urge Schumer to find a way around the Senate's filibuster procedure that requires at least 60 votes in the evenly split, 100-member chamber for most legislation to advance. 
Such ideas include exempting the measure from the filibuster. Others include requiring that senators stay in the chamber and talk until the filibuster is abandoned - the way it used to be done.
The bill is in response to voting restrictions passed in Republican-led states following former President Donald Trump's repeated false claims he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of widespread electoral fraud.
His claims were rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and Trump's own Justice Department.
Since late last year, a number of Republican-controlled states have enacted or advanced bills to tighten access to the polls and make it easier to challenge election results.

Democrats and voting rights advocates have denounced the measures as partisan power grabs that will make it harder for Black and Hispanic voters - important voting blocs for Democrats - to cast ballots.
Election experts have said voting fraud is rare in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to move forward with policing reform, telling a gathering honoring slain officers that their profession is called on to do too much.
""We expect you to be everything,"" Biden said in a speech in front of the U.S. Capitol, mourning 491 law enforcement officers who died at work in 2019 and 2020. ""We expect everything of you.
""And it's beyond the capacity of anyone to meet the total expectations,"" he said. ""Being a cop today is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been.""
Biden's own drafting of his remarks came as he learned of a shooting earlier on Saturday in Houston, which left one deputy dead and two injured. Biden expressed sorrow for the incident.
Biden has been a loyal ally to law enforcement, dating back to his days in the Senate when he crafted a 1994 crime bill with their help.
But his support for broad reforms following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by an officer created some tension with police groups opposed to some of the reforms promoted by Democrats.
The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), a major officers' union which sponsored Saturday's event, endorsed Biden's Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
Efforts to reach a bipartisan police reform deal failed in September https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-are-refusing-back-police-reforms-trump-supported-white-house-2021-09-22, marking a setback for the Democratic president, who campaigned on taking such action.
Biden on Saturday credited the FOP with ""sincerely trying to reach an agreement."" He added, ""We haven't gotten there,"" but ""must"" do so.
The president said he would work to get police departments the support and funding they need. Biden has already asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars to help law enforcement agencies with training and recruitment, 
Biden has also said he will explore further executive actions https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-wants-keep-working-police-reform-bill-willing-take-executive-action-2021-09-22 he can take to help hold police officers accountable for breaking the law. Officers, he said, need more backup from mental-health and other professionals to deal with issues they face on the streets.
Biden credited law enforcement agencies with upholding U.S. democracy during the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.
And he repeated his proposed measures to reduce gun violence, including against officers, a set of efforts that has also largely stalled given insufficient support in Congress, which Democrats control by only narrow margins in both chambers.
Nearly 50 officers have been killed this year by gunfire, according to the FOP, more than in all of 2020.

The National Peace Officers' Memorial Service began in 1982 as a small gathering of approximately 120 survivors and supporters of law enforcement. It has since turned into a series of events, attracting thousands of officers and the families of victims to the nation's capital each year.
The White House issued a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff at public buildings on Saturday.

Adam Laxalt https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-nevada/its-all-relative-family-blasts-republican-running-for-nevada-governor-idUSKCN1MX2NR, who lost his bid for the governorship, said he ultimately received a $10,000 donation from Parnas associate Igor Fruman shortly before the Nov. 6, 2018 election. But he said his campaign did not accept the funds because of doubts about the true source and concerns the contribution was illegal.
Prosecutors called Laxalt to testify in Parnas' Manhattan federal court trial. The Ukraine native has been charged with illegally funneling money from a Russian businessman to the campaigns of candidates for office in states where Parnas, Fruman and associates were seeking licenses to run cannabis businesses.
Laxalt said he met Giuliani, who was then personal attorney for former President Donald Trump, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington two months before the 2018 state election. Laxalt, a Republican, said he then accompanied Giuliani to a balcony at the hotel, where a group including Parnas were smoking cigars and drinking. 
Parnas ""immediately offered to help my campaign,"" Laxalt told the jury in the case overseen by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken. 
There was no suggestion that Giuliani did anything illegal by introducing Laxalt to Parnas. Prosecutors are separately probing whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer. Giuliani has not been charged with any crime and has denied wrongdoing. 
The case has drawn attention because of Parnas' and former co-defendant Fruman's roles helping Giuliani investigate President Joe Biden's activities in Ukraine. Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump in the Republican's 2020 bid for re-election. 

Giuliani's lawyer has said Parnas' case and the lobbying probe are unrelated.

""Senator Manchin has clearly expressed his concerns about using taxpayer dollars to pay private companies to do things they’re already doing,"" Manchin spokesperson Sam Runyon told Reuters in a statement.
""He continues to support efforts to combat climate change while protecting American energy independence and ensuring our energy reliability,"" Runyon said.
The White House had no comment on the New York Times report on Friday evening.

Both Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a centrist from Arizona, have objected to the initial $3.5 trillion price tag for Biden's spending plan to fund social programs and fight climate change. As a result, the president faces a difficult balancing act in trying to bring down the cost but not alienate progressive Democrats who also are essential to passing the legislation. In the evenly split Senate, every Democratic vote will be needed for passage.
Following a meeting this month on Capitol Hill with his fellow Democrats, Biden suggested the bill could be trimmed to around $2 trillion over 10 years.

The agency accepted a complaint against the state over its oversight of Port Arthur, Texas-based Oxbow Calcining, which produces petroleum coke from oil refinery byproducts. 
An environmental advocacy group has alleged the state's air quality regulator violated residents' civil rights by allowing the plant to operate without a scrubber to capture sulfur dioxide. Between 2016 and 2019, the plant released about 22 million pounds per year of sulfur dioxide, an eye and lung irritant, over predominantly low-income and Black areas.
A spokesperson for regulator Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said it was reviewing the complaint. 
“I am encouraged by the response of the EPA to investigate our concerns,"" said John Beard, a former Port Arthur city councilor and founder of advocacy group Port Arthur Community Action Network. 
The plant is part of William Koch's Oxbow Corp, one of the largest recyclers of oil refinery and natural gas byproducts. The company was not immediately available for comment. 

Within a three mile radius of the Port Arthur plant, the population is 98% people of color and 62% lower income, the group said. 
EPA said it would pursue alternative dispute and informal resolution processes to settle the complaint and, if unable to reach an agreement, would look to deliver preliminary findings within 180 days of launching the investigation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A White House commission studying potential changes to the U.S. Supreme Court said expanding the number of justices would pose ""considerable"" risks and might further politicize the court, according to preliminary draft documents released on Thursday.
Members of the commission formed by President Joe Biden appeared more positive about the benefits of imposing term limits and staggering appointments out over time. But they noted it might not be possible to make such a change without amending the U.S. Constitution.
The documents are to be used as a source of debate by members of the commission who are holding a meeting on Friday and will prepare a report for Biden and turn it over to him by mid-November.
Biden signed an executive order in April creating the 36-member bipartisan commission in response to calls from the left for seats to be added in order to counteract the 6-3 conservative majority on the nation's highest court. 
Many Democrats were angered by Republican former President Donald Trump's success in filling three vacancies, including one that Republicans who controlled the Senate refused to fill when Democrat Barack Obama was president.
The commission noted that adding seats would clearly be lawful but said that ""the risks of court expansion are considerable, including that it could undermine the very goal of some of its proponents of restoring the court's legitimacy.""
It said that ""rather than calm the controversy surrounding the Supreme Court, expansion could further degrade the confirmation process,"" adding that ""a future Senate could respond by refusing to confirm any nominee."" 
PREFERENCE FOR TERM LIMITS
While the discussion materials noted that commissioners were divided on the merits and justification of expanding the court, they said that advocacy groups, a cross-ideological group of Supreme Court lawyers, academics and others preferred the idea of term limits for the justices, who currently have lifetime appointments.
""Among the proposals for reforming the Supreme Court, term limits for Supreme Court Justices appear to enjoy the most widespread and bipartisan support,"" one document said.
Term limits ""would advance our constitution's commitments to checks and balances and popular sovereignty"" by allowing each president to appoint two justices per four-year term. That ""can enhance the court's legitimacy in the eyes of the public"" because appointments will ""appear fairer, less arbitrary and more predictable,"" the draft materials said.
But the question remains how term limits can be implemented as that might require an amendment to the Constitution. ""Members of the commission are divided about whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to create the equivalent of term limits by statute,"" one document said.

It is significantly more difficult to amend the Constitution than it is for Congress to enact legislation.
The materials noted that the United States is ""the only major constitutional democracy in the world that has neither a retirement age nor a fixed term of years for its high court justices.""

McCabe, who was fired just before he had been due to retire, said he was dismissed improperly amid efforts by Trump to obstruct an investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
As the Russia investigation unfolded, McCabe criticized Trump in media appearances and in turn was attacked by the former Republican president in rally speeches and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) statements.
""Politics should never play a role in the fair administration of justice and civil service personnel decisions,"" McCabe said in a statement issued by Arnold & Porter, the firm that filed his wrongful termination lawsuit in August 2019.

Arnold & Porter said under the settlement, the U.S. government would rescind McCabe's removal and deem him as having retired in good standing.
The government would also restore McCabe's full retirement pension from the date he was fired, the firm said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A group of anti-Trump Republicans on Thursday will endorse a slate of Democratic lawmakers facing tough races in next year's midterm elections, in a bid to stop the Republican Party from retaking control of Congress.
The officials, dismayed that most elected Republicans now embrace former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, told Reuters they are also backing vulnerable Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney, who have rejected Trump's voter fraud allegations.
The Renew America Movement (RAM), formed by centrist Republicans after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress on Jan. 6 to try to stop lawmakers from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory, concedes that Trump and his conspiracy theories now have an iron grip on the party.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll from August, 30% of U.S. adults agreed that the ""2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump."" That included 61% of Republicans, 19% of independents and 10% of Democrats.
Trump, for his part, has endorsed several candidates mounting primary challenges to Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting insurrection in a fiery speech ahead of the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.
He has also backed a challenger to Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of seven in her party who voted to convict Trump on the charge. He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.
RAM, whose leadership includes former Republican Governors Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Bill Weld of Massachusetts, said supporting moderate candidates is vital to safeguarding American democracy.
""With the mounting threats to our democracy and Constitution, we need people who work proactively to lead their party and the country away from the political extremes,"" Joel Searby, the group's national political director, told Reuters.
RAM will endorse and in many cases campaign for 11 moderate Democrats, nine moderate Republicans and one independent running for the House of Representatives and Senate in the November 2022 elections, the officials said.
Democrats have a narrow majority in the House, while the Senate is tied 50-50. Party insiders are increasingly nervous about losing both chambers next year, which would derail Biden's agenda.

The lawmakers to be backed by RAM include Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, all Democrats locked in close contests.
The group is also supporting Republican House members such as Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger from Illinois, who are among a handful of elected Republicans to denounce Trump and his baseless voter fraud claims. Trump's allegations were rejected by dozens of courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With the 2022 congressional elections less than 13 months away, President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies could face a bigger challenge retaining control of Congress as Republicans harden their opposition to his legislative agenda. 
Lawmakers are heading for a series of high-stakes partisan fights over Biden's multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better bill to bolster the social safety net and fight climate change and a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, as well as urgent early December deadlines to avert an embarrassing government shutdown or catastrophic debt default.
With the 2022 election campaign season ramping up, Republican strategists and congressional aides say the confrontation could be the death knell for any major new bipartisan initiatives.
""As long as there are items like the Democrats' massive social spending package hanging over Congress, it's going to be very difficult to do big things in a bipartisan way,"" said one Senate Republican aide, who added that the fight over Biden's Build Back Better social plan could spill into the new year. 
Last week's vote to advance a temporary debt ceiling fix in the U.S. Senate, in which 11 Republicans joined Democrats to move the measure toward final passage, could be the last sign of bipartisanship for now. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose debt ceiling offer broke weeks of partisan gridlock, has put Democrats on notice that Republicans will not help when the debt ceiling re-emerges in December. Party strategists say partisanship could also be an issue when funding to keep the government open expires on Dec. 3. 
""Bipartisanship is over for the remainder of this Congress, most likely,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.
Congressional aides say there could still be scope for further bipartisan action on some legislative items including defense authorization, China, Big Tech regulation and perhaps funding for government operations. 
Democrats blame Republicans for the partisan atmosphere in Congress, saying McConnell displayed the Republican Party's ""obstructionist"" aims in May when he declared ""100%"" opposition to the Biden agenda. 
White House officials, who lived through the Republican blockade of former President Barack Obama's domestic agenda, believe Biden played an important role in the bipartisan debt ceiling agreement by hinting at the possibility of filibuster, which would have reduced Republican power, according to people familiar with the matter. 
But Biden, who as a candidate pledged to turn the page on former President Donald Trump's divisiveness, may have sacrificed a chance for major bipartisan success by allowing House Democrats to link the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill to the larger package that Democrats plan to pass without Republican vote, analysts said.
The decision could have repercussions for moderate Democrats, whose reelection Biden will need in 2022 if he hopes to retain Democratic control of Congress in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. 
""The president is obviously making the decision that moving his agenda is worth a one-party legislative strategy, and that is digging a hole that he'll have to dig himself out of,"" said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. 
Democratic infighting over the size and scope of the Build Back Better package could pose another challenge, with Biden's poll numbers down and his administration weathering negative news on Afghanistan, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, the global supply chain and immigration. 
""Even Democrats who are relatively well disposed toward Biden feel that congressional fumbling reinforces the narrative that he is out of touch,"" said Geoffrey Kabaservice, policy analyst at the nonpartisan Niskanen Center think tank. 
Democrats view passage of both Build Back Better and the infrastructure bill as the path to safeguarding both their congressional majorities and Biden's presidency, particularly if combined with government funding along with existing legislation on defense and U.S. competitiveness with China. 
""That's a pretty good record. It's solid,"" said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf. 

But Republicans say that success for Biden on infrastructure and social spending would likely curtail the scope for further major Democratic initiatives ahead of 2022. 
""If both bills pass, that's probably it for any significant legislation between now and Election Day,"" said Republican strategist Rory Cooper. ""You're not going to get moderates to stomach any more spending and a large chuck of their policy agenda will have been enacted.""

19,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said on Thursday the chamber will vote next week on whether to debate a new election reform bill aimed at countering the growth of state-level Republican voting restrictions.
The move sets up a fresh conflict with Senate Republicans, all 50 of whom voted against a voting rights bill in June. Top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell last month said he would block the new bill.
Schumer has already warned Republicans that failure to advance the legislation would prompt him to find a way to move it forward without them. 
""We cannot allow conservative-controlled states to double down on their regressive and subversive voting bills,"" Schumer said in a letter to fellow Democrats calling for a vote as early as Wednesday.
At least 18 Republican-led states have enacted laws restricting voting access this year, following Republican former President Donald Trump's false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. 
The bill, dubbed the Freedom to Vote Act, would ensure that all qualified voters can request mail-in ballots and have at least 15 days of early voting. It also would allow people to register to vote as late as Election Day, which would become a public holiday.
It also would place new federal controls on how state legislatures draw the 435 House of Representatives districts in an attempt to minimize ""gerrymandering"" resulting in oddly-shaped areas that give one political party an advantage over others in congressional elections. 
The measure would require 60 votes to move forward and failure could prompt Democrats to revisit the question of reforming the Senate filibuster https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-03-10 rule that requires a super-majority vote for most legislation. 
Schumer signaled to Republicans last month that he would look for a path around the filibuster if Republicans blocked the reform measure. Democrats and Republicans each control 50 Senate seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris wielding the tie-breaking vote. 

But there have been no indications that the bill has attracted the Republican support it would need to advance.
""I hope that our Republican colleagues will join us in good faith,"" Schumer said in the letter. ""But Republicans must come to the table to have that conversation and at the very least vote to open debate.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A congressional panel investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol said on Wednesday it has issued a subpoena seeking testimony and records from Jeffrey Clark, a former senior official at the Justice Department who was a proponent of former President Donald Trump's false election fraud claims.
The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee ""needs to understand all the details about efforts inside the previous administration to delay the certification of the 2020 election and amplify misinformation about the election results,"" the panel's Democratic chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said in a statement.
""We need to understand Mr. Clark’s role in these efforts at the Justice Department and learn who was involved across the administration. The Select Committee expects Mr. Clark to cooperate fully with our investigation,"" Thompson said.
The subpoena requires Clark to produce records and testify at a deposition by Oct. 29.
It is one of more than a dozen subpoenas issued to date by the Select Committee, with some depositions scheduled as soon as this week. However, it was not immediately clear whether former Trump aides would appear.
Trump has urged them to refuse to cooperate, citing executive privilege, which legal experts in turn dispute.
Committee members have said the panel will take legal action against those who do not comply with its subpoenas. ""In general, people are going to have to appear, or, you know, we will move contempt charges against them,"" Representative Liz Cheney, one of two Republican committee members and the panel's vice chair, told reporters on Tuesday.
The Senate Judiciary Committee last week issued a report saying there was ""credible evidence"" that Clark was involved in efforts to interrupt the peaceful transition of power while serving at the Justice Department.
An attorney for Clark, the former acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, declined to comment.
Throngs of supporters of the former Republican President Trump forced their way into the seat of the U.S. government on Jan. 6, as then-Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November 2020 election.
Trump, who has refused to concede defeat and leveled unsubstantiated fraud allegations of election fraud, had urged his supporters to ""show strength"" at a raucus rally before they marched to the Capitol. The attack forced Pence, members of Congress, staff and journalists to flee, and delayed certification of the election result for several hours.
Four people died on the day, one shot to death by police and the others of natural causes. More than 100 police officers were injured.

A Capitol Police officer attacked by protesters died the following day and four officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives.
It was the worst attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812 and the only time in U.S. history that power has not been transferred peacefully.

Lawmakers said a ""toxic culture"" had allowed sexual abuse to fester and go unchallenged at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA), which works with major shipping lines to prepare new recruits for a life at sea.
Senator Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Commerce Committee, said in a letter to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) that numerous alleged incidents occurred during midshipmen’s ""Sea Year,"" where sophomore and junior midshipmen spend part of their academic year at sea working on primarily private merchant marine vessels learning firsthand skills.
""Many of these allegations involve a repeated pattern of crimes and intimidations committed by people in positions of power and responsibility on merchant ships, and include alleged poor oversight or policy failures of USMMA officials and Coast Guard investigators,"" Cantwell wrote.
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure chair Peter DeFazio and Salud Carbajal, chair of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation subcommitte, said in a joint statement ""this pattern of abuse in the maritime industry and the Sea Year program in particular has gone on far too long — we must reform the toxic culture that has allowed this problem to fester, and not stop until our seas are safe for everyone.""
The world's largest shipping firm, A.P. Moller-Maersk, suspended five employees as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on one of its ships run by a U.S. subsidiary, and said it was working closely with American authorities, Reuters reported Tuesday.
A cadet, who has remained anonymous, wrote in a blog post that she was a 19-year-old virgin when she was raped by a 60-year-old 1st Engineer aboard the Maersk ship during Sea Year. 
Maersk Line Limited (MLL), a U.S.-based subsidiary of the A.P. Moller-Maersk group working with the U.S. government to support military, government and humanitarian missions, participates in the Sea Year program where it has trained 732 cadets since 2017.
A MARAD spokesperson said the agency was aware of the alleged rape of the cadet, adding that USMMA referred it to the Coast Guard on Sept. 28.

""We have zero tolerance for sexual assault and sexual harassment at USMMA and in the maritime industry,"" the spokesperson added.
The Coast Guard said it was ""aware of an allegation of sexual assault which occurred aboard a U.S.-flagged commercial cargo vessel and is currently investigating.""

(Reuters) - A state judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Georgia voters and self-described election integrity activists who alleged that officials in Atlanta's Fulton County had counted fraudulent ballots in the November 2020 election.
Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero in McDonough just southeast of Atlanta, who oversaw the case, ruled that the petitioners had failed to allege injuries that affected them in a ""personal and individual way,"" leaving them with no standing to bring the lawsuit.
The order is the latest defeat for private groups in the United States which have claimed without evidence that widespread voting fraud in populous cities helped Democrat Joe Biden unfairly defeat then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.
In September, a review of Arizona's election results by Trump's Republican Party allies reaffirmed Biden's win https://www.reuters.com/world/us/arizona-republicans-release-findings-widely-panned-election-audit-2021-09-24 in that state. Multiple courts and officials have rejected the Trump campaign's claims that the election was stolen from him.
Biden also won Georgia, scoring the first victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992.
Amero's Wednesday order came one day after attorneys for Georgia's secretary of state responded to the lawsuit in court. The attorneys said the secretary's office had thoroughly investigated the allegations of fraudulent ballot counting in Fulton County and found them unsubstantiated by the evidence presented so far.
Garland Favorito, the activist who led the lawsuit against Fulton County, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was ""not adequate for any organization to secretly tell us there are no counterfeit ballots and refuse to let the public inspect them.""

Favorito also said his group had prepared to show ""concrete evidence"" of their claims at a Nov. 15 hearing that had been scheduled in the case before Amero dismissed the lawsuit.
Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts said in his own statement on Wednesday that the dismissal was a ""win for democracy."" Pitts, a Democrat, noted that Fulton County's votes had already been counted three times, including a hand recount.

(Reuters) - Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's Democratic attorney general and a high-profile critic of former President Donald Trump, on Wednesday entered the 2022 race for governor, vowing to use veto power as a check on any efforts by Republicans to curtail abortion or voting rights in the battleground state.
Shapiro, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, delivered a speech with both moderate and progressive messages. He promised to reduce taxes to entice business investment while also boosting wages, expanding broadband internet access and lowering the cost of healthcare.
""I think we all know that Pennsylvanians need a governor who will take on the powerful and be on their side,"" Shapiro told supporters in Pittsburgh at an event launching his campaign. 
The announcement makes Shapiro, 48, the early front-runner to become the Democratic Party nominee. No other Democrat has launched a campaign to succeed Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, who is constitutionally barred from running for a third four-year term.
The Republican field for the 2022 race currently numbers a half-dozen and is expected to grow, with most candidates jostling to secure an endorsement from Trump, the Republican Party's de facto leader. Lou Barletta, 65, a former U.S. congressman, and former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain, 52, are among those who have already announced campaigns.
Pennsylvania is a battleground state, where presidential elections can go either way, and commands a large number of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, won the state by more than 80,000 ballots.
Shapiro, a former state representative and commissioner in Montgomery County just outside Philadelphia, has in recent months built up his national profile through frequent appearances on cable TV shows to criticize Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. 
Last month, Shapiro filed a lawsuit in state court against Republican state lawmakers in a bid to stop their effort to subpoena detailed personal information on voters, including partial Social Security numbers, as part of their partisan review of the 2020 election. That legal dispute is continuing.
Without naming them, Shapiro said his Republican challengers were more focused on promoting lies about the 2020 election than in solving everyday problems. He noted that the ongoing election review was being funded by taxpayers.
""There's a cost to their lies. Not only are they doing real damage to our democracy, but they are holding us back from meeting this moment,"" Shapiro said, adding that, if elected, he would veto any law that infringed on voting or abortion rights.
""I won't hesitate to use that veto pen to protect you."" 
In an earlier online video announcing his candidacy, Shapiro also highlighted his work overseeing a grand jury investigation that in 2018 led to sexual abuse allegations against 300 Roman Catholic priests in six Pennsylvania dioceses.
Barletta sought to tie Shapiro to the far left of the Democratic Party and the policies of Wolf, who has come under Republican fire for business restrictions aimed at curbing COVID-19's spread.
""His policies are dictated to him by leftist activists,"" Barletta said in a statement.
Terry Madonna, a Pennsylvania political analyst, said he expected progressives, who have been at odds with Shapiro over instances when he supported police and for his relatively tough-on-crime stance, to eventually come around to back him.

Madonna said Shapiro had perhaps the highest profile of any attorney general in modern Pennsylvania history. He said that should help Shapiro as he took on the Republican nominee. 
""I don't know anyone who has been more out and about,"" Madonna said. ""He's all over the state.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Labor Department on Tuesday submitted to the White House the initial text of President Joe Biden's plan to require private-sector workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or get tested regularly.
The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration submitted the proposed rule for review. Some details could change, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The move indicates the proposed standard could be released soon.
The mandate will apply to businesses with 100 or more employees and will be implemented under a federal rule-making mechanism known as an emergency temporary standard. It would affect roughly 80 million workers nationwide.
Along with Biden's order last month that requires all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, the orders cover 100 million people, about two-thirds of the U.S. workforce.
Biden's mandate announcement in September came at a breaking-point moment as the country was struggling to control the pandemic and a large swath of the nation's population was refusing to accept free vaccinations that have been available for months. The coronavirus has killed more than 700,000 Americans.
The workplace vaccine order has spurred pushback from many Republican governors. On Monday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, issued an executive order banning businesses and other private entities in his state from requiring Covid-19 vaccinations for employees.
The plan has also drawn mixed reactions from companies. Many support the government's goal of speeding the pace of vaccinations, but smaller employers and those with mostly hourly workers have expressed concern the policy could be difficult to implement especially as it may lead to losing employees in a tight labor market in addition to managing the cost and complexity of vaccinate-or-test mandates.

Several big employers such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), 3M along with airlines such as American and JetBlue have imposed mandates since Biden's announcement. Others such as  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) have said it will require all of its U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8, regardless of how often they come into the office. 
Several other large U.S. employers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), have yet to issue broad requirements. The Labor Department's standards will require many such companies to introduce mandates.

(Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to bar private companies from enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandates is the latest sign he is betting the state's electorate remains solidly Republican ahead of his re-election bid next year.
In recent months, Abbott has backed a series of measures that have pulled Texas sharply to the right, including the country's most restrictive abortion ban, a raft of voting limits, an effort to fund a border wall, restrictions on transgender student athletes and expanded gun rights.
His executive order on Monday banning private employers and other entities from imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates is in direct conflict https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/texas-vaccine-mandate-ban-likely-be-trumped-by-federal-law-could-cause-2021-10-13 with the Biden administration's plan to require shots for workers.
Democrats have made political gains in Texas on the strength of rapidly growing metropolitan areas such as Houston and Austin. But with the two-term governor facing a pair of intraparty challengers in a March primary, Abbott's moves appear aimed at energizing the Republican base rather than appealing to swing voters and moderate Democrats.
""He's taking a more aggressive approach,"" said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican political consultant. ""These are all ways to shore up conservative voters in the state.""
There is evidence to suggest the strategy is sound. Last year, former President Donald Trump carried Texas by more than five percentage points, despite national unpopularity and unprecedented Democratic fervor.
Abbott, 63, is likely to face a far friendlier environment in 2022 as he seeks another four-year term. The party that controls the White House typically suffers losses in its first midterm election, and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has already seen his approval ratings falter.
""I do strongly believe Governor Abbott is in the catbird seat for re-election,"" said Ray Sullivan, who was a senior adviser to Republican former Texas Governor Rick Perry. ""History is against the Democrats this cycle."" 
No Democrat has announced a run for Abbott's office next year. Most political observers expect Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman and presidential candidate who has proven fundraising muscle, to throw his hat in the ring.
Abbott is facing at least two credible Republican rivals for the first time in his tenure: Don Huffines, a former state senator, and Allen West, chairman of the Texas Republican Party who was recently hospitalized with COVID-19.
Both say Abbott is not conservative enough for Texas. Huffines took credit for Abbott's vaccine mandates ban on Monday, tweeting that he was ""glad Greg Abbott is finally caving to the grassroots pressure brought by my campaign.""
Abbott's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
CONSERVATIVE BONA FIDES
Abbott has occasionally angered his party's right wing, such as last year when, early in the coronavirus pandemic, he issued a statewide mask order. That stands in contrast to his decision this summer to prohibit schools from requiring masks.
With Biden serving as a convenient political foil in the White House, Abbott can focus on re-establishing his conservative bona fides. Abbott has already made the president a frequent target, picking fights with the administration on everything from border security to mask mandates to abortion.
""By and large, Abbott's thinking right now first and foremost about the March 2022 Republican primary,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.
Mustafa Tameez, a Texas-based Democratic strategist, said Abbott is doing what many other Republican leaders have done: demonstrating his fealty to Trump. Last month, Abbott defended his state's partial review of the 2020 presidential election, a decision announced hours after Trump called on Republicans to ""audit"" the results even though he carried the state.
Tameez said he understood the argument that Texas Republicans hold an edge in midterm elections, in part because turnout tends to be lower among Democrats. But he noted that turnout has exploded in recent cycles and warned that Abbott could pay a price for pursuing far-right priorities.
""If Governor Abbott and the Republican Party continue to go to their extreme agenda... they will lose the suburbs of Texas and therefore will lose elections – sooner than they believe,"" he said.
A poll conducted by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas in August showed a majority of Texans feel the state is headed in the wrong direction, the worst assessment since the poll began in 2008. It gave Abbott his lowest approval rating since he took office in 2015.
Some of Abbott's drop in approval can be attributed to his more aggressive partisan stances of the past year. But it was also part of a general decline in support for political leaders over the same period, said James Henson, who directs the polling project.

Even if Abbott's policies have alienated some independents and Democrats, consolidating his conservative base is a strategic way to prepare for next year's elections, Henson said.
""He knows that Trump is not going to be on the ticket in 2022, which would get Democratic voters more fired up,"" said Nate Lerner, a Democratic consultant who helped run a grassroots effort to convince O'Rourke to run for the White House in 2020. ""The middle is so tiny and small, it's become more about base turnout.""

The committee late last month subpoenaed four members of former President Donald Trump's administration. They were Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, former White House adviser Steve Bannon, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino and former Defense Department official Kash Patel.
The committee has already threatened criminal contempt charges against Bannon for refusing to cooperate with the inquiry into the attack, in which a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the seat of the U.S. government. 
Those subpoenaed will have the opportunity to cooperate, but if they do not, the committee will enforce its subpoenas, Cheney, a Republican, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. She leads the committee along with its chairman, Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson.
""In general, people are going to have to appear, or, you know, we will move contempt charges against them,"" Cheney said. She said the entire committee was in agreement on that point.
Cheney said the committee expected to have depositions from Meadows and Patel later this week. ""We'll see if they show up. If they show up, we'll be prepared,"" she said.

The riot took place as Congress was meeting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election victory, delaying that process for several hours as then-Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress, staff and journalists fled. More than 600 people now face criminal charges stemming from the event.
House Democrats formed the committee over objections fromTrump's fellow Republicans in the House. Cheney is one of two Republicans on the committee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. prosecutor on Tuesday asked a federal judge to order continued pre-trial detention for a man charged with spraying a chemical on police officers during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Donald Trump supporters.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Collyer said evidence showed ""escalating conduct"" by Samuel Lazar, 37, of Ephrata, Pennsylvania, who the prosecutor alleged was ""obsessed"" with firearms and Trump's false claims that his defeat in the 2020 presidential election was the result of widespread fraud.
Collyer said prosecutors do not believe Lazar entered the Capitol building during the riot. But in court papers the government alleged that Lazar, wearing a tactical vest and goggles, pushed his way to the front of a line of police guarding the Capitol and used a bullhorn to encourage rioters to grab police weapons.
Prosecutors said Lazar ""discharged a chemical irritant at three police officers"" and later ""bragged in a video about macing police."" More than 660 defendants have been arrested on riot-related charges.
Matthew Wilson, Lazar's defense lawyer, described the alleged conduct as ""an aberration"" and said Lazar should be released to home detention instead of being held in prison, where Wilson said Lazar was in isolation, ""presumably for his own protection.""
Later, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden on Tuesday sentenced a Texas man to 500 hours of community service for unlawfully entering the Capitol on Jan. 6. The defendant, Eliel Rosa, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was not accused of violence.

The government asked McFadden to impose a sentence of one month of house arrest and three years of probation, but the judge said he did not think home confinement was necessary.
And McFadden denied a request by Brandon Fellows, 27, a New York resident facing felony and misdemeanor riot charges, for release from pre-trial detention. The judge told Fellows - who, defending himself https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-allows-accused-capitol-rioter-act-own-attorney-2021-09-23, offered the judge a lengthy argument for his release - that he had ""admitted to incredible lapses in judgment.""

(Reuters) - Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, responding to what he called ""bullying"" by the Biden Administration, on Monday barred all COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the state by any entity, including private employers.
Abbott's move sets him up for a clash with President Joe Biden, a Democrat who last month called on businesses nationwide to order their workers to be vaccinated or lose their jobs. At least several thousand people have since been fired for refusing to comply.
""In another instance of federal overreach, the Biden Administration is now bullying many private entities into imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, causing workforce disruptions that threaten Texas' continued recovery from the COVID-19 disaster,"" Abbott said in an executive order.
The White House had no immediate comment.
Abbott's order states that ""no entity in Texas"" could compel proof of vaccination by any individual, including employees or customers. He called on state lawmakers to take up the issue in an upcoming special session.
Tech giants  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google have both told employees that they would need proof of vaccination to return to their offices. Both companies employ large numbers in Texas.
Fort Worth-based American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), the largest U.S. carrier, last week told its 100,000 U.S.-based employees they must submit proof of full vaccination no later than Nov. 24 - or be fired.
United Airlines imposed a vaccine mandate on its 60,000 employees, around 9,000 of whom are based in Texas.
The company is defending a lawsuit filed in Fort Worth, and a federal judge on Wednesday will hear a request by United employees for an injunction to prevent the carrier from firing those who requested exemptions. 
Biden issued his mandate in September as his administration struggled to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans. 
Political leaders across the United States have ratcheted up pressure on the unvaccinated in recent weeks. 

Laws requiring proof of vaccinations are deeply controversial in the United States, with many Americans criticizing them as unconstitutional and authoritarian.
Proponents of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the nation out of the nearly two-year pandemic and return to normalcy.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis met on Saturday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Catholic who has come under criticism from some bishops in the United States for her support for abortion rights.
Their meeting took place several weeks before Joe Biden is expected to meet the pope while the U.S. president is in Rome for talks between leaders of the Group of 20 major economies.
Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but, as a politician, cannot impose his views. Pelosi, who has five children, has said she supports a woman's right to choose.
Biden's administration and Pelosi have urged judges to block a new Texas law which bars abortions from six weeks, saying it is unconstitutional. The ban was temporarily reinstated on Friday by a conservative-leaning appeals court.
The Catholic Church teaches that human life begins at the moment of conception and Biden and Pelosi have been criticised by conservative Catholic media and U.S. conservative bishops, some of whom say neither should be allowed to receive communion.
Last month the pope, asked about the U.S. communion debate, told reporters abortion is ""murder"", even soon after conception, and appeared to criticise U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than pastoral way.
""Communion is not a prize for the perfect ... communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,” the pope said.
In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. They take up the issue again next month.
In a statement, Pelosi said the audience with the pope was a ""spiritual, personal and official honor"". She praised his defence of the environment, immigrants, refugees and the poor.
The Vatican announced Pelosi's audience with the pope in its daily bulletin but gave no details.
After Pelosi met former Pope Benedict in 2009, the Vatican said he had told her that legislators and other public figures should help create ""a just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development"".
The archbishop in Pelosi's home city of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, has said public figures who support abortion should be denied communion in his archdiocese and has urged Catholics to pray for Pelosi's ""conversion of heart"".
Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, D.C., has not tried to stop Biden, a regular church-goer, from receiving communion.
Biden's meeting with the pope will be the first since his election although they have met several times before, including when he was vice-president to Barack Obama.
Pelosi is in Rome for a Parliamentary Speakers' Summit ahead of the G20 as well as a meeting of parliamentary leaders before of the U.N. Climate Change Summit (COP20) next month in Glasgow.

Francis told the parliamentarians separately on Saturday they had a decisive role to play in protecting the environment.
The Vatican announced on Friday that the pope would not be going to Glasgow but that its delegation would be headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state.

Salazar's comments come a day after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on a visit following a period of strained cooperation.

The Biden administration is increasingly reliant on its southern neighbor to stem migration not only from Central America but also Haiti and Venezuela.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court late on Friday temporarily reinstated Texas's restrictive abortion law, which bars the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and outsources enforcement of the ban to ordinary citizens.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a conservative-leaning intermediate appeals court, granted a request on Friday by the Texas Attorney General's Office to temporarily suspend a judge’s order blocking the abortion ban.
The administrative stay from the Fifth Circuit, a conservative-leaning appeals court, came in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department on Sept. 9. The purpose of the administrative stay is to give the court time to determine whether to issue a more permanent ruling.
A three-judge Fifth Circuit panel gave the Justice Department until Tuesday to respond to Texas's filings.
Justice Department representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Texas abortion law, which took effect on Sept. 1, makes no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. It also lets ordinary citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. Critics of the law have said this provision enables people to act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.
U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin on Wednesday temporarily blocked the abortion ban while litigation over its legality continues.
The Justice Department has argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy that was recognized in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.

“This is a deeply alarming order that will allow Texas’ abortion ban to go back into effect at a time when abortion providers were quickly starting to resume abortion care for all patients,” said Brigitte Amiri, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.
Amiri said the ACLU hopes the litigation ""moves swiftly"" so the Texas abortion law can be halted again, potentially by the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Reuters) -The White House on Friday formally blocked an attempt by Donald Trump to withhold documents from Congress related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol when he was U.S. president.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had authorized the National Archives, a government agency that holds records from Trump's time in office, to turn over an initial batch of documents requested by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the riot.
“The president has determined an assertion of executive privilege isn't warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House that have been provided to us by the National Archives,"" Psaki said.
Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of some communications between White House officials.
Trump said the Biden administration was using the investigation to undercut his future political prospects.
""This is about using the power of the government to silence 'Trump' and our Make America Great Again movement, the greatest such achievement of all time,"" he said in a statement. 
Throngs of Trump supporters stormed the seat of Congress on Jan. 6 in a failed bid to prevent lawmakers from certifying Democrat Biden's presidential victory. More than 600 people now face criminal charges stemming from the event.
The Jan. 6 Select Committee has threatened criminal contempt charges against Steve Bannon, the longtime Trump adviser who is refusing to cooperate with the inquiry.
“We will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral,"" said Representatives Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, who lead the committee. 
Bannon on Thursday told the committee he would not comply with a subpoena it issued last month.

A lawyer for Bannon, Robert Costello, said in a letter to the committee that the refusal was due to Trump's claim that he can invoke executive privilege to block Bannon's testimony.
Legal experts have said Trump, as the former president, cannot lawfully use executive privilege to block subpoenas issued by the select committee.

Following weeks of partisan fighting, the Senate approved https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-republicans-haggle-over-short-term-debt-fix-2021-10-07 the short-term fix that will allow the United States to avoid defaulting on its bills in a 50-48 vote on Thursday evening. The House will vote on the measure on Tuesday.
Congress will need to find a longer-term solution in December. But McConnell has said the reprieve would give Democrats enough time to raise the debt ceiling through a procedural move known as reconciliation, which Democrats have rejected as an option for lifting the cap.

In his letter to Biden, McConnell referenced comments on the Senate floor on Thursday by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who said Republicans had played a ""dangerous and risky partisan game.""
""I am writing to make it clear that in light of Senator Schumer's hysterics and my grave concerns about the ways that another vast, reckless, partisan spending bill would hurt Americans and help China, I will not be a party to any future effort to mitigate the consequences of Democratic mismanagement,"" McConnell wrote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump's showcase hotel in Washington bled millions of dollars during his time in office even as he concealed payments from foreign governments, a U.S. House of Representatives panel said on Friday.
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform said recently obtained government documents raised ""troubling"" questions about the Trump International Hotel, a historic building the Trump Organization leases from the federal government and a popular gathering spot for his supporters and for foreign dignitaries.
According to the Democratic-controlled committee, Trump reported that the hotel earned him more than $150 million during his time in office but actually lost more than $70 million.
The committee found that the hotel received over $3.7 million in payments from foreign governments - equal to more than 7,400 nights at the hotel, raising a potential conflict of interest.
The hotel gave a portion of that money to the U.S. government but failed to provide full details of those payments to the General Services Administration, the federal government's property manager, the committee said. Its investigation was based on documents released by the GSA.
Provisions in the U.S. Constitution prohibit the president from obtaining payments, or ""emoluments"", from foreign governments.
Trump's lawyers have argued in court cases that his ownership of the hotel did not violate these constitutional provisions. 
A Trump Organization spokeswoman said the committee's report was inaccurate but did not elaborate.
""This report is nothing more than continued political harassment in a desperate attempt to mislead the American public and defame Trump in pursuit of their own agenda,"" Kimberly Benza said.
The GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Congressional Democrats say the GSA stonewalled their investigation into Trump's businesses while he was in office, but in July 2021 finally produced some of the documents they had been seeking.
The committee found that Trump moved millions of dollars through other businesses, complicating GSA's ability to enforce provisions that prohibited him from collecting profits from the hotel. 
The committee also found that he concealed debts when he was bidding for use of the property in 2011 and failed to disclose what it said were favorable loan terms from  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) that financed renovations to the hotel.
The House panel found that Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) allowed Trump to delay making payments on the principal of a $170 million loan for six years.

The committee said Trump did not disclose ""this significant benefit from a foreign bank"" while he was in office.
Deutsche Bank spokesman Daniel Hunter said that was inaccurate, without giving further details.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Mitch McConnell, long known as the Republican mastermind in Congress, lost support among some members of his own party this week after offering Democrats a temporary deal to avert a cataclysmic U.S. credit default and safeguard the Senate's endangered super-majority rule.
The 79-year-old Kentucky Republican, who had insisted for months that Democrats use a complex procedure to raise the debt ceiling on their own, offered a temporary fix to extend it into early December after the U.S. Treasury said it would run out of money to pay its bills by Oct. 18. 
Democrats readily agreed and declared victory https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-republicans-haggle-over-short-term-debt-fix-2021-10-07 after the agreement passed the Senate by a 50-48 majority on Thursday.
""Somebody got to McConnell and finally said: 'Hey Mitch, you know what, are you really prepared to sink the entire American economy and the global economy with your obstinacy?'"" Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters on Friday. 
While the deal simply postpones the same battle, McConnell's decision to relent raised questions about whether he had put himself at a disadvantage in future confrontations. 
""Republican leadership blinked. I think that was a mistake,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz told reporters on Thursday.
But Republican strategists and aides said the outcome could give the party increased leverage against President Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar social spending package, which Democrats hope to pass in the coming weeks. 
Republicans believe the high-stakes debt-ceiling debate could make it harder for Democrats to find common ground on the legislation. 
""Forcing Democrats to punt the debt ceiling into the (Biden agenda) fight may prove to be very good strategy,"" said Republican strategist Alex Conant.
A Republican aide credited McConnell's tactics with safeguarding the ""filibuster,"" the super-majority rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber. That has enabled Republicans to block many Democratic initiatives.

In the short term, McConnell faces pressure from Republican allies of former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called on the party to oust McConnell from his position. 
Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) denounced McConnell's agreement as a ""complete capitulation"" without naming the leader, adding: ""We had a strategy and we abandoned it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden’s approval rating has increased somewhat over the past few weeks, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, as coronavirus infection rates slowed.
The latest national public opinion poll, conducted Oct. 6-7, found that 48% of U.S. adults approved of Biden’s performance in office, which is up by 4 percentage points from a similar poll that ran in mid-September. 
Meanwhile 47% disapproved of Biden in the latest survey, which is down 3 points from the September poll.  
The rise in Biden’s approval has mirrored a recent drop in U.S. coronavirus cases. A Reuters tally shows there are a little more than 100,000 reported cases on average each day, which is 40% of the peak infection rate in January.
The president's standing with the American public recently has been entwined with the state of the U.S. pandemic. 
Many voters supported Biden's presidential bid in 2020 because they thought he would be better than former President Donald Trump at pulling the country out of the health crisis. And since he was elected, Biden has routinely received higher levels of support for his response to the coronavirus than for other parts of his agenda. 

When the Delta variant drove up infection rates around the country this summer, Biden's approval numbers took a hit. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1,005 adults, including 414 Democrats and 365 Republicans. It has a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of 4 percentage points.

39,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell found himself this week in the unenviable position of begging for votes from within his own caucus.
The shrewd partisan strategist and nemesis to two Democratic presidents, who has repeatedly held his party together in the face of fierce public criticism, was only able to muster 10 of the 49 other GOP senators to follow him in a critical engagement on the central campaign he set for the coming months.
McConnell’s case wasn’t helped by a couple of withering statements from former President Donald Trump and the spreading fear of primary challenges from the populist right.
McConnell was able to deliver on the short-term deal with one vote to spare. But the race to get to the 61-38 tally Thursday evening to overcome a filibuster against the measure underscored the continuing hold Trump exerts over Republicans in Congress as he seeks to re-assert his dominance of the party. 
Republicans were already on the fence about McConnell’s proffered deal to extend the nation’s debt ceiling through early December, a move that averts immediate economic catastrophe but very much keeps the issue alive. 
Only two Republicans up for re-election next year backed McConnell on the vote to stop the filibuster: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose home-state political base is so strong that she won re-election in 2010 as an independent despite losing the Republican primary, and John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
No Republican voted for the new debt limit, which passed with 50 Democratic votes once the filibuster was lifted.
The outcome avoided a humiliating defeat for a party leader who has remained unchallenged in his post for 15 years, the longest tenure ever for a Republican Senate leader, outlasting a succession of counterparts in the House who have departed amid sniping from the right.
But the close call suggests reduced room for maneuver ahead, raising the risk he will be unable to pull his party back from the precipice when the battle over the federal debt limit resumes in December. And it dramatically surfaced the roiling tension within the party between the business-friendly traditional conservatism represented by McConnell and the populism Trump champions.  
It’s not the first time McConnell has recently found himself in the minority within his own caucus. In August, he was one of just 12 Republicans to support a $550 billion bipartisan infrastructure bill. And late last year, McConnell put himself squarely at odds with Trump -- and the right flank of his party -- when he recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election in mid-December after the Electoral College vote. 
Late Thursday, McConnell worked up to the last minute to secure the votes he needed and endured furious criticism in a contentious emergency meeting of Republicans shortly beforehand.
Senator Roy Blunt, a close ally of McConnell who is retiring in 2022, wavered until nearly the final moment. He declared himself still undecided only an hour before the vote. Nearly every other senator had voted and McConnell was still short when Blunt finally supplied the critical vote allowing the Republican leader to prevail. Senator Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, followed with one more before the vote was quickly gaveled to a close.  
The push for votes was especially jarring because McConnell, in contrast to Republicans’ recent leaders in the House, has established a reputation for carefully discerning whether he has sufficient backing within his party before offering a deal.
Trump, who has seethed against McConnell since the Kentucky senator criticized his role in stoking tensions before the Jan. 6 riot, trained his sights on the Republican leader immediately after the temporary debt deal was announced. Trump accused him Wednesday of “folding to the Democrats again.” Just before the vote, Trump again implored senators not to vote “for this terrible deal.”
Republican senators echoed the former president’s criticisms.
“I don’t understand why we’re folding here,” Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) of South Carolina said on Thursday, borrowing Trump’s words. 
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blasted McConnell’s deal as “a strategic mistake” on the Senate floor. “Chuck Schumer won this game of chicken,” Cruz declared.
McConnell, who under Barack Obama bestowed on himself the nickname “Grim Reaper” for his record of obstructing Democratic presidential priorities, held his party together through precedent-breaking feats such as his refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee during Obama’s final year in office and his later pivot to rush through a Trump nominee to the high court ahead of the 2020 election. Those gambits laid the groundwork for the current 6-3 conservative court majority.
He has spent recent months engineering the confrontation over the debt limit as Democrats debate Biden’s $3.5 trillion economic plan, demanding that Democrats use a convoluted and time-consuming budget process known as reconciliation to avert an economically catastrophic U.S. debt default. 
The strategy has kept the rising national debt at the forefront of news coverage as Congress considers Biden’s economic plan and helped amplify a sense of political disorder while the president is down in the polls. The party-line vote to raise the debt limit also provides fodder for attack ads against Democrats in next year’s midterm congressional elections.
But the showdown became perilous as an Oct. 18 deadline for a U.S. debt default neared and pressure rose within the Democratic party to carve out a new exception to the filibuster rule for the debt limit, a precedent that would have weakened the primary instrument McConnell has used to obstruct the Democratic majority. 
Two Democratic moderates, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have been bulwarks against weakening the filibuster but Republicans feared they were wavering. Biden even weighed in Tuesday evening, saying a filibuster carve-out was “a real possibility.”
Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said the possibility of losing the leverage of the filibuster was paramount in the decision to extend the offer of a temporary deal to Democrats.
“Let’s not tempt fate and push Joe Manchin to wreck the Senate and end the filibuster,” Cramer said was the prevailing sentiment in his party.
Even so, he voted no on the Senate floor.

ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday said more U.S. businesses should obligate workers to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, calling the move vital to ending the pandemic and sustaining the economy. 
""Today I'm calling on more employers to act,"" Biden said. 
""My message is: Require your employees to get vaccinated. With vaccinations, we're going to beat this pandemic finally. Without them, we face endless months of chaos in our hospitals, damage to our economy and anxiety in our schools.""
Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, and for private employers with 100 or more workers to require staff to be vaccinated by Dec. 8, or get tested for the coronavirus weekly. That order covers 100 million people, about two-thirds of the workforce.
The president intensified the call on Thursday on a visit to the construction site of a future  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) data center near Chicago. The construction firm, Clayco, said it plans to implement immunization or testing requirements for all employees.
Biden highlighted other vaccination success stories, including a move by Chicago-based United Airlines to set an October deadline for all employees to be fully vaccinated, the first U.S. carrier to do so.
Biden praised other airlines and businesses that followed suit, including entertainment company Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Microsoft. 
Immunization requirements have broad public support, and Wall Street economists agree higher vaccination rates will stoke economic growth and add jobs, the Democratic president said. 
Biden's workplace vaccine order spurred pushback from high profile Republican governors and resistant Americans. Biden said he was initially reluctant to order vaccinations. 
""We have to beat this thing. So, while I didn't race to do it right away, that's why I've had to move toward requirements (that) everyone get vaccinated, where I had the authority to do that,"" he said. 
Biden's mandate announcement in September came at a breaking-point moment as his administration struggled to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans, as a large swath of the nation's population refused to accept free vaccinations that have been available for months. 

A surge of hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has threatened not just the country but a president who ran on promises to get control of the pandemic. Biden's approval ratings have sagged since he said in July the United States was ""closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A review by U.S. Senate Democrats of Donald Trump's attempt to use the Justice Department to overturn his 2020 election defeat provided new details on Thursday about an official's bid to push out the acting attorney general to advance Trump's false claims.
The report by Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats details how Jeffrey Bossert Clark, then a senior Justice Department official, met with Trump more than once in late 2020. The then-president was growing angry that acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen would not launch a public investigation into Trump's false claim that his defeat to now-President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud.
Rosen assumed his position in the final weeks of Trump's presidency after William Barr resigned effective Dec. 23, 2020, rather than use the department to pursue Trump's false claims, which were rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and his own administration.
""Today's report shows the American people just how close we came to a constitutional crisis,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said in a statement.
Rosen told the committee that Trump opened one meeting with him by saying, ""One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren't going to do anything to overturn the election.""
Trump also asked Clark if he would be willing to take over as acting attorney general, the report said, adding that Clark relayed this message to Rosen. 
""Rosen recalled Clark indicating that he hadn’t yet decided whether he would accept Trump’s offer, wanted to conduct some 'due diligence' on certain election fraud claims, and might turn down the offer if he determined that Rosen and (Rosen's deputy, Richard Donoghue) were correct that there was no corruption,"" the report said.
The report also found that Clark sought to attend a meeting with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to ask about a baseless conspiracy theory that a Dominion voting machine ""accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat.""
Clark pushed for a letter to Georgia, urging a special legislative session to contest the election results, the report said. The request was refused.
Clark's efforts ultimately failed, after all of the department's remaining senior leadership threatened to resign in protest if Clark were installed.
Durbin said the committee has asked Clark to testify.
Thursday's report also contains new details about how former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows tried convince Rosen to launch ""at least four categories of false election claims"" in places such as Fulton County, Georgia and New Mexico.

Republicans on the committee issued their own report, which drew different conclusions.
""The available evidence shows that President Trump did what we’d expect a president to do on an issue of this importance: He listened to his senior advisers and followed their advice and recommendations,"" Ranking Member Charles Grassley said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that his Democrats might make an exception to a U.S. Senate rule to allow them to extend the government's borrowing authority without Republican help, which could head off an economically crippling debt default.
As a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats showed no sign of abating, Biden said there was a ""real possibility"" that his party would bypass the long-standing supermajority voting requirement known as the filibuster (https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-03-10) for dealing with the debt limit. 
That would allow Democrats, who hold a razor-thin Senate majority, to suspend the federal government's $28.4 trillion borrowing cap without Republican votes.
Asked if Democrats would remove the filibuster solely to raise the debt limit, Biden said: ""Oh I think that's a real possibility."" 
Many Democrats have argued that the Senate should dump the filibuster entirely, saying it prevents progress on climate change, voting rights and other priorities.
Centrist Democratic senators including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said they are not willing to do so, leaving the party short of the votes they need to change the rule.
But Democrats now are considering dropping the filibuster just for dealing with the debt limit, several senators said. Manchin declined to comment when asked about that possibility on Tuesday prior to Biden's statement.
Biden made the comment as the Democrats were due to try for a third time to suspend the debt ceiling on Wednesday, which Republicans are expected to block.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is urging Democrats to raise the debt ceiling on their own using a more convoluted approach called reconciliation that would require no Republican votes.
""They have the time to do it. And the sooner they get about it, the better,"" McConnell said at a news conference.
'DANGER ZONE'
Biden and other Democrats say that process would take too long and push the country too close to an unprecedented default. Economists say that would roil the global financial system, raise borrowing costs and eliminate millions of jobs. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government will exhaust its borrowing capabilities by about Oct. 18 if Congress does not raise the country's $28.4 trillion borrowing authority by then.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted last week to suspend the debt ceiling until the end of 2022. 
But Democrats need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, which is evenly divided between the two parties. Republicans blocked two other efforts to raise the debt ceiling last week.
""If Republicans want to vote 'no' tomorrow, if they really want to be the party of default, that's their choice,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. 
Republicans have said the unpleasant task of increasing the debt limit should be the responsibility of the party in charge. If they succeed in forcing Democrats to do so on their own, the issue would likely be fodder for attack ads against Democratic candidates in the 2022 congressional elections. 
Biden and Schumer have rejected reconciliation as too convoluted and risky and have warned of economic catastrophe unless Republicans change course. But Schumer did not rule it out at a news conference on Tuesday.
Without a quick resolution, some government services might be suspended, such as delivering Social Security benefit checks to the elderly.
Even a close call would likely be damaging. A 2011 debt ceiling dispute, which Congress resolved two days before the borrowing limit was due to have been reached, caused stocks to tumble and prompted a first-ever credit downgrade for U.S. debt.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said on Tuesday it expects Washington will raise the debt limit.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner said Congress was already risking U.S. creditworthiness. ""We're in the danger zone right now,"" he told reporters. 

Using reconciliation could consume the attention of Congress, slowing Biden's efforts to reach agreement on his multitrillion-dollar social agenda and potentially undermining his support among moderate and progressive Democrats.
Another potential advantage of pursuing a filibuster exception is that the reconciliation process would require Democrats to adopt a specific dollar figure for a new, higher debt ceiling on their own, rather than simply postponing the issue until after the November 2022 elections.

DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. Commissioner General to the Expo in Dubai Robert Clark, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said on Tuesday that he would lobby Congress to pass legislation to allow the government to finance the country's participation in future world fairs.
The United States is banned by Congress from using public funds to take part in fairs organised by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), like the six-month Expo that started in Dubai last week.
Host the United Arab Emirates instead financed the pavilion of its key security partner, which houses the U.S. exhibition, at a cost of $60 million.
""One of my missions going forward ... is to educate the United States Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to the benefits of participating in the Expo,"" Clark said at Expo. ""I am having those conversations now.""
Clark is the Expo's most senior U.S. government representative.
Congressional delegations are expected to visit the Expo, and Clark said he planned to ""emphasise the importance"" so that the government would be able to use public funds going forward.
Clark, a businessmen who was has been in the unpaid role for less than a month, was speaking to reporters at the U.S. pavilion which features a replica Space X Falcon 9 rocket and a Koran that was owned by third president Thomas Jefferson.
""United States of America"" is written in English and Arabic outside the pavilion. Visitors can eat ""New York"" bagels and drink Budweiser beer at the pavilion's restaurant and buy NASA T-shirts in the souvenir store.

The U.S. is forecasting its pavilion will attract over 2 million visitors the six months the fair runs for. Expo organisers expect 25 million visits to the fairgrounds.
The U.S., which has said it is interested in hosting the smaller ""Specialised Expo"" in 2027 in Minnesota is one of nearly 200 countries taking part in the Dubai fair, including adversaries China and Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Monday the federal government could breach its $28.4 trillion debt limit in a historic default unless Republicans join Democrats in voting to raise it in the two next weeks.
Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have twice in recent weeks blocked action to raise the debt ceiling https://www.reuters.com/world/us/congress-confronts-us-debt-ceiling-drama-again-2021-09-22, saying they do want action but will not help by voting for the move. Republicans say Democrats can use a parliamentary maneuver known as budget reconciliation to act alone. Top Democrats have rejected that approach.
""Raising the debt limit comes down to paying what we already owe ... not anything new,"" Biden said at a White House news conference.
Asked if he could guarantee the United States won't breach the debt limit, the president answered: ""No, I can't. That's up to Mitch McConnell."" He said he intended to speak with McConnell about the matter.
McConnell for months has said that Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to get around the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires 60 of 100 members to agree to pass most legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, has refused to use that approach, and Biden on Monday pleaded for Republicans not to block action with the filibuster.
""Just get out of the way,"" Biden told Republicans. ""If you don't want to help save the country, get out of the way so you don't destroy it.""
But Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who has been at odds with many in his party on other major issues, said Democratic leaders should not rule out using budget reconciliation to raise the debt ceiling.
""Well they shouldn't rule out anything - we just can't let the debt ceiling lapse,"" Manchin said, according to CNN reporter Manu Raju, who tweeted the senator's comments.
'PREVENTABLE CRISIS,' MCCONNELL SAYS
Calling default a ""preventable crisis,"" McConnell remained adamant. ""Democrats need to tackle the debt limit,"" he said on the Senate floor.
In an open letter to Biden, McConnell reiterated that Democrats do not need Republican cooperation to pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling. Democrats have known the Republican position for three months, McConnell wrote.
Late last month the U.S. House of Representatives passed and sent to the Senate a bill to suspend the limit on Treasury borrowing through the end of 2022.
Schumer on Monday filed a cloture motion, which ends debate, on a measure that would allow for extension of the debt limit. The Senate is likely to vote on it later this week, the third time Schumer has brought the issue to a vote.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week warned lawmakers that the United States government would exhaust its federal borrowing capabilities by about Oct. 18.
Failure to act could have catastrophic economic consequences. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) last month warned that default could cause a nearly 4% decline in economic activity, the loss of almost 6 million jobs, an unemployment rate of close to 9%, a sell-off in stocks that could wipe out $15 trillion in household wealth and a spike in interest rates on mortgages, consumer loans and business debts.
Concerns over the debt ceiling contributed to Monday's drop in the stock market. Wall Street's main indexes tumbled. (N)
Democrats voted to raise the debt limit during Republican President Donald Trump's administration even though they opposed deep tax cuts that added to the debt.
Biden said the United States racked up nearly $8 trillion in new debt over Trump's four years in office, more than one quarter of the entire debt outstanding.

""Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times"" under Trump, he said, with Democratic support.
Schumer said the Senate will have to stay in session through the weekend and possibly into a planned recess next week if no progress is made on raising the debt limit.

46,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senator Elizabeth Warren called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether stock transactions by top Federal Reserve officials violated insider trading rules.
“The reports of this financial activity by Fed officials raise serious questions about possible conflicts of interest and reveal a disregard for the public trust,” Warren wrote in a letter to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. “They also reflect atrocious judgement by these officials, and an attitude that personal profiteering is more important than the American people’s confidence in the Fed.”
Warren cited a Bloomberg News report on Friday that Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida’s 2020 financial disclosures show he traded between $1 million and $5 million out of a bond fund into stock funds one day before Chair Jerome Powell issued a statement flagging possible policy action as the pandemic worsened. Two regional Fed chiefs recently announced their departures following revelations about their trading activity last year.
A Fed spokesman, speaking on Clarida’s behalf, said in an Oct. 1 statement that the transactions were a “pre-planned rebalancing to his accounts,” and were “executed prior to his involvement in deliberations on Federal Reserve actions to respond to the emergence of the coronavirus and not during a blackout period.”
“There is no justifiable ethics or financial rationale for him or any other government official to be involved in these questionable market machinations while having access to non-public information and authority over decisions that have extraordinary impacts on markets and the economy,” Warren said.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston’s Eric Rosengren announced Sept. 27 that they were stepping down after their trading activity last year drew scrutiny. Rosengren cited a long-standing and worsening health condition in explaining his early retirement.

47,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she’s pushing ahead with a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill despite threats from progressive Democrats to sink the legislation without assurances the Senate will pass a more expansive tax and spending package as well.
“So far, so good for today,” Pelosi said at a news conference after a meeting of her leadership team. “We’re on a path to win the vote. I don’t want to even consider any other options than that.” By contrast, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, when asked by reporters if he is confident the bill will pass, said “nope.”
Pelosi held a series of meetings with moderate and progressive lawmakers in an attempt to find some bridge between the two wings of the party and prevent President Joe Biden’s agenda from getting stalled. But top progressives said they were unmoved.
“We are at the same place we’ve always been,” Representative Pramila Jayapal said after leaving Pelosi’s office. “We will not be able to vote for the infrastructure bill until the reconciliation bill has passed.”
Jayapal called Pelosi “a master vote counter,” but said there won’t be enough support for the bill to pass. 
Pelosi said she is confident that the bigger spending package, which encompasses much of Biden’s economic plan, would ultimately be enacted, despite hitches in negotiations with the Senate over the size and scope of the measure.
“There’s going to be a lot of conversations between now and when we get the vote,” Texas Representative Henry Cuellar, one of the moderates demanding a vote this week, said after meeting with Pelosi.
Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark said earlier Thursday that Democratic leaders are continuing to work to lock down the necessary support ahead of the planned vote on the $550 billion infrastructure package. She said even if that bill isn’t passed on Thursday, the impact would be limited.
 “Whether that vote happens today, and I hope it does, this is not over,” Clark said in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s “Surveillance” program. “If we haven’t reached that point in our negotiations, our commitment is to getting this entire agenda done, and that will happen.”
Progressives have pledged to vote against the infrastructure bill unless there’s agreement on the larger tax and social spending package. But negotiations on that have been dragging on, with Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona raising objections to the proposed $3.5 trillion price tag.
Their votes are necessary for Democrats to pass the package in the evenly divided Senate, through a budget process known as reconciliation that would bypass a filibuster.
While there is some Republican support for the infrastructure legislation, GOP leaders have been linking that bill with opposition to the bigger tax and spending plan Democrats are pushing through Congress.
“I think the majority, the overwhelming number of our members will vote no,” House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent and a leading progressive, called the House moderates’ demands for a vote this week “totally arbitrary.”
The infrastructure bill “will pass as soon as we have confirmation of a strong reconciliation bill that protects the needs of working families and addresses the crisis of climate change” he said. “We are talking about the most consequential piece of legislation for working people in modern history of this country.”

49,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer ratcheted up pressure on Republicans in their feud over raising the national debt limit, announcing Thursday he will seek a vote “as early as next week” on House-passed legislation suspending the legal ceiling.
The timetable brings the vote nearer the Oct. 18 deadline to avoid the first-ever default on U.S. sovereign debt and tightens the time available to pursue a convoluted alternative strategy to overcome a Republican blockade on addressing the debt limit.
Senate Republicans have twice blocked debt ceiling measures from advancing in the 50-50 chamber, where 60 votes are needed to proceed on most legislation.
Schumer again called on Republicans to give consent to let Democrats clear it with just 51 votes, instead of using a filibuster.
“If they want to oppose this measure and bring us closer to financial disaster, they can write their names in the history books as the senator that would let the country default for the first time ever, but Republicans need to get out of the way so Senate Democrats can address this issue quickly and without endangering the stability of our economy,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made clear Republicans remain united behind their demand that Democrats act on their own through a budgetary process called reconciliation, which could take nearly two weeks to complete.
The debt ceiling was suspended for two years under the Trump administration and snapped back into place in August. Although much of the recent increase in federal debt occurred when Republicans controlled the White House and Congress, the GOP is tying the debt limit increase to Democratic efforts to pass a tax and spending package of as much as $3.5 trillion.
The House-passed legislation would suspend the federal debt limit through December 2022.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this week the government would exhaust the “extraordinary measures” it has been using to pay bills since August and run out of cash on Oct. 18 without congressional action.

But the Rules Committee action, a party-line 7-3 vote, is little more than symbolic; even the panel’s Democratic chairman says Senate Republicans are likely to block the legislation. 
“I hope they take this second chance to do the right thing” and “to avoid a total economic meltdown,” Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said of Senate Republicans.
But the panel’s top Republican, Tom Cole of Oklahoma, responded that Republicans will not help Democrats raise the debt ceiling “as long as this majority insists on spending money like drunken sailors on shore leave.”
“They and they alone must act,” Cole added.
McGovern responded it’s clear Democrats will have to act alone. 
“The question is, why won’t the Senate Republican allow a clear up-or-down vote?” McGovern asked, adding the use of a procedural roadblock in that chamber to allowing even just a vote makes no sense to him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress on Tuesday that the Afghan army's sudden collapse caught the Pentagon ""by surprise,"" as military leaders confronted a contentious Senate hearing about how and why America lost its longest war.
Republican lawmakers accused President Joe Biden of lying about recommendations from his military that some troops should be kept in Afghanistan. Even Biden's Democrats expressed frustration with a chaotic withdrawal that left U.S. troops dead and American citizens behind.
Biden's approval ratings have been badly damaged by last month's spectacular collapse of the two-decade war effort, with painful images of Afghans clinging desperately to a U.S. military plane as they tried to escape Taliban rule. 
Thirteen U.S. troops also died in an Aug. 26 suicide bombing trying to safeguard the evacuation effort that, ultimately, relied on support from the militant Islamist Taliban, a long-time U.S. foe. 
General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Frank McKenzie of U.S. Central Command also acknowledged being caught off-guard by the speed of the Taliban takeover and collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.
It was their first public congressional testimony since the Taliban won the war in August.
""The fact that the Afghan army we and our partners trained simply melted away – in many cases without firing a shot – took us all by surprise,"" Austin, a former four-star general who served in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
""It would be dishonest to claim otherwise.""
McKenzie and Milley testified that they had believed it would have been best to keep a minimum of 2,500 troops in the country. In an August interview, Biden denied his commanders had recommended that, saying: ""No. No one said that to me that I can recall.""
Republican Senator Joni Ernst said Biden's decision to keep former President Donald Trump's unconditional withdrawal agreement with the Taliban had squandered U.S. sacrifices for what he thought would be ""a cheap political victory.""
""The loss of our service members, and abandonment of Americans and Afghan allies last month was an unforced, disgraceful humiliation that didn't have to happen,"" Ernst said.
Senator James Inhofe, the panel's top Republican, described it as a ""horror of the president's own making."" 
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Biden's military experts had provided ""a range of viewpoints"" about Afghanistan, and that Biden believed leaving troops there would ""mean war with the Taliban.""
Milley, the top U.S. military officer, noted military warnings since late 2020 that an accelerated, unconditional withdrawal could precipitate the collapse of the Afghan military and government.
""That was a year ago. My assessment remained consistent throughout,"" Milley said.
'WHY DON'T YOU RESIGN?'
Republican Senator Tom Cotton asked Milley why, if everything he said was true, he didn't resign his position.
Milley pushed back strongly, saying a U.S. president does not have to agree with the advice of his generals. ""This country doesn't want generals figuring out what orders we are going to accept and do or not. That's not our job,"" Milley said.
Austin, Milley and senators - many of whom oversaw the war effort for years - seemed full of questions about what went wrong, citing failures to appreciate the impact of corruption and damaged morale in the ranks. 
""There's a series of strategic lessons to be learned,"" Milley said.
Democrats faulted Republicans for blaming Biden, who has been president since January, for everything that went wrong during the 20 years U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan, including under Trump.
""Anyone who says the last few months were a failure, but everything before that was great, clearly hasn't been paying attention,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said.
Much of the hearing was devoted to Republicans' questions about Milley's interviews with Bob  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) and other reporters for books on the chaotic last months the former president was in the White House. 
Austin praised U.S. personnel who helped airlift 124,000 people out of the country. 
But Milley acknowledged that while the evacuation effort was a logistical accomplishment, the withdrawal was a ""strategic defeat"" that left the Taliban back in power. 
He warned the Taliban ""remains a terrorist organization"" which has not broken ties with al Qaeda.
A reconstituted al Qaeda in Afghanistan with aspirations to attack the United States was ""a very real possibility"" - perhaps in as little as a year, he said.
That warning is likely to unsettle lawmakers, who are skeptical of the Pentagon's ability to quickly respond to al Qaeda and Islamic State threats.

Austin defended plans to address future counterterrorism threats from overseas after a botched drone strike killed 10 Afghan civilians last month.
""Over-the-horizon operations are difficult but absolutely possible. And the intelligence that supports them comes from a variety of sources, not just U.S. boots on the ground,"" Austin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Almost a year after President Joe Biden trounced Donald Trump in Virginia, the state's unexpectedly tight race for governor has alarmed Democrats and left Republicans hopeful they can win back crucial suburban voters who left the party during Trump's tumultuous presidency. 
With early voting under way, the non-partisan Cook Report has labeled the Nov. 2 contest between Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor, and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin, a toss-up. A poll last week by the University of Mary Washington gave Youngkin an advantage with likely voters.
That is a surprising show of strength for the Republican in a Southern state that has trended Democratic in recent years. Trump lost by 10 percentage points in November, double his margin of defeat in 2016 in large part because his scorched-earth politics repelled moderate, suburban and female voters.
As one of the first statewide elections since Trump’s departure, the Virginia race is seen as a barometer for national political trends and a preview of what is to come in the 2022 elections that will decide which party controls Congress.
Current Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, cannot seek re-election because the state bars governors from serving consecutive terms.
While McAuliffe, 64, remains favored, Democrats “should absolutely be worried about the prospect of losing this race,"" said Jesse Ferguson, an aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
""This is absolutely a four-alarm fire,"" he said. ""It's been burning red-hot for months.""
The Biden administration has faced abundant challenges recently, including the chaotic pullout of forces from Afghanistan, the persistent COVID-19 pandemic and the humanitarian crisis at the U.S. southern border.
This week, the White House faces the prospect of a government shutdown if Congress cannot reach a deal to keep the federal government funded, while Democrats are split over a massive spending bill that includes Biden's key priorities.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week, 44% of U.S. adults approved of Biden’s performance, while 51% disapproved – his lowest marks since taking office in January.
Youngkin, 54, a former chief executive of The  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc private equity firm, provides an alternative for voters who were not comfortable with Trump but do not feel at home in the Democratic Party, said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from northern Virginia.
""These people voted for Biden because they didn’t want Donald Trump in their living room for four more years,"" Davis said. 
Youngkin, he said, ""speaks the language of suburbia. People don’t have to be embarrassed to put a Youngkin sign in their yards.""
Democrats are watching the race closely. A lack of enthusiasm among their voters and some independents who backed Biden in November is a worrisome harbinger ahead of next year’s elections, said Ben Tribbett, a Virginia-based Democratic strategist. 
“Democrats have a year to turn this around, but right now the electorate is not where we need them to be for the midterms,” Tribbett said.
A CHECK ON POWER
The governor’s race in Virginia has often served as a check on the party holding the White House. After Republican George W. Bush became president, Virginians elected Democrat Mark Warner in 2001. In 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell won a year into Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. While Virginia has trended in a more liberal direction since then, experts say it is more competitive without Trump on the ballot to galvanize Democratic turnout.
The former president still looms large: The election has become a test of whether Republicans such as Youngkin can successfully navigate the space between having Trump's support and being branded as a full-fledged adherent to his “Make America Great Again” movement. 
Youngkin has cast himself as an outsider businessman rather than a politician picking up Trump’s mantle. At the same time, he has tried not to stray too far from Trump's orbit as to alienate his ardent supporters.
He has not endorsed Trump’s false stolen-election claims, although he spoke at an “election integrity” rally in August held by Trump supporters. He has urged Virginians to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but has opposed vaccine and mask mandates. Youngkin has advocated for voting by mail - methods that Trump has falsely attacked as untrustworthy. 
An adviser to Youngkin, Kristin Davison, said the campaign has brought together “forever Trumpers and never Trumpers” —trying to appeal to Trump’s base while reaching out to independents and disaffected Democrats on issues such as inflation, education and crime.
There is a risk to that strategy. Trump argued in a recent radio interview that Youngkin needs to fully “embrace the MAGA movement"" or risk losing. McAuliffe has tried to tie Youngkin to Trump at every opportunity, suggesting there is little daylight between the two.
“He is a Trump wannabe,” McAuliffe said of his rival at their first debate. The second debate is scheduled for Tuesday.
CORONAVIRUS ELECTION
McAuliffe, who served as the state’s governor from 2014 to 2018, increasingly has made the contest about safeguards against the virus. He has said he would require all teachers and healthcare workers to be vaccinated and has run ads criticizing Youngkin on the issue. 
His campaign believes it will be a difference maker with suburban parents, an aide told Reuters. 

A source familiar with the White House’s thinking said McAuliffe was running a race centered on COVID-19 and the economy, similar to the themes Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized in handily defeating a Republican-led recall campaign this month. 
The White House is not worried about the race, the source added. “We always knew it was going to be close.""

55,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 01:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A disagreement among European Union countries means a pivotal trade meeting with the U.S. this week will be narrower in scope than originally planned and the contents of a joint statement outlining the results are still up in the air.
During a meeting of EU ambassadors on Monday, France wouldn’t agree to the draft conclusions for the trade and technology council meeting with the U.S. planned for Sept. 29 in Pittsburgh, according to officials familiar with the talks.
EU diplomats expect an updated draft to be sent around Monday evening, according to another official.
The meeting was planned as a reconciliation between the EU and the U.S. after four years of transatlantic conflict with former President Donald Trump. The four main topics to be discussed are screening foreign investments, export controls, semiconductor supply chains and artificial intelligence.
The French earlier sought to postpone the meeting in the aftermath of the announcement that Australia had inked a new defense pact with the U.S. and the U.K., which scuttled a contract France had to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.
Another EU diplomat said several countries have pushed for changes to the draft document, including ones aimed at protecting the EU’s regulatory autonomy from U.S. influence. 
The latest version of the TTC conclusions watered down the scope of the discussion on semiconductors, and would only focus on short-term supply chain issues, according to a copy of the draft conclusions seen by Bloomberg.
“This partnership should be balanced and of equal interest to both sides,” the draft said. “It will initially focus on short-term supply chain issues. Cooperation on mid- and long-term strategic semiconductor issues will begin in the relevant TTC working groups ahead of the next TTC meeting.”
At least one member state complained that the text was getting weaker with each new iteration, according to one of the officials, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Negotiations among the member states are ongoing in an effort to agree to a statement before the meeting.

PHOENIX (Reuters) - Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden in Arizona's most populous county, a review of results by his allies in the Republican Party has reaffirmed, capping a widely panned effort spurred by Trump's false claims of voter fraud.
Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, the Republican who paved the way for the so-called ""full forensic audit"" of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County, said the review's overall vote tally matched the initial results in November.
""Truth is truth, numbers are numbers,"" Fann said at a Senate hearing on the review, which found only small variations, yielding 99 additional votes for Biden and 261 fewer votes for Trump. ""Those numbers were close, within a few hundred.""
The conclusion will dismay Trump supporters who had pushed for the review, many in the expectation that it would prove his unfounded assertions that he was robbed of re-election due to orchestrated fraud. So far no such proof has been produced either by Trump or his backers. 
Outside groups tied to the ""Stop the Steal"" movement and other efforts to cast doubt on the 2020 results raised nearly all of the $6 million to fund the inquiry, viewing it as a catalyst for similar investigations in Pennsylvania, Michigan and other battleground states that Trump lost. 
In Texas on Thursday, the secretary of state's office said the state had begun an audit of the presidential election in its four largest counties - Dallas, Harris, Tarrant and Collin - an announcement that came hours after Trump publicly called for such a move. Although Trump carried Texas, Biden won three of the targeted counties. 
Trump, who had predicted the Arizona inquiry would substantiate his claims, issued a statement that appeared at odds with the review's findings, calling it ""a big win for democracy and a big win for us.""
Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer who represented Republican George W. Bush when he prevailed over Democrat Al Gore in a 2000 electoral dispute, called the review's conclusions a ""huge defeat"" for Trump.
""This was Donald Trump's best chance to prove his cases of elections being rigged and fraudulent and they failed,"" Ginsberg said on a media call organized by the States United Democracy Center, a nonpartisan policy group.
BIDEN VICTORY REAFFIRMED
In Arizona, Biden won by just over 10,000 votes, a narrow win confirmed by a hand recount and multiple post-election tests for accuracy. Biden carried Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, by about 45,000 votes, making it critical to his defeat of Trump.
The Arizona inquiry is part of a larger effort by Republicans to undermine faith in the 2020 election and gain more control over the voting process. So far this year, at least 18 Republican-led states have passed legislation curbing ballot access, moves they say are needed to ensure election integrity. Democrats say such laws are aimed at gaming the system since Republicans tend to do better in low-turnout elections.
Fann said the state Senate was working on legislation to achieve an ""unimpeachable electoral process"", based on alleged issues found in the review. She called for improvements to the signature verification process for absentee ballots, to the maintenance of voter rolls and to cybersecurity, even though no evidence has emerged that the state's systems were breached.
Democratic leaders said they were worried Republicans would use the review as a pretext to enact laws suppressing the vote.
Arizona's top elected official Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, in a statement denounced the review as ""a political stunt that created massive security risks, cost millions of dollars, and has shaken faith in free and fair elections.""
A wide array of election experts, Democrats and some Republican officials had long rejected the Arizona audit as a highly partisan boondoggle run by contractors without relevant expertise. The lead contractor was an obscure company, Cyber Ninjas, whose chief executive has promoted conspiracy theories about orchestrated fraud in the election.
The audit was marked by practices that critics described as ranging from inappropriate to bizarre, including counters marking ballots with blue ink, which can alter how they are read by machines, and workers checking for traces of bamboo fibers based on a conspiracy theory that forged ballots may have been shipped in from Asia.
While finding the overall vote tallies largely matched up, the report highlighted a series of alleged problems, including 10,342 potential voters who voted in different counties, which Cyber Ninjas termed a ""critical finding.""
As part of a point-by-point rebuttal on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Maricopa County called that claim ""laughable"", suggesting those conducting the review may have failed to account for people with matching names and birth years in different counties, a not uncommon occurrence in a state of more than 7 million people.

Fann said she had passed along the review's findings to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who said his election integrity unit would look at the evidence.
""Arizonans deserve to have their votes accurately counted and protected,"" Brnovich said.

57,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Democratic leaders said on Friday they intended to forge ahead next week with U.S. President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion social agenda as well as a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.
But with Democrats continuing to squabble over details of the social spending, it was unclear when votes would actually occur. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter to fellow Democrats vowing to ""move forward to pass two jobs bills next week.""
""The bill will come up on Monday,"" Pelosi told reporters, referring to the smaller of the two measures that would help spark road, bridge, airport, school and other construction projects. The Senate passed that bill with bipartisan support on Aug. 10.
Far more complex is Democrats' drive for $3.5 trillion for expanding healthcare for children and the elderly and for investing in steps to drastically reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions blamed for climate change.
Asked about the timing for that legislation on the House floor, Pelosi told reporters, ""Have a little patience. Follow it, see it unfold. It’s interesting. We’re very encouraged.""
A large group of progressive lawmakers insist that the $1 trillion infrastructure bill be held back until the $3.5 trillion was ready. Moderates want the $1 trillion bill enacted no matter the progress on the larger measure.

The moderates extracted a promise from Pelosi for a House vote on it by Sept. 27.
Meanwhile, lawmakers were expected to spend the weekend working out thorny matters, including possibly bringing down the $3.5 trillion price tag, setting specific tax increases to fully offset the cost and settling a dispute over lower prescription drug prices.

“We got off to a very fast start with the first piece of legislation,” Biden said Friday at the White House, referring to his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief law that passed in March.  
“I don’t expect this to be done, and us be in a position where we can look back and say, ‘Okay, did we get it done?,’ until basically the end of the year,” he said of his larger economic plans. “I don’t mean the vote on the two pieces of legislation relating to the economy, but I think it’s just going to take some time.”
The House could vote as soon as Monday on the Senate-passed infrastructure bill, but the larger package of social spending encompassing much of Biden’s agenda is still being negotiated among Democrats.
House liberals have warned they won’t support the $550 billion public works legislation, negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators without their input, unless the Senate first passes the larger bill.
Senate moderates have expressed alarm at the initial $3.5 trillion price tag for that bill as well as some of the tax increases Biden and progressives have proposed to pay for it.
“This is a process, and it’s going to be up and down. That’s why I don’t look at the polls -- not a joke,” Biden said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate aims to vote next week on raising Washington's borrowing authority and keeping the government funded, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat said on Wednesday, as a House Democrat warned that Republican opposition could lead to a historic default on the nation's debt.
Senator Dick Durbin said the chamber sometime next week would take up the bill passed in a party-line House of Representatives vote. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said his caucus will sink the emergency legislation to suspend the $28.4 trillion federal debt ceiling.
Republicans have said Democrats should act alone to raise the debt ceiling, using a maneuver called ""budget reconciliation.""
Time is short as funding for federal agencies expires on Oct. 1 and the U.S. Treasury has warned it could run out of money to pay the government's bills by some time in October, potentially triggering a default.
House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said ""parliamentary obstacles"" prevent Democrats from including language to raise the debt ceiling in a social spending bill moving through Congress under the budget reconciliation maneuver that circumvents the need for Republican votes. 
""The ball is now in Senator McConnell's court. If he doesn't support this (House-passed) bill - or at least ensure it is not filibustered - our country will default and our government will shut down,"" Yarmuth said in a statement. ""The decision is now his.""
It further complicates a messy picture for Congress, where talks aimed at police reform collapsed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-are-refusing-back-police-reforms-trump-supported-white-house-2021-09-22 on Wednesday and the moderate and progressive wings of President Joe Biden's Democratic Party are deeply divided https://www.reuters.com/world/us/splits-among-democrats-plague-effort-pass-bidens-domestic-agenda-2021-09-21 on the size of a proposed $3.5 trillion social spending bill that is at the core of the White House's domestic legislative agenda.
Republicans are betting that dragging out the debate over the debt will further stymie https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-see-opportunity-us-debt-ceiling-standoff-2021-09-22 Democrats. 
Republicans say they support additional spending to keep the government operating with the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year and to help communities recover from recent natural disasters.
But they refuse to vote for it, saying raising the nation's borrowing authority is Democrats' problem because of the $3.5 trillion spending plan to invest in expanded social services and address climate change.
Democrats note that they voted to raise the nation's debt limit during Republican Donald Trump's administration even though they opposed deep tax cuts that added to the debt.
'ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY'
Durbin said: ""There comes a point where you have to accept responsibility"" for avoiding a U.S. government default on its debt in coming weeks and provide temporary federal funding for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1 to avoid the third partial U.S. government shutdown in a decade.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday it is ""very important"" for Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling in a timely fashion and that no one should assume the central bank can fully protect the economy or financial markets in the event of a U.S. debt default.
Biden met on Wednesday with a number of Democratic lawmakers in an attempt to heal divisions over his budget reconciliation plan of climate and social spending measures that Democrats aim to pass in coming weeks using special procedures that do not require Republican support.
Moderate Democrats see the price tag as too high, while some House progressives are threatening to vote down a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill backed by the president, and set for a Monday vote, unless the $3.5 trillion bill is also nailed down.
The White House said in a statement after the meetings that ""progress was made toward finding the pathway forward"" on both bills. It said Biden and his team would have follow-up meetings starting on Thursday.
Among attendees, moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has urged the price tag of the spending plan be no more than $1.5 trillion, said: ""He (Biden) just basically said: 'Find a number you're comfortable with, based on the needs that we still have, and how we deliver to the American people.'"" 
But there were fresh signs of Democratic infighting as 11 liberal senators supported the House progressives who want the planned Monday vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill delayed. 

Senator Bernie Sanders and the other 10 senators said in a statement they had voted for the bill with the understanding it and the spending plan would move together.
""Passing the infrastructure bill first would be in violation of that agreement,"" they said. ""That is what we agreed to, it’s what the American people want, and it’s the only path forward for this Congress.”

(Reuters) - A Florida Republican lawmaker has filed a bill that would ban abortions after six to eight weeks and allow members of the community to sue doctors for terminating pregnancies in what may be the first effort to mirror a similar new law in Texas.
The bill by state Representative Webster Barnaby would ban abortions after regular cardiac contractions are detected in an embryo, known as a fetal heartbeat even though the heart has not yet developed, about six to eight weeks into pregnancy. That is before many women know they are pregnant.
The bill was immediately condemned by proponents of reproductive rights.
""It's a FL version of TX's bill and it's disgusting,"" Florida state Representative Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Helene Krasnoff, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president for public policy litigation and law, said the Florida bill was the first such legislation she had seen filed since Texas' ""Heartbeat Act"" became law.
The Texas law and the Florida bill are the latest in a decades-long string of efforts by Republican officials to limit or ban abortion in conservative states.
The right to abortion was established in the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but abortion-rights advocates fear it could be overturned when the court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, hears a bid by Mississippi or other states to overturn that decision.
Barnaby's bill, which was filed for consideration in the Republican-controlled legislature next year, is similar to the Texas measure in that would ban abortion after the so-called fetal heartbeat is detected and allow abortion opponents to sue doctors and their employees for $10,000 for terminating pregnancies.
The Texas law is more restrictive, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and it can be interpreted to allow lawsuits to be filed against anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion, such as taxi drivers or friends who might give her a ride to the doctor.
The Florida bill makes exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies that threaten the life of the woman.
The Texas law, the most restrictive in the country, took effect on Sept. 1 after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to act on a request by abortion-rights groups to block it.

It was a victory for conservatives, who have long sought to eliminate abortion access in the United States.
Prominent Democrats including President Joe Biden voiced outrage, and Biden's Justice Department has challenged the Texas law in federal court.

White, who served as the chief trade adviser to the Senate Finance Committee, has worked on nearly every major trade issue and legislation for two decades. 
White worked closely with Tai, who previously served as chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, to strengthen the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement that took effect in July 2020. 

In his confirmation hearing, White had vowed to carry out ""robust monitoring"" of compliance to the U.S.-EU agreement on aircraft subsidies.

Batchelder won confirmation in a 64-34 vote, with 15 Republicans voting in support of the New York University law professor.
The vote gives the Treasury Department its fourth confirmed political appointee, with at least nine others still awaiting confirmation. Many of Biden's nominees have been held up by Republican holds over unrelated policy issues.
It came after a vote on cloture, which essentially limits debate on any bill or motion before the Senate and sets a 30-hour window before a final vote must be held. The process eliminates the ability of senators to filibuster, or hold the floor indefinitely, and delay a vote.
Batchelder, who served as the Senate Finance Committee’s chief tax counsel from 2010 to 2014, has pledged to work with Congress on tax policy that fosters economic recovery, promotes equality and addresses climate change.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said it was high time the Senate moved forward on Batchelder's nomination, which was announced in April.
""Secretary (Janet) Yellen needs her full team in place at the Treasury. The country is going to be dealing with the aftereffects of the pandemic economic crash for years to come. There’s a long way to go before full recovery,"" he said in a statement on the Senate floor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Confused and tired-looking toddlers clung to their parents at Port-au-Prince airport in Haiti on Tuesday, among the 360 family members rapidly expelled from the U.S. over the past three days.
These scenes came after U.S. border agents on horseback on Sunday used whip-like reins to block Haitian migrants wading across the Rio Grande with food and supplies from Mexico to a squalid encampment with nearly 10,000 people on the Texas side.
The images triggered anguish among some current U.S. officials interviewed by Reuters who said they once had high hopes that U.S. President Joe Biden would quickly reverse the hardline immigration policies of his Republican predecessor Donald Trump and, as he promised, ""restore humanity and American values"" to the immigration system.
Outside the government, disillusioned immigration advocates point to Biden's refusal to repeal Trump's most sweeping policy known as Title 42 - that allows border agents to quickly expel most migrants to Mexico or their home countries without a chance to apply for asylum.
Biden extended the March 2020 policy put in place by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, arguing it remained necessary as a public health measure amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""These deterrence (and) expulsion measures deny due process to asylum seekers and place them in harm's way. That is a human rights violation,"" Michael Knowles (NYSE:KN), president of AFGE Local 1924, the union that represents the asylum officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) told Reuters. 
""Our members are outraged by the mistreatment of migrants and the refusal of our border authorities to allow them to have their asylum claims heard.""
Three other USCIS employees expressed similar concerns to Reuters, as did an official at another government agency.
Asylum officers interview migrants and refugees to determine if they need protection in the United States, while Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents oversee border security and detention. 
Top Democratic lawmakers joined in the criticism. The dwindling goodwill among allies comes as Biden's immigration agenda was dealt a blow on Sunday when the Senate parliamentarian ruled Democratic proposals to give legal status to millions of immigrants in the United States could not be included in a budget reconciliation bill.
'WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE IN?'
Biden did exempt unaccompanied children from Title 42 expulsions early in his presidency. But he has included families, even after a federal judge on Thursday ordered the government to stop expelling them. The administration is appealing the order.
    A two-week stay on the order was ""to allow the government time to organize itself,"" said Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union suing the administration over the policy, ""not to round up as many people as possible to expel them, and certainly not to expel desperate Haitian asylum seekers."" 
The Trump administration argued many asylum claims were false and issued a flurry of policies to limit protections, moves that were often criticized by the USCIS' union headed by Knowles. 
One of the USCIS officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press said it was understood it would take time to roll back the Trump-era measures, but that some are now losing patience in the face of slow reform.
""It's appalling, disgusting,"" the official said. ""What do they believe in, if this is acceptable?"" Some colleagues were considering whether to leave their jobs, the official said.
Another USCIS official spoke of being ""personally mortified."" 
USCIS referred a request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who did not immediately respond.
RECORD CROSSINGS
On Tuesday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Title 42 was being applied to the fullest extent possible, while at the same time condemning the actions of the agents on horseback saying the incident was being investigated and those involved had been assigned administrative duties.
As Biden is facing criticism from the left, Republicans say he has encouraged illegal migration by moving too fast to reverse other Trump-era immigration reforms.
In recent months, the number of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border increased to 20-year highs with close to 200,000 encounters in August alone, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, though that is counting individuals who may have crossed multiple times.
Early in his presidency, Biden took several executive actions cheered by immigration groups - such as ending Trump's travel bans on several Muslim-majority countries and scrapping a policy that sent asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings. He also exempted unaccompanied minors from Title 42 expulsions and reduced the number of families being expelled.
In a letter to Congress, retired Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott said Biden's reversals created a crisis at the border and constituted ""a national security threat."" Unlike the USCIS union, the unions representing border and ICE agents have been vocal Trump backers. 

Earlier this year, Biden also extended deportation relief to around 150,000 Haitians already living in the United States with Temporary Protected Status, though the benefits do not apply to anyone who arrived after July 29. 
Biden acknowledged conditions are dire in the Caribbean country that has long struggled with violence and recently suffered a presidential assassination and a major earthquake.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiations in the U.S. Congress to tighten police practices following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis have collapsed, Democratic Senator Cory Booker said on Wednesday, as President Joe Biden blamed Republicans for the failure.
The end of congressional negotiations, at least for now, marked a setback for the Democratic president, who campaigned on the need for policing reforms.
Calling Floyd's murder ""a stain on the soul of America,"" Biden in a statement held out hope for eventually signing a comprehensive police reform bill into law and said he will look at developing further executive actions on the matter.
""Regrettably, Senate Republicans rejected enacting modest reforms, which even the previous president had supported, while refusing to take action on key issues that many in law enforcement were willing to address,"" Biden said, referring to his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.
Among the issues that lawmakers were discussing were changes to ""qualified immunity"" https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-scotus that protects police officers from some lawsuits accusing them of using excessive force, as well as prohibiting the kind of chokeholds and other restraints on people being arrested that have led to deaths.
""It was clear at this negotiating table at this moment we were not making progress"" following nine months of meetings, Booker said. 
""In fact, recent back and forths with paper showed me that we were actually moving away from it,"" Booker told reporters.
Republican Senator Tim Scott in a statement accused Democrats of reverting to ""a partisan approach to score political points."" Scott said the two sides had reached agreements banning chokeholds, limiting the transfer of military equipment to police departments and increasing mental health resources. 
In April, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a death that triggered protests across the United States and gave new impetus to police reform efforts in Washington to stamp out systemic racism.
Floyd, a Black man, died after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.

Reform advocates encouraged Biden to use his executive powers to achieve changes.
One of the congressional negotiators, Democratic Representative Karen Bass, pointed to just such an action this month imposing strict limits on when federal officers can use chokeholds and ""no-knock warrants."" But those will not apply to local police departments.

Harris will make the announcement during a virtual COVID-19 summit being held on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. It is aimed at boosting vaccinations worldwide with the goal of ending the COVID-19 pandemic by the end of 2022.
Harris will be chairing a session on preventing future pandemics, a senior administration official said.

The United States has also been criticized for planning booster shots for fully vaccinated Americans while millions of people around the world still do not have access to the life-saving vaccines. Other countries including the UK and Israel have already begun booster shot campaigns.
The new Global Health Security Financial Intermediary Fund will be created at the World Bank to coalesce resources for pandemic preparedness, the White House official said.
The Biden administration will also request an additional $850 million from the U.S. Congress for the fund, to build on the $630 million in such funding that was secured for fiscal year 2021.
""Her leadership over the last several months has included very specific engagement on preparing for the next pandemic,"" a senior administration official said of Harris.

""She has said it is clear we are not ready for the next pandemic,"" the official said, adding that in order to be prepared we need to build the resources to help low-income countries and put in place ""some sort of... early warning governance structure.""

68,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address expanding the federal deduction for state and local taxes at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon with President Joe Biden, according to two people familiar with his thinking.
The discussion would bring Biden into a conversation he has so far avoided: how to address a politically important -- but expensive -- tax break that largely benefits higher-income households.
The state and local tax, or SALT, write-off has divided Democrats over whether to expand a measure that’s a boost to homeowners in Democratic strongholds including California, New York and New Jersey, but also would eat into the revenue that Democrats have to spend on social programs.
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are set to meet with the president Wednesday to discuss the path forward for a package of social spending proposals and tax hikes that Democrats are pursuing in Congress.
SALT has become one of the most contentious issues -- along with the overall cost of the package. Bringing Biden into the debate over SALT could help lawmakers broker a deal. Biden has so far stayed out of the discussions over SALT, having omitted it from his tax plans. White House officials have so far said it was up to Congress to come up with a solution -- as well as revenue measures to offset the cost of the expanded break.
Unsettled Issue
House Democrats failed to agree on a way to address SALT when they approved the bill in the House Ways and Means Committee last week, leaving the issue to House leaders to resolve. Neal has pledged to find a way to address the SALT cap with Pelosi.
Many of the conversations on how to address SALT are focused a two year repeal of the $10,000 cap -- making the tax break unlimited, for that period -- according to an aide familiar with the plan. Lawmakers have also previously discussed increasing the cap threshold, which is a less costly alternative.
Republicans instituted the $10,000 cap in their 2017 tax overhaul, and it went to help offset some of the slew of income and corporate tax cuts they enacted.

69,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Six former Treasury secretaries appealed to congressional leaders to raise the statutory limit on U.S. debt in order to avoid a debilitating default on the U.S. government’s financial obligations.
“Even a short-lived default could threaten economic growth,” the bipartisan group, which included Robert Rubin, Henry Paulson and Lawrence Summers, wrote in a letter dated Wednesday to Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. “It creates the risk of roiling markets and of sapping economic confidence.”
Democrats this week are pursuing an almost certainly doomed attempt to pass a bill that would fund the government through the end of the year and suspend the debt ceiling for a year. Republicans have pledged to block the legislation in the Senate.
The limit kicked in at $28.4 trillion at the beginning of August following a two-year suspension, forcing the Treasury to employ so-called extraordinary measures to avert breaching the ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the department will run out of money some time in October.
The letter from former Treasury secretaries also backed the Treasury’s assertion that it could not prioritize payments in the event of a default to make sure investors in Treasury securities were protected.

He added he was confident Biden and Xi would also meet at some point but did not know when.

(Reuters) - One leading candidate seeking to become Georgia’s chief elections official, Republican Jody Hice, is a Congressman who voted to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win in the hours after the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. Hice had posted on social media earlier that day: “This is our 1776 moment,” referencing the American Revolution.
In Arizona, the contenders for the elections-chief office, secretary of state, include Republican state lawmaker Mark Finchem, who attended the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally before the deadly insurrection and spoke at a similar gathering the previous day. In Nevada, one strong Republican candidate for elections chief is Jim Marchant, who unsuccessfully sued to have his own defeat in a 2020 congressional race reversed based on unfounded voter-fraud claims.
The three candidates are part of a wider group of Republican secretary-of-state contenders in America’s swing states who have embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims that he lost a “rigged” election. Their candidacies have alarmed Democrats and voting-rights groups, who fear that the politicians who tried hardest to undermine Americans’ faith in elections last year may soon be the ones running them - or deciding them, in future contested votes.
Jena Griswold, chair of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State and Colorado's top elections official, said the secretary-of-state races reflect a much broader exploitation of phony voter-fraud claims by Republicans seeking all levels of elected office.
""That is ‘code red’ for democracy,"" she said in an interview.
Secretary-of-state candidates face primary elections next spring and summer and general elections on Nov. 8, 2022, along with the midterm congressional contests.
Reuters interviewed nine of the 15 declared Republican candidates for secretary of state in five battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada -- and reviewed public statements by all of the candidates. Ten of the 15 have either declared that the 2020 election was stolen or called for their state’s results to be invalidated or further investigated. 
Only two of the nine candidates Reuters interviewed said that Biden won the election.
The group of 15 includes Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state and the only incumbent Republican in the five battleground states who is seeking re-election. Raffensperger has consistently rejected Trump’s stolen-election allegations in the face of intense pressure from many fellow Republicans to overturn Biden’s win in the state.
Nearly all of the Republican contenders have stressed a need to curb mail-in voting, to limit ballot drop boxes and to take other steps to curtail ballot access. A majority said they backed a Republican push for more audits or other investigations of the 2020 vote, despite dozens of audits, recounts and court rulings that confirmed Biden’s victory.
Shawnna Bolick - an Arizona state representative and a Republican contender for state elections chief - has gone a step further. She proposed a law empowering the Arizona legislature, currently controlled by Republicans, to overrule the secretary of state’s certification of popular vote results. That call for a drastic change in how America chooses presidents comes after Trump’s unsuccessful attempt to get Republicans in states he lost to send electors for him instead of Biden to Congress. (See graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ELECTORAL-COLLEGE/qzjpqaeqapx/media-embed.html on how the U.S. Electoral College works.)
Bolick said she intended to make certification “more democratic” and that her bill did not allow lawmakers to pick a winner.
Boris Epshteyn, a former special assistant to Trump, said the party is focused on secretary-of-state elections. So is Trump, who has endorsed candidates in three states: Hice in Georgia; Finchem in Arizona; and Kristina Karamo, a Michigan educator he praised for parroting his false claims of winning that state.
""It's vital they have the right ideals,"" Epshteyn said of Republican secretary-of-state candidates. ""That includes, first and foremost, getting to the bottom of the 2020 election as well as making sure widespread voter fraud doesn't happen going forward.""
It’s highly unusual for a former U.S. president to endorse secretary-of-state candidates. “President Trump is proud to endorse candidates who fight for election integrity,” said Liz Harrington, a Trump spokeswoman.
Democrats and nonpartisan election experts say it appears that Trump allies - having been foiled in their attempt to reverse Biden’s victory - are now trying to make it easier to overturn future results.
Republican State Leadership Committee spokesman Andrew Romeo said his organization acknowledges that Biden beat Trump in the 2020 election but that it proudly supports candidates focused on making it “easier to vote and harder to cheat for all Americans.”
The Republican secretary-of-state candidates are part of a much larger party effort to exert more control over election administration following Trump’s false fraud claims. At least 18 Republican-led states have passed voting restrictions they say are intended to ensure election integrity. Democrats argue such measures are intended to suppress voting because Republicans fare better in low-turnout elections.
Georgia and Arizona have put greater power over elections in the hands of Republican-controlled state legislatures. In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona, Republican lawmakers are pursuing partisan audits https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pennsylvania-republicans-kick-start-2020-election-review-with-hearing-2021-09-09 of the 2020 vote. The long-delayed results of the audit in Maricopa County, Arizona - launched five months ago - are scheduled for release on Friday.
The false voter-fraud claims by Trump and his allies have inspired hundreds of threats of hanging, firing squads, bombs and other violence against election officials and their families, Reuters has reported this year. A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-law-enforcement this month revealed that U.S. law enforcement has held almost no one accountable for the barrage of threats https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-georgia-threats and intimidation of election administrators.
CAMPAIGN DONATIONS POUR IN
Secretaries of state oversee elections in most U.S. states and have significant power over how votes are cast, counted and certified. They typically approve vote tallies in individual counties and the overall presidential results.
In normal times, most voters might struggle to name their secretary of state or detail their election-oversight duties. But these once-overlooked races are drawing far more attention and money this year from both parties, according to interviews with party officials and a Reuters review of political fundraising records.
Campaign finance reports from Georgia and Michigan show donors from both parties piling aggressively into their races early in the cycle. Georgia candidates raised $1.8 million between February and June - nearly four times what was raised in the same period of 2017 ahead of the last Georgia secretary-of-state election in 2018, according to campaign finance disclosures.
In Georgia, Trump allies are eager to unseat incumbent Republican Raffensperger after he rebuffed Trump's request to ""find"" just enough votes https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKBN2980MG to reverse Trump’s Georgia loss.
David Becker, an election expert and former Justice Department voting-rights attorney, said Raffensperger and other secretaries of state last year formed a bulwark to protect democracy under extreme pressure from Trump and his allies. The prospect of those allies running elections, he said, “should chill all of us.”
""If one of these con artists became Secretary of State, and President Trump tried to make the call he made to Secretary Raffensperger - to someone with less integrity, who denies democracy - what happens if that person takes that call?”
This year, one prominent donor to pro-Trump secretary-of-state candidates is the Presidential Coalition, a conservative group founded by David Bossie, a former Trump deputy campaign manager who was initially tapped in November to lead Trump's failed post-election court challenges before testing positive for COVID-19. The coalition gave Hice $7,000 in June, campaign financial disclosures show. Bossie said in an interview that the coalition is looking at backing Finchem in Arizona and other secretary-of-state candidates in Nevada, Michigan and ""many other states.”
Democrats say they are just as energized to win secretary-of-state races. The party’s fundraising arm for those campaigns, chaired by Griswold, has raised $1.1 million in the first six months of 2021, according to filings with the U.S. Treasury Department. Griswold said they aim to raise at least $10 million before the election.
TRUMP ENDORSEMENTS
In Arizona, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is running for governor, leaving her seat an open race. She won by a single percentage point in 2018, and both parties expect another extremely close race next year.
Trump last week endorsed Finchem for Arizona secretary of state, praising his “powerful stance on the massive Voter Fraud.” The state lawmaker is now seen as a favorite in the Republican primary. Finchem declined an interview request.
In addition to promoting voter-fraud claims and calling for Arizona to decertify Biden’s win, Finchem has expressed views linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles and cannibals.
Finchem was a featured speaker at the Jan. 5 ""pre-rally"" in Washington, a warm-up for the bigger gathering at which Trump himself spoke. “When you steal something, that’s not really a win; that’s a fraud,” Finchem said. Addressing members of Congress, he said: “This ain’t going away.”
One of his competitors for the Republican nomination is Bolick, the lawmaker who introduced the bill to allow the legislature to revoke the secretary of state’s election certification. The bill died in committee.
In an interview, Bolick tried to draw a distinction between herself and Finchem, saying she was “not part of ‘Stop the Steal.’”
But like Finchem, Bolick signed onto a resolution in December urging Congress to award Arizona’s Electoral College votes to Trump, despite his loss to Biden by more than 10,000 votes.
In Nevada, Marchant said he expects to get Trump’s endorsement. Trump endorsed Marchant when he ran unsuccessfully last year for Congress. If elected secretary of state, Marchant said, he would seek to end all early voting and ban the use of voting machines temporarily while the devices are examined for evidence of election-rigging.
Marchant could not provide evidence of fraud in Nevada when asked for it in an interview.
In Wisconsin, businessman and secretary of state candidate Jay Schroeder is considered the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He said in an interview that ""there is lots of reasonable doubt"" as to whether Biden won the election.
The secretary of state in Wisconsin, unlike most other states, does not oversee elections. Schroeder is campaigning to change that: He advocates for stripping election oversight power from the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and giving it back to the secretary of state, which controlled elections until a decade ago.
If he gets his way, he said, he would get tough with counties that don't follow the law: ""I would call for an audit, and if the county refused that, I would not certify their results.”
GEORGIA RACES TO TEST TRUMP’S CLOUT
Georgia is shaping up to be a key 2022 battleground, with competitive Senate, governor and secretary-of-state races next year. These elections will be a major test of whether Republicans who crossed Trump can survive primaries - and whether those who backed his election-fraud falsehoods can win general elections against Democrats.
With Trump's support, Hice is seen as the frontrunner in Georgia's Republican nominating contest. Hice has raised $580,000 between February and June, more than doubling Raffensperger's haul of $249,000, according to campaign finance disclosures.
Hice has been among the most strident backers of Trump’s baseless stolen-election claims. In the hours after the Jan. 6 riots, Hice was among 147 Republican members of Congress https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-lawmakers-special-report/special-report-stolen-election-republican-lawmakers-paralyzed-by-trumps-false-fraud-claims-idUSKBN2A41CP who voted against certifying Biden’s election win in at least one of two states that came up for a vote.
Hice did not respond to requests for comment on his candidacy, his voter-fraud allegations, or his “1776” social-media post on Jan. 6, which was deleted after Trump supporters breached the Capitol.
Bossie's group supported Raffensperger in 2018 but now condemns his failure ""to fight for what the overwhelming number of Republican voters in Georgia were demanding, which was ballot integrity,"" Bossie said. ""2020 was a total disgrace.""
Multiple recounts and audits have confirmed Biden won Georgia by about 12,000 votes. Raffensperger has repeatedly described the November election as secure and told Reuters in a recent interview that Trump’s surrogates don’t have the facts to support their allegations.
Since the vote, Raffensperger and his family have been inundated with threats of violence, causing them to go into hiding at one point and to take other precautions, including starting their car remotely to guard against bombs, the Reuters investigations revealed.
Hice's candidacy is not without risk for Republicans. His vocal support of Trump’s false voter-fraud allegations could drive away some moderates and independents in a general election, political consultants said.
Another Republican contender in Georgia is David Belle Isle, who lost a runoff to Raffensperger in 2018 and is running again next year.

Belle Isle acknowledged he had no “smoking gun"" to prove widespread fraud. But he said he believes Biden should not have been declared the winner because too few absentee ballots were rejected despite their potential for fraud.
Raffensperger, he said, “certified the wrong result.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to pull back powers from the presidency, part of an ongoing effort to rein in the White House in a rebuke to the administration of former Republican President Donald Trump.
House leaders said the ""Protecting our Democracy Act"" would restore the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government that was written into the Constitution.
Among other things, it would put new limits on the use of presidential pardons, prohibit self-pardons and strengthen measures to prevent foreign election interference or illegal campaign activity by White House officials.
The bill also would boost subpoena enforcement, protect inspectors general and watchdogs and strengthen oversight of emergency declarations.
As president, Trump fired a series of inspectors general - watchdogs charged with fighting corruption at federal agencies. To sidestep congressional control over government spending, he declared a national emergency at the border with Mexico to force the transfer of military funds to help build a wall there, a campaign promise.
""We have to codify this... so that no president of whatever party can ever assume that he, or she, has the power to usurp the power of the other branches of government,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a news conference.
Representative Adam Schiff, a lead sponsor, said Democratic President Joe Biden's White House had been consulted on the bill's contents. He said he hoped for a House vote this autumn.
The path forward was uncertain. Democrats hold only a slim House majority, and the Republican caucus stands firmly behind Trump, who is expected to run for re-election in 2024 and remains the party's most influential leader.

Republicans overwhelmingly opposed Trump's two impeachments - led by many of the Democrats who introduced the legislation - and rejected a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters.
Aides to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If the ""Women's Health Protection Act"" passes the Democratic-controlled House, it is unlikely to succeed in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans also are a minority but hold enough votes to prevent it from reaching the 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation.
Democrats sent the bill to the full House after a law took effect in Texas early this month that almost completely bans abortion in the state. 
The right to abortion was established in the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but abortion-rights advocates fear it could be overturned when the court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, hears Mississippi's bid to overturn that decision.
""Action is both urgent and necessary,"" said Representative Norma Torres during a hearing of the House Rules Committee, which voted 9-4 along party lines to advance the legislation to the full House.
Republicans attacked the legislation, arguing that it would expand access to abortions beyond the intent of Roe v. Wade.
""It's the fiercest assault on the unborn since Roe was decided,"" said Representative Tom Cole, the senior House Rules panel Republican. He added that the Democrats' bill ""would pre-empt any state law that seeks to protect (unborn) life.""

While a majority of Americans for many years have supported at least some forms of abortion, it is one of the most divisive issues in American society.
A mid-June Reuters/Ipsos survey found that 52% of adults said abortion should be legal in ""most"" or ""all"" cases, while 36% said it should be illegal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday set May 18 as a tentative date for the start of a trial of four men allegedly affiliated with the ""Proud Boys"" movement on charges stemming from their participation in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said that a May trial slot was the first available for a large courtroom at the Washington D.C. federal courthouse often used on ceremonial occasions. In conversations with defense lawyers, the judge discussed the possibility of a trial running four to six weeks.
All four defendants facing trial in the case - Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Charles Donohoe - are currently held in pre-trial custody. Defense lawyers have made multiple unsuccessful efforts to win their release on bail. A further status hearing was set for Oct. 26.
Proud Boys are one of three right-wing militia groups targeted by prosecutors for their role in the riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump that broke out as Congress met to certify Joe Biden's November presidential election victory. Prosecutors said last week that more than 600 defendants had been arrested on riot-related charges.
The four facing the May trial were videotaped leading a crowd toward the Capitol on Jan. 6. In court filings, the U.S. government said they helped lead the break in of the Capitol. The men dispute the charges.

A defense lawyer has said that the FBI possesses videos showing that Nordean, alleged to be one of the Proud Boys' Jan. 6 leaders, advised group members marching toward the Capitol that their goal was a photo op and that they would only spend a few minutes at the Capitol and then turn around.
Four people died on the day of the riot, one fatally shot by police and three from medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day.

Nearly one in three people did not have access to adequate food last year, Biden said in his speech to the annual gathering of world leaders, and the United States is committing to rally partners to address malnutrition. 
""To that end, the United States is making a $10 billion commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad,"" Biden said. 

He did not provide details on the program. On Thursday the United Nations hosts a ""Food Systems Summit"" that it says will ""trigger the transformation of food systems"" though a series of pledges.

76,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 01:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Democratic leaders plan a Monday vote on the Senate-passed infrastructure bill, a move that risks deepening divisions in their caucus and dooming President Joe Biden’s economic agenda. 
The infrastructure vote will almost certainly come before a vote on a broader tax and spending package, the size and scope of which has been the subject of Democratic discord for the last several weeks. 
The timing of the infrastructure vote will appease moderate Democrats who were assured last month that the $550 billion package, which had bipartisan Senate support, would receive a vote by Sept. 27. In exchange, they supported a $3.5 trillion budget outline that served as the starting point for the broader so-called reconciliation package. 
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats, however, have maintained they wouldn’t support the infrastructure bill -- which they have the power to defeat -- if the House votes on it before the larger package of social and other programs is passed by the House and Senate.
“I think that may well be the case that it is not ready next week,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said of the reconciliation measure during a Tuesday conference call with reporters.
Senate Key
Pressed about how that schedule will square with progressives, Hoyer did not directly explain.
“We’re going to pass something that can pass the Senate,” Hoyer said in regard to what the larger bill might eventually contain and cost. 
The White House is putting pressure on Democrats to stay the course on Biden’s economic plans. On Tuesday, the administration dispatched Brian Deese, National Economic Council director, and Louisa Terrell, White House legislative affairs director, to Capitol Hill to meet with some House Democrats.
Senate moderates Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have said they would not support a package totaling $3.5 trillion. In the evenly divided Senate, Democrats need the entire caucus on board. Manchin has asked for a “strategic pause” on the negotiations. 
“If the Senate can’t do $3.5, we’ve got to see what they can do,” said Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. 
Hoyer said he believed House Democrats would unite to eventually pass both bills. 
“Not a single progressive has told me they would not vote for the infrastructure bill,” Hoyer said.
Progressives have been candid to the media about their plans. On Tuesday, House Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal reiterated that there is no scenario in which she can vote for infrastructure next week without reconciliation passing.
“We’re working on it,” she said when asked whether reconciliation could be finished next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer signaled to Republicans on Tuesday that if they block an upcoming election reform bill, he will look for a path around the chamber's filibuster rule to try to pass it with only Democratic support.
Schumer noted that Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate who wields great power to advance or block legislation in the narrowly divided chamber, has signed on to try to secure Republican support.
Congressional Democrats are reacting to at least 18 Republican-led states that have enacted laws restricting voting access this year, following Republican former President Donald Trump's false claims the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
""We're going to take action to make sure we protect our democracy and fight against the disease of voter suppression, partisan gerrymandering and election subversion that is metastasizing at the state level,"" Schumer said.
Bypassing Republicans would likely require altering or abandoning the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires 60 of the chamber's 100 members to agree on most legislation. Manchin has repeatedly objected to any change to the filibuster, but some Democrats have said a failure to secure Republican backing for the voting rights act could change his mind.
""As Senator Manchin said earlier this year regarding congressional action on voting rights, inaction is not an option,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. ""I agree with Senator Manchin in that regard.""
In recent years, the Senate has eliminated the filibuster rule on executive branch nominations, including presidential picks for the U.S. Supreme Court.
That resulted in Trump being able to name three conservative justices to the high court amid staunch Democratic opposition.
In June, all 50 Senate Republicans blocked an ambitious voting rights bill. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday slammed the door on the new bill.

He rejected the notion it was truly a compromise, calling it ""the same Frankenstein's monster"" and adding in a Tuesday speech, ""The substance is not really changing, so neither will the result.""
Schumer has not yet set a date for forcing a vote on a Democratic bill, saying Manchin was still trying to attract some Republican support for it.

78,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 09:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats set up a Tuesday vote on a bill that would suspend the U.S. debt ceiling until after the 2022 congressional elections and temporarily fund the government to avert a shutdown after the end of this month.
The debt ceiling suspension -- to Dec. 16, 2022 -- is urgently needed because the Treasury Department has warned it could run out of accounting measures to stave off a payment default sometime in October. But Republicans have vowed to block the measure in the Senate as long as Democrats are pursuing their separate package of tax hikes and spending.
That standoff raises the chances of twin fiscal disasters -- a government shutdown and a default -- that could have devastating consequences for Wall Street and the broader U.S. economy. 
The stopgap bill would prevent a shutdown of most U.S. federal agencies and keep them operating through Dec. 3. 
The bill also contains $28.6 billion for recovery from a series of hurricanes and wildfires as well as $6.3 billion to resettle refugees from the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
GOP Opposition
Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to vote against the bill over the debt ceiling provision. That makes it likely the Senate will have to revise the spending bill, stripping out the debt ceiling language, before the Oct. 1 deadline.
The political endgame on the debt ceiling remains murky if Senate Republicans continue to block the suspension.
House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth said Democrats alone can raise the debt ceiling using the fast-track budget process that bypasses the Senate filibuster -- but doing so would require specifying a numerical debt ceiling increase rather than a time-limited suspension.
Democrats are also loathe to take sole political responsibility for the debt, which was increased under both Republican and Democratic administrations, ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
Last Time
The U.S. debt ceiling came back into effect in August after a two-year suspension. The 2019 bipartisan debt ceiling deal was approved by both parties and the Trump administration in conjunction with increased budget caps on regular domestic and military spending.
Congress is seeking a similar top-line appropriations deal this fall ahead of the planned December expiration of the proposed stopgap spending bill. This week, the House is set to vote on a military policy bill endorsing a $24 billion increase for the Pentagon, a move that could facilitate Republican agreement on top-line numbers and prevent a shutdown showdown in December. That would allow Congress to pass the 12 regular annual spending bills for 2022 -- likely as a giant omnibus package.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress were scrambling on Monday to find another way to include immigration reform in a sweeping $3.5 trillion social spending bill after a Senate arbiter said their first proposal broke the chamber's rules.
The ruling was the latest in a series of stumbling blocks President Joe Biden's party faces as it enters a critical few weeks before a Sept. 27 vote on a $1 trillion Senate-approved infrastructure bill. Also ahead is an Oct. 1 deadline to continue funding the federal government and the threat later in the month that the government will breach its borrowing cap, risking default on U.S. payment obligations.
Democrats can afford to lose just three votes in the House of Representatives and none in the Senate if they are to pass the packages. But the party's moderate and progressive factions are at odds over the size of the $3.5 trillion program, which includes proposals for childcare, education, housing and green energy.
Progressives insist on passing the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion measure in tandem, with some threatening to vote against the smaller bill otherwise.
Moderates note the larger bill has not even been written yet, and have secured an agreement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to vote on the smaller bipartisan bill next week. 
Representative James Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, on Sunday acknowledged the larger bill may need to be trimmed to pass.
One possible compromise would be to vote on the infrastructure bill as scheduled on Sept. 27 but for Pelosi not to forward it to Biden to sign until the larger package passes.
One moderate House Republican on Monday signaled he would vote for the smaller bill if it came up by itself.
""Representative (Don) Bacon plans to vote 'yes' for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, as long as it is not coupled with the $3.5 trillion spending bill,"" said Danielle Jensen, a spokeswoman for Bacon. 
​ Moderate Senate Democrats including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema say $3.5 trillion is too much; Manchin suggests spending less than half that. 
To get the bill passed in the Senate, Democrats plan to use a maneuver called budget ""reconciliation"" to avoid the requirement for 60 votes in the 100-member chamber.
But they suffered a setback on Sunday when the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a provision giving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants, including the so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children, could not be included under the Senate rules.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would pursue alternatives. 
Senator Robert Menendez said on Monday one alternative would be to try to bring the date of arrival in the United States for eligibility for legal status for some immigrants forward from the current Jan. 1, 1972.
""We're not going to take no for an answer,"" Menendez said in a conference call with reporters. 
DEBT CEILING
While the Sept. 27 deadline is self-imposed, two more rigid ones come next.
The first is Oct. 1, when funding for government operations runs out, which would force the stoppage of many federal functions as has happened three times in the past decade.
In addition, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that sometime in October the Treasury will exhaust its cash reserves and borrowing capacity under the $28.4 trillion federal debt limit, and be unable to pay all of its bills or service its debt without congressional action to raise the limit.
Pelosi and Schumer packaged the two issues into one bill on Monday, saying legislation to avoid a government shutdown by funding the government through the end of this year will also include a suspension of the debt ceiling through December 2022. The bill is coming before the House this week.

A U.S. default would roil financial markets, lead to cuts in services and benefits and hit the nation's credit rating. It could also plunge the economy back into recession.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans have warned they will not vote to boost the national debt limit, despite having done so repeatedly when Republican Donald Trump was president. 
 
"
80,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats will include a suspension of the U.S. debt ceiling in a must-pass spending bill needed to keep the government open past the end of this month, in a risky move that assures a potentially damaging showdown with Republicans.
The debt ceiling would be suspended through December 2022. 
Without a shift in position by one of the two parties, the decision leaves the U.S. on course for a government shutdown and defaults on federal payments as soon as next month. 
“This week, the House of Representatives will pass legislation to fund the government through December of this year to avoid a needless government shutdown that would harm American families and our economic recovery before the September 30th deadline,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. “The legislation to avoid a government shutdown will also include a suspension of the debt limit through December 2022.”
The majority party aims to pressure Republicans into backing down on their threat to vote against a debt ceiling increase by attaching it to the stopgap bill, which would keep the government open. The legislation includes money for hurricane and wildfire disaster aid, which could make the package more difficult for some Senate Republicans to vote against.
The federal debt ceiling came back into effect, at $28 trillion, in August and the Treasury Department has warned that without congressional action it may run out of extraordinary accounting measures to avoid a payment default as soon as “sometime” in October. 
It remains unclear what Democrats plan to do if the bill combining spending and a debt-ceiling increase fails to pass the Senate, where at least 10 Republican votes will be needed to overcome a 60-vote threshold for cutting off debate.
The Democrats could raise the debt ceiling alone, using a separate partisan budget tool known as reconciliation, but have so far declined to do so -- arguing that the debt is the responsibility of both parties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senate Democrats hit a major roadblock on Sunday in their effort to allow millions of immigrants to legally stay in the United States, after the Senate Parliamentarian ruled against attaching the measure to a $3.5 trillion spending bill, lawmakers said.
The provision aimed to give a path to citizenship for millions, including so-called Dreamer immigrants, brought to the United States as children, who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Farmworkers, essential workers and immigrants with temporary protected status, which gives work permits and deportation relief to those hailing from nations hit by violence or natural disasters, also stood to benefit. 
In a statement, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats were ""deeply disappointed in this decision but the fight to provide lawful status for immigrants in budget reconciliation continues.""
Senate Democrats have prepared alternate proposals and aimed to hold further meetings with the Senate parliamentarian, Schumer added.
A legislative remedy has become all the more pressing since a July court ruling that struck down DACA, which now protects around 640,000 young immigrants.
Sunday's ruling was ""deeply disappointing,"" a White House spokesperson said, but added, ""We fully expect our partners in the Senate to come back with alternative immigration-related proposals for the parliamentarian to consider.""
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Senator Chuck Grassley, the Judiciary Committee's top Republican, praised the parliamentarian's ruling, saying, ""Mass amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants isn’t a budgetary issue appropriate for reconciliation.""
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said, ""Democrats will not be able to stuff their most radical amnesty proposals into the reckless taxing and spending spree they are assembling behind closed doors.""
An estimate in Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough's ruling, obtained by Reuters, showed the step would have helped about 8 million people become lawful permanent residents, including about 7 million now deemed to infringe the law.
MacDonough said that if the reform were allowed to proceed in a budget bill a future Senate could then rescind anyone's immigration status on the basis of a majority vote.
That would be a ""stunning development ... and is further evidence that the policy changes of this proposal far outweigh the budgetary impact scored to it,"" she added.
""It is not appropriate for inclusion in reconciliation.""
Lawful permanent status allows people to work, travel, live openly in U.S. society and become eligible, in time, to apply for citizenship, MacDonough said. 
As the Senate's parliamentarian, MacDonough, in the job since 2012 under both Republicans and Democrats, advises lawmakers about what is acceptable under the chamber's rules and precedents, sometimes with lasting consequences.
Chosen by the Senate majority leader, the holder of the job is expected to be non-partisan.
Early this year, MacDonough barred inclusion of a minimum wage hike in a COVID-19 aid bill.
Most U.S. Senate bills require support from 60 of the 100 members to go to a vote. Budget reconciliation measures, however, can clear the chamber on a simple majority vote, in which case Vice President Kamala Harris could break the tie.
The proposed designation of essential workers covered 18 major categories and more than 220 sub-categories of employment, MacDonough said in the ruling.

DACA beneficiaries receive work authorization, access to driver's licenses and better access, for some, to financial aid for education, but not a path to citizenship.
The law protects primarily young Hispanic adults born in Mexico and countries in Central and South America who were brought to the United States as children.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Police and media vastly outnumbered protesters around the U.S. Capitol on Saturday at a sparsely attended rally by supporters of the people who breached the building on Jan. 6, trying to overturn former President Donald Trump's election defeat.
About 100 to 200 protesters showed up, some carrying the flags of the right-wing group Three Percenters over their shoulders. It was far fewer than the 700 people organizers had expected and the thousands who brought mayhem to the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Hundreds of officers patrolled the Capitol grounds and a black eight-foot-high (2.44 m) fence that surrounded the white-domed building for about six months after the attack was reinstalled, reflecting unease about a potential repeat of Jan. 6. One hundred National Guard troops were on standby.
As part of an effort by some of Trump's far-right supporters to rewrite the history of the deadly mob assault on the Capitol that was captured in graphic video, speaker after speaker insisted that hundreds of rioters arrested for their actions that day were ""political prisoners"" who committed no violence.
Prosecutors and legal experts say the cases are being handled properly.
""This is about justice and disparate treatment,"" said Matt Braynard, a rally organizer and supporter of Trump's false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
While crowds were small, passions rose at times, with sporadic yelling matches breaking out between participants in the rally and counter-demonstrators. Police on bicycles moved in to break up some of these squabbles.
Capitol Police reported four arrests, including a man armed with a handgun spotted in the crowd, though they said it was ""not clear why the man was at the demonstration."" Officers in riot gear also removed one man from the rally who had a large knife strapped to his hip.
Organizers of the ""Justice for J6"" rally called for a peaceful event, but U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger told reporters on Friday there had been threats of violence linked to the rally, some targeting individual members of Congress, and police were bracing to prevent clashes between Trump supporters and opponents.
Tony Smith, 40, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, said he had come to voice his support for a fair judicial process for those charged in the breach of the Capitol. 
""If we don't honor that we don't honor America,"" said Smith, who was carrying a poster board that said ""We Want Trump!""
HUNDREDS CHARGED IN JAN. 6 RIOT
More than 600 people have been charged with taking part in the Jan. 6 violence, which followed a speech by Trump at a nearby rally reiterating his false claims that his election loss was the result of widespread fraud. Those claims have been rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration.
Rioters that day battled police, beating them with sticks and metal barricades, smashed their way through windows into the Capitol building and ran through the halls, sending lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for safety.
Four people died on Jan. 6, one fatally shot by police and three from medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later committed suicide.
Almost 50 people have so far pleaded guilty to charges related to the violence, nine admitting to committing felonies. The vast majority of defendants have been released awaiting trial but about 75 are still in custody, according to court documents.
Members of the right-wing groups the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters are among those charged with storming the building.
""Let them go, let them go,"" the crowd occasionally chanted during the rally, which lasted just over an hour.
But Eric Lamar, 64, a retired firefighter in Washington, D.C., said he came to the Capitol to counter ""false narratives"" from Trump supporters about Jan. 6.
""It breaks my heart,"" Lamar said after hearing another retired firefighter claim that the riot was a ""false flag,"" a conspiracy theory wrongly claiming that the event was staged. ""There is no question that what happened on Jan. 6 is the work of supporters of Donald Trump who decided falsely and without evidence that the election was stolen.""
Trump called Saturday's rally a “setup” and said media would use it as an excuse to bash Republicans regardless of its outcome, according to an interview on Thursday with the Federalist, a conservative news website.
Unlike on Jan. 6, when Congress was in session to certify Biden's election, the Capitol was largely empty on Saturday, with most members out of town.
No members of Congress attended Saturday's rally, though two Republican congressional candidates addressed the group.
Authorities, who had made clear they were much better prepared after being caught without enough forces to deploy quickly in January, took no chances.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put 100 National Guard troops on standby to help police on Saturday if needed. 
National Guard troops were stationed in and around the Capitol from early January through late May, with as many as 5,200 troops in place at the mission's peak.

(Reuters) - A North Carolina court on Friday struck down a voter photo identification law passed by Republicans in 2018, finding it intentionally discriminated against Black voters likely to vote Democratic.
The ruling marks the second consecutive Republican-backed voting law from North Carolina to be overturned by the courts. A U.S. appeals court in 2016 found a previous law targeted African Americans ""with almost surgical precision.""
In Friday's ruling, a 2-1 majority of the Wake County Superior Court wrote that the 2018 law ""was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.""
Other states with Republican majority legislatures have passed similar laws in recent years, some with renewed purpose after President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and falsely claimed the election was stolen for President Joe Biden.
Georgia and Texas passed voter laws this year that triggered a national backlash from civil rights advocates.
The North Carolina ruling did not find that supporters of Senate Bill 824 were racist, but that targeting Black voters because of their propensity to vote for Democrats was discriminatory.
The ruling quoted from the 2016 federal appeals court ruling that overturned the previous law, known as House Bill 589.
""We do not find that any member of the General Assembly who voted in favor of S.B. 824 harbors any racial animus or hatred towards African American voters, but rather ...that the Republican majority 'target(ed) voters who, based on race, were unlikely to vote for the majority party. Even if done for partisan ends, that constitute(s) racial discrimination,'"" the majority said.
That Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling stood after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.
The Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a North Carolina-based civil rights group that helped bring the suit, applauded the decision and vowed to fight any appeal.
""(We) hope it sends a strong message that racial discrimination will not be tolerated,"" Allison Riggs, the coalition's chief counsel for voting rights, said in a statement.
Sam Hayes, a lawyer the Republican North Carolina House speaker Tim Moore, declared, ""This fight is far from over.""
He referred to the November 2018 election, when voters approved a ballot measure supporting a constitutional amendment requiring photo identification to vote.
""Once again, liberal judges have defied the will of North Carolinians on election integrity,"" Hayes said.

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced the move during a meeting with BLM employees on Friday, the agency said in a statement. Interior is the agency that oversees BLM.
The announcement comes two years after the Republican Trump administration said putting BLM's headquarters in the West, where most federal lands are located, would save taxpayers $50 million and bring officials closer to the areas they serve.
But Interior said the move had failed to create promised jobs in the West and that hundreds of departures ""led to a significant loss of institutional memory and talent.""
Just 41 people in the 328 positions affected by the move opted to relocate, Interior said. Just three of those moved to the Grand Junction, Colorado, office. 
BLM manages 245 million acres, or a tenth of America's land base, overseeing programs such as oil and gas drilling, cattle grazing and recreation. The bureau is central to the efforts of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to address climate change through the management of public lands by expanding renewable energy and tamping down on federal oil and gas leasing.
The bureau will maintain the office in Grand Junction, which it has promised to expand as a new western headquarters - an apparent concession to efforts by the state's Democratic U.S. senators to preserve the bureau's presence there. 
U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, said in a statement he welcomed Interior's commitment to expand the office.

The announcement brought criticism from Republicans in Congress.
""Today's misguided, partisan decision has nothing to do with executing good land management and everything to do with centralizing and growing big government,"" U.S. Representative Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the senior Republican on the House Committee on Natural Resources, said in a statement.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Friday moved to revive an order put in place by then-President Donald Trump directing the expulsion of migrant families caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a day after a U.S. judge blocked it. 
The U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal with a Washington-based appellate court of Thursday's ruling https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-expulsions-migrant-families-under-title-42-order-2021-09-16 by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who said the public health law the policy is based on, Title 42, does not authorize the expulsion of migrants. 
President Joe Biden has faced growing pressure https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-immigration-advocates-blast-cruel-biden-policies-asylum-2021-08-13 from some health experts, immigration advocates and fellow Democrats to stop applying the Title 42 order, which has essentially cut off access to asylum for hundreds of thousands of migrants. 
The Biden administration has said the Title 42 policy remains necessary to limit the spread of the coronavirus, although it has not provided scientific data to support that rationale and many public health experts have opposed it.
Friday's appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit involved a lawsuit by advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Oxfam America.
Noah Gottschalk, global policy lead for Oxfam, said the group was confident the judge's decision would be upheld.
""It's extremely disappointing that the Biden administration is willing to fight tooth and nail to uphold President Trump's xenophobic immigration policies,"" Gottschalk said in a statement.
The Trump administration first adopted the expulsion policy in March 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Republican President Trump put into effect tough policies on legal and illegal immigration before the coronavirus struck. 

Biden in February exempted unaccompanied children from the policy, and his administration had been applying it to fewer families apprehended at the border. 
The judge's order only applies to families and not to single adults, who represent most of the migrants arrested at the border.

Trump's fire has been focused on the handful of Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, or to convict him on that charge in a Senate trial that ultimately ended in his acquittal.
Below are notable Republicans whom Trump has targeted through his endorsements.
REPRESENTATIVE ANTHONY GONZALEZ
Gonzalez, a two-term U.S. representative from Ohio who voted to impeach Trump for inciting supporters to launch a deadly assault on the Capitol, on Thursday became the first of Trump's targets to withdraw https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-congressman-who-voted-impeach-trump-wont-seek-re-election-2021-09-17 from a re-election bid after the former president endorsed a Republican challenger. 
Gonzalez' impeachment vote had drawn rebuke from the Ohio Republican Party, which in May called on him to resign his seat in Congress. In a statement, Gonzalez said ""the toxic dynamics inside our own party"" played a role in his withdrawal. Trump has endorsed former White House aide Max Miller for Gonzalez's seat.
REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY
Cheney was the highest-profile lawmaker of the 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump. A U.S. representative for Wyoming since 2017, she was ousted from her role as the No. 3 House Republican following the impeachment vote. A scion of a storied Republican family, Cheney's father Dick Cheney served as U.S. vice president from 2001 to 2009. In a Sept. 9 statement endorsing Wyoming attorney Harriet Hageman https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-endorses-challenger-republican-cheney-wyoming-house-race-2021-09-09, who is challenging Cheney, Trump called Cheney ""disloyal."" 
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI
The U.S. senator for Alaska was one of seven Republican Senators who voted to convict Trump and remove him from office. The vote failed and Trump was acquitted. Murkowski, known for her long independent streak, is the only one of the seven Republicans up for re-election this year. Trump has endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner, to challenge Murkowski for her seat.
REPRESENTATIVE JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER
The U.S. representative from Washington state not only voted to impeach Trump, she submitted evidence in his Senate trial against the former president. Herrera Beutler said in a statement that the top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, had told her about a call he had with Trump on Jan. 6, during the riot when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, in which Trump said, ""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are."" Trump has endorsed Army veteran Joe Kent's bid to unseat Herrera Beutler, who has been in Congress since 2011.

REPRESENTATIVE FRED UPTON
Upton, who has represented Michigan in the House since 1987, was an early critic of Trump's false claims that he lost the November presidential election due to widespread fraud. Upton said in January his vote for impeachment was to ""send a clear message"" that the country will not tolerate a president impeding the peaceful transfer of power. Trump has endorsed Michigan state lawmaker Steve Carra's bid to challenge Upton.

Visiting England for a meeting of parliamentary leaders from G7 countries, the Democratic leader was asked during a forum to reflect upon the two impeachment proceedings she initiated against Trump late in 2019 and in January 2021.
Seizing an opportunity to score a political point against the man who continues to be the most powerful force in the Republican Party, Pelosi proclaimed, ""I don't ever talk about him.""
However, she continued to talk about Trump, though not by name.
""I reference him from time to time as 'What's His Name,'"" Pelosi said, quickly adding: ""If he wants to run again, he'll be the first president who was impeached twice and defeated twice.""
Her remarks were met with loud applause from the largely British audience.
Throughout Trump's four years in the White House, Pelosi tangled with the president over immigration policy, infrastructure investments, the pandemic response and a wide range of other domestic and foreign issues.
She gained a reputation of being eager to skewer the hard-hitting Trump and became one of the biggest thorns in his side as she initiated not one, but two impeachment proceedings against him.
The Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Trump both times.

The former president is already playing a role in the 2022 midterm elections for Congress by recruiting challengers to Republican lawmakers he has tangled with. And Trump has dropped numerous hints he might seek the presidency for a third time in 2024.
""I say to my Republican friends, and I do have some, 'Take back your party,'"" Pelosi said. ""You have now been hijacked by a cult that is just not good for our country.""

""In America, capitalism is our system, it is our economic system, but it has not served our economy as well as it should,"" she told a Chatham House event. ""So what we want to do is not depart from that, but to improve it.""
""You cannot have a system where the success of some springs from the exploitation of the workers and springs from the exploitation of the environment and the rest, and we have to correct that.""

The United States has expressed grave concern that a row between London and Brussels over the implementation of the 2020 Brexit treaty could undermine the Good Friday accord, which effectively ended three decades of violence.
""If there is destruction of the Good Friday accords, they (are) very unlikely to have a UK-U.S. bilateral,"" she told a Chatham House event. 
After the United Kingdom exited the bloc's orbit on Jan. 1, Johnson has unilaterally delayed the implementation of some provisions of the deal's Northern Ireland Protocol and his top negotiator has said the protocol is unsustainable.
The 1998 peace deal largely brought an end to the ""Troubles"" - three decades of conflict between Irish Catholic nationalist militants and pro-British Protestant ""loyalist"" paramilitaries in which 3,600 people were killed.
The British-run region remains deeply split along sectarian lines 23 years after the peace deal brokered by the United States. 
Many Catholic nationalists aspire to unification with Ireland while Protestant unionists want to stay part of the United Kingdom.
The Northern Ireland Protocol aims to keep the province, which borders EU member Ireland, in both the United Kingdom's customs territory and the EU's single market.

The EU wants to protect its single market, but an effective border in the Irish Sea created by the protocol cuts off Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom - to the fury of Protestant unionists.
Some unionists say the protocol contravenes the 1998 peace deal.

Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting a riot on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol. Trump supporters were attempting to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory as president.
In a statement, Gonzalez, who has two young children, cited family responsibilities as the reason for not seeking re-election.
He expressed hope ""the chaotic political environment that currently infects our country will only be temporary."" He did not mention Trump.
But in an interview on Thursday with the New York Times, Gonzalez called Trump ""a cancer for the country.""

In May, the Ohio Republican Party censured Gonzalez and called for him to resign for his impeachment vote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A cybersecurity attorney known for his work advising Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign was indicted on Thursday for lying to the FBI, as part of U.S. Special Counsel John Durham's probe into the origins of the FBI investigation of ties between Russia and former President Donald Trump's campaign.
Michael Sussmann, a former partner with Perkins Coie who also represented the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign in connection with Russia's hack of the organization, is accused of making false statements during a Sept. 19, 2016, meeting with former FBI General Counsel James Baker.
It marks the second criminal case Durham has filed since former Attorney General William Barr tapped him in 2019 to investigate U.S. officials who probed the Trump-Russia contacts. Trump, a Republican, portrayed the 2016 FBI investigation as part of a witch hunt.
President Joe Biden's administration has allowed Durham to continue his work as special counsel.
The indictment accuses Sussmann of falsely telling Baker he did not represent any client when he met him to give the FBI white papers and other data files containing evidence of questionable cyber links between the Trump Organization and a Russian-based bank.
The indictment alleges that Sussmann turned over that information not as a ""good citizen"" but as an attorney representing a U.S. technology executive, an internet company and Clinton's presidential campaign.
Sussmann ""will fight this baseless and politically-inspired prosecution,"" his attorneys, Sean Berkowitz and Michael Bosworth, said in a statement. 
Sussmann set up the meeting on behalf of a cyber-expert client, the statement said. ""Mr. Sussmann met with Mr. Baker because he and his client believed that the information raised national security concerns,"" it said. 
""At its core, the Special Counsel is bringing a false statement charge based on an oral statement allegedly made five years ago to a single witness that is unrecorded and unobserved by anyone else,"" the attorneys said. 
Sussmann, who had been on leave from Perkins Coie, resigned from the firm on Thursday ""in order to focus on his legal defense,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.
The indictment says the technology executive client who helped assemble the data Sussmann presented to the FBI had ""exploited his access to non-public data at multiple Internet companies to conduct opposition research concerning Trump.""
The FBI investigated, but ultimately concluded there was insufficient evidence of a ""secret communications channel"" between the Trump organization and the bank, which has been identified in news reports as Alfa Bank. 
The bank was not named in the indictment.
The New York Times later reported on the FBI's investigation into the Alfa Bank-Trump connection in October 2016 - a probe that the indictment says was sparked following Sussmann's September 2016 meeting with Baker.
The indictment alleges that some other materials Sussmann handed over to the FBI included a paper prepared by an investigative firm. 
The indictment does not identify the firm, but a source familiar with the events told Reuters it is Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to conduct opposition research on Trump on behalf of the Clinton campaign.

Steele went on to produce a contentious 35-page ""dossier"" purporting to outline Trump links and dealings with Russia and Russians. 
A spokesman for Fusion GPS declined to comment, as did Steele. Neither has been accused of wrongdoing.

(Reuters) -A U.S. district judge on Thursday blocked the expulsion of migrant families caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under an order put in place by former President Donald Trump's administration early in the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The order, invoking Title 42, was issued in March 2020 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which cited the need to limit the spread of the coronavirus. 
Judge Emmet Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia wrote the public health law the policy is based on does not authorize the expulsions of migrants. Expelling asylum seekers denies them the ""opportunity to seek humanitarian benefits"" they are entitled to under immigration law, he wrote. 
Sullivan's order takes effect in 14 days. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The judge's order only applies to families and not to single adults, who represent most of the migrants arrested at the border.
The ruling comes as U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, faces pressure from Republicans due to the number of border arrests, which have hovered around 20-year highs https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-arrests-nearly-200000-migrants-us-mexico-border-august-2021-09-15. 
U.S. authorities arrested more than 195,000 migrants at the Mexican border in August, according to government data released on Wednesday. Thousands of people were waiting under the International Bridge that connects Del Rio, Texas and Ciudad Acuña, Mexico https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/hungry-overwhelmed-texas-town-migrants-slip-back-into-mexico-food-2021-09-16, this week, according to a Reuters witness. 
Biden has faced growing pressure from some health experts, immigration advocates https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-immigration-advocates-blast-cruel-biden-policies-asylum-2021-08-13, and fellow Democrats to stop applying the Title 42 order, that has essentially cut off access to asylum for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

The Biden administration has said the Title 42 policy remains necessary to limit the spread of the coronavirus, although it has not provided scientific data to support that rationale and many public health experts have opposed it.

Human rights groups and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have said expelled migrants face violence and kidnappings in northern Mexico.
""President Biden should have ended this cruel and lawless policy long ago, and the court was correct to reject it today,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, one of the groups challenging the expulsions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta this week ordered the Justice Department to review whether it is adequately monitoring police departments and other recipients of its federal grants to ensure they are not engaging in ""illegal discrimination.""
The review was ordered in a Sept. 15 memo made public on Thursday. For years, major civil rights organizations have complained the Justice Department was too lax in funding organizations such as police departments that have engaged in racial profiling and other overly aggressive and discriminatory enforcement aimed at Black and brown communities.
“Law enforcement agencies engaged in discriminatory policing practices should not receive and utilize taxpayer-supported grants,"" said NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill, who has long called on the department to claw back funds from troublesome police departments. 
“Today’s announcement by the DOJ...is an important step toward making sure that federal funds are not used in a discriminatory manner by state and local law enforcement agencies.""
The Justice Department's grant-making arms collectively award more than $4 billion a year to states, municipalities and local victims service providers and research institutions.
Grant winners are prohibited from using public money to discriminate against people because of race, national origin, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation.
""This review is intended to ensure that the department is
providing sufficient oversight and accountability regarding the activities of its federally-funded recipients,"" Gupta wrote in her memo to other top department officials.
More broadly, Attorney General Merrick Garland has been stepping up the Justice Department's enforcement of federal civil rights laws, an area that was not prioritized under former President Donald Trump. 

The actions also follow a wave of protests across the United States last summer against systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.
Garland in recent months announced the Civil Rights Division was launching investigations into patterns of possibly discriminatory practices by police departments in Minneapolis, Louisville and Phoenix.

96,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden is set to ratchet up pressure on congressional Democrats on Thursday, as discord within the party threatened to derail key pieces of his economic agenda, including lowering prescription drug prices and some of his proposed tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans.
In a speech Thursday at the White House, Biden plans to urge Democrats to unite, focusing on the struggles of middle class families -- such as the prices of prescription drugs, hearing aids and high-speed internet, as well as the more general costs of raising a child -- said a White House official. 
The recent back-and-forth on Capitol Hill has shown the limits of Biden’s power to guide the $3.5 trillion plan through a narrowly divided Congress. Moderate Democrats have balked at recent efforts to negotiate on drug prices and to impose a new tax on the assets of the wealthiest people, measures that progressives applaud.  
The White House can only afford to lose the support of three House Democrats for the package to pass; it needs all Democratic votes in the Senate. 
On Wednesday, Biden hosted two moderate Democratic senators -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- for separate meetings at the White House. Manchin has pushed for a spending package less than half of Biden’s proposal, a move that risks delaying the president’s package by weeks or months in Congress with tax, health care and other issues still unresolved. 
White House aides have spent the last several days negotiating and speaking with lawmakers and top staffers to weigh various options to raise enough money to fully fund Biden’s plan and ensure as many big policies as possible survive the legislative process.
Progressives have been disappointed as House Democratic lawmakers shied away from ideas like taxing the increase of wealthy people’s assets at death -- a key pillar of Biden’s attempts to reduce income inequality. Just this week, after intense lobbying from the health-care industry, a handful of moderate Democrats also backed away from efforts to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.
Democratic Representatives Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Scott Peters of California and Kathleen Rice of New York joined Republicans in voting against a bill to allow the government to demand lower prices from drugmakers and cap price increases on some medicines. The measure failed to advance, in a tied committee vote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China's restrictions on free speech and human rights are getting worse and its control of tech data poses a threat to the West, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday during a trip to Britain.
""China is tightening. It's getting worse and worse in terms of democratic reform, freedom of speech or pluralism, or just the ability of people to speak out,"" Pelosi, long a China critic, said in a moderated discussion at the Cambridge Union.
""They're not trying to change the government, they're just trying to express themselves, and that - it's a major problem,"" Pelosi said of dissenting voices in China.
Pelosi praised a new Indo-Pacific security alliance between the United States, Britain and Australia, a partnership China denounced on Thursday.
In Britain for a meeting of parliamentary leaders from the Group of Seven, Pelosi cited what she called China's military aggression in the South China Sea, its genocide of the Uighurs Muslim minority, restrictions in Tibet and the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and other parts of China. 
Pelosi, who is third in succession for the U.S. presidency, also praised the United Kingdom for phasing out equipment from Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network.
""That is a big threat,"" Pelosi said when asked about Huawei.

""We do have to develop our own 5G and be advanced in so much technology so that we're not saying, 'Well, they're the best and the cheapest and so we all have to be enslaved by the Chinese in terms of their control of the data.'""
She also said it was important for Beijing and Washington to work together in other areas, including on climate change, COVID-19 and fighting terrorism.

A large group is expected at the Capitol on Saturday to protest the arrests and criminal charges against some 600 people in connection with a Jan. 6 riot by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
The tall fence was first erected following the Jan. 6 attack on the building that houses the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. It was dismantled in July.
The U.S. Capitol Police on Wednesday said it has asked the Pentagon to provide National Guard troops if they are needed to help with security.
""The USCP has asked the Department of Defense for the ability to receive National Guard support should the need arise on September 18,"" the police department statement said.
No details were provided on the potential number of National Guard troops that could be deployed.
Trump falsely claimed that the election was stolen from him as a result of massive election fraud. He gave a fiery speech to supporters at a rally on Jan. 6 outside the White House just prior to their attack on the Capitol. 
Battling law enforcement outside and inside the Capitol, the rioters were trying to stop Congress from formal certification of Joe Biden's victory in the November 2020 presidential election.

Many of the Jan. 6 rioters carried Trump flags, which at times were used as weapons against law enforcement.
Four people died on the day of the riot, one fatally shot by police and three from medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later committed suicide.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday handily beat back a Republican campaign to oust him from office, sending a decisive message that voters in the deeply Democratic state supported his policies for tackling COVID-19, immigration and crime.
Newsom, who won his first term in 2018 by a landslide, again claimed a resounding victory in the special recall election. That means he will remain in office through his term ending in January 2023 and see his chances significantly bolstered in next year's regularly scheduled election.
With 100% of precincts reporting late Tuesday and some mail-in ballots yet to be counted, Newsom was ahead by 28 percentage points, with 64% of voters saying he should stay in office and 36% saying he should be removed.
""I'm humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercised their fundamental right to vote,"" Newsom said in a victory speech Tuesday night in the state capital of Sacramento.
His win and the high turnout in Tuesday's election came as a relief to national Democrats, who already were bracing for a tough fight in the 2022 elections that will decide control of Congress. A loss in one of the party's stronghold states would have set off alarms across the country, particularly given the leading Republican challenger was a supporter of former President Donald Trump with a track record of controversial statements about women and minorities.
Newsom and Democratic leaders including President Joe Biden characterized the recall effort, heavily supported by state and national Republican groups, as part of a broader Republican agenda to oust Democrats from power and expand conservative restrictions on voting, civil rights and abortion.
""Economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, our values where California has made so much progress, all of those things were on the ballot this evening,"" Newsom said in his speech.
His decisive win holds lessons for national Democrats, who will be fighting next year to keep majorities in Congress and seats in governor's mansions, said Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio.
Newsom mounted a massive get-out-the-vote effort that mobilized Democrats who typically are not engaged in off-year elections. 
His embrace of strong COVID-19 protections such as mask and vaccination mandates, and his messaging around the threat Trumpism posed to his liberal policies, resonated with Democratic voters, Maviglio said.
""Nationalizing this election was the smartest move he could have made,"" said Maviglio, who was press secretary for former Governor Gray Davis.
Davis, a Democrat, remains the only California governor to lose his job in a recall, having been replaced by action star Arnold Schwarzenegger in a 2003 special election.
MYRIAD CHALLENGES
Newsom, a 53-year-old former lieutenant governor and San Francisco mayor, faced just the second gubernatorial recall election in state history despite 55 attempts. During his first term in office, he was beset by challenges including the pandemic, homelessness, extreme drought and severe wildfires.
Though he remained popular in the nation's most populous state, conservatives angered by his liberal policies on LGBTQ rights, immigration and crime mounted a campaign to unseat him.
The effort gained momentum amid the pandemic, with many Republicans infuriated by Newsom's decision to close schools and require masks and vaccinations against COVID-19. Backers of the recall collected 1.5 million signatures from Californians who favored holding a special election.
The leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder, a Black radio talk show host and Trump supporter, had vowed to remove requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and mask wearing.
In the days leading up to the recall vote, he and Trump pushed the narrative that Democrats planned to steal the election. Elder garnered nearly 47% of the vote on the portion of the ballot asking which of 46 candidates should replace Newsom if he were recalled.
Elder conceded Tuesday night, telling supporters, ""Let's be gracious in defeat. We may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war.""
That Newsom's political fate would ever have been in doubt might seem unlikely in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.
But Democrats worried that complacency among their voters could have tilted the election toward motivated Republicans. Newsom tried to boost Democratic turnout with a flurry of late campaigning after mid-summer polls showed many in his party were not engaged in the election and large numbers did not plan to vote.
He appeared in the final days of the race alongside Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who formerly represented the state as a U.S. senator and attorney general.

Malia Cohen, an elected member of the California Board of Equalization, spent several days at the end of the campaign aiming to raise turnout among African American voters. She said the effort was key to Newsom's success.
""You can feel the energy,"" Cohen said on Tuesday.

(Reuters) -Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania voted on Wednesday to subpoena the state's top election official in a review that joins widely criticized efforts in other battleground states aimed at fueling doubts about the 2020 election.
With a 7-to-4 vote along party lines, Republicans in the state Senate committee overseeing the review will issue a subpoena for information on some 7 million voters from Veronica Degraffenreid, acting head of the Department of State.
Democratic lawmakers, who are in the minority in the legislature, said they would challenge the subpoena in court.
The move advances what is expected to be an expansive review of Pennsylvania's election last November and comes amid similar efforts by Republicans in other key states to promote the baseless claim that Republican former President Donald Trump did not lose due to widespread voter fraud.
Trump's loss in Pennsylvania to President Joe Biden by nearly 81,000 votes was confirmed by multiple audits and certified more than nine months ago.
Trump's allies in Michigan and Wisconsin are also pursuing election probes, modeling their efforts after an ongoing audit in Arizona that a wide collection of election experts, Democrats and even some Republican officials have rejected as a partisan operation run by contractors without relevant expertise. 
The broad array of information sought by the Pennsylvania subpoena includes the driver's license numbers, addresses, and last four digits of the Social Security numbers of all registered voters in the state, separated by county and with distinct lists for those who voted in person and by mail. 
Cris Dush, the Republican chair of the Intergovernmental Operations committee overseeing the review, said at a hearing that the objective was to verify whether votes were cast by people who ""exist"" and to look into various allegations made about the election to see whether they have any foundation in fact. 
The hearing became heated at points, with Dush cutting off the live video feed multiple times as one Democratic lawmaker questioned whether Republicans who attended the Jan. 6 rally in Washington would have access to information obtained via subpoena. The rally that day ended with a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Biden's victory from being certified. 
""We have every reason, every right to be concerned about what happens with these documents, with this information,"" said Vincent Hughes, a Democratic member of the committee. ""You are asking for prolific personal information.""
Dush said that unlike the audit in Arizona, Pennsylvania's review would be funded by taxpayers. The lawmaker, a Trump supporter who toured the Arizona operation in June, also promised he was ""not going to be hiring political activists"" to carry out the review. He said he was still vetting vendors.
Dush and Jake Corman, the top Republican in the state Senate, said the subpoenas and the broader review were not aimed at reversing Trump's loss, but rather finding any flaws in the state's voting systems to inform future legislative fixes.
""The legislature has no authority to overturn an election,"" said Corman, the chamber's president pro tempore.
Jay Costa, the Senate's minority leader, said Democrats would file a lawsuit on Friday in state court asserting that Republicans are belatedly attempting to contest the election, which by law must occur within 20 days of the election.
""This is clearly a separation of powers issue,"" Costa said.

""We cannot some 10, 11 months later come back and try and do another election contest. That is what the crux of this is about.""
Pennsylvania's attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, said in a statement that, while the bulk of the information requested is publicly available, his office would seek to protect the personal data, such as Social Security numbers, also being sought via subpoena.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are breathing easier on Wednesday after California Governor Gavin Newsom handily survived a Republican attempt to oust him through a recall election.
With midterm elections looming next year that will determine which party controls the U.S. Congress, here are four takeaways from Newsom’s victory -- for both parties.
COVID IS STILL KING
Newsom’s aggressive approach toward containing the coronavirus pandemic was the driver behind the recall movement. It also seems to be a primary reason he survived.
About one-third of voters said the pandemic was their top concern, according to an exit poll conducted for CNN – far more than any other issue. 
As the Delta variant sweeps across the country, Newsom was able to draw a sharp contrast between states such as California, which have adopted sweeping virus mitigation measures, and Republican-run states such as Florida and Texas that have resisted them. The Republican favorite in the recall election, radio talk show host Larry Elder, said he would lift the state’s vaccine and mask mandates if elected.
“If the next few months going into the midterms get fought on vaccine mandates and masks and keeping kids safe, that’s good for Democrats,” said Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic adviser who teaches at the University of Southern California. 
TEXAS, FLORIDA AS A FOIL
Newsom nationalized the election, turning it into a test of Democratic versus Republican polices. He spent much of the closing days of his campaign railing against the actions of Republican-led states such as Texas, which recently enacted laws restricting abortion, curtailing voting access and expanding gun rights - and whose governor, Greg Abbott, opposes mask and vaccine mandates. 
In both New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states with gubernatorial elections this year, both Democratic candidates are proposing much stronger requirements to manage COVID-19 and casting their opponents as out of step with the American public. 
California's outcome, however, might not be entirely applicable to other states. Newsom went into the recall with a huge advantage: Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state 2-to-1. Moreover, the recall process was conducted largely by mail and did not follow the contours of a normal election. 
TRUMPISM LOOMS LARGE
Newsom also benefited from the rise of Elder as his primary foil in the election. With his history of taking controversial conservative opinions on his radio show and his steadfast support of Republican former President Donald Trump, Elder made an easy target.
As the recall election approached, Newsom and his allies began to frequently invoke Trump, who lost to Democratic President Joe Biden in California last year by nearly 30 percentage points. 
""I got to run against the real Donald Trump,"" Biden said on Monday at a campaign event for Newsom. ""Well, this year, the leading Republican running for governor is the closest thing to a Trump clone that I've ever seen.""
Raphael Sonenshein, a political scientist at California State University in Los Angeles, said Newsom successfully framed the election to be about national Republicans and Trump, rather than his own record.
“If you run against yourself, you’re going to lose,” he said.
For Republicans, the election illustrated the dangers of having polarizing, pro-Trump contenders in competitive states and districts where moderates, independents and suburban voters will be decisive. That may be a lesson that carries over to Republican nominating elections next year, when a host of Trump allies and candidates endorsed by him will challenge more centrist politicians.
""Republicans can certainly squander potential opportunities with unsatisfactory candidate selection,"" said Chris Stirewalt, a Republican analyst with the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington.
TURNING OUT THE BASE
The largest concern among Democrats heading into the recall was that energized Republicans would vote in droves while their own voters would neglect to show up in an off-year special election. But Newsom and his allies appear to have successfully alarmed Democrats enough to come out.
That should serve as an example for Democrats at the national level, who at times have focused more on reaching swing voters than turning out their base in state elections, Sonenshein said.  

With high turnout in the 2018 midterm elections and now in the recall, Democrats are showing that they are motivated not just by their own party identification, but specifically by opposition to today’s Republican Party, added Mike Madrid, a Republican political strategist who is a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group.
“Trump in some specter is enough to get them out to vote,"" Madrid said.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom handily beat back an effort to oust him from office in Tuesday's special election, overcoming a Republican campaign to unseat him over his liberal policies on immigration, COVID-19 and crime. 
Newsom, a first-term governor beset by challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme drought and severe wildfires, boosted turnout among Democrats with a flurry of late campaigning and easily overcame the move by Republicans to recall him.
By late Tuesday, returns showed Newsom easily winning a majority of support from voters who said he should remain in office. With 46% of precincts reporting, Newsom was up by more than 30 points, with 67% support compared to 33% who wanted to recall him, state data showed.
U.S. television networks projected Newsom had defeated the recall effort about 40 minutes after polls closed on Tuesday.
""I'm humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercised their fundamental right to vote,"" Newsom said in a victory speech Tuesday night in the state capital of Sacramento.
""Economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, our values where California has made so much progress, all of those things were on the ballot this evening,"" Newsom said. 
The decisive win significantly bolsters Newsom's chances in next year's regularly scheduled gubernatorial elections, while weakening any likely Republican challengers, said Republican political strategist Mike Madrid.
Key to Newsom's success was an all-out campaign to mobilize a Democratic base that had initially been sleepy, assuming that the governor would win because the state is so overwhelmingly Democratic. 
He made the campaign a referendum on former Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, linking Trump with his main challenger in the recall election, Larry Elder, a Republican talk show host who had made controversial statements about minorities and women.
In the final days of the race, Newsom appeared alongside President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who formerly represented California as a U.S. senator and attorney general. 
Malia Cohen, an elected member of the California Board of Equalization who spent the last several days campaigning to raise turnout among African American voters, said the effort was key to the campaign's success.
""You can feel the energy,"" Cohen said Tuesday. ""I see 'No on recall' on bumper stickers and buttons people are wearing. I didn't see that until Friday.""
With 34.3% of precincts reporting, Elder had garnered about 43% of the vote on the portion of the ballot asking who should replace Newsom if he were recalled, state data showed. 
Elder has vowed to remove requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and mask wearing. In the days leading up to the recall vote, he and Trump pushed the narrative that Democrats planned to steal the election. 
The removal of Newsom, who was elected in a landslide in 2018, would have set off alarms among Democrats, coming in one of the nation's most liberal states just over a year before the 2022 elections that will decide control of Congress. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in the state, and polls consistently showed that a strong majority of voters opposed recalling Newsom.
But Democrats worried that complacency among their voters could have tilted the election toward Republicans. Newsom's immigration and crime policies - along with the governor's handling of the pandemic - fueled the petition drive by conservatives to put the recall question on the ballot. 
In early voting and vote by mail, Democrats returned ballots at more than twice the rate of Republicans. This prompted fear among Republican leaders that their voters had taken to heart false claims of election fraud pushed by Trump and conservative media after Biden won the 2020 presidential election.
In response, the California Republican Party promised to fight for election integrity and released videos showing party officials confidently mailing in ballots.
Tying the recall effort to Trump and efforts in Texas, Georgia and other states to tighten abortion restrictions and impose new laws that Democrats believe curtail voting rights helped Democrats turn out their voters.

""We could see changes like what's happening in Texas,"" said Katie Van Note, 27, a dance instructor who voted in Oceanside, just north of Carlsbad, and described her politics as left-leaning. 
The Secretary of State has until Oct. 22 to certify the results.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration formally asked a federal judge on Tuesday to block enforcement of a new Texas law that effectively bans almost all abortions in the state under a novel legal design that opponents say is intended to thwart court challenge.
The U.S. Justice Department's 45-page emergency motion seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction lifting the abortion ban while its lawsuit challenging the statute as unconstitutional proceeds through the courts.
The Republican-backed law forbids abortions performed once cardiac activity has been detected in the embryo, typically starting at six weeks of gestation, before many women even realize they are pregnant. 
It provides no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, though it makes narrowly defined exemptions to protect the mother's health. Governor Greg Abbott, who signed the measure into law, defended it earlier this month saying that the state would ""eliminate all rapists"".
The case is being closely watched after the U.S. Supreme Court decided on Sept. 1 to let the six-week abortion ban to remain in effect pending judicial review, igniting a firestorm of criticism from abortion rights advocates.
The high court did not address the constitutionality of the Texas statute. But it widely was seen as a sign that the court's conservative majority was inclined to roll back the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling guaranteeing a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability of the fetus, at around 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.
Abortion rights supporters were especially outraged that the court left intact provisions of the Texas statute, known as S.B. 8, they said were designed to evade court challenges.
The law relies on private citizens, rather than the state, to enforce it by filing civil suits against people who help a woman obtain an abortion after six weeks, whether that be a doctor who performs the procedure or a cabbie who drives a woman to a clinic. And it allows individuals who file such suits to collect bounties of at least $10,000.
""Although S.B. 8 was designed to create jurisdictional obstacles to the ability of women and providers to sue to protect their rights, those obstacles do not impede the relief sought through this suit - an action brought by the United States against the state of Texas itself,"" the DOJ motion said.

Tuesday's motion was filed with U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin, the state capital, who was assigned to the Justice Department lawsuit brought Sept. 9 and previously ruled against Abbott in another major abortion case last year.
Abortion foes have predicted that the Biden administration challenge to the latest Texas law will ultimately fail.

(Reuters) -Larry Elder, a conservative radio host and lawyer, rapidly emerged as the most serious challenger in California's recall election with a message that Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom botched his response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Elder criticized vaccine and masking requirements, saying those safety measures should be a matter of personal choice. He also opposed Newsom's restrictions on businesses, calling them an overreaction that caused unnecessary pain.
Though the latest polls show Newsom is likely to survive Tuesday's recall attempt, they also indicate Elder struck a chord with many voters in a crowded field of 46 candidates vying to replace the governor.
""Larry Elder will keep businesses open and allow us to have freedom of choice,"" said Republican Taylor Livesley, 31, of Carlsbad, who on Tuesday voted to recall Newsom largely because of his response to COVID-19.
If a majority of California voters say ""yes"" to removing Newsom on the first ballot question, the top vote-getter on the second question will become governor for the remainder of his term ending in January 2023.
Newsom campaign ads have used Elder's image alongside former President Donald Trump's in an attempt to motivate liberal voters in the heavily Democratic state.
""We may have defeated Donald Trump, but we have not defeated Trumpism. Trumpism is still on the ballot in California,"" Newsom warned voters at a rally with President Joe Biden on Monday.
Elder, 69, in 2019 called the election of Trump ""divine intervention"" and ""a miracle"" but has aimed to shift attention away from the former president during the recall campaign.
""To call me a Trump-supporting radio host is a little unfair ... call me a Mitt Romney-supporting person, or a George Herbert Walker Bush person. I'm a Republican,"" Elder told CNN. 
Elder campaign spokesperson Ying Ma said the recall election ""has nothing to do with Trump ... It's about Newsom.""
As with Trump, Elder has been embraced by some conservatives who see his penchant for provocative statements as a refreshing antidote to political correctness. The Republican also has railed against high taxes and government regulations, and takes a tough stance on crime.
The Elder campaign says biased media have attempted to turn voters against Elder and overlooked the diversity of the support base he built after joining the race in July.
""Voters of all stripes have responded with overwhelming enthusiasm to Larry Elder's candidacy,"" Ma said in an email. ""Maybe offense wouldn't be taken if the media weren't so biased and dishonest when reporting on his statements and positions.""
'SAGE FROM SOUTH CENTRAL'
Elder, who is Black, has said his views grew out of his parents' contention that he could overcome racism with hard work and determination. 
He calls himself the ""Sage from South Central,"" referring to a largely African American district of Los Angeles. He left Los Angeles after high school, attended Brown University in Rhode Island and earned a law degree at the University of Michigan.
After practicing law in Cleveland, he returned to Los Angeles in the 1990s and began his career as a radio host, later becoming syndicated nationwide. He is a frequent guest on conservative media outlets such as Fox News.
Elder defines himself as ""an American who is Black"" rather than African American, telling The Hill in an interview in February, ""The idea that there's systemic racism against Black people is a lie.""

Elder has blamed the Black Lives Matter movement for rising crime. In July on ""The Candace Owens Show,"" Elder suggested in a discussion about reparations for slave descendants that slave owners also deserved reparations for having their property taken away.
Elder has accused women of exaggerating sexism and hinted women who participated in an anti-Trump march in 2017 were too unattractive to be sexually assaulted. In a 2000 column for Capitalism Magazine he wrote, ""Women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events. Good news for Democrats, bad news for Republicans. For the less one knows, the easier the manipulation.""

LONG BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Monday campaigned with California Governor Gavin Newsom on the eve of a Republican-backed recall race that both Democratic leaders cast as an attempted power grab by political acolytes of former President Donald Trump.
Biden joined the embattled first-term governor in the port city of Long Beach, near Los Angeles, for Newsom's final rally ahead of a special election on Tuesday that will test the power of a Republican Party still dominated by Trump in a deeply Democratic state.
Biden joined Newsom in characterizing the recall effort, heavily supported by state and national Republican groups, as part of a broader Republican agenda to oust Democrats from power and expand conservative restrictions on voting, civil rights and abortion.
Recall supporters have countered that the move to force Newsom from office gained traction from mounting resentment over his decisions to close schools and require masks and vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Democrats rallying to Newsom's cause have followed his lead in invoking Trump's record and the Republicans who have embraced his falsehoods of a stolen presidential election. 
""I got to run against the real Donald Trump,"" Biden told a crowd of several hundred at Long Beach City College. ""Well, this year, the leading Republican running for governor is the closest thing to a Trump clone that I've ever seen."" 
It was an apparent reference to Republican radio host and Trump supporter Larry Elder, who polls show as the leading candidate among a crowded field of would-be successors on the recall ballot, though the president did not mention him by name.
Taking the stage before Biden, Newsom took a similar tact, declaring his oft-repeated line: ""We may have defeated Donald Trump, but we have not defeated Trumpism. Trumpism is still on the ballot in California.""
The president and governor met up earlier in the day in Sacramento, the state capital, where Biden stopped during a tour of wildfire damage in the region. They then flew together on Air Force One to Long Beach.
Vice President Kamala Harris stumped for Newsom in the San Francisco Bay area last week, and the governor has drawn campaign ad appearances from such Democratic luminaries as former President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders.
NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor and lieutenant governor, entered the last day of a month-long early voting period in a strong position, with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting him and outnumbering Republicans more than 2-to-1 in balloting thus far.
Biden's visit caps a dramatic turnaround from earlier this summer, when polls indicated Democrats were planning to vote in so few numbers that Newsom, who won election in 2018 by a wide margin, was in danger of losing his job in a state where Republicans make up less than a quarter of registered voters.
A Newsom defeat would have national implications for Democrats seeking to cling to razor-thin majorities in Congress, signaling trouble as emboldened Republicans escalate their efforts to win back control of the legislative branch in next year's congressional elections.
It also could spell the end of Newsom's political ambitions, widely believed to include possible runs for the U.S. Senate or the presidency.
Arriving for the rally with Newsom, the president's motorcade passed multiple groups of anti-Biden protesters, including one crowd of about 200 holding signs that read: ""Trump won,"" ""unvaxxed lives matter"" and ""Recall Newsom.""
At the rally, a sign at the front of the stage said ""Stop the Republican recall."" Another golden illuminated sign said, ""Vote no.""
Under California's recall system, voters are asked to vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether to recall Newsom, and then to choose from one of 46 replacement candidates on the same ballot.
If Newsom fails to win a simple majority on the first question, then the candidate with the most votes on the second - even if less than a majority - automatically replaces him for the duration of his term.
Polls show Elder, a Trump supporter, topping the list of replacement candidates with the support of 38% of those likely to vote on the second question.

Newsom assailed Elder's position on climate change, saying he supports more offshore oil drilling and has called global warming a ""hoax."" 
Also in the race are Republicans including former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, businessman and former gubernatorial nominee John Cox and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, along with Democrat Kevin Paffrath, a YouTube host who jumped into the fray.

(Reuters) - The governor of Iowa has said she will appeal a temporary order by a federal judge that aims to allow schools to enforce use of face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 6,300 people in the state.
""We will appeal and exercise every legal option we have to uphold state law and defend the rights and liberties afforded to any American citizen protected by our constitution,"" Republican Governor Kim Reynolds said in a tweet on Monday night.
A federal judge had earlier ordered the state to immediately stop enforcing a law passed in May that prevents school boards from ordering use of face masks, saying the law substantially increased the risks of catching the disease for children with health conditions.
The temporary restraining order will be in effect until the court orders a preliminary injunction.
Iowa has reported more than 450,000 cases of the coronavirus and over 6,300 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
It joined a handful of other U.S. states in May in passing a law that forbids cities, counties and local school districts from requiring people to wear face masks that protect against the spread of the coronavirus.
These governors have said that such rules of mask mandates infringe on personal liberty, while proponents of mask mandates say these are needed to combat surging cases, fuelled by the more contagious Delta variant, which has disrupted the reopening of schools across the country.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, under pressure to approve a COVID-19 vaccine for children below 12, is meanwhile looking to complete a data review on the safety of children in clinical trials as quickly as possible.
Separately, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has threatened fines for cities and counties that mandate employees must get vaccinated against COVID-19, which has killed nearly 50,000 people in the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Secretary of State Antony Blinken beat back criticism of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan on Monday at a contentious congressional hearing where at least two Republicans called on him to resign.
In five hours of often testy exchanges with lawmakers, Blinken defended President Joe Biden's decision to pull out and pushed back on accusations that the State Department should have done more to help Americans and at-risk Afghans to be evacuated, blaming the previous administration for lacking a plan.
He repeatedly noted that Republican former President Donald Trump had negotiated the withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, and said Biden's administration could not renegotiate because of threats from the group to resume killing Americans.
""There's no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining,"" Blinken said.
""We inherited a deadline. We did not inherit a plan,"" Blinken said, referring to the Trump administration's agreement to remove all U.S. forces from Afghanistan by May 1.
Members of Congress - Biden's Democrats as well as opposition Republicans - have pledged to investigate since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan last month after a rapid advance.
Blinken appeared on Monday before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and was to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the first Biden administration official to testify publicly to lawmakers since the Islamist militant group's takeover.
Fireworks had been expected, given the amount of finger-pointing over how the two-decade-long war ended. Many Republicans, particularly those closely allied to Trump, interrupted or even shouted over Blinken during the House hearing, a departure for a committee known for bipartisan cooperation.
Others offered harsh criticism.
""The American people don't like to lose, especially not to the terrorists. But this is exactly what has happened,"" said Representative Michael McCaul, the panel's top Republican.
McCaul asked why assets like the Bagram Air Base were not maintained and why the administration had not reached counterterrorism agreements with neighboring countries.
""This is a national security threat as China moves in. For all I know they make take over Bagram,"" McCaul said.
Blinken said the United States was actively working to identify threats.
MANY QUESTIONS
Lawmakers asked a long list of questions about the rapid collapse of the U.S.-backed Afghan government and scramble to evacuate 124,000 people.
Democrats expressed concern about Americans and at-risk Afghans who still wish to leave, but backed the withdrawal as necessary, if painful. ""I would welcome hearing what exactly a smooth withdrawal from a messy chaotic 20-year war looks like,"" said Representative Gregory Meeks, the committee's chairman.
Blinken praised the evacuation as ""a heroic effort."" He pledged that the United States will continue to support humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, but through non-governmental organizations and U.N. agencies, not the Taliban.
Afghanistan is at risk of running out of food as it faces a terrible drought in addition to political upheaval. ""We need to do everything we can to make sure the people of Afghanistan don't suffer any more than is already the case,"" Blinken said.
He said he had not spoken personally to members of the Taliban leadership. ""Any legitimacy that they may seek from the international community ... is going to be contingent on their actions,"" he said.
Blinken said he would name a senior State Department official to focus on support for Afghan women, girls and minorities.
Republicans grilled Blinken about what happened at Kabul's airport during the evacuation ahead of the administration's Aug. 31 deadline to leave. Thirteen U.S. troops and dozens of Afghans were killed in a suicide bombing amid the chaos.

Democrats said they wanted to address not just the seven months Biden was president before Kabul fell but all 20 years of U.S. involvement in the country - under presidents from both parties.
A U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks masterminded by al Qaeda leaders based in Afghanistan.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Monday renewed his push for significant investments to combat climate change as he visited California during a three-state western U.S. tour and took an aerial tour of areas hit by one of the country's worst fire seasons.
The trip is aimed at highlighting the devastation caused by a warming planet, pushing for more resources to tackle the issue and touting the environmental initiatives that are part of the infrastructure bills his administration is pushing.
Biden will also campaign for fellow Democrat Gavin Newsom, who is battling to maintain his governorship in California's recall election on Tuesday.
Biden toured the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento with Newsom, where he addressed emergency operations officials and said parents are not just worried for their children over COVID-19 but whether they can also breathe the air. 
""Scientists have been warning us for years that extreme weather is going to get more extreme. We're living it in real time now,"" Biden said.
Extreme weather events cost the United States $99 billion last year, and that record would be broken again this year, the president said, underscoring the need for urgent, decisive action to combat global warming.
""We have to think big. Thinking small is a prescription for disaster,"" he said, touting a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a separate $3.5 trillion package he said would work to combat climate change over a decade. The measures face hurdles in the closely divided U.S. Congress.
Biden got a firsthand look at the damage in California as his Marine One helicopter flew over a parched landscape hazy with smoke from the relentless wildfires. Patches of black in the landscape showed areas where the fires had been put out.
The Caldor Fire in California, which had threatened the Lake Tahoe resort area, has charred more than 219,000 acres (88,600 hectares) and destroyed more than 1,000 homes and other structures since it erupted in the Sierra Nevada range about 70 miles (112 km) east of Sacramento on Aug. 14. 
As of Monday, firefighters had carved containment lines around 67% of the fire's perimeter. It is the second-largest blaze in the state this year, behind the Dixie Fire, which has scorched more than 960,000 acres (388,000 hectares) and destroyed 1,300-plus buildings farther north in the Sierras since it began in mid-July. That wildfire ranks as California's second-largest on record. 
Earlier in the day, Biden visited the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, a hub designed to coordinate resources on wildfires - and held a briefing with state and local officials. 
In Boise, the president said fire season in the United States is starting earlier each year and that this year alone, 44,000 wildfires in the country had consumed 5.4 million acres (2.2 million hectares) - an area roughly the size of New Jersey.
""Thank God, thank God we have you,"" Biden told firefighters in the room. He pledged to help federal firefighters make at least $15 an hour and said he is committed to raising the pay gap for firefighters who protect federal wildlands.
White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that one in three Americans is affected by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and that Biden's message on his first trip to the U.S. West Coast as president would be that the ""climate crisis is in code red.""
The White House said late on Sunday that Biden had approved U.S disaster funding to help California amid the Caldor Fire. He ordered other federal assistance earlier this month after declaring the situation an emergency. 
CAMPAIGNING FOR NEWSOM
Biden will head later to Long Beach, California, to take part in an event with Newsom, an ally who is fighting to survive a Republican-led recall. Biden's presence, the day before polls close, is meant to help mobilize Democrats to vote and secure Democratic leadership of the nation's most-populous state. https://reut.rs/3C7TT3g
Democrats outnumber Republicans in California and recent polling shows a majority of likely voters opposing the recall, but Biden and Newsom are not taking anything for granted.

Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, campaigned for Newsom last week and painted the recall, which is backed financially by state and national Republican groups, as part of a broader Republican effort to expand conservative restrictions on voting, abortion and LGBTQ rights. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-vp-harris-rallies-california-governor-facing-recall-2021-09-08

Former Democratic Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank said Powell’s reappointment would provide “strong support” for President Joe Biden’s comprehensive program for tackling the underlying social and economic problems facing the U.S.
Their support -- coming in an opinion article written for The Hill -- is noteworthy because a number of progressives have criticized Powell for rolling back some of the reforms initiated under the Dodd-Frank legislation and called on Biden to replace him as Fed chair.
“We acknowledge that Powell did implement some relaxation for the financial industry -- but we do not believe this outweighs the case for reappointing him,” Dodd and Frank wrote in an article published on Monday.
Powell’s term as chair ends in February. Bloomberg has reported that advisers to Biden are considering recommending that the president give Powell another four years. A decision is likely this fall.

(Reuters) - The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has dismissed a claim that  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) violated election laws when it prohibited users from posting links to a New York Post story about then-presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The Republican National Committee lodged a complaint after the social media site blocked the story link in October. The RNC argued that Twitter blocking the story meant it was illegally contributing to Democratic candidate Biden's presidential campaign.
The election regulator determined that Twitter's actions were allowable because it was enacted with a valid commercial reason and not for a political purpose, according to The New York Times, which first reported the FEC's dismissal on Monday.
The FEC, Twitter and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), which owns the Post, declined to comment. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The New York Post's editorial board defended its story in an op-ed published on Monday, saying that the people involved in the emails it published had confirmed the contents.

Some disinformation researchers raised red flags about the provenance and credibility of the story.

Twitter said at the time that the story violated its ""hacked materials"" policy, which bars the distribution of content obtained through hacking that contains private information or trade secrets. It provided no details on what materials it viewed as hacked in the Post articles.
Soon after the incident, Twitter changed its hacked materials policy and later said it had stopped https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-twitter-idUKKBN27121P blocking the story when the private information in it had become widely available in the press and on other platforms.

""Our position has not changed when it comes to North Korea, we remain prepared to engage,"" principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.
North Korea's state media announced on Monday what it said were successful tests of a new long-range cruise missile that analysts said could be the country's first such weapon with a nuclear capability.
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said initial indications were that North Korea had carried out such a test.
North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the missiles were ""a strategic weapon of great significance"" and flew 1,500 km (930 miles) before hitting their targets and falling into the country's territorial waters during the tests on Saturday and Sunday. https://reut.rs/3ntR34r
North Korea's cruise missiles usually generate less interest than ballistic missiles because they are not explicitly banned under United Nations Security Council resolutions. However, analysts said calling it ""strategic"" could mean it was a nuclear-capable system.
It is unclear whether North Korea has mastered the technology needed to build warheads small enough to be carried on a cruise missile, but leader Kim Jong Un said earlier this year that developing smaller bombs is a top goal.
The U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) said the activity highlighted North Korea's ""continuing focus on developing its military program and the threats that poses to its neighbors and the international community.""
Commenting at the United Nations in New York, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters: ""We've seen these reports, and I think it's yet another reminder that diplomatic engagement is the only way to reach sustainable peace and complete and verifiable denuclearization on the (Korean) Peninsula.""
Chief nuclear negotiators from the United States, South Korea and Japan are due to meet this week in Tokyo to explore how to resume efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said it is open to diplomacy to achieve this, but has shown no willingness to ease sanctions on North Korea.
Sung Kim, the U.S. envoy for North Korea, said in August that he was ready to meet with North Korean officials ""anywhere, at any time.""

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will talk about the Senate rules blocking large parts of his agenda ""when or if"" he has something to say about the legislative filibuster, a spokesperson said on Monday.
Liberal lawmakers have been pressing for the Senate to scrap the rule, which blocks much legislation from passing the Senate without at least 60 votes, a hurdle seen as too high to clear for Biden's immigration, gun control, abortion, and voting rights plans.
The Democratic president has so far publicly opposed scrapping the rule.

""We keep those personal conversations with congressional leadership private,"" she said.

The 100-member chamber is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is able to break ties on issues requiring a 50-vote majority.

The plan, released Monday by the Ways and Means Committee, would generally require investment funds to hold assets for more than five years -- up from three years -- in order for managers to get a preferential tax rate on their share of the fund’s profits, known as carried interest. 
Assets that meet the holding-period requirement are subject to the smaller long-term capital gains tax rate, rather than the rate for ordinary income.
Under the committee’s proposal, the capital gains rate would top out at 28.8%, after adding in a Medicare surtax. The top individual rate would be 39.6%.  
The proposed carried-interest change would include some exceptions, retaining the three-year holding period for real property trades or businesses and taxpayers earning less than $400,000. It would also extend the carried-interest rules to all assets eligible for long-term capital gains rates.
Biden’s Proposal
The Ways and Means proposal is a watered-down version of the plan laid out by the Biden administration in May, which would have eliminated the tax perk for investment fund managers if their overall taxable income exceeded $400,000. 
If enacted, the Ways and Means proposal would go into effect in 2022.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that taxing carried interest as ordinary income would raise $14 billion over a decade. The Ways and Means Committee in an informal estimate claims the same amount of savings from its proposed change. 
The most recent attempt to address carried interest was in 2017, under then-President Donald Trump. The Republican tax overhaul fell short of doing away with the benefit altogether, leaving it intact for investments that are held for at least three years.

(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a disaster declaration for California and will travel to Sacramento on Monday to survey the damage from recent wildfires, the White House said on Sunday.
More than 6,800 wildfires large and small have blackened an estimated 1.7 million acres (689,000 hectares) within California alone this season, stretching available firefighting forces and equipment dangerously thin.
The blazes have been stoked by extremely hot, dry conditions that experts say are symptomatic of climate change during a summer fire season shaping up as one of the most destructive on record.
""President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by the Caldor Fire beginning on August 14, 2021, and continuing"", the White House said late on Sunday. 
Biden said last week that wildfires, hurricanes and floods were hitting every part of the United States, with more than 100 million Americans affected this summer alone, as he pressed for investments to boost infrastructure and fight global warming.
Biden made fighting climate change a key plank of his 2020 presidential campaign and a top priority of his administration, but some of his goals rely on getting the U.S. Congress to pass multitrillion-dollar legislation on infrastructure and other priorities.
This month, Biden declared an emergency in California and ordered federal assistance to boost responders' efforts to battle the Caldor fire.
""Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments"", the White House said on Sunday.

The Caldor fire, burning since mid-August, is 65% contained. It has led to 5 injuries and damaged 81 residential, commercial and other structures while destroying over a thousand such structures, according to authorities.
Southwesterly winds are forecast through most of the coming week which could fan the growth of fires in the West Zone, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said late on Sunday https://

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House Democrats are expected to propose raising the corporate tax rate to 26.5% from 21% as part of a sweeping plan that includes tax increases on the wealthy, corporations, and investors, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Democrats are also expected to propose a 3% surtax on individual income above $5 million as part of a wide-ranging $3.5 trillion budget bill.
They are also considering raising the minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign income to 16.5% from 10.5% and the top capital gains tax rate to 28.8% from 23.8%.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the outline of the proposal, citing a congressional aide. A spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for tax policy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said House Democrats are making ""significant progress towards ensuring our economy rewards work and not just wealth by cutting taxes for middle class families; reforming the tax code to prevent the offshoring of American jobs; and making sure the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share.""
The overall package of tax changes, summarized in a four-page document circulating among lobbyists and congressional aides on Sunday, was estimated to raise $2.9 trillion in new revenue, largely covering the costs of President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion domestic investment plan.

The proposal would also raise the top individual tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, as part of a series of changes aimed at high income individuals that was estimated to raise approximately $1 trillion.
The package also includes $80 billion more in additional funding for the Internal Revenue Service specifically devoted to tax enforcement of high income taxpayers, which could raise as much as $200 billion in additional revenue.

(Reuters) -The FBI on Saturday released a newly declassified document related to its investigation of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and allegations of Saudi government support for the hijackers, following an executive order by President Joe Biden.
The partially redacted 16-page document released by the FBI on the 20th anniversary of the attacks detailed contacts between the hijackers and several Saudi officials, but it did not draw a definitive conclusion whether the government in Riyadh was complicit in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. 
Earlier this month, Biden ordered the Department of Justice to review documents from the FBI's probe into the attacks for declassification and release. 
Relatives of the victims have been pushing for years for more information about what the FBI discovered in its probe and have contended that the documents would show Saudi Arabian authorities supported the plot.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. 
The Kingdom has long said it had no role in the attacks. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment sent out of hours late on Saturday. 
A U.S. government commission in 2004 found no evidence that Saudi Arabia directly funded al Qaeda, the group given safe haven by the Taliban in Afghanistan at the time. It left open whether individual Saudi officials might have.
The families of roughly 2,500 of those killed in the attacks, and more than 20,000 people who suffered injuries, businesses and various insurers, have sued Saudi Arabia seeking billions of dollars.
In a statement issued on Sept. 8, the embassy said Saudi Arabia has always advocated for transparency around the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and welcomes the release by the United States of classified documents relating to the attacks. 
""As past investigations have revealed, including the 9/11 Commission and the release of the so-called '28 Pages,' no evidence has ever emerged to indicate that the Saudi government or its officials had previous knowledge of the terrorist attack or were in any way involved,"" the embassy's statement said. 
In a statement on behalf of the organization 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, whose husband Tom was killed on Sept. 11, said the document released by the FBI on Saturday put to bed any doubts about Saudi complicity in the attacks. 

""Now the Saudis' secrets are exposed and it is well past time for the Kingdom to own up to its officials' roles in murdering thousands on American soil,"" the statement said.
Biden has taken a tougher stance with Saudi Arabia than his predecessor Donald Trump, criticising the Kingdom over its human rights record while releasing a U.S. intelligence report implicating the Kingdom's de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The prince denies any involvement.

The police bureau launched 38 internal investigations and was able to identify the officers involved in 26 of the cases. Some of the complaints contained too little information to identify the officer involved. In 20 of the cases, no wrongdoing was found, the department said.
In the six cases, disciplinary action was recommended for violations including ""conduct unbecoming,"" failure to comply with directions, improper remarks and improper dissemination of information, according to the statement.
A separate case, started after a criminal investigation in which charges were not filed, into an official accused of unsatisfactory performance and conduct unbecoming is still pending.
Following a fiery speech by Republican then-President Donald Trump, hundreds of his supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory. Four people died in the melee, one shot by a police officer and three others of natural causes. 
Among the police officers who responded to the insurrection, one Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-capitol-police-says-robust-security-planned-sept-18-rally-2021-09-08 later took their own lives.
The department said in February that 35 U.S. Capitol Police officers were being investigated https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-capitol-police/u-s-capitol-police-investigating-role-of-35-officers-during-january-6-riot-idUSKBN2AJ243 for their actions during the Jan. 6 riot and that six had been suspended without pay. ()

The department's statement came after Democratic U.S. Representative Tim Ryan said two officers had been suspended for their actions that day. One had taken a selfie with a protester, while another wore a Trump-supporting hat and had directed rioters around the building.
It was not clear whether those officers were among the six cases in which disciplinary action was recommended.

SHANKSVILLE, Pa./ ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States on Saturday with visits to each of the sites where hijacked planes crashed in 2001, honoring the victims of the devastating assault.
In the first of his wordless tributes, Biden stood in somber silence with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at the New York City site where planes brought down the World Trade Center's twin towers. 
The three leaders, flanked by Jill Biden, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, shared a moment of silence with the crowd at 8:46 a.m. EDT to mark the time that the first plane hit, heads bowed. They listened as relatives read the names of those who died.
The Bidens then flew to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, before heading back to the Washington area to visit the Pentagon memorial. 
Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks in New York, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and in Pennsylvania, where passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 overcame the hijackers and the plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. 
Biden did not deliver remarks at any of the sites. He released a video on Friday to express his condolences to the loved ones of the victims and highlight the national unity that resulted, at least initially, after 9/11.
""The core of who we are is not divided,"" Biden said Saturday during a visit to a fire station after the Shanksville ceremony.
In New York, on a clear, beautiful day similar to the weather 20 years ago, the New York Police Department pipes and drums band played ""Hard Times Come Again No More,"" an American folk song from the 1850s. Bruce Springsteen, playing an acoustic guitar, sang ""I'll See You in My Dreams.""
Rudy Giuliani, mayor of New York at the time of the attacks, attended the ceremony. Former President Donald Trump, a New York native, did not. 
In Shanksville, the Bidens participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial where names of the dead are etched on a white marble wall.
The passengers who stormed the cockpit had stepped up in a crisis, Biden told reporters later. ""That's genuine heroism,"" he said. He praised a speech given in Shanksville earlier in the day by former President George W. Bush, the Republican who had been in office less than a year when the hijacked planes changed the country, and the world.
In a rare public address, Bush warned https://www.reuters.com/world/us/george-w-bush-calls-out-threat-domestic-terrorism-911-anniversary-2021-09-11 of the threat from domestic terrorism. He recalled how Americans came together after the attacks and urged a spirit of greater unity amid growing political division in the country.
Bush also urged a common front against violent extremists both domestic and foreign, saying ""they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them.""
Biden's last visit of the day was to the Pentagon, the symbol of U.S. military might that was pierced by another of the planes used as missiles that day.
The Bidens, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff touched a memorial wreath at the site where a series of benches have been erected representing each of the 184 victims. They put their hands on their hearts, with Biden raising his in a salute, while ""Taps"" played.
UNITY UNRAVELED
The anniversary comes shortly after the end of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan that Bush launched 20 years ago to root out the al Qaeda militant group that carried out the 9/11 attacks. 
Biden's withdrawal of U.S. troops in August, months after a deadline set by his Republican predecessor Trump, and the resulting rapid fall of the country https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-interim-government-agrees-let-foreigners-leave-afghanistan-2021-09-09 to the Taliban has drawn criticism from members of both political parties.
Trump, a divisive figure who did not attend any formal Sept. 11 tribute, appeared instead at a friendly police precinct near his Manhattan home. 
In stark contrast to the messages of unity, the former president criticized Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal, repeated his false claim of 2020 election fraud and hinted he may take another run at the White House. 
U.S. presidents often travel to one of the three sites on the 9/11 anniversary but it is unusual to go to all three on the same day. 
In his video address, Biden noted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-calls-unity-nation-marks-20th-anniversary-911-2021-09-10 the heroism that was seen in the days following the attacks 20 years ago. ""We also saw something all too rare: a true sense of national unity,"" Biden said.

Biden, a Democrat, pledged to build up such unity after he took office in late January, but the country remains deeply split politically.
Last month, many families of 9/11 victims asked Biden to skip 20-year memorial events unless he declassified documents they contend will show Saudi Arabian leaders supported the attacks. Last week, the president ordered the Department of Justice to review documents from the FBI probe into the attacks for declassification and release.

SHANKSVILLE, Pa. (Reuters) -On the 20th anniversary of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil, George W. Bush, who was president at the time, warned of a new danger coming from within the country. 
""We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come, not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within,"" Bush said on Saturday at the 9/11 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
""There is little cultural overlaps between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home ... they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them."" 
The United States has seen an uptick https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-supremacist-groups-pose-rising-us-threat-garland-says-2021-05-12 in homegrown terror threats in recent years, particularly from white supremacists, capped by the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by followers of Republican former President Donald Trump. 
The attackers were hoping to stop U.S. lawmakers from certifying the election that Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. 
Bush, recalling the unity of the American people after the attacks, appealed for a return to that spirit amid growing political division in the country. 
""When it comes to unity of America, those days seem distant from our own,"" the Republican former president said. ""Malign force seems at work in our common life ... so much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment."" 
Trump did not attend any formal 9/11 events on Saturday. In the afternoon, he repeated his frequent lie that the 2020 election was ""rigged"" to a group of New York police officers at a precinct near his Manhattan home, and said the city's crime would stop if police were allowed to act as they wished. 
Bush and his wife Laura, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, were attending a ceremony at the Shanksville site where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed after passengers overpowered the hijackers. The plane crashed in a field, preventing another target from being hit. 
""In the sacrifice of the first responders, in the mutual aid of strangers, in the solidarity of grief and grace, the actions of an enemy revealed the spirit of a people,"" Bush said, describing the country's reaction. ""We were proud of our wounded nation."" 
BUSH ON AFGHANISTAN PULLOUT 
Bush's has rarely spoken publicly about the 9/11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, since leaving office. 
The attacks prompted Bush to launch a U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that ousted the Taliban from control in Kabul and sent al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden into hiding.
His administration's subsequent invasion of Iraq, based on the erroneous claim that Saddam Hussein's authoritarian government had illicit weapons of mass destruction diverted resources https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/americas-longest-war-20-years-missteps-afghanistan-2021-08-16 and attention from Afghanistan, leaving U.S. strategy there adrift, former officials and experts say. 
Biden's withdrawal of remaining U.S. military forces in Afghanistan at the end of August, months after a deadline set by Trump, triggered harsh criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, as a lightning-fast Taliban takeover stranded Americans and Afghans seeking to evacuate.

In a July interview with German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Bush called the pullout a mistake and said he worried ""the consequences are going to be unbelievably bad.""
Speaking about U.S. veterans who served in Afghanistan, Bush said ""you have been a force for good in the world and nothing that has followed can tarnish your honor.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday called for national unity as the United States prepared to mark the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed 2,977 people, calling it America's greatest strength in the face of adversity.
Biden, speaking in a videotaped recording at the White House https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1436444392584253442, honored the memories of those killed in the attacks and the thousands more injured, as well as the firefighters, nurses and many others who risked or gave their lives during the subsequent rescue missions and long road to recovery.
He also acknowledged the ""darker forces of human nature - fear and anger, resentment and violence against Muslim Americans, true and faithful followers of a peaceful religion"" that he said had bent, but not broken, American unity.
""To me, that's the central lesson of Sept. 11, is that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, and the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength,"" he said.
""Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing. We must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other, and in this nation,"" he added.
The White House released the video on the eve of the 20th anniversary, which Biden will mark by visiting all three sites that were attacked https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-visit-all-three-sites-sept-11-attacks-white-house-2021-09-04.
On Saturday, Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New York City, where two airliners destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 2,753 people; the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, where a third airliner crashed; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where passengers forced down a fourth aircraft believed to have been headed to the U.S. Capitol or White House.
The president's appeal for unity comes at a time when political divisions over the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine mandates https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-angers-republicans-libertarians-2021-09-10, and voting and abortion rights, are boiling over across the country.

Hate crimes against Arab-Americans, Muslims and others perceived as Arab or Muslim surged after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and while they have abated in recent years, the numbers have never returned to levels seen before the attacks, FBI data show.
More recently, the United States has seen a rise in anti-Semitic and anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes.

130,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 12:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- California enters next week’s historic recall election besieged by crises: massive wildfires, a drought forcing water rationing and a resurgent pandemic filling hospitals. 
Oddly enough, they all may help Governor Gavin Newsom keep his job.
Polls show the Democrat prevailing in the Sept. 14 recall, beating back a mostly Republican field of challengers. If Newsom wins, the same crises his opponents used as campaign issues against him likely will have helped cement his victory. Voters beset by calamities may be unwilling to take a chance on his challengers, most of whom have never held elected office. 
“The fires, drought, power outages -- all of the bad news in California requires some experience in Sacramento, and that message seems to be resonating,” said David McCuan, chairman of the political science department at Sonoma State University. “It looks like they’ve had a security-blanket effect with voters.”
The prospect of disaster has always loomed over Newsom, who since taking office in 2019 has faced record-setting wildfires, the bankruptcy of the state’s largest utility and an unrelenting pandemic. The election is now happening in a crisis scenario Democratic leaders had hoped to avoid, and yet it may work in the governor’s favor. 
The situation could easily have gone otherwise. Last week, South Lake Tahoe -- a family vacation spot beloved among generations of Californians -- narrowly escaped destruction in the sprawling Caldor Fire, which had already erased several smaller communities in its path. Had the town burned, public anger could have found a ready target in the governor. 
“The threat to Newsom has always been that events would spin out of control,” McCuan said.
QuickTake: Why California’s Governor Is Facing a Recall Election
Just weeks ago, polls showed Newsom, 53, in a tight race to survive in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one. With the help of national leaders -- Vice President Kamala Harris stumped for him this week in the San Francisco Bay area, while former President Barack Obama recorded a video message to bring out voters -- more recent surveys have indicated increased support. President Joe Biden will be campaigning for Newsom next week. 
Pandemic Anger
Efforts to recall the first-term governor stretch back to 2019, but the Covid-19 pandemic gave them new fuel. Newsom moved aggressively to shut down the state early in the pandemic, a step polls showed most residents supported. 
But some Californians bitterly resented lockdowns -- and started circulating petitions. Recall backers collected more than 1.7 million valid signatures to force an election, comfortably above the nearly 1.5 million required by law.
Democratic state officials picked the election’s unusual timing. Rather than wait for a more traditional November date, they gambled on September. At the time the decision was made in early July, the economy had fully reopened, Covid case rates had plunged, and Newsom’s political standing looked strong. Waiting could give his opponents more time to organize and plunge California deeper into its annual wildfire season.
The gamble didn’t quite pan out. The delta variant caused virus cases to soar. Fires started early and quickly grew huge, with one -- the Dixie Fire -- becoming the first in history to burn all the way across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. 
“If the Democrats in the legislature had known that in addition to Covid, the state would be dealing with wildfires, drought and school reopening problems, they might have stuck with November,” said Dan Schnur, a former spokesman for Republican Governor Pete Wilson who now teaches political communication at several California universities. 
Newsom’s opponents took the state’s many crises as ready ammunition. 
Republican businessman John Cox, who lost to Newsom in the 2018 gubernatorial election, has run television ads listing fires, homelessness and crime as proof of Newsom’s bad management, saying “Gavin, you’ve failed.” 
Conservative commentator Larry Elder, who leads the polls among candidates trying to replace Newsom, made a campaign stop at a shrunken reservoir to criticize the governor’s drought response. And he’s pointed to a June report from CapRadio and National Public Radio that found 35 high-priority wildfire prevention projects touted by Newsom only covered 11,399 acres of 90,000 acres they were supposed to treat. 
A spokeswoman for the governor said the 35 projects “strategically and collectively protected a total area of 90,000 acres and more than 200 communities.”
Kim Nalder, a political science professor at Sacramento State University and executive director of CalSpeaks Opinion Research, said many people in the mountain areas suffering the worst of the fires do blame Newsom. 
“People are very much searching for a target for their anger, for their desperation, really,” she said. 
But many of those corners of California already trend Republican. The same applies to the drought-stricken Central Valley. Voters there weren’t likely to vote for Newsom anyway. 
“They will add his handling of Covid or the handling of the economy, schools, the drought, fires to the long list of things they don’t like about him,” said Mark Baldassare, chief executive officer of the Public Policy Institute of California. 
The institute’s polling shows that while Californians worry about the crises facing them, that concern hasn’t led to big shifts in Newsom’s support, one way or the other. 
“If anything, it tends to reinforce what people already feel about him,” Baldassare said.

131,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Two senior Democratic senators proposed a 2% tax on corporate stock buybacks in an effort to boost investment and reduce what they termed as tax avoidance.
The plan, released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown of Ohio, comes as Democratic lawmakers assemble a raft of tax measures to help pay for a $3.5 trillion budget bill that contains the bulk of President Joe Biden’s longer-term economic agenda.
“Rather than investing in their workers, mega-corporations used the windfall from Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts to juice their stock prices and reward their wealthiest investors and their executives through massive stock buybacks,” Wyden said in a statement on the proposal Friday.
Brown said, “It’s past time Wall Street paid its fair share and reinvested more of that capital into the workers and communities who make those profits possible.”
The Senate Finance Committee had been discussing both an excise tax on stock buybacks and a levy on a measure of excess pay for chief executives, Bloomberg reported last week. 
Record Buybacks
The 2% excise tax on stock buybacks pitched by Wyden and Brown wouldn’t apply to transactions for funding an employee pension plan or those below a “de minimis threshold,” according to a statement released by Brown’s office. “Special rules address the treatment of foreign corporations,” though so-called inverted companies -- a term used to describe American firms that shift their headquarters abroad -- “are fully subject to the excise tax.”
Equity buybacks totaled a record $806 billion in 2018, the first year after passage of the tax cuts -- including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% -- enacted by Republican lawmakers and then-President Donald Trump, according to the Brown and Wyden statement. “In 2021, as millions of families are struggling through the pandemic, corporate stock buybacks should approach, or even surpass, this record.”
The Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees are now hashing out proposed legislative text that would boost taxes to help pay for expanded spending on social programs including child care, elder care and tax credits for children. Democratic lawmakers have yet to nail down agreement on the scope of the overall legislation -- which will require the unanimous backing of the party’s caucus in the Senate, given universal GOP opposition to the initiative.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden took aim on Thursday at vaccine resistance in America, announcing policies requiring most federal employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations and pushing large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly.
The new measures, which Biden laid out in remarks from the White House, would apply to about two-thirds of all U.S. employees, those who work for businesses with more than 100 workers.
""We've been patient,"" Biden told the tens of millions of Americans who have declined to get coronavirus shots. ""But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us.""
Taken together, the policies and speech represented Biden's most aggressive steps yet to prod Americans resistant to getting shots as the fast-spreading Delta variant sparks a new wave of sickness and death.
The surge has posed increased risk not just to the country but to a president who ran on promises to get control of the pandemic. Biden's approval ratings have sagged since he said in July the United States was ""closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.""
Biden's latest moves are expected to be the subject of political and legal challenges. 
Despite a full-throttled campaign by the Biden administration urging Americans to get the free and widely available vaccines, just over 62% of eligible Americans https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total are fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On Thursday, Biden warned that ""we're in a tough stretch and it could last for a while.""
Infectious disease and health policy experts said the mandates are unlikely to significantly change infection rates quickly.
Still, they would help against potential future waves of the virus, reducing deaths and hospitalizations and alleviating the stress on the healthcare system, said Georgetown University's Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
""It's absolutely the right thing to do,"" he said. ""Ideally everyone would have been vaccinated already.""
'FEAR, CONTROL AND MANDATES'
In a televised speech running a bit under half an hour, the Democratic president accused ""a distinct minority of elected officials"" who have resisted mask and vaccine mandates on freedom-of-choice and economic grounds as ""making people sick.""
The White House COVID-19 recovery plan https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-covid-19-strategy-thwarted-by-anti-vaxxers-delta-variant-2021-07-29 was based on the vast majority of eligible Americans being vaccinated this year. But the public health issue has become politicized, with a vocal minority refusing the shots and mask mandates.
Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order in July blocking mask mandates in schools.
Administration medical officials have said over 97% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are not vaccinated, and those people account for an even higher share of deaths.
Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives committee that oversees health policy, said Biden ""is using fear, control, and mandates.""
The Republican National Committee said it intends to sue the Biden administration over the vaccine mandate.
Under Biden's plan, the administration will also require vaccinations for more than 17 million healthcare workers at hospitals and other institutions that participate in Medicare and Medicaid social programs for poor, disabled and older Americans.
Biden previously required that federal employees be vaccinated or get tested. Federal workers now have 75 days to get vaccinated, or face termination unless they fall into limited exemption categories.
Federal workers unions suggested on Thursday they would accept the vaccine mandate. 
SUBSTANTIAL FINES
The U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) plans to take enforcement actions against private companies that do not comply with the vaccine mandate, with substantial fines of nearly $14,000 per violation.
The administration is also calling on entertainment venues to require tests or shots and for states to adopt mandates for school employees. It is also multiplying the fines https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-doubling-fines-travelers-not-wearing-masks-2021-09-09 charged to people who fail to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses.
It plans as well to ramp up testing capacity for the virus. 
Biden will use authority under the Defense Production Act to spur industry to accelerate production of the tests, and big retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc , Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co are expected to sell the tests at cost for the next three months to make them more affordable. 
Critics have said the Biden administration has not done enough on testing during its seven months in office. Still, the new demand for tests could tax already strained suppliers.
Administration officials believe the full recovery of the U.S economy depends on blunting the spread of the virus, the key focus of the president since entering office in January.
The disease has killed more than 654,000 people in the United States, and deaths and hospitalizations have been rising sharply as the easily transmissible Delta variant of the virus spreads. https://tmsnrt.rs/3A1KHg3
The spread of the Delta variant has raised concerns as children head back to school, while also rattling investors, upending company return-to-office plans and tamping down https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-growth-slows-sharply-august-unemployment-rate-falls-52-2021-09-03 hiring.
The White House also plans to offer booster shots providing additional protection to those who are fully vaccinated. But supplies are limited and the World Health Organization has begged rich countries to pause booster programs until more people worldwide are inoculated.

But with Delta causing more symptomatic breakthrough infections among fully inoculated individuals, most vaccinated Americans want a booster, a recent Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found. Boosters could begin the week of Sept. 20.
""Get vaccinated,"" Biden urged in closing his speech.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania kicked off an ""election integrity"" review with a public hearing on Thursday, joining partisan efforts in other battleground states to cast doubts on former President Donald Trump's November election loss.
The hearing at the State Capitol in Harrisburg was the first step in what is expected to be an expansive review of the 2020 election, though the lawmaker leading it stressed the goal was to restore trust in voting and not to overturn past results.
""That horse is out of the barn,"" state senator Cris Dush said, referring to Trump's loss in Pennsylvania to Democratic President Joe Biden by nearly 81,000 votes, a result confirmed by multiple audits and certified more than 9 months ago.
Democrats portrayed the investigation as part of a broader, nationwide effort by Republicans to promote Trump's false claims attributing his defeat to widespread electoral fraud and enact laws that would make it harder for Democrats to vote. They said they believed Dush and others were laying the groundwork to restrict mail-in voting, among other steps.
""This is a sham. It's all just perpetuating a lie,"" said Anthony Williams, a Democrat and minority chair of the state Senate committee that initiated the review. ""It is an attack on our right to vote.""
Pennsylvania's election review will be closely watched by Trump's allies in Michigan, Wisconsin and other swing states where they are attempting to justify or forge ahead with ""forensic"" audits involving the inspection of paper ballots and tabulation equipment. Their model has been an ongoing audit in Arizona that a wide collection of election experts, Democrats and some Republican officials have rejected as a partisan operation run by contractors without relevant expertise.
Dush, a Trump supporter who toured the Arizona operation in June, spent much of Thursday's hearing probing what he called ""last minute"" guidance provided by the Department of State to counties about how to handle complications brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, such as the proliferation of voting by mail.
Stewart Ulsh, a Republican commissioner in rural Fulton County, was the only witness at the hearing.
Ulsh testified about his dealings with Department of State officials in the run-up to the election. He said frequent changes to its guidance on how to process ballots made the job of county officials more difficult.
Ulsh said Fulton County had not found any significant problems or fraud. He was also grilled by Democrats about an audit the county conducted in consultation with Republican lawmakers that led to the Department of State decertifying its voting machines.
Pennsylvania's attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, said the hearing showed Republicans are searching for wrongdoing that does not exist. ""I've been hearing for weeks this was going to be a blockbuster hearing. Instead what I saw was a complete dud,"" he told Reuters.
Dush said his committee would consider issuing subpoenas to obtain information, without disclosing potential targets. He said the next hearing would focus on problems with the state's database for voting registrations.

The Department of State, which declined to participate in the hearing due to ongoing election-related litigation, said in a statement that the 2020 election was accurate and fair and predicted that after dozens of lawsuits and hearings the latest attempt to find wrongdoing would ""fail again.""
The review is expected to eventually include inspections of paper ballots and voting rolls, according to a person familiar with the matter, who added that a vendor to oversee the probe would likely be chosen soon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday withdrew his nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - a federal agency pivotal in his goal of lowering U.S. firearms violence - blaming Republican opposition.
Chipman, who previously worked for the ATF for nearly 25 years, had drawn strong Republican opposition in the Senate, undermining his chances of winning confirmation in a chamber only narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats. Republicans generally oppose gun control.
Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who usually votes with the Democrats but was a holdout on Chipman, also was a key factor in the decision to withdraw the nomination, according to two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
In a statement issued by the White House, Biden put the blame on Republicans, noting that Chipman, a gun owner himself who had won the backing of law enforcement groups, would have made an exemplary ATF director. The agency https://www.atf.gov/about/who-we-are, part of the U.S. Justice Department, has responsibilities including investigating the unlawful use and possession of guns and illegal firearms trafficking.
""Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress have made clear that they intend to use gun crime as a political talking point instead of taking serious steps to address it,"" Biden said.
""That's why they've moved in lockstep to block David Chipman's confirmation, and it's why they side with gun manufacturers over the overwhelming majority of the American people in opposing commonsense measures like universal background checks"" for gun buyers, Biden added.
Biden has called U.S. gun violence a ""national embarrassment"" https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-faces-increased-pressure-act-guns-after-indianapolis-shooting-2021-04-16 but Congress has failed to pass new firearms measures favored by many Americans https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-anniversary-poll-idUSKCN1PX11I.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden intends to nominate someone else for the ATF post and is in ""active discussions"" with Chipman about another government role. The job of ATF director is so politically fraught that the Senate has confirmed only one nominee to the post in the past 15 years. The rest of the ATF's leaders have served in an acting capacity, making it harder to put their stamp on lasting and meaningful policy.
Republicans and pro-gun groups including the National Rifle Association and National Shooting Sports Foundation had opposed Chipman, known for his work at a prominent gun control advocacy group. Chipman serves as a policy adviser for Giffords, a group founded by former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, after a gunman shot her in 2011. 
Republicans in particular opposed his support for banning military-style assault weapons, which have been used in some of the most serious U.S. mass shootings in recent years.
Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he was glad to hear of the withdrawal, calling Chipman's nomination ""absurd."" 
""This is a win for the Second Amendment and law-abiding American citizens,"" said McConnell, referring to the constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to bear arms.
Kris Brown, president of Brady, a group advocating for stricter gun regulation, called Chipman ""exceptionally qualified"" to lead the agency.
The Senate Judiciary Committee in June split along party lines https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-senate-panel-vote-gun-control-advocate-lead-firearms-enforcement-agency-2021-06-24 when it voted to advance his nomination. That meant Democrats would have had to jump through procedural hurdles to get Chipman confirmed. 

During his confirmation process, Chipman confronted a social media disinformation campaign falsely claiming he was involved in the deadly 1993 stand-off with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas.
The ATF is positioned to play a vital role in Biden's pledge to crack down on rising violent crime and shootings. Attorney General Merrick Garland has pledged that the ATF will crack down on gun dealers who fail to conduct background checks, do not assist law enforcement with tracing guns used in crimes, falsify records or sell guns to people prohibited from owning them.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will campaign for California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday as Democrats keep rolling out their biggest names to fight a Republican-backed recall attempt in the deep blue state.
Biden will appear with the embattled governor in the port city of Long Beach near Los Angeles in the campaign's final rally before the special recall election on Sept. 14, Newsom campaign spokesman Nathan Click said in an emailed announcement on Thursday.
On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned in the San Francisco Bay Area for Newsom. She painted the recall, heavily supported financially by state and national Republican groups, as part of that party's broader effort to oust Democrats from power and expand conservative restrictions on voting, abortion and LGBTQ rights. 
""They think if they can win in California, they can do this anywhere,"" Harris told a crowd of supporters and union members. ""Well we’ll show them you are not going to get this done – not here – never.""
The special recall election is being held as the country's most-populous state faces an unprecedented onslaught of troubles including wildfires, extreme drought and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The recall question was placed on the ballot after a petition drive by a conservative group called the Patriot Coalition. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in the state, and a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California showed 58% of likely voters opposed recalling Newsom, a first-term governor.
But complacency among Democrats could tilt the election toward Republicans, who are motivated to vote by their opposition to Newsom's progressive policies on immigration and crime.

The Democratic governor's decision to shut down in-person schooling during the worst of the pandemic has also angered some conservatives, as have mask and vaccination mandates.
In addition to stumping for Newsom, Biden will tour a wildfire-damaged area near Sacramento, visit the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho and campaign for his Build Back Better agenda in Colorado during his trip to the West next week, the White House said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump endorsed Wyoming attorney Harriet Hageman's bid on Thursday to unseat U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, who was the highest-profile Republican to seek Trump's removal from office on a charge he incited the U.S. Capitol riot.
Hageman was the fifth candidate Trump has backed to challenge a Republican congressional incumbent, part of his efforts to assert dominance over the Republican Party after losing his November re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump's fire has been focused on the 10 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting insurrection in a fiery speech ahead of the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by his supporters. He has also endorsed a challenger to Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of seven in her party who voted to convict Trump on the charge. He was ultimately acquitted.
Most of Trump's post-presidency endorsements have yet to face voters in Republican nominating contests before the party seeks to win control of Congress in November 2022 elections.
He has a mixed track record with those who have already faced voters. Republican activist Susan Wright - who was seeking a vacant U.S. House seat in Texas - lost a July special election to Texas state legislator Jake Ellzey, a fellow Republican. Another Trump-backed candidate - coal lobbyist Mike Carey - won a crowded August Republican nomination contest for a U.S. House seat in Ohio.
But in Wyoming, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump last November, public opinion polls suggest Cheney's vocal criticism of the former president will hurt her chances of victory, said David Wasserman, a political analyst at Cook Political Report.
""Trump still effectively leads the Republican Party, and there's no better sign of that than in Wyoming,"" Wasserman said.
A Remington Research Group poll conducted in July, before Hageman's entry into the race, showed Cheney with only 19% support among Wyoming Republicans and second in a field of four candidates. 
Wasserman said Cheney's best chance of winning would be if the field remains large.
Cheney, whose father Dick Cheney served as U.S. vice president from 2001 to 2009 after a previous stint in the House, is a lawmaker with impeccable conservative credentials. She is up for re-election in November 2022 to a third two-year term as Wyoming's only House member.
She responded defiantly to Trump's endorsement of Hageman. ""Bring it,"" Cheney wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). She also said she looked forward to an ""extended public debate"" about the rule of law, and criticized Trump again for misleading Americans over his baseless accusations that he lost the 2020 election due to voter fraud.
Cheney has been a steady critic of Trump and earlier this month, when she was named vice chair of the congressional select committee investigating the Capitol riot, vowed she and other investigators would ""not be deterred by threats.""
Hageman is a well-known attorney for land rights issues, an important political issue in the U.S. West. 

In a statement on the launch of her campaign, Hageman described Cheney as a politician who ""betrayed us because of her personal war with President Trump.""
Trump similarly called Cheney ""disloyal"" in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a key ally of President Joe Biden, said on Thursday she was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year but after months of treatment her doctors have concluded she has a low risk of the disease re-emerging.
Klobuchar, 61, is a leading figure in the Democratic Party and made her own run for the party's 2000 presidential nomination eventually won by Biden. A former prosecutor, she has represented Minnesota in the Senate since 2007. 
In a statement https://medium.com/@Amy_Klobuchar/statement-from-senator-amy-klobuchar-975260e9de8, Klobuchar said she underwent a procedure called a lumpectomy on her right breast that involved the removal of the cancer and subsequently completed a course of radiation treatment. She added that ""after additional follow-up visits, it was determined in August that the treatment went well.""
Even with a favorable diagnosis, Klobuchar's health scare is a reminder of the razor-thin margin Democrats have in the 50-50 Senate, where their majority hinges on Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
Klobuchar said doctors found signs of cancer at a routine mammogram in February that a biopsy then confirmed to be stage 1A breast cancer. According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-0-and-stage-1, stage 1A involves a tumor two centimeters (eight-tenths of an inch) or smaller that has not spread to the lymph nodes.

Klobuchar said she underwent treatment even as she helped lead the Senate investigation involving whether former President Donald Trump incited insurrection in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot by his supporters. Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in January but acquitted in the Senate https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/trump-impeachment-trial-could-wrap-up-on-saturday-conviction-seen-unlikely-idUSKBN2AD0AE in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government agencies have a Thursday deadline to produce documents demanded by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, including communications involving some of former President Donald Trump's closest advisers and family.
The Republican Trump wants executive privilege to be used to stop at least some of the documents from being transferred, a decision that rests with the White House of his Democratic successor, Joe Biden.
Here's an explanation of how executive privilege works:
WHAT DOES THE COMMITTEE WANT TO SEE?
The House of Representatives Select Committee is investigating the events leading up to and on Jan. 6, when mobs of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was meeting to certify Biden's November election victory.
The panel has asked for White House communications records which are held by the National Archives and Records Administration, as well as material from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Interior and Justice, and the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
WHAT'S EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE GOT TO DO WITH THIS INVESTIGATION? 
Executive privilege is a legal principle recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows the White House to refuse to comply with demands for records such as congressional subpoenas or Freedom of Information Act requests.
The principle is rooted in the idea that, for the White House to operate effectively, some privacy should be given to presidential advisers so they can have candid discussions.
A sitting president has in the past used executive privilege to keep records and communications from an earlier administration secret, but it is rare.
For example, Trump's White House cited executive privilege in 2018 to withhold from the Senate more than 100,000 pages of records from then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s time as a lawyer in the administration of former President George W. Bush.
Trump also asserted executive privilege over former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, and said he would use the doctrine to block his former National Security Advisor John Bolton from testifying in his first Senate impeachment trial. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
If the Biden White House says the requested materials are protected by executive privilege, it will make it much more difficult for the congressional committee to investigate Trump.
But Biden is expected to be sympathetic toward the panel's view that the materials should be produced. In July, the White House said it would allow former Justice Department lawyers to testify to a Senate committee about Trump's efforts to overturn his election loss.
Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University who wrote a book about executive privilege, said it should not be used to cover up evidence of wrongdoing. 
""Claims of executive privilege always weaken when there is credible evidence of wrongdoing,"" Rozell said. ""Congress's investigatory powers reach very, very broadly in those circumstances.""
Biden's White House Counsel, Dana Remus, will likely be involved in determining whether executive privilege applies to any of the communications sought by the committee, said Jonathan David Shaub, a law professor at the University of Kentucky.
Remus will also consult with the Office of Legal Counsel, a division of the Justice Department, Shaub said.
""Whatever they turn over will be a precedent for the future,"" said Shaub.
A White House official told Reuters that Biden ""has been clear that the events of January 6th were an unprecedented assault on our democracy – and he believes they deserve a full investigation to determine what transpired and ensure it can never happen again.""
Executive branch agencies have been engaging with the Select Committee and will continue to do so, the official said.
WHAT ARE TRUMP'S OTHER OPTIONS?
If Biden rejects Trump's view of executive privilege, as widely expected, the former president can file a legal challenge in Washington, D.C., federal court, said Michael Stern, a former congressional lawyer.
Even if the courts reject Trump's arguments, he could still succeed in slowing the investigation down, Stern said.
""If he is willing to pay for the lawyers, Trump could delay the production of records for some time,"" he said.
Such a lawsuit would be likely be filed against the head of the National Archives and Records Administration.

Rozell said Trump may be aiming to gum up the investigation until November 2022, when Republicans hope to take control of the House.
""He knows Biden is not going to support his privilege claim, but if he can tie it up in the courts ... he may be able to run out the clock on the Democratic majority doing their investigation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Michigan officials on Wednesday demanded that lawyers who unsuccessfully sued to overturn former President Donald Trump's election defeat in the state pay about $200,000 to reimburse for legal fees and related costs.
U.S. District Judge Linda Parker ruled last month that state and local election officials in Michigan were entitled to reimbursement of their legal fees, but has not yet determined the exact amount. The judge will now review the $200,000 request to determine if it is reasonable.
Most of the $200,000 was requested by the City of Detroit, which spent about $180,000 on a private law firm in the case. The office of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel asked for about $20,000.
Parker ordered the repayment as part of sanctions against the lawyers who included Sidney Powell, a former campaign lawyer for Trump, and prominent litigator Lin Wood.
The Trump lawyers sued in Michigan last year to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory over Trump. Parker suggested they might deserve to lose their law licenses.
Parker said in her Aug. 25 ruling that the pro-Trump lawyers should have investigated the Republican former president's voter fraud claims more carefully before filing what Parker called a ""frivolous"" lawsuit.

Parker, who dismissed the Michigan suit in December, formally requested that disciplinary bodies investigate whether the pro-Trump lawyers should have their law licenses revoked. The judge also ordered the lawyers to attend classes on the ethical and legal requirements for filing legal claims.
""This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,"" Parker said in her decision, adding that the case ""was never about fraud - it was about undermining the People's faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so.""

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned on Wednesday for embattled California Governor Gavin Newsom, part of a ramped-up effort to save his job from a Republican-led recall by bringing in some of the Democratic Party's biggest names.
Harris, a longtime ally of Newsom, appeared with the governor in San Leandro, near her childhood home of Oakland. Harris previously served as a U.S. senator from California and state attorney general.
She painted the recall, which is backed financially by state and national Republican groups, as part of a broader Republican effort to oust Democrats from power and expand conservative restrictions on voting, abortion and LGBTQ rights. 
""They think if they can win in California, they can do this anywhere,"" Harris told a crowd of supporters and union members. ""Well we’ll show them you are not going to get this done – not here – not ever.""
Harris praised Newsom's handling of the pandemic and cited his early support for same-sex marriage as mayor of San Francisco.
President Joe Biden also is expected to campaign for the governor ahead of the election next Tuesday.
The special election on whether to recall Newsom is being held as the country's most-populous state faces an unprecedented onslaught of troubles including wildfires, extreme drought and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The recall question was placed on the ballot after a petition drive by a conservative group called the Patriot Coalition. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in the state, and a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 58% of likely voters opposed recalling Newsom, a first-term governor.
But complacency among Democrats could tilt the election toward Republicans, who are more motivated to vote by their opposition to Newsom's progressive policies on immigration and crime.
The Democratic governor's decision to shut down in-person schooling during the worst of the pandemic, as well as enacting mask and vaccination mandates, has also angered some conservatives.
On Wednesday, the firm Political Data Intelligence released data on early returns that showed Democrats were sending mail-in ballots at more than twice the rate of Republicans.
Many Republicans no longer trust mail-in voting after former President Donald Trump's false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, a hesitancy the party is trying to counter https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-republicans-launching-campaign-boost-trust-mail-in-voting-2021-09-03.
Republican leaders in the state launched a campaign last week to show that mail-in voting is safe, including distributing videos showing top officials placing their ballots in mailboxes.

But in an interview with the conservative Newsmax network on Tuesday, Trump predicted, without providing evidence, that the recall election would be ""rigged"" in favor of Newsom.
If such claims make Republicans less likely to vote, Newsom is more likely to keep his job, analysts said.

If they did not resign their positions, they were to be terminated at 6 p.m., the White House said.
Those asked to step down include Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor under Donald Trump, and Sean Spicer, a White House spokesperson under the former Republican president.
""I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified ... to serve on these boards,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in response to a question during a daily briefing.
""The president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you're aligned with the values of this administration.""
""I'm not resigning, but you should,"" Conway wrote in a letter to Biden posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Spicer, who serves on the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Naval Academy, said on his Newsmax show on Wednesday he would not step down. ""I will not be submitting my resignation, and I will be joining a lawsuit to fight this,"" Spicer said.

Trump's former budget chief Russ Vought also said he would not quit. ""No. It’s a three year term,"" he said on Twitter.
The boards provide advice and recommendations to the U.S. president on matters including those related to morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs and academic methods of the academies, according to a 2020 notice in the Federal Register.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawyer for a man linked by prosecutors to the anti-government Oath Keepers group on Wednesday asked a judge to consider moving his possible trial on charges of involvement in the U.S. Capitol riot away from Washington because he believes jurors in the city are politically biased.
Lawyer David Fischer represents former Navy intelligence officer Thomas Caldwell, 65, of Berryville, Virginia, who is among around 600 defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s November election victory over then-President Donald Trump. Earlier on Jan. 6 Trump had given a fiery speech to supporters falsely claiming his defeat was the result of fraud.
""There is so much prejudice against these defendants it's off the chart,"" Fischer said to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, referring to Washington D.C.
Asked by Mehta how he knew that, Fischer said Washington was ""very anti-Donald Trump.""
Mehta did not immediately rule on Fischer's venue request.
In February Caldwell pleaded not guilty https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-capitol-riots/virginia-man-with-ties-to-anti-government-oath-keepers-pleads-not-guilty-in-capitol-riots-case-idUSKBN2AC2N5 to several charges, including plotting with others to disrupt the proceeding in Congress.
Caldwell’s attorney has denied prosecutors' statements that his client is a member of the Oath Keepers or that he has strong ties to the militia.
Also on Wednesday, Mark Connell, a lawyer for Mark Leffingwell, who faces riot-related felony charges, told U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson that defense and prosecution lawyers ""need to iron out some details"" of a possible plea bargain agreement for Leffingwell.
Leffingwell, of Seattle, was one of the first people arrested on riot-related charges. In a statement, an unnamed U.S. Capitol police officer said Leffingwell ""punched me repeatedly with a closed fist. I was struck in the helmet that I was wearing and in the chest.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Capitol Police is increasing security in preparation for potential violence at a Sept. 18 rally in which followers of former President Donald Trump intend to show support for people arrested after the deadly January attack on the Capitol, according to a statement and an internal memo on Wednesday.
Department Chief Tom Manger will provide a security briefing to top lawmakers on Monday about the rally, a source familiar with the meeting said. The source said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has invited U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to the briefing.
""We have a robust security posture planned for September 18th,"" the U.S. Capitol Police statement said. ""All available staff will be working.""
Citing an internal Capitol Police memo, CNN reported on Wednesday that law enforcement officials are bracing for potential clashes and unrest during the rally after seeing a noticeable uptick in violent rhetoric around the event on social media and discussion boards.
Capitol Police did not respond to request for comment on the CNN report.
The ""Justice for J6"" rally, planned for the area around the U.S. Capitol, is intended to protest the treatment of the more than 600 people arrested for participating in the Jan. 6 siege of the building. Mobs of supporters of then-President Trump stormed the building while Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's November election win.
The demonstration is being organized by Look Ahead America, a nonprofit led by Matt Braynard, who worked on Trump's presidential campaign.

The Jan. 6 attack was the worst violence at the Capitol since the British invasion during the War of 1812.
Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot to death by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started when its new session begins in October, the nation's top judicial body announced on Wednesday.
The court building has been closed to the public since March 2020 due to the pandemic, with the justices hearing oral arguments via teleconference for the first time ever.
""The court will continue to closely monitor public health guidance in determining plans,"" the court said in a statement, adding that the building would be open only for official business - not the public - amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic ""until further notice."" 
Live audio of oral arguments, a practice the court began when it started hearing its cases via teleconference in May 2020, will continue, the statement said. Courtroom access will be limited to the nine justices, court personnel, lawyers and members of the Supreme Court press corps, it added.
The court's term begins on Oct. 4 and runs through the end of next June. 
Among the cases the justices are due to hear is a major challenge to abortion rights involving Mississippi's bid to revive a Republican-backed state law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. They also are set to hear a challenge backed by the National Rifle Association to New York state's restrictions on people carrying concealed handguns in public in a case that could further undermine firearms control efforts nationally.
The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is due to hear the gun case on Nov. 3. A date for the abortion case has not yet been scheduled.
The court's decision to shut its building to the public and change the format for its arguments represented one of the innumerable ways the pandemic reshaped life in the United States.
In-person oral arguments in March and April of 2020 were canceled and the justices instead heard 10 cases by teleconference in May 2020. 

The court then heard the all its cases during the 2020-2021 term using the same method. There were few technological glitches in the arguments by teleconference. The new format prompted Justice Clarence Thomas to regularly pose questions to lawyers during the arguments after usually remaining silent when arguments are held in-person.
All nine justices, three of whom are over age 70, have been vaccinated to protect against COVID-19, an illness that has proven to be particularly dangerous among the elderly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Tuesday toured sites of deadly floods in the Northeast and said Hurricane Ida demonstrated the ravages of climate change as he pressed for investments to boost infrastructure and fight global warming.
""Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here. It's not going to get any better,"" Biden said after touring neighborhoods in New Jersey and New York City's Queens borough that were hurt by the storm. ""We can stop it from getting worse.""
It was Biden's second trip in recent days to areas slammed by the storm, shifting his focus to domestic priorities after weeks of public attention to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Biden made fighting climate change a key plank of his 2020 presidential campaign and a top priority of his administration, but some of his goals rely on getting the U.S. Congress to pass multitrillion-dollar legislation on infrastructure and other priorities.
Biden noted that wildfires, hurricanes and floods were hitting every part of the United States, with more than 100 million Americans affected this summer alone. The storms, he said, will only be getting worse.
""Folks, we got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red. The nation and the world are in peril. That's not hyperbole. That is a fact,"" Biden said.
On Friday he visited Louisiana, promising federal aid and urging national unity. Ida devastated parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast and unleashed even deadlier flooding in the Northeast.[L1N2Q50IA]
Biden's flood damage trips revived his familiar role of consoler-in-chief, a shift from time spent in recent weeks defending his decision to pull U.S. troops from Afghanistan following its deadly aftermath.
The United States is still working in Afghanistan to get Americans out while resettling tens of thousands of evacuees. Still, Biden is expected to focus in the coming days on domestic issues: a fight to protect women's reproductive rights in the wake of a new Texas anti-abortion law, the end of extended unemployment benefits for many Americans and new measures to fight COVID-19. 
On Saturday, the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, he will visit the three sites where hijacked U.S. domestic planes crashed. Next week, he plans to visit California to boost Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom's effort to stay in office amid a recall election and to highlight the damage done by wildfires, another sign of climate change. Vice President Kamala Harris plans to travel to California on Wednesday. 

On Tuesday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said it would take ""months more likely than weeks"" to complete cleanup, repairs and rebuilding after his state was ravaged by flooding and a tornado from the remnants of Ida. 
Dozens of people died during the hurricane and in its aftermath and some states are still grappling with widespread power outages and water-filled homes.

148,"<span>Sep 05, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's filibuster rule likely imperils a bill intended to protect abortion rights that Democrats are readying following the Supreme Court's decision not to block a strict new Texas ban, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday.
Senator Amy Klobuchar told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that some Senate Republicans support abortion rights but not enough to overcome the chamber's rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation.
The nation's 6-3 conservative top court this week allowed Texas' six-week abortion ban to go into effect, which observers said showed the justices may be ready to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a national right to abortion.
That decision led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that the Democratic-controlled chamber will soon debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping similar state anti-abortion regulations. But Klobuchar said that bill faces little to no chance of passing the Senate.
""My solution to this ... I believe we should abolish the filibuster,"" Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Rules Committee, told CNN. ""I do not believe an archaic rule should be used to allow us to put our heads in the sand ... and not take action on these important issues ... We just will get nowhere if we keep this filibuster in place.""
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats have repeatedly over the past year suggested doing away with the filibuster to allow other Democratic priorities to pass, including a voting rights bill intended to counteract a wave of new voting restrictions passed by Republican-governed states.
Senate moderates, including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have rejected that idea, however.

Klobuchar said one way to discourage the frequency of filibusters would be to make senators who object to ending debate actually stay on the floor debating. This ""talking filibuster"" was the tradition until the 1970s. 
She said another approach would be a ""carveout"" that would only change the filibuster for legislation directly tied to one subject, such as abortion rights.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Capitol rioter nicknamed the ""QAnon Shaman"" is disappointed former President Donald Trump did not pardon him, his defense lawyer said on Friday after the man pleaded guilty to taking part in the Jan. 6 unrest.
Jacob Chansley, of Phoenix, Arizona, was photographed inside the Capitol shirtless, wearing a horned headdress and heavily tattooed. He has been held without bond since his arrest shortly after the riot, and on Friday entered a guilty plea to obstructing an official proceeding.
While in detention, Chansley underwent mental examinations and was diagnosed by prison officials with transient schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety.
Nearly 600 people have been arrested over the attack on the Capitol where Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's November victory over Trump. Earlier Trump had given a fiery speech falsely claiming his defeat was the result of fraud.
While the felony charge Chansley pleaded guilty to carries both a maximum 20-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutor Kimberly Paschall indicated the maximum sentence the government was likely to request would be much shorter.
Chansley had been a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory that casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals.
Although he did not get a pardon from Trump, Chansley's defense lawyer Albert Watkins said ""there will always be a soft spot"" for Trump in Chansley's heart.

At Friday's plea hearing, Watkins asked Judge Royce Lamberth to allow Chansley to be released from prison pending a sentencing hearing, scheduled for Nov. 17. The judge said he would consider this request. 
Watkins noted that prosecutors had acknowledged Chansley was ""not a planner or organizer"" of the riot. Watkins later told reporters that Chansley had cooperated with Jan. 6 investigations and informed on a group he saw stealing classified materials from a Senate office.

152,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 10:55PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - A Texas judge on Friday temporarily barred an anti-abortion group from suing Planned Parenthood to enforce a near-total ban on abortion in the state, handing the nation's largest abortion provider a small victory in the bitter legal fight.
Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Planned Parenthood a temporary restraining order against the anti-abortion group, Texas Right to Life, blocking the group and its allies from using an unusual mechanism of the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who provides or ""aids or abets"" an abortion after six weeks.
The law https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-declines-block-texas-abortion-ban-2021-09-02 took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests Supreme Court justices are closer than ever to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision under which abortion rights have been protected.
Guerra Gamble said in her three-page written order that allowing the so-called private enforcement mechanism to go forward while Planned Parenthood took further legal action would cause ""probable, irreparable and imminent injury"" that could not be cured later.
The unusual enforcement mechanism gives the civil enforcement power to any party in or out of Texas who chooses to sue, while preventing government officials from enforcing the ban. 
The Travis County restraining order does not bar others from using the law against Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers in Texas. A hearing on a possible further injunction was set for Sept. 13. 
Helene Krasnoff, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's vice president for public policy litigation and law, expressed relief ""that the Travis County district court has acted quickly to grant this restraining order against Texas Right to Life and anyone working with them as deputized enforcers of this draconian law.""

""But make no mistake: this is not enough relief for Texas,"" she said.
Elizabeth Graham (NYSE:GHM), a Texas Right to Life vice president, said in a statement that her group ""will never back down from protecting pregnant women and preborn children from abortion.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -California Republicans will launch a campaign on Friday to convince conservatives to trust the state's mail-in balloting system, hoping to boost turnout in the election to recall Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, party officials said.
The party will roll out videos on its digital platforms showing Republican Party officials mailing their ballots and urging supporters to vote early in the Sept. 14 election, according to footage seen exclusively by Reuters and interviews with party leaders. 
Polls show Republicans are highly motivated to vote in the election to recall Newsom, a liberal Democrat who has faced criticism over his policies on COVID-19, immigration and crime. But they have been turning in early ballots at half the rate of Democrats, who outnumber Republicans in California more than two-to-one. 
In addition to mail-in voting, voters can return their ballots to drop boxes or vote in person on Sept. 14. Many Republicans are expected to wait until election day.
Privately, Republican leaders acknowledged that false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election by former President Donald Trump and others in large part created the reticence about mail-in voting.
The state party's new campaign will acknowledge concerns about election integrity while also seeking to convince Republican voters they can trust the system, party leaders said. U.S. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy will be featured in an upcoming video urging people to vote.
""It's a trust but verify strategy,"" California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said in an interview. ""We want to make sure that they have confidence in the election process, and we want to make sure that they know there are different ways that they can vote.""
Patterson said she planned to mail her ballot.
The first two videos emphasize the party's election integrity plan, which involves increasing poll watchers, hiring election lawyers and asking voters to report any irregularities. Then the speakers pivot to urging voters to cast their ballots.
Another video, to be released next week, features Harmeet Dhillon, a top state party official, casting her ballot by mail and later receiving a text message that it was received, said one party official who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The state's Republicans find themselves in ""a very odd and ironic situation,"" said Raphael Sonenshein, director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles.
""Republicans are facing the problem that vote by mail was one of the principal targets of the argument that something had gone wrong in 2020,"" he said.

The order requires U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to make the declassified documents public over the next six months as it oversees ""a declassification review of documents"" related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe.

Saudi Arabia has said it had no role in the hijacked plane attacks. 
Relatives of the victims have been pushing for years for more information about what the FBI discovered in its probe.
Last month, many families asked Biden to skip 20-year memorial events unless he declassified documents they contend will show Saudi Arabian leaders supported the attacks.

""My heart continues to be with the 9/11 families who are suffering, and my Administration will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community,"" Biden said in the statement on Friday. ""I welcome their voices and insight as we chart a way forward.""

Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he supported Biden's move.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause ""unconstitutional chaos"" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday.
The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-abortion-ban-opens-up-wild-west-enforcement-critics-say-2021-09-02 on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy.
Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because of an unusual feature that leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, who could collect cash bounties of at least $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against women who seek abortion after their sixth week of pregnancy or those who help them.
Civil rights advocates warned that concept could cause havoc https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-abortion-ban-opens-up-wild-west-enforcement-critics-say-2021-09-02 if it is adopted by other states or applied to other contentious rights, such as gun ownership.
""It unleashes unconstitutional chaos and empowers self-anointed enforcers to have devastating impacts,"" Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement directing federal agencies to act to protect the right to abortion enshrined in the high court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women.""
By a 5-4 vote, the justices late on Wednesday denied an emergency request by abortion and women's health providers for an injunction on enforcement of the ban while litigation continues. 
The ban took effect early on Wednesday and prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. The law could still be blocked at some other stage.
The law would amount to a near-total ban on the procedure in Texas - the second-most-populous U.S. state - as 85% to 90% of abortions are obtained after six weeks of pregnancy, and would probably force many clinics to close, abortion rights groups said. 
'STUNNING'
One of the court's six conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts, joined its three liberals in dissent.
""The court's order is stunning,"" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. 
""Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.""
In an unsigned explanation, the court's majority said the Texas law's unusual construction - leaving enforcement to individuals bringing lawsuits - limited its ability to act and that its decision was not a reflection of the ultimate constitutionality of the law.
""Federal courts enjoy the power to enjoin individuals tasked with enforcing laws, not the laws themselves,"" the court said. ""This order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts.""
A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the United States, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In a June survey https://www.reuters.com/world/us/plurality-americans-would-strike-down-mississippi-abortion-ban-2021-06-24, some 52% said it should be legal in most or all cases, with just 36% saying it should be illegal in most or all cases.
The Republican president of Florida's state Senate, Wilton Simpson, told local station WFLY-TV on Thursday that he planned to follow Texas' lead and bring up a similar abortion ban in the chamber's next session. 
""This law will begin saving the lives of tens of thousands of Texas babies and we look forward to the day that babies’ lives will be spared across America,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee.
Biden, a Roman Catholic who has shifted to the left on abortion in recent years, said the White House would look at what steps the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice can take to respond to the Texas law. The Office of the White House Counsel and Biden's Gender Policy Council will also review the matter.
POLARIZING ISSUE
Abortion remains a deeply polarizing issue, with a majority of Democrats supporting abortion rights and most Republicans opposing them. The number of abortions reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped in recent decades, to roughly 620,000 in 2018, the most recent figures, down from 790,000 in 2009.
Congress has the power to legalize abortion nationwide, and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the Texas law and vowed to take up a bill to do so when Congress returns later this month.
""Its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade, and even refuses to make exceptions for cases of rape and incest,"" Pelosi said. ""This ban necessitates codifying Roe v. Wade.""
Democrats hold narrow majorities in Congress, but passage in the House would not guarantee success in the Senate, which requires 60 of its 100 members to agree on most legislation. Democrats hold 50 seats in that chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote.
The court decision illustrates the impact of Republican former President Donald Trump's three conservative appointees to the nation's highest court, who have tilted it further to the right. All were in the majority.
A ban like Texas' has never been permitted in any state since the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade.
Texas is among a dozen mostly Republican-led states to ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, often at six weeks.

Courts had previously blocked such bans, citing Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the coming months in a case centering on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, in which the state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022.

156,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Democratic lawmakers are discussing a range of tax proposals targeting corporations and the wealthy -- including levies on stock buybacks, carbon emissions and executive compensation, a wider set of measures than President Joe Biden had proposed to help fund a ramp-up in spending on social programs.
One idea is applying an excise tax on stock buybacks or treating them as taxable dividends to shareholders, according to two people familiar with Senate Finance Committee discussions. Corporate deductions for executive pay could also be limited, and chief executive officers could face an excise tax if their pay exceeds that of an average company worker by a certain ratio, the people said.
The expanded menu of tax options would give Democrats more flexibility as they undertake thorny negotiations among themselves over how to pay for a proposed $3.5 trillion of long-term investments in child care, education and other social programs. Biden and Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly made clear that their plans will not raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year.
Assorted other proposals are in the mix and have previously been proposed by Biden or by Senate Democrats, including raising the 21% corporate rate, increasing taxes on overseas company income and raising both the top individual income tax rate to 39.6% as well as the capital gains rate for high-income investors.
Hurdle Raised
It’s not clear which parts could pass muster, however, given the views of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a pivotal Democrat who this week blasted the $3.5 trillion size of the legislation and called for a pause in its consideration given concerns about inflation and debt.
Read More: Manchin Jolts Democrats by Urging ‘Pause’ on $3.5 Trillion Bill
Treating corporate buybacks and dividends similarly for tax purposes would raise $70 billion to $80 billion a year, “making it a potentially attractive add-on to future budget bills that strive for revenue neutrality or deficit reduction,” law professors Daniel Hemel and Gregg Polsky wrote in a paper earlier this year.
Other measures being considered by Senate Finance Committee Democrats would increase exemptions to Biden’s proposal to impose capital gains taxes on appreciated assets held by wealthy individuals until death.
The new proposal would allow for a $5 million exemption per person, or $10 million per couple -- an increase from the $1 million-per-person and $2 million-per-couple exclusions proposed by the administration in May, according to the people familiar with the discussions.
Family Farms
The Senate Finance proposal would also modify a protection for family farms by allowing couples to exclude the first $25 million from their property from taxes, in addition to the general $10 million exemption. The Biden proposal would allow family-owned and-operated businesses to indefinitely defer paying the capital gains tax until the interest in the business is sold or the business ceases to be run by the family.
Democrats have also been discussing a boost to Internal Revenue Service enforcement to raise as much as $200 billion, taxing carried interest for fund managers at regular tax rates, and cracking down on trusts used by the wealthy to avoid gift and estate taxes.
Environmental proposals on the table include a potential tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels starting at $15 per ton; a carbon tax on major industrial emitters like steel, cement and chemicals, and a per-barrel tax on crude oil. Each option would be paired with rebates for low-income taxpayers and a border-adjustment tax.
Fossil-fuel companies could also lose assorted tax breaks. The set of proposals under consideration also includes a 20-cents a pound fee on the sale of so-called virgin plastics.
Wealthy Estates
The Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Ron Wyden, is also considering proposals to end popular techniques the ultra wealthy use to avoid estate taxes, including grantor-retained annuity trusts and intentionally defective grantor trusts, according to the people.
In addition, the committee may seek to compel the Treasury to revive regulations that would limit the use of discounts for reducing the value of assets held in closely held family businesses for estate and gift tax purposes. A set of rules was proposed in 2016 by the Obama administration but later withdrawn under the Trump administration -- a move heralded at the time by trade groups and Republican lawmakers who opposed the regulations for being overly broad.

(Reuters) - More than 9 months after Pennyslvania certified the 2020 election, Republican lawmakers in the state are launching a partisan probe into the vote by soliciting sworn testimony on ""irregularities"" and scheduling a hearing for next week.
Thursday's announcement by the committee overseen by state senator Cris Dush marks the start to the ""forensic investigation"" that hardcore supporters of former President Donald Trump have been clamoring for in the battleground state, spurred on by Trump's false claims of widespread voting fraud.
Dush, a Trump backer who in June toured the site of a contentious audit ongoing in Arizona, was last month tapped to chair the Pennsylvania Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee so he could push forward with the election probe.
""As part of the committee's comprehensive election integrity investigation, Dush is encouraging voters to come forward if they have witnessed voter irregularities or other election improprieties firsthand,"" the committee said in a statement.
The committee said it created a webpage to collect testimony and that anyone making a submission must be ""comfortable signing an affidavit and potentially testifying under oath at a Senate committee hearing under penalty of perjury.""
It scheduled the first hearing for Sept. 9 in Harrisburg.
The state's attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, has been critical of the push for another audit of the election, calling a previous attempt at one a ""sham"" and a ""partisan fishing expedition"" and vowing to fight against it.
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the November election, and all counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud to put in question Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the state by 81,000 votes.
The previous attempt at a ""forensic"" probe of the 2020 election by state senator Doug Mastriano was shut down last month following a tussle between him and Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman over his methods. Corman, the Senate's top Republican, sidelined Mastriano, a vocal Trump supporter, after the two traded public barbs.
Corman spokesman Jason Thompson said the goal of the investigation was not to overturn Trump's loss.
""It is to restore faith in the system by strengthening election security. That means conducting a thorough investigation that goes much, much further than the limited audits required by state law,"" he wrote in an email.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday said he is launching a ""whole-of-government effort,"" including from the White House counsel, to combat a strict new Texas abortion law after an overnight Supreme Court decision let it stand.
Biden, a Democrat and a Catholic who has shifted to the left on abortion in recent years to be more in line with his party's base, called the law that bans any abortion after six weeks an ""unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights."" 
The president said in a statement he was directing the office of the White House counsel and his Gender Policy Council to review how the government could ""ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions... and what legal tools we have to insulate women and providers from the impact of Texas’ bizarre scheme of outsourced enforcement to private parties."" 
The White House will specifically look at what measures can be taken through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, Biden said. 
The White House has called for the ""codification"" of abortion rights that are currently protected by the court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision through legislation in Congress, but has not outlined any specific steps that it is taking to back any such law. 
A plurality of Americans believe that abortion should be legal up until the fetus is capable of living on its own, and they remain largely supportive of Roe v. Wade, a Reuters/Ipsos poll https://www.reuters.com/world/us/plurality-americans-would-strike-down-mississippi-abortion-ban-2021-06-24 in June showed. The responses are split along party lines, with 70% of Democrats, 35% of Republicans and 47% of independents agreeing abortion should be legal in most or all cases. 

Biden's Democrats have control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with slim majorities and he is seeking to push through legislation on infrastructure and other Democratic priorities in the coming weeks. 
The House will debate and vote on legislation stopping states from enacting restrictive anti-abortion regulations like the one just approved by Texas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives plans to debate and vote on legislation aimed at stopping states from enacting tough anti-abortion regulations like the one in Texas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday, but the bill's prospects in the Senate were slim.
Declaring that the Texas statute ""delivers catastrophe to women in Texas, particularly women of color and women from low-income communities,"" Pelosi said in a statement that a Democratic bill would be brought before the full House after Sept. 20, when its recess is scheduled to end.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters President Joe Biden will consult with lawmakers on legislation to protect women's right to abortions. She said a range of approaches were under review, including the bill to be voted upon by the House.
It was unclear whether the Senate would bring up such a bill even if it is passed by the House, however. It would face a difficult path in the 100-member chamber, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris having the power to break tie votes.
Most legislation requires the support of at least 60 lawmakers to advance in the Senate. The House Democrats' measure, the Women's Health Protection Act, would likely struggle to get 10 votes among Republicans.
Most Republicans oppose abortion, one of the most divisive issues in the United States, and many have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark decision making it a woman's constitutional right.
The Women's Health Protection Act has been introduced in Congress multiple times since 2013 but never advanced in either the House or Senate.
The issue took on renewed urgency for Democrats after a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling late on Wednesday allowing a Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion to remain in force.
The bill aims to protect health care providers’ ability to deliver abortion services free from restrictions such as waiting periods, admitting privilege requirements for providers, or what supporters argue are unnecessary medical procedures, like ultrasounds, before an abortion can be performed.
The Texas law and the Supreme Court's initial reaction to it could motivate Democratic voters to turn out in elections in November 2022, which Republicans are hoping will allow them to take control of the House and Senate.
With such a tenuous hold on the two chambers, a number of Democrats want to change the 60-vote ""filibuster"" rule in the Senate so that bills could advance now with a simple majority of 51 lawmakers.

""Democrats can either abolish the filibuster and expand the court, or do nothing as millions of peoples’ bodies, rights, and lives are sacrificed for far-right minority rule,"" liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""This shouldn’t be a difficult decision,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Liz Cheney will serve as vice chair of the congressional select committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, an appointment likely to draw the ire of some of her fellow Republicans.
Bennie Thompson, the panel's Democratic chairman, announced the appointment in a statement on Thursday that said Cheney demonstrated ""again and again"" a commitment to getting answers.
""Her leadership and insights have shaped the early work of the Select Committee and this appointment underscores the bipartisan nature of this effort,"" he said.
Lawmakers closely aligned with Republican former President Donald Trump have been critical of Cheney, a three-term House member and daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. 
One of two Republican select committee members, Cheney was stripped of her leadership role in the House Republican caucus after denouncing Trump's false assertions of voter fraud in his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.
Cheney said on Thursday the panel intended to conduct a non-partisan, professional and thorough investigation. 
""We owe it to the American people to investigate everything that led up to, and transpired on, January 6th. We will not be deterred by threats or attempted obstruction and we will not rest until our task is complete,"" she said in a statement.
House Democrats formed the committee, despite objections from Trump's fellow Republicans, to investigate the assault on the Capitol by mobs of his supporters as Congress was meeting to certify the Democrat Biden's election victory.
Nearly 600 people have been arrested in connection with the attack.
It was the worst violence at the seat of the U.S. government since the British invasion during the War of 1812. Four people died on the day, one shot to death by police and the others of natural causes. 
A Capitol Police officer attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than 100 police officers were injured.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday the United States was ""firmly committed"" to Ukraine's territorial integrity and offered Kyiv $60 million in new security aid as it grapples with aggression from Moscow.
""The United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression,"" Biden said at the beginning of a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Oval Office.
""Today we're going to discuss how the U.S. can continue to support Ukraine as it advances its democratic reforms agenda,"" Biden said.
The two leaders, at their first face-to-face meeting since Biden took office in January, also had the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on their agenda, a project Ukraine fears could be used by Russia as a geopolitical weapon. 
Zelenskiy raised his concerns about the pipeline in his opening remarks and said he would seek to hear Biden's vision of Ukraine's chances for joining the NATO military alliance and a time frame for such a move.
Zelenskiy told reporters in June he wanted a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" from Biden on giving Ukraine a plan to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He has urged NATO members to accelerate Ukraine's entry after a standoff with Russia this year in which Moscow massed additional troops and military equipment near Ukraine's borders.
NATO allies believe Ukraine needs to adopt more political reforms before gaining membership. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki underscored that Ukraine needed to modernize its defense sector and advance rule-of-law reforms in order to meet NATO membership standards.
Zelenskiy told reporters after the meeting that no time frame on NATO emerged from the discussions, but said of Biden: ""I feel that the president personally, and not only feel - I heard this - the president personally supports Ukraine regarding the granting of NATO membership.""
Zelenskiy's White House visit came after he played an unwitting and high-profile role in the process that led to former President Donald Trump's first impeachment. 
Trump, a Republican who lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Biden, had pressed the new Ukrainian leader in a 2019 phone call to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who had served as a director of a Ukrainian energy company. News of the phone call and related actions sparked an effort to remove Trump from office.
Asked if Biden expected to address that in the meeting, Psaki said simply: ""No."" 
'VERY MUCH CONCERNED'
The Wednesday get-together took place as European leaders take stock of Biden's abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan, a move that prompted some allies to raise questions about U.S. security commitments.
Ukraine and Russia have been at odds since Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backed separatists in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, which Ukraine says has killed 14,000 people.
The new $60 million security assistance package for Ukraine would include Javelin anti-armor systems and other ""defensive lethal and nonlethal capabilities,"" a senior Biden administration official said before the visit.
The meeting came after the Biden administration announced a deal last month with Germany intended partly to allay Ukrainian concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea to carry gas from Russia's Arctic region to Germany.
Ukraine is concerned that the pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine, could embolden Moscow to take further action against Kyiv and has sought guarantees over its status as a gas transit country once the pipeline becomes operational.
""We are very much concerned, as you are, with the commissioning of - possible commission on the Nord Stream 2,"" Zelenskiy told Biden.

The two countries said in a joint statement after the meeting that they both oppose the project and ""support efforts to increase capacity for gas supplies to Ukraine from diversified sources.""
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Tuesday that officials from both countries had signed a letter of intent to cooperate on energy and climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed Army veteran Joe Kent's bid to unseat Republican U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who was among the few in her party who voted to impeach Trump in January.
Trump has promised to help Republicans win control of Congress in the November 2022 elections and is also working to replace his Republican critics in Congress with loyalists.
Herrera Beutler was among 10 Republican lawmakers who joined House Democrats in a January vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection in a fiery speech ahead of the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by his supporters.
Trump in February endorsed a former aide who is challenging Republican Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who also voted to impeach. 
The former president has also backed a Republican challenging Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was among the seven Republicans in that chamber who voted with Democrats in a failed attempt to convict Trump.
Trump said in a statement that Herrera Beutler's impeachment vote was ""against the Republican Party"" and that Kent, if elected, would ""be a warrior for the America First agenda.""
Herrera Beutler's campaign manager, Parker Truax, brushed off Trump's comments, noting that the lawmaker outperformed Trump in her district in the 2016 and 2020 elections. In January, Herrera Beutler said ""the president of the United States incited a riot"" and that the evidence against him was ""indisputable."" 
She has represented Washington's 3rd Congressional District since 2011 and won re-election in 2020 with 56% of the vote. 

Herrera Beutler has also easily led the Republican field at campaign fundraising, ending June with over $1 million in the bank. 
Kent, whose campaign website touts his allegiance to Trump, had just over $500,000, second to Herrera Beutler among the five Republican candidates who filed campaign finance disclosures for the period.

(Reuters) - The Illinois Senate passed a bill early on Wednesday that aims to prevent two nuclear power plants from shutting this autumn, sending the legislation to the House where it was uncertain if the chamber would bring the legislation to a vote. The Senate voted 39-16 to pass a wide-ranging energy bill, with two senators voting ""present."" The bill contains more than $600 million in carbon mitigation credits for nuclear plants which generate virtually emissions-free electricity. U.S. nuclear plants have been struggling to compete with wind and solar farms and plants that burn low-cost natural gas.  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) has said it will close its Byron nuclear plant in September and its Dresden plant in November if a state or federal program does not come to the rescue. It was uncertain whether the House would move fast enough to pass the legislation to prevent the shutting of the first plant, located in Byron, Illinois.
Exelon spokesperson Paul Adams said the company was continuing shutdown preparations at the plants. Still, Exelon has ""established off-ramps that will allow us to reverse that decision if lawmakers pass legislation with enough time for us to safely refuel the plants,"" he said. Byron will run out of fuel and permanently shut on Sept. 13 unless legislation is enacted.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement his ""office looks forward to working with members of the House to finalize an energy package that puts consumers and climate first.""
The state has been working on the bill for nearly two years but it has been delayed by concerns of Pritzker, some lawmakers and environmentalists that coal plants would not be phased out quickly or allowed to keep running with unproven carbon-capture equipment. Local media quoted Senator Don Harmon, a Democrat and the Illinois Senate president, saying he thought the House and Pritzker could reach an agreement in a matter of days.
Jaclyn Driscoll, a spokesperson for House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, a Democrat, said: ""The Speaker has been very clear that before an energy proposal is called in the House there must be a consensus among the Democratic caucus and stakeholders, as well as include strong, meaningful ethics provisions.""
Driscoll did not respond to a question on whether the bill could be worked out in days. The House left town after the Senate passed the bill, but is expected to return in less than two weeks to approve changes to an ethics bill. Gina McCarthy, President Joe Biden's climate adviser, has said some existing nuclear plants are ""absolutely essential"" to hit U.S. goals to decarbonize the electric grid by 2035. Incentives are included in the infrastructure bills being considered by the U.S. Congress. But Exelon has said these alone would come too late to save Byron and Dresden. The plants have more than 1,500 workers, many in high-paying union jobs. The United States has 93 nuclear reactors, more than any other country, but that is down from 104 in 2012.

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) -The Texas legislature on Tuesday passed the final version of a bill restricting voter access that sparked a weeks-long political showdown and is expected to be quickly signed into law by the state's Republican governor.
Both the state House of Representatives and state Senate - each controlled by Republicans - approved the measure that would outlaw drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and add new identification requirements for mail-in voting.
It would also prevent election officials from sending out unsolicited mail-in ballot applications and empower partisan poll-watchers. 
Republicans across the United States have pushed similar legislation, citing former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that voter fraud cost him the November election.
Democratic lawmakers and voting rights advocates have warned that the Texas bill would disproportionately hamper voters of color, a charge denied by its Republican backers.
Drive-through and 24-hour voting were innovations pushed through in the Houston metropolitan area in last November's election, measures that local officials said drove the area's record turnout.
""You can say this isn't about the 'big lie' and all that. But it is,"" said Senator Royce West, a Democrat, in speaking against the bill on Tuesday. ""This wasn't even on the agenda before Trump started talking about election integrity.""
The bill's legislative approval came after dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state on July 12 to break the legislative quorum, delaying its passage for more than six weeks.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott pushed the bill. In a written statement shortly after it passed, he said the rules would make ""it easier to vote and harder to cheat."" 
""I look forward to signing Senate Bill 1 into law, ensuring election integrity in Texas,"" Abbott said.
Senator Bryan Hughes, a Republican who authored the bill, rejected criticism that it aimed to suppress votes. He said Texas has more days of early, in-person voting than some Democratic-run states like New York, and his bill would for the first time allow people who make mistakes on mail-in ballots to correct them.
""Anyone who tells you there is no voter fraud in Texas is telling you a very big lie,"" Hughes said on the floor of the Senate. ""We know it happens. The right to vote is too precious - it cost too much for us to leave it unprotected.""
Democrats said that zero evidence of widespread voter fraud or enough to overturn any election was presented by Republicans in either chamber during debate on the measure.
State Senator Juan ""Chuy"" Hinojosa, a Democrat, said the bill was the latest chapter in a racist legacy of U.S. voter suppression measures, which he said are rolled out whenever it appears minorities may be gaining power.
He said that is the case in Texas, where census data released this month showed the state's Latino population nearly equal with non-Hispanic whites, and forecast to surpass them by next year. 

Democratic Representative Trey Martinez said those opposed to the bill would now take the fight to the courts. 
""This law was written for one purpose - to stop certain people from voting,"" Martinez said. ""The minute the governor signs this into law, it will be met with fierce resistance in federal courts.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Tuesday defiantly rejected criticism of his decision to stick to a deadline to pull out of Afghanistan this week, a move that left up to 200 Americans in the country along with thousands of U.S.-aligned Afghan citizens.
In a televised address, Biden offered a sweeping defense of his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, saying he inherited an unstable situation from his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, and that the 20-year war ""should have ended long ago.""
""I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,"" he said, his voice rising with emotion as he spoke.[nL1N2Q2055]
Biden's handling of the withdrawal has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans and his own Democrats as well as foreign allies, punctured his job approval ratings and raised questions about his judgment.
The fate of Americans and Afghans who were not able to get on the last U.S. flights out of Kabul airport this week after the Taliban took over the capital remains a top concern.
U.S. officials believe 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan ""with some intention to leave,"" Biden said. He said most of those who remained were dual citizens and long-time residents who earlier had decided to stay, and added the United States was determined to get them out if they wanted to go. 
Many lawmakers had called on Biden to extend the Aug. 31 deadline to allow more Americans and Afghans to escape. He said on Tuesday it was not an arbitrary deadline, and that sticking to it was aimed at saving lives.
""I take responsibility for the decision. Now some say we should have started mass evacuations sooner and couldn't this ... have been done in a more orderly manner. I respectfully disagree,"" he said from the White House State Dining Room.
The White House said it had enormous leverage over the Taliban, including access to the global marketplace, that could be used to ensure Americans get out of the country. 
Biden said a deal brokered by the Trump administration last year authorized the release of 5,000 prisoners, including some of the Taliban's top war commanders.
""By the time I came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling or contesting nearly half of the country,"" he said. 
Even if evacuations had begun in June or July, Biden said there still would have been a late rush to the airport by people wanting to leave.
He criticized the ousted Afghan government's inability to fight back against swift Taliban advances, which forced the United States and its NATO allies into a hasty and humiliating exit.
Biden met now-exiled Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani in the Oval Office in June and called him an old friend; in a July call https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-call-before-afghan-collapse-biden-pressed-ghani-change-perception-2021-08-31 he promised Ghani he would ""fight hard, diplomatically, politically, economically"" to support his government.
But on Tuesday, Biden said ""the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our allies.""
The departure of the last U.S. troops this week caps two decades of military involvement in Afghanistan that Biden was determined to end.
While most Americans agreed with him, the chaotic and deadly nature of that end will present fresh challenges in the months ahead.
Biden's presidency, which had been focused on fighting the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding the economy, now faces political probes over the handling of the withdrawal as well as the logistical challenge of finding new homes for thousands of Afghans being moved to U.S. military bases.
Biden also must contend with a surge in coronavirus infections, disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and a series of difficult deadlines https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-faces-gauntlet-deadlines-afghanistan-infrastructure-budget-2021-08-25 to get signature spending measures through Congress. 
Republicans and some Democrats have expressed frustration and anger at how fast Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, the former leaders who were ousted by the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and what they call a botched withdrawal. 
Republicans are expected to use the crisis to try to derail Biden's policy and legislative agenda and as a talking point in the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans hope to take control of the Senate and House of Representatives from Biden's Democrats, which could hobble the second half of his presidential term.
Less than 40% of Americans approve of Biden's handling of the withdrawal, and three quarters wanted U.S. forces to remain in the country until all American civilians could get out, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday.

Leading House Republicans, including the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, said they wrote on Monday to Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, requesting details of the plan to repatriate Americans and evacuate others left behind.
“Congress has a right to know how these evacuations will be facilitated and conducted,” McCaul said in a statement.

172,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 07:50PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. court on Monday vacated the Trump administration's scaled back clean water rule that had limited the number of waterways that could be federally regulated because leaving it in place could harm the environment, restoring previous protections.
Arizona district court judge Rosemary Marquez said that leaving the Trump administration's Navigable Waters (NYSE:WAT) rule in place while the Biden Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers work on their own rulemaking could lead to ""serious environmental harm"" and that the Trump rulemaking process was filled with ""errors.""
President Joe Biden's administration in June announced its intent to revisit which waterways should be protected by federal regulation and begin the process of reversing the Trump-era rollback that had been urged by farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.
They had determined that the Trump Navigable Waters Rule ""significantly"" reduced clean water protections - a major concern as arid states in the west face droughts.
The remand and vacatur of the Trump water rule is a victory for the six federally recognized Native America tribes who had sued the EPA and Army Corps for passing a rule that failed to protect their waterways.
""The court recognized that the serious legal and scientific errors of the Dirty Water Rule were causing irreparable damage to our nation's waters and would continue to do so unless that Rule was vacated,"" said Janette Brimmer, attorney for Earthjustice, which represented the tribes.
The tribes include the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Tohono O'odham Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established an office to address climate change and health equity at the national level, Secretary Xavier Becerra said on Monday.
The office aims to protect vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by pollution and climate-driven disasters, including drought and wildfires, he said.
""There is no doubt that America is experiencing climate change, and there is no reason for us to doubt that we must take this on immediately, because it's not just about the climate, it's not just about our environment. It's about our health.""
Becerra spoke to reporters as Hurricane Ida knocked out power https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hurricane-ida-plunges-new-orleans-into-darkness-amid-louisiana-flooding-2021-08-30 across Louisiana and Mississippi, killing at least one person and littering roads with downed power lines and debris.
President Joe Biden declared major disasters and ordered federal assistance to bolster recovery efforts in both states. Becerra declared public health emergencies there.
Biden has made tackling the climate crisis domestically and abroad a key part of his agenda. He ordered in May the creation of a comprehensive government-wide climate-risk strategy within 120 days. Establishing the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity is part of that strategy, Becerra said.
The office will identify communities disproportionately exposed to climate hazards, address health disparities resulting from climate change, and help with regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the healthcare sector. 
Biden aims to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 
The health sector accounts for roughly 8.5% of U.S carbon emissions, and the global health sector accounts for around 4.5% of the world's emissions, said Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine.
The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250,000 deaths annually.

Dr. John Balbus, senior public health adviser to the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, is interim director of the new office.
Arsenio Mataka, formerly Becerra's environmental adviser when he was California attorney general, joined the department as senior adviser for climate change and health equity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House on Wednesday in a show of solidarity between the two countries, the White House said on Sunday.
The meeting is taking place two days later than originally scheduled, as Biden oversees the response to Hurricane Ida and the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.
""This visit will affirm the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression,"" a White House statement said.
Kyiv and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backed separatists in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, which Ukraine says has killed 14,000 people. 
The leaders will also discuss energy security as well as the White House's ""backing for President Zelenskiy's efforts to tackle corruption and implement a reform agenda based on our shared democratic values,"" the statement added.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, told Reuters that the meeting had been postponed to Wednesday ""given the unpredictability and tenseness of the situation in Afghanistan.""
The meeting comes after the Biden administration announced a deal https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-germany-deal-nord-stream-2-pipeline-draws-ire-lawmakers-both-countries-2021-07-21 last month with Germany intended partly to allay Ukrainian concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea to carry gas from Russia's Arctic region to Germany.
Kyiv fears Nord Stream 2 will be used as a geopolitical weapon by Russia and has sought guarantees over its status as a gas transit country once the pipeline becomes operational.

U.S. ties with Ukraine were in the spotlight over Zelenskiy’s unwilling involvement in events leading to the first of two impeachment trials for Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.
Trump was impeached in 2019 over what White House aides described as an effort to withhold nearly $400 million in aid and a coveted White House visit unless Ukrainian officials announced investigations into Biden, then a Democratic presidential candidate, and his businessman son, Hunter Biden.

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden shut his eyes and tilted his head back as the flag-draped cases carrying the remains of 11 American service members killed in a suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan emerged on Sunday from a military plane at a base in Delaware.
Biden, his wife, Jill, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and senior military officials stood somberly as U.S. troops carried the cases down the ramp of an Air Force C-17 aircraft at Dover (NYSE:DOV) Air Force Base. Crying could be heard and a woman collapsed as the remains were loaded into vans for transport to a facility where they will undergo identification and autopsies.
The 11 service members were among 13 U.S. troops killed in an Islamic State suicide attack on Thursday outside Kabul's airport, where the United States has been staging a massive airlift of Americans and Afghans during the past two weeks. Scores of Afghans were also killed in the attack.
None of the fallen service members was over the age of 31, and five were just 20, as old as the war itself.
Earlier on Sunday, Biden and his wife met with grieving family members of some of the fallen American service members. 
The remains of two other U.S. service members killed in the attack are being brought home privately at the request of their families.
Biden, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who have accused his administration of bungling the Aug. 31 withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan after a two-decade war in the South Asian nation.
His administration is focused on safeguarding the remaining U.S. troops in Kabul and getting the rest of the Americans as well as many vulnerable Afghans evacuated from the capital. More than 114,000 people have been airlifted in the past two weeks as part of the U.S. effort.
American forces launched a military strike in the Afghan capital on Sunday targeting a possible suicide car bomb, U.S. officials said.
""We are in a period of serious danger given what we are seeing in the intelligence,"" Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, told CNN’s ""State of the Union"" program in an interview broadcast on Sunday, before the latest strike was reported. 
""We are taking every possible measure at the direction of the president to ensure that our forces are protected on the ground even as they complete their mission of bringing in the remaining American citizens and Afghan allies."" 
Thursday's attack, which was claimed by ISIS-K https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-islamic-state-afghanistan-2021-08-26, the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, was the most lethal incident https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/didnt-need-happen-pentagon-seeks-answers-deadly-attack-2021-08-28 for U.S. service members in Afghanistan in a decade. 
It took place just outside the gates of the airport, where thousands of people have gathered to try to get a flight out the country since the Taliban returned to power on Aug. 15.
The Islamist militants' rapid advance across Afghanistan amid the withdrawal of American and allied troops combined with the chaotic scenes at the airport have presented Biden with his biggest foreign policy challenge as president.
Biden has vowed to punish those responsible for the airport bombing. The U.S. military said on Saturday it had killed two ISIS-K militants in a drone attack in eastern Afghanistan.
Sullivan said the two ""are individuals involved in the facilitation and planning and production of explosive devices and they are part of the larger network of ISIS-K."" 
U.S. DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE 'UNLIKELY'
The United States has evacuated nearly 5,500 American citizens from Afghanistan since Aug. 14, including 50 in the last day, and was still working to get about 250 American citizens in the country onto evacuation flights, a State Department spokesman said.
NATO, the European Union and 97 other countries signed on to a joint statement with the United States on Sunday saying they will continue to issue travel documents to at-risk Afghans and expect the Taliban to stick to its commitment to allow those people to leave.
The United States was unlikely to have any diplomats in the country after the Tuesday deadline for the withdrawal of NATO forces, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. 
""In terms of having an on-the-ground diplomatic presence on September 1st, that's not likely to happen,"" Blinken said.
Blinken later spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who urged Washington to help the new regime in Kabul that is likely to be led by the Taliban, including on countering terrorism, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement.
Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the administration had failed to plan for a Taliban takeover, and criticized Blinken for giving an overly positive view of the evacuation effort.

""Their plan has basically been happy talk. People have died and people are going to die because President Biden decided to rely on happy talk instead of reality,"" Sasse told ABC's ""This Week.""
Other members of Congress have vowed to probe what went awry in Afghanistan. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat, said earlier this month his panel will hold a hearing on U.S. policy toward Afghanistan ""including the Trump administration’s flawed negotiations with (the) Taliban, and the Biden administration's flawed execution of the U.S. withdrawal.""

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom and his supporters are stepping up their fight against a Republican-backed recall with a barrage of door knocks, text messages and outreach to communities of color as opinion polls show the Democrat in danger of losing. 
The group Voto Latino exclusively told Reuters it plans to spend about $1 million ahead of the Sept. 14 recall vote to try to persuade 600,000 young Latinos to cast ballots for Newsom, highlighting his need to spur more enthusiasm among Black and Latino voters.
Democrats outnumber Republicans in California more than two-to-one. President Joe Biden won the state by nearly 30 percentage points last year. Half of the state's registered voters and 91% of Democrats said in a July 27 poll by the University of California, Berkeley, Institute for Governmental Studies that they want to retain the first-term governor.
But a perfect storm of issues energizing Republicans - and complacency among Democrats who think the governor has it in the bag - has the recall election looking much closer than expected.
Like Democrats across the country, Newsom has taken heat throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from opponents of public health shutdowns, mask mandates and school closures. He also is grappling with a rise in cases of homelessness and homicides, extreme drought and devastating wildfires.
A successful recall would serve as a wake-up call for Democrats already facing the threat of losing their majorities in Congress in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, said Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio.
Maviglio served as press secretary for Democrat Gray Davis, ousted as California's governor by Hollywood action star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the state's last recall in 2003.
Maviglio said Democrats must take the election seriously to avoid the same fate for Newsom, a former lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.
""Democrats need a slap in the face to get off the sofa and fill out that form,"" he said.
TURNOUT KEY
The Patriot Coalition, a group angered by Newsom's policies on immigration and crime, spearheaded the effort to remove him. Their campaign gained steam as frustration mounted over Newsom's pandemic policies and a judge granted them extra time to get enough signatures to put the recall on a ballot.
Voters will be asked to make two separate decisions - whether Newsom should be removed, and who should replace him. 
If Newsom is recalled, he will almost certainly be succeeded by a Republican with comparatively little statewide support. The winner needs only a plurality of votes to become governor, and just one little-known Democrat is among the replacement choices.
Conservative talk show host Larry Elder leads recent polls, followed by businessman John Cox and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. 
Newsom goes into the final weeks of the race with a war chest of more than $51 million, campaign finance records show, compared to about $6 million for those seeking to unseat him.
Keenly aware that turnout could decide the special election, Newsom's team is rolling out new daily messages predicting dire consequences for Democratic priorities such as abortion rights, immigration and other issues if he is removed from office.
A Friday rally with Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California senator, was canceled after a deadly attack outside the Kabul airport killed dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members.
""There are no swing voters in this election,"" said Newsom adviser Nathan Click. ""There's no one who's choosing between yes and no. The 'swing voters' are all Democrats who are choosing between voting and not voting.""
Just 36% of registered voters told pollsters at the University of California, Berkeley, last month that they favored removing the governor, with 51% opposed.
But when researchers dug deeper, they found that very few Democrats were planning to vote - making the race exceedingly close with 47% of the most likely voters favoring the recall and 50% opposed.
""What we found was an astounding gap between likely and registered voters,"" said Eric Schickler, co-director of the institute that conducted the poll.
The state sent mail-in ballots to all Californians who are registered to vote. Data released last week showed Democrats had returned their ballots by a rate of two-to-one compared to Republicans, buoying Democrats' hopes that their voters were beginning to understand the stakes.
But analyst Paul Mitchell, whose firm Political Data studied the returns, said the early results could reflect Republicans' skepticism of voting by mail rather than heightened Democratic interest in the recall.
Former President Donald Trump's repeated false accusations that mail-in voting was rife with fraud caused a shift in voting tendencies among Republicans that others in his party are now trying to counter.
Political strategist Matt Shupe, the Republican Party chairman for Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he sent 35,000 text messages last week to members urging them to return their ballots.
""They need to not be worried, and they need to go and mail in the ballots,"" he said. 
Most of the ballots cast so far came from white voters, Mitchell's analysis found. Newsom also needs to persuade voters in communities of color to turn out if he wants to keep his job.
Groups including the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project; Black Women for Wellness; the Chinese Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Association Action Fund; and the immigrant rights group CHIRLA are planning get-out-the-vote activities such as canvassing and phone banks.

Voto Latino, which targets voters ages 18 to 34, has sent out text messages and digital advertisements urging people to vote, said Ameer Patel, vice president of programs.
In coming days, he said, the messages will take on a more urgent tone, warning that voting rights, immigration and climate could be impacted if Newsom is replaced by a Republican.

""The Taliban have both communicated privately and publicly that they will allow for safe passage,"" said Jake Sullivan, U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, in a CBS TV interview set to be broadcast Sunday.
U.S. forces are set to wind up their evacuation mission in Kabul before a Tuesday deadline set by Biden after the Taliban took control of much of the country. That effort has been complicated by the threat of more attacks like Thursday's blast https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-launches-drone-strike-islamic-state-after-afghan-airport-blast-2021-08-28 that killed scores of Afghans and 13 American troops.
""After August 31st, we will make sure there is safe passage for any American citizen, any legal permanent resident,"" Sullivan said, according to a transcript of CBS' ""Face the Nation.""
""And yes, we will ensure the safe passage of those Afghans who helped us to continue coming out after the 31st of August.""
Such safe passage would suggest some form of ongoing cooperation between Washington and the Taliban, which now controls a country it ran from 1996 to 2001, before being toppled by the United States in retaliation for providing safe haven to the al Qaeda militants who planned the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
""Our current plan is not to have an ongoing embassy presence in Afghanistan as of September 1st,"" said Sullivan.

He said more strikes and ""other operations"" are under consideration to retaliate for Thursday's attack, which was claimed by ISIS-K https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/what-is-islamic-state-afghanistan-2021-08-26, the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State and was the most lethal incident https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/didnt-need-happen-pentagon-seeks-answers-deadly-attack-2021-08-28 for U.S. service members in Afghanistan in a decade.
Sullivan also said U.S. officials do not believe that ""the relevant terrorist groups in Afghanistan"" have an advanced ability to plot attacks abroad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Thousands of protesters rallied in Washington and other U.S. cities on Saturday to demand protections for voting rights, aiming to pressure lawmakers to pass legislation to counter a wave of ballot restrictions in Republican-led states.
Held on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic 1963 March on Washington, organizers of the ""March On For Washington And Voting Rights"" stressed that the moves to curb voting access would disproportionately affect people of color.
In Washington, protesters holding ""Black Lives Matter"" flags and signs calling for federal legislation marched from McPherson Square to the final meeting point at the National Mall, where a series of civil rights leaders delivered remarks not far from where King gave his iconic ""I Have a Dream"" speech 58 years ago.
More than 20,000 people participated in the march, the Rev. Al Sharpton estimated in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post. Rallies also took place in Phoenix, Miami and dozens of other cities. 
Activist Carolyn Ruff, 74, said she made the trip from Chicago to Washington to push for the passage of a federal law that would restore key protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices. 
The bill, named after the late civil rights hero and longtime congressman John Lewis, was approved in the U.S. House of Representatives this week but faces poor prospects in the Senate due to rules that allow a minority to block legislation.
Lewis' youngest brother urged Republican senators to put aside partisanship and pass the law, saying that fundamental rights secured in the 1960's were at stake.
""Just think, 58 years later we are still fighting for those same rights. Something about that just don't sound right,"" said Grant Lewis told the crowd. ""It doesn't matter what side of the aisle you are on. It's more important to be on the right side of history.""
After Democrat Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Republican lawmakers in many states reined in the use of dropboxes and mail-in voting. The moves came after Republican former President Donald Trump tried unsuccessfully to overturn the election based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.
So far this year, at least 18 states have enacted laws restricting voter access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
In addition to the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a more expansive voting reform bill was passed by the House earlier this year, but Senate Republicans blocked it in June, saying voting rules should be left to the states.
The lack of meaningful Republican support appears set to doom any legislation in the Senate, which is divided 50-50 along party lines and where filibuster rules mean Democrats need to secure the votes of 10 Republicans to advance measures.
Kathleen Kennedy, 27, said she joined the Washington march after reading about a law in Texas that had garnered national attention after Democratic lawmakers fled the state in an effort to deny a quorum needed for Republicans to pass it.
The bill, which would outlaw drive-through and 24-hour voting locations and add new identification requirements to mail-in voting, among other restrictions, was approved by the state's House of Representatives on Friday.

""So many of these laws are getting passed. Elections are coming up, elections will be impacted by these laws,"" said Kennedy, a resident of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland. ""It's worth ending the filibuster.""
Some speakers also promoted the idea of making the nation's capital the next state. A coalition of groups advocating for Washington, D.C., statehood, called 51 for 51, was one of the leading organizers of Saturday's event.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven U.S. Capitol Police officers on Thursday sued former President Donald Trump, alleging that he conspired with far-right extremist groups to provoke the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Congress.
The officers in a lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C. federal court allege the attack was culmination of months of rhetoric from Trump, who they say knew of the potential for violence on and actively encouraged it in hopes of halting the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.
The lawsuit alleges Trump conspired with the extremist groups The Proud Boys and The Oathkeepers, as well as far-right political operatives including Roger Stone and Ali Alexander, who promoted Trump's speech near the White House right before the Capitol attack.
""Trump, in concert with other Defendants, deliberately and persistently made and encouraged false claims of election fraud to discredit the outcome of the election and disingenuously incite outrage among his supporters,"" the lawsuit alleged.
The case is the latest in a string of civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump accountable for the siege of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.
Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than a hundred police officers were injured.

Ron Fischetti, a personal lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a similar lawsuit filed by Democratic U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, Trump has argued that his actions were free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and that he cannot be held liable under U.S. civil law because he was acting within his capacity as president on Jan. 6.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Wednesday sanctioned Sidney Powell and other lawyers who sued in Michigan to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory over Donald Trump, and suggested they might deserve to lose their law licenses.
In a highly anticipated written ruling, U.S. District Judge Linda Parker in Detroit said the pro-Trump lawyers, including Powell and prominent litigator Lin Wood, should have investigated the Republican former president's voter fraud claims more carefully before filing what Parker called a ""frivolous"" lawsuit.
Parker, who dismissed the Michigan suit last December, formally requested that disciplinary bodies investigate whether the pro-Trump lawyers should have their law licenses revoked. The judge also ordered the lawyers to attend classes on the ethical and legal requirements for filing legal claims.
""This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,"" Parker said in her decision, adding that the case ""was never about fraud - it was about undermining the People's faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so.""
The judge said Powell, Wood, and other lawyers who worked with them ""have scorned their oath, flouted the rules, and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary along the way.""
Powell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wood said on the social media platform Telegram that he ""had nothing to do with"" the lawsuit and would appeal.
Powell represented Trump's campaign when he tried to overturn last Nov. 3's presidential election in the courts. His campaign distanced itself from Powell after she claimed without evidence at a Nov. 19 news conference that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.
In a written decision last December, Parker said Powell's voter fraud claims were ""nothing but speculation and conjecture"" and that, in any event, the Texas lawyer waited too long to file her lawsuit.
Powell asserted in a court hearing last month that she had carefully vetted her election fraud claims before suing, and that the only way to test them would have been at trial or a hearing on evidence gathered. Her co-counsel repeatedly called for such an evidentiary hearing.
Starting in January, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and other government lawyers asked the judge to discipline the pro-Trump lawyers, saying they had filed a frivolous lawsuit full of typos and factual errors and should be held accountable.
""I'm pleased to see that the Court has ensured there is accountability for the attorneys who perpetuated meritless arguments in court,"" Nessel said in a statement on Wednesday.

""I appreciate the unmistakable message (the judge) sends with this ruling - those who vow to uphold the Constitution must answer for abandoning that oath.""
Parker on Thursday also ordered the pro-Trump lawyers to reimburse election officials for the cost of defending the lawsuit. The amount will be determined by the judge in the coming months, said David Fink, a lawyer for the City of Detroit who requested sanctions, in an interview.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol issued its first demands for documents from government agencies on Wednesday, including communications involving some of former President Donald Trump's closest advisers and family.
The House of Representatives Select Committee asked for White House communications records on and leading up to Jan. 6, The panel also made extensive requests for material from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Interior and Justice, and the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
The committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, gave the agencies two weeks - until Sept. 9 - to produce the materials. It expects to make additional requests as the investigation moves forward.
""Our Constitution provides for a peaceful transfer of power, and this investigation seeks to evaluate threats to that process, identify lessons learned and recommend laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations necessary to protect our republic in the future,"" Thompson wrote in a letter to the National Archives and Records Administration, which holds records from the Trump administration, and the seven other government entities.
Trump, in a statement late on Wednesday, called the committee's request ""a partisan sham and waste of taxpayer dollars.""
Mobs of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was meeting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory, and delayed that process for several hours as then-Vice President Mike Pence, members of Congress, staff and journalists fled from rioters. 
Nearly 600 people have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack.
The panel said it wanted information on the attack itself and the run-up to the events of the day, including the gathering and dissemination of intelligence, security preparations and the role agencies played in defending the Capitol.
It asked for documents related to planning for and concerns about violence surrounding the rally on Jan. 6 where Trump made a falsehood-laden speech before his followers headed for the Capitol.
The Select Committee also requested information about personnel changes between the Nov. 3, 2020, election and Jan. 20, 2021, when Biden took office, and asked for documents and communications about possible attempts by Trump to remain in office despite losing the election.
TRUMP AIDES AND FAMILY
Among the requests were documents and communications about Trump's allegations of election fraud, involving Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the members of his legal team including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Kurt Olsen.
The letters also ask for documents and communications related to members of his family, some of whom had official roles at the White House. Those included first lady Melania Trump, his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, daughter Ivanka, daughter-in-law Lara and Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner.
House Democrats formed the committee, despite objections from Trump's fellow Republicans in the House, to investigate the assault on the Capitol. It was the worst violence at the seat of the U.S. government since the British invasion during the War of 1812.
Representative Liz Cheney, one of the two Republican select committee members, was stripped of her leadership role in her caucus after denouncing Trump's allegations that Biden's election victory was not legitimate.
Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot to death by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than 100 police officers were injured.

The document requests came a month after the committee held its first hearing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-who-defended-us-capitol-testify-riot-probes-first-hearing-2021-07-27, at which four police officers who had helped repel the attack described being beaten, taunted with racial insults and fearing they might die as they struggled to protect the building.
The committee has not yet scheduled additional hearings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Retired football star Herschel Walker on Wednesday launched a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from Georgia that leaned heavily on his personal rise from poverty to sporting greatness, as well as his support from former President Donald Trump.
Walker, who has never before run for elective office, will seek the Republican nomination to take on first-term Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock next year. The contest could play a critical role in determining whether President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats retain their razor-thin Senate majority.
His newly unveiled campaign website featured a video that highlighted his sports achievements but included little on policy views other than saying, ""I believe in smaller government, a strong military, personal responsibility and making sure all people have an opportunity to pursue their dreams."" He formally filed paperwork https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/former-football-star-herschel-walker-launches-us-senate-bid-2021-08-24 to run on Tuesday.
The website also included a photo of Walker on a stage with Trump, who in recent months has urged him to run. Walker in the 1980s played for a professional football team owned by Trump. 
Walker in December backed Trump's false claims of widespread election fraud and urged Georgia's election officials to avoid certifying Biden's victory in the state.
Walker, 59, on Wednesday released a statement to local media saying that his personal successes - growing from ""a poor kid"" to be a business owner and winner of the 1982 Heisman Trophy https://www.heisman.com/heisman-winners/herschel-walker while at the University of Georgia signifying the nation's outstanding collegiate football player - were examples of an upward mobility in America that he said was slipping away. 
Trump's backing may deter other Republicans from seeking the nomination, but observers said Walker could face an uphill battle against Warnock in the November 2022 general election.
""I'm not sure he's going to be the Republicans' best candidate to win in November,"" said University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock. ""If he is just a football hero from 40 years ago, for some part of the electorate that could work well but swing voters may not necessarily think that makes you a good senator.""
Walker did not respond to requests for comment. 
Democrats cheered his entry in the race, with a major fundraising group for the party, the American Bridge 21st Century political committee, on Tuesday predicting a ""full-bore nasty primary"" after another Republican in the Senate race released a video taunting Walker.

Trump, who has yet to formally endorse Walker, has thrown his support to more than a dozen congressional candidates, including several challenging Republican incumbents who joined Democrats in an impeachment vote on a charge that Trump incited insurrection in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot by his supporters.
The former president has a mixed track record of late in endorsements. A coal lobbyist backed by Trump this month won a crowded primary in an Ohio contest for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, a week after his preferred candidate for a Texas seat in the House lost to another Republican.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday that the United States would be on track to meet its climate goals in the next decade, with measures introduced in two infrastructure bills along with efforts by states and the federal government.
President Joe Biden in April hiked the U.S. target for slashing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions to 50%-52% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
Schumer said in a letter to fellow lawmakers that climate measures in the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-setback-us-house-democrats-near-deal-biden-agenda-2021-08-24 will achieve emissions reductions of about 45% by 2030. Actions being planned by the Biden administration and states including New York, California and Hawaii would help hit the 50% target, he added.
""The bottom line is this: we have very little time to prevent the most horrendous outcomes for our children and grandchildren,"" Schumer said in the letter. ""But if we act 
now and act boldly, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change and own the 21st century clean energy economy.""
Two measures in particular in the bills, he said, would help put the United States on the path to dramatically slash emissions: the Clean Electricity Payment Program (CEPP) and the Senate Finance Committee’s tax package on clean energy and vehicles. 
Both measures are in the wider bill that Democrats in the Senate hope to pass over the next few months using a process called budget reconciliation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senates-reconciliation-process-its-not-way-it-sounds-2021-06-16, which bypasses the chamber's usual rules requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. 
The CEPP is a system of payments and penalties that aims to push utilities to increase power generation from clean energy sources including wind, solar and nuclear power. Many lawmakers and the White House had originally favored a Clean Electricity Standard, which is similar but includes mandates. 
The tax package would extend tax breaks for clean energy and clean transportation fuels. It could also abolish tax breaks for oil, gas and coal production - which would be a tough sell for Democrats from states dependent on fossil fuel revenue.

As Congress debates the climate measures, wildfires have been tearing through Western states https://www.reuters.com/world/us/smoke-us-west-wildfires-leaves-easterners-gasping-2021-07-20 while floods killed at least 18 people in Tennessee https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-president-biden-approves-federal-aid-tennessee-after-flooding-2021-08-24 - examples of extreme weather impact that will become more frequent and severe with climate change.
Schumer also said he looked forward to seeing other ideas from lawmakers for cutting emissions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied President Joe Biden's bid to rescind an immigration policy implemented by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that forced thousands of asylum seekers to stay in Mexico awaiting U.S. hearings.
The court, with three liberal justices dissenting, rejected the Biden administration's effort to block a Texas-based judge's ruling requiring the government to revive Trump's ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program.
The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump. 
The brief order by the justices means that U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling now goes into effect.
The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it regretted the Supreme Court's decision and would continue to ""vigorously challenge"" the district court ruling. As the appeals process continues, it said, the agency will comply with the order ""in good faith"" and has begun discussions with Mexico.
The court's decision referenced its 2020 ruling that thwarted Trump's bid to end a program introduced by Democratic former President Barack Obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants - often called “Dreamers” - who entered the United States illegally as children.
Both cases concern whether the government followed the correct legal process in unwinding a previous administration's policy.
Biden, who has sought since taking office in January to reverse many of Trump's hardline immigration policies, rolled back the MPP program. Republican-led Texas and Missouri challenged the Democratic president's move.
Biden's administration turned to the Supreme Court after Kacsmaryk ruled that the Trump policy https://www.reuters.com/world/us/court-orders-biden-reinstate-trumps-remain-mexico-policy-2021-08-14 would have to be reinstated and the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 denied the government's request for a delay.
The 5th Circuit's decision said the Biden administration must implement the MPP program in ""good faith,"" which leaves the government some discretion in how to move forward.
Democrats and immigration advocates criticized MPP, saying the policy subjected migrants, primarily from Central America, to dangerous conditions in Mexican border cities.
Trump's administration cited a ""security and humanitarian crisis"" https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/01/24/migrant-protection-protocols along the U.S.-Mexican border in refusing to allow migrants seeking asylum, because of a fear of persecution in their home countries, to enter the United States ahead of hearings before immigration judges.
Reacting to the Supreme Court's order, Omar Jadwat, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the Trump policy during the previous administration, said the Biden administration must ""take all steps available to fully end this illegal program, including by re-terminating it with a fuller explanation."" 

Arrests of migrants caught crossing the U.S. southern border have reached 20-year highs in recent months, a development that Republicans blame on Biden's reversal of MPP and other Trump immigration policies.
Biden's administration has left in place a separate Trump-era order that lets U.S. border authorities, because of the COVID-19 public health crisis, rapidly expel migrants caught at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden told G7 leaders on Tuesday that the United States is on pace to complete the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan by Aug. 31 depending on cooperation from the Taliban, the White House said.
Biden sent thousands of U.S. troops to the Kabul airport after the Taliban militant group took over the city and much of the country less than two weeks ago. 
The nearly 6,000 U.S. troops are helping to evacuate American citizens and at-risk Afghans and to protect the airport so other countries can evacuate their citizens as well. 
The Pentagon made the recommendation that Biden stick to his Aug. 31 target date on Monday, U.S. officials said.
""During a meeting this morning with the G7 leaders, the President conveyed that our mission in Kabul will end based on the achievement of our objectives. He confirmed we are currently on pace to finish by August 31st,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
Biden told the other G7 leaders that completion of the mission by Aug. 31 ""depends on continued coordination with the Taliban, including continued access for evacuees to the airport,"" she said.
""In addition, the President has asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timeline should that become necessary,"" Psaki said.
U.S. officials told Reuters earlier that the United States has been in regular contact with the Taliban and officials are telling the group that the timeline is contingent on Taliban cooperation.
Biden sent CIA Director William Burns to meet Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul on Monday in the highest level official encounter since the militant group took over the Afghan capital, a U.S. official and a source familiar with government activity told Reuters on Tuesday. 
A congressional source said Burns and Baradar had discussed the Aug. 31 date. 
The Pentagon recommendation reflects increasing security concerns at the Kabul airport, where American citizens and at-risk Afghans are being evacuated.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was increasing concern about suicide bombings by Islamic State militants at the airport.
One official said it was no longer a question of if, but when, militants would attack and the priority was to get out before it happened.
Biden was set to speak later on Tuesday. 
The Pentagon earlier said that it was confident the military can evacuate all Americans who want to leave. Whether thousands of at-risk Afghans would all be evacuated was unclear.
""We're absolutely still aiming towards the end of the month,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said, while adding that the Pentagon may need additional bases to house evacuees from Afghanistan.
Kirby said ""several thousand"" Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan but declined to give a more specific figure. He also said he was unable to provide the percentage of Americans in Afghanistan who have now been evacuated.

Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers said on Tuesday they wanted all foreign evacuations from the country completed by Aug. 31 and they would not agree to an extension as Group of Seven leaders met to discuss the crisis.
Western troops have been working frantically to get foreigners and Afghans onto planes and out of the country and Biden has faced growing pressure from allies to negotiate more time for the airlift.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a voting rights measure that Democrats say would help counteract a wave of voting restrictions in Republican-led states, but it faced slim chances of passing the Senate.
The House voted 219-212 on the bill to restore key protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices. The measure is named after the late Representative John Lewis, a civil rights hero who died last year. 
But the outlook in the Senate was poor. Only one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, has expressed support for the proposal, but Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to help advance it in the chamber, which is divided 50-50 along party lines.
At least 18 states have enacted laws so far this year that restrict voter access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
Proponents of the measures say they are necessary to counter fraud, which Republican former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed led to his 2020 election defeat. Multiple courts, state election bodies and members of his own administration have rejected that claim.
Democrats have accused Republicans at the state level of enacting such measures to make it harder for racial minorities who tend to support Democratic candidates to cast ballots.
The U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and again in 2021. The House-passed bill would seek to redress the court's objections with an updated formula for which jurisdictions are subject to additional federal scrutiny, said Democratic Representative Terri Sewell, the bill's sponsor.
Democrats argued that voter suppression is alive and well, pointing to states such as Texas where the state legislature has been considering limiting early voting hours, adding new identification requirements to mail-in voting and empowering partisan poll watchers.
But Republicans accused Democrats of attempting a federal takeover of election laws.
""If it's easier to vote today than at any time in our history, and more Americans are voting than ever before, then why are Democrats going to such extreme measures to ensure a federal takeover of elections?"" Representative Rodney Davis said.
A more expansive voting reform bill was also passed by the House this year but was blocked by Senate Republicans in June. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said voting rules should be left to the states.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this month that the chamber would consider more voting rights legislation in September. Fearing a similar outcome, voting rights activists want all 50 Senate Democrats to unite in a bid to change Senate rules requiring 60 votes to advance legislation. 
At least one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin, has said he will not go along with changing the rules to help pass a voting rights bill.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's first female governor, Kathy Hochul, was sworn into office on Tuesday, promising to change the state's political culture and work to ensure that New Yorkers ""believe in their government again.""
Publicly sworn in Tuesday morning by the state's highest judge, Hochul takes over the governor's office in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal that drove her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, from power. She promised that ""changing the culture of Albany"" would be a top priority. 
Hours earlier, Hochul, a Democrat from Buffalo who turns 63 this week, officially became New York state's 57th governor in a private ceremony.
Hochul pledged to strengthen the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and speed direct aid to residents in need, all with an eye, she said, toward winning back the trust of the people of New York in their elected officials.
""I want people to believe in their government again,"" she said.
Cuomo - who in his final public remarks on Monday complained https://www.reuters.com/world/us/unfair-unjust-bitter-cuomo-says-farewell-new-yorkers-2021-08-23 the state investigation that concluded that the Democratic governor had sexually harassed women who worked for him was unfair - was known for a bruising approach to political dealmaking that left him standing alone amid calls for his resignation.
Hochul, whose resume https://www.reuters.com/world/us/kathy-hochul-become-first-woman-lead-new-york-2021-08-10 ranges from town board in upstate New York to the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, vowed to bring an entirely different style to the governor's office. 
""I'm looking forward to a fresh, collaborative approach. That's how I've always conducted myself. There will be nothing new for me,"" she said, speaking to reporters after the ceremony at the State Capitol in Albany. 
She said she's already working with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose feud with Cuomo often led to sharp, veiled criticisms. 

""No blindsiding,"" vowed Hochul, who said de Blasio called her on Monday to give her a heads up that moments later he would be announcing a vaccine mandate for all New York City teachers. Indicating she is considering a similar mandate for all teachers in the state, she said she would be making an announcement, possibly later on Tuesday.
""I have a chance to assemble all the stakeholders now that I am officially governor and I have the ability to work with them. I'll also be discussing this with our leadership in the Assembly and the Senate,"" Hochul said. ""This is what collaboration looks like.""

(Reuters) -Authorities said on Tuesday they have accounted for dozens of people who were previously listed as missing after the weekend's deadly flooding in Tennessee, where the full scope of damage is coming into view.
Officials also lowered the number of those killed by the storm - which destroyed homes and businesses, swept cars off the road, and left streets awash in mud - dropping the estimate to 18 from 21. 
As residents have gotten in touch with authorities, or found family members and friends at the local reunification center, only three people remain missing. Earlier, officials had put the number of missing at 50.
""Three is too many,"" Waverly Public Safety Chief Grant Gillespie said at an afternoon news conference.
The scope of the damage came into sharper focus in hardest hit Humphreys County, as rescue teams continue to search house-to-house with trained dogs looking for victims.
""We've got 100 to 125 homes off the foundation, twisted and some that are gone. And that's just the ones we've seen,"" Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said.
Hundreds of other homes were water-damaged and uninhabitable, officials said.

Displaced residents found shelter with relatives, local churches and with housing provided by the American Red Cross, the sheriff said.
Officials who had been seeking federal aid were granted it late on Monday as President Joe Biden declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee and ordered federal aid, the White House said in a statement.

Fruman, born in Belarus, and co-defendant Lev Parnas, a Ukraine-born businessman, previously pleaded not guilty to charges including that they concealed a $325,000 donation to support former U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election.
Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to Trump, has not been charged and has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer said on Monday that Fruman's plea would have no effect on Giuliani.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to advance key parts of President Joe Biden's agenda, after moderates and progressives reached a compromise allowing them to move forward on the multitrillion-dollar plans.
In a party-line 220-212 vote, it approved a $3.5 trillion budget framework to advance progressives' ambitious plans to expand child care and other social programs, and agreed to vote by Sept. 27 on a $1 trillion Senate-passed infrastructure bill that is a top priority for moderate Democrats.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said her chamber would work with the Senate to nail down the details of the larger $3.5 trillion budget.
Biden's fellow Democrats have little room for error as they try to approve the two massive spending initiatives in the House and Senate, where the party holds razor-thin majorities.
""Passing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country,"" Pelosi said. ""Now more than ever, it also has to be a part of protecting our environment.""
Pelosi had hoped to quickly approve the $3.5 trillion budget outline https://www.reuters.com/world/us/paid-leave-clean-energy-preschool-democrats-35-trln-plan-2021-08-09, which would enable lawmakers to begin filling in the details on the sweeping package that would boost spending on child care, education and other social programs and raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations.
But centrist Democrats, led by Representative Josh Gottheimer, had refused to go along, saying the House must first pass the infrastructure bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-us-senates-bipartisan-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-03, which has already won approval by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate.
Liberals, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have said they will not support the smaller package without the larger one, fearing they will lose leverage.
""These negotiations are never easy,"" said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern.
Pelosi said the House would work with the Senate on the details of the massive budget outline, which Senate Democrats plan to pass using a maneuver that gets around that chamber's normal rules requiring 60 of the 100 senators to agree to pass most legislation.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy blasted Pelosi and other Democrats with bare-knuckle partisan rhetoric for working on an agreement to secure Biden’s domestic spending priorities and voting legislation without addressing the crisis in Afghanistan. 
""Maybe in your caucus, you think it is a great day for you and the Democrats,"" McCarthy said. ""It's an embarrassing day to America, it’s an embarrassing day for this floor and it's embarrassing that you would even move forward with it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser on Monday said he had not heard the president discuss any plans to fire, reassign or ask for the resignation of any White House or U.S. officials over the situation in Afghanistan.
""I have not heard him say so,"" Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House, when asked if Biden had plans to take disciplinary action against U.S. officials after the Taliban's lightning-fast takeover of the country this month.
Biden has repeatedly defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and said he took responsibility for making the decision to end the 20-year war.
Biden has said that the Taliban’s march into Kabul unfolded more quickly than anticipated, raising questions about a possible intelligence failure.
Sullivan said Biden was considering whether to extend his Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan, amid mounting pressure to do so from Britain, France and other U.S. allies.

He said U.S. officials were in daily contact with the Taliban and U.S. allies about the issue, but saw substantial progress in the military operation to evacuate U.S. citizens, people from third countries and vulnerable Afghans.
""The president will make his own determination,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump launched on Saturday a sustained attack on President Joe Biden's handling of the retreat of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, which he called ""the greatest foreign policy humiliation"" in U.S. history.
Trump, a Republican who has dangled the possibility of running again for president in 2024, has repeatedly blamed Biden, a Democrat, for Afghanistan's fall to the Islamist militant Taliban, even though the U.S. withdrawal that triggered the collapse was negotiated by his own administration. 
""Biden’s botched exit from Afghanistan is the most astonishing display of gross incompetence by a nation’s leader, perhaps at any time,"" Trump said at a boisterous rally packed with his supporters near Cullman, Alabama.
Taliban leaders are trying to hammer out a new government after their forces swept across the country as U.S.-led forces pulled out after two decades, with the Western-backed government and military crumbling.
For his part, Biden has criticized the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from Trump.
At the rally, Trump blamed the situation on Biden not having followed the plan his administration came up with and bemoaned U.S. personnel and equipment being left behind as troops withdrew.
""This is not a withdrawal. This was a total a surrender,"" he said.

Trump said the Taliban, with whom he had negotiated, respected him. He suggested the quick takeover of Afghanistan would not have happened if he was still in office.
""We could have gotten out with honor,"" Trump added. ""We should have gotten out with honor. And instead we got out with the exact opposite of honor.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Friday charged a North Carolina man who claimed to have a bomb in his truck near the U.S. Capitol the day before, leading to a five-hour standoff with law enforcement.
Floyd Ray Roseberry was charged with threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to use an explosive device.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui ordered a mental competency evaluation for Roseberry after he said he could not understand the proceedings against him because he had not been able to take his medications for blood pressure and his ""mind.""
""My memory isn't that well, sir,"" Roseberry said, adding that his wife has power of attorney over his medical issues and he did not know the names of his medications.
Roseberry, 51, spread alarm at the Capitol and prompted the evacuation of nearby government buildings on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/capitol-police-investigating-suspicious-vehicle-near-us-library-congress-2021-08-19. He live-streamed threats on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) about having a possible bomb while holding what appeared to be a metal cannister on his lap.
""The revolution's on, it's here,"" Roseberry said in the video. ""I'm ready to die for the cause.""
Facebook later suspended his account and removed the video. 
Roseberry surrendered to law enforcement without incident, and police said they found possible bomb-making materials but no bombs inside a truck.
A law enforcement official said there was no evidence so far suggesting anyone else was involved in or conspired with Roseberry in staging Thursday's incident.
During Friday's virtual hearing, Faruqui appointed Roseberry a federal defender, and Roseberry told him: ""I'm willing to do whatever you ask.""

In a sworn statement, an FBI agent said that a local law enforcement official in Cleveland County, North Carolina contacted the bureau on Aug. 18 to warn about Roseberry. A relative called with concerns that Roseberry had ""expressed anti-government views and an intent to travel to Virginia or Washington, D.C. to conduct acts of violence.""
Crystal Roseberry, the man's ex-wife, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday she had divorced him more than eight years ago, saying he made violent threats against her and had multiple mental illnesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fundraising arm of the U.S. Democratic Party raised more money in July than its Republican counterpart, helped by big contributions from billionaire donors including investor George Soros and former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chief Executive Eric Schmidt.
Disclosures filed on Friday with the Federal Election Commission showed the Democratic National Committee raised about $13.1 million last month, above the $12.9 million raised by the Republican National Committee.
The RNC still had more money in the bank at the close of the month - $79 million compared to nearly $68 million held by the DNC - although Democrats narrowed the gap.
Raising more money does not necessarily translate into Election Day victory, but a big bank account helps U.S. parties support their candidates' campaigns and pays for ads and polling.
Democrats have narrow majorities in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, and losing control of either in the November 2022 contests would be a blow to Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda. 
Friday's disclosures showed that Schmidt - a Silicon Valley titan who has made personnel recommendations to Biden's White House for Department of Defense appointments, according to a Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tech-biden-insight/big-techs-stealth-push-to-influence-the-biden-administration-idUSKBN28V170 - gave more than $360,000 to the DNC in July.
Soros, a famed investor and a bogeyman of conservatives due to his status as a major donor for liberal causes, gave the DNC at least $250,000 in July.
While the DNC has raised slightly more than the RNC this year, Republicans have been spending money more aggressively. 

It also spent more in July, shelling out $1 million to JDB Marketing Inc, a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina firm that specializes in direct mail fundraising.
Some of the DNC's largest outlays during the month were also to support fundraising efforts, including more than $1.1 million to RWT Production, a direct mail firm from Annandale, Virginia.

(Reuters) - The Pennsylvania lawmaker and ally of former President Donald Trump who has been pushing for a ""forensic investigation"" into the 2020 election has been stripped of his role overseeing the probe, the state's top Republican senator said on Friday. 
The announcement could mark the end of efforts by state Senator Doug Mastriano, who launched his investigation last month without the explicit backing of Republican leadership in Harrisburg.
In a statement Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman accused Mastriano, who is seen as a potential candidate for governor in 2022, of focusing on the ""politics and showmanship"" of the election probe rather than its substance. 
Mastriano, for his part, accused Corman of stonewalling his investigation.
Corman said there was still a need for a ""full investigatory audit of recent elections"" in Pennsylvania and appointed Cris Dush, a senator who in June accompanied Mastriano on a tour of a contentious election audit in Arizona, to oversee the effort.
""We need someone to lead this effort who is more interested in real results than grandstanding at rallies,"" Corman said.
Corman's move comes after the three counties targeted by Mastriano -- Tioga, York and Philadelphia -- said they would not comply with his request to hand over voting equipment and other materials. They all cited a warning from the state's top election official against providing third-party access to machines.
After receiving death threats online last month, the all-Republican board of commissioners in Tioga criticized Mastriano, saying he led people to believe they were trying to conceal something in not complying with the probe. 
Mastriano, who has been a leading promoter of Trump's baseless stolen-election claims, said Corman prevented the committee he chairs from holding a meeting to vote on subpoenas needed to compel the counties.

Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the November election, and all counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud to put in question Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the state by 81,000 votes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a Texas man who hosts a talk show tied to the conspiracy-theory website InfoWars with unlawfully breaching the U.S. Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6 riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
Owen Shroyer unlawfully entered a restricted area at the west side of the Capitol during the deadly rampage that interrupted the formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, prosecutors said in court papers unsealed on Friday.
He hosts a talk show associated with Infowars, called ""The War Room With Owen Shroyer,"" streamed daily on an InfoWars platform, prosecutors said.
Shroyer faces two misdemeanor charges: violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and unlawfully entering a restricted area. 
The court papers included a photograph of Shroyer at the Capitol on Jan. 6 with Alex Jones, a right-wing media personality and the founder of InfoWars. Jones, who has not been charged in connection with the riot, participated in pro-Trump events in Washington on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 and helped promote the former president's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Shroyer led a crowd of people who marched from a park near the White House to the Capitol on Jan. 6, an FBI agent said in a court filing.

The agent said video footage showed Shroyer leading chants and telling the crowd: ""Today we march for the Capitol because on this historic January 6, 2021, we have to let our congressmen and women know, and we have to let Mike Pence know, they stole the election, we know they stole it, and we aren't going to accept it!"" Pence was Trump's vice president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. troops may stay in Afghanistan past an Aug. 31 deadline to evacuate Americans, President Joe Biden said on Wednesday, and the Pentagon said the U.S. military does not currently have the ability to reach people beyond the Kabul airport.
""If there's American citizens left, we're going to stay until we get them all out,"" Biden told ABC News in an interview conducted on a day many U.S. lawmakers pressed him to extend the deadline that he had set for a final pullout.
Biden has come under fierce criticism for his handling of the withdrawal, which in recent days has been dominated by scenes of chaos https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/evacuations-afghanistan-gather-momentum-taliban-promise-peace-2021-08-18 in and around the Kabul airport with people desperately trying to get out of the country.
Biden defended his decisions, saying problems were inevitable in ending the 20-year U.S. involvement there.
""The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens,"" he said.
He also said the Taliban is cooperating for now in helping get Americans out of the country but ""we're having some more difficulty"" in evacuating U.S.-aligned Afghan citizens.
The speed with which Taliban forces retook Afghanistan, as U.S. and other foreign forces withdrew, has led to chaotic scenes at the airport with diplomats, foreign citizens and Afghans trying to flee but they are being impeded by crowds and Taliban checkpoints.
""We're going to do everything we can to continue to try and deconflict and create passageways for them to get to the airfield. I don't have the capability to go out and extend operations currently into Kabul,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon. 
A top U.S. diplomat separately said on Wednesday the United States expects the Taliban to allow Afghans who wish to leave Afghanistan to depart safely.
NOT SATISFIED
Austin said the United States was not satisfied with how many people were being evacuated. 
""It's obvious we're not close to where we want to be in terms of getting the numbers through,"" he said. 
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris discussed ways to accelerate evacuations of Americans and refugees from Afghanistan with his national security team on Wednesday, a White House official said.
Biden did not take questions after delivering a White House speech about coronavirus vaccine booster shots, turning his back and walking away as reporters shouted.
Reuters reported on Tuesday increasing concern from officials about how many at-risk Afghans https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bidens-vow-airlift-afghan-allies-meets-ticking-clock-risky-rescue-2021-08-17 could be evacuated.
U.S. troops guarding the evacuation effort fired some shots in the air overnight to control crowds, but there were no indications of casualties or injuries, the Pentagon said earlier on Wednesday.
Austin said there are about 4,500 U.S. military personnel in Kabul and there ""have been no hostile interactions with the Taliban, and our lines of communication with Taliban commanders remain open.""
Speaking to reporters alongside Austin, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there had been no intelligence to indicate that the Afghanistan security forces and government would collapse in 11 days, as they did. 
Milley said intelligence had ""clearly indicated, multiple scenarios were possible,"" including a Taliban takeover following a rapid collapse of Afghan security forces and the government, a civil war or a negotiated settlement.
""The timeframe of rapid collapse - that was widely estimated and ranged from weeks to months and even years following our departure,"" Milley said. 
The two top Republicans in the U.S. Congress, Kevin McCarthy of the House of Representatives and Mitch McConnell of the Senate, requested a classified briefing for the ""gang of eight"" - the top eight relevant lawmakers - for a status report on the evacuation.
""It is of the utmost importance that the U.S. government account for all U.S. citizens in Afghanistan and provide the necessary information and means of departure to all those Americans who desire to leave the country,"" they wrote in a letter to Biden.

Both Austin and Milley, who have served in Afghanistan, acknowledged that troops and veterans were finding the images from the evacuation troubling.
""I'm hearing strong views from all sides on this issue ... what's important is that each of us will work our way through this in our own way,"" Austin said.

207,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Iran has nearly doubled its enrichment capacity dedicated to purifying uranium close to the levels required for nuclear weapons, signaling it won’t de-escalate its atomic activities before meeting again with world powers. 
Inspectors verified on Aug. 15 that Iran introduced a second cascade of nuclear centrifuges to produced uranium enriched to 60% purity at a fuel plant in Natanz, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in reply to questions. The machines spin at supersonic speeds to separate the uranium isotopes needed to induce fission. 
Iran had originally taken that added enrichment capacity off line in April, at the start of now-stalled negotiations to bring Washington back into the deal. Its 2015 agreement with world powers had capped the activity in exchange for sanctions relief, but former U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the accord triggered Iranian breaches. 
The negotiations in Vienna had originally been projected to restart in August but could now drag into next month. September is traditionally a key period for diplomats in the Austrian capital, with senior nuclear officials congregating for the IAEA’s quarterly board meeting and annual general conference beginning Sept. 13. 
Earlier this month, Iran’s new president picked a hawkish Foreign Ministry veteran with close ties to the military elite as the nation’s top diplomat, underscoring the shift in power that’s clouding the resumption of talks. That could see Iran seek to drive a harder bargain over rolling back its rapidly expanding nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, and perhaps even topple the process. 
The delay in resuming the talks has already put off Iran’s return to global oil markets beyond what many traders expected.
The U.S. called Iran’s continuing nuclear expansion “unconstructive and inconsistent” earlier this week after a separate IAEA report showed Tehran continuing to process uranium into metal fuel for a research reactor. While Iran says that activity will help eventually help supply its population with medical isotopes, some nonproliferation analysts are concerned it will also yield knowledge needed for making weapons. 
Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is for civilian uses, but concern in Western capitals and Israel over the potential for bomb-making helped to spur the 2015 deal.
Tehran said last month that it had more than tripled its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% to 8.9 kilograms (19.6 pounds) from 2.4 kilograms in June. That’s just shy of the quantity of 90%-enriched material typically used in weapons.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's approval rating dropped by 7 percentage points and hit its lowest level so far as the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed over the weekend https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-taliban-engineered-political-collapse-afghanistan-2021-08-17 in an upheaval that sent thousands of civilians and Afghan military allies fleeing for their safety, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
The national opinion poll, conducted on Monday, found that 46% of American adults approved of Biden's performance in office, the lowest recorded in weekly polls that started when Biden took office in January. 
It is also down from the 53% who felt the same way in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran on Friday.
Biden's popularity dropped as the Taliban entered the capital, Kabul, wiping away two decades of U.S. military presence that cost nearly 1 trillion taxpayer dollars and thousands of American lives. 
However, a majority of both Republican and Democratic voters said the chaos was a sign that the United States should leave.
A separate Ipsos snap poll, also conducted on Monday, found that fewer than half of Americans liked the way Biden has steered the U.S. military and diplomatic effort in Afghanistan this year. The president, who just last month praised Afghan forces for being ""as well-equipped as any in the world,"" was rated worse than the other three presidents who presided over the United States' longest war. 
The United States and Western allies continued to evacuate diplomats and civilians on Tuesday, one day after Afghans crowded into Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to flee the Taliban regime. 
Americans expressed a variety of opinions that may still be evolving as the Taliban completes its takeover of the country.
The Ipsos poll found that 75% of Americans supported the decision to send in additional troops to secure key facilities in Afghanistan until the withdrawal is complete, and about the same number supported the evacuation of Afghans who helped U.S. forces in the country.
Yet Americans appeared to be largely unsettled on what to think of the war, with majorities expressing somewhat contradictory views about what the U.S. military should have done. 
For example, a majority of the 18-to-65-year-olds who took the Ipsos survey - 68% - agreed that the war “was going to end badly, no matter when the U.S. left,” and 61% wanted the United States to complete its withdrawal of troops on schedule. 
Yet a smaller majority - 51% - also agreed that “it would have been worth it for the United States to leave troops in Afghanistan another year,” and 50% wanted to send troops back into the country to fight the Taliban.
In many cases, Republicans and Democrats appeared to share the same outlook on the war: six in 10 Republicans and seven in 10 Democrats agreed, for example, that the swift capitulation of the Afghan government “is evidence why the U.S. should get out of the conflict.”
About 44% of respondents said they thought Biden has done a “good job” in Afghanistan. In comparison, 51% praised the way former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama handled the war. 
Approval of Biden's handling of Afghanistan is even lower than that of former President George W. Bush, who ordered the Afghanistan invasion and entrenched the United States in the costly and ultimately futile effort to foster new leadership in the country. 
About 47% of Americans felt that Bush did a good job in Afghanistan. 
To be sure, the latest polling should be viewed so far as just a one-week drop: it is still far too early to say how the Taliban takeover will affect Biden politically. 
Forty percent of registered voters said in the Reuters/Ipsos poll that they would vote for a Democrat in next year's congressional elections, while 37% said they would back a Republican. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 947 American adults, including 403 Democrats and 350 Republicans. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

The Ipsos online snap poll gathered responses from 1,000 people, including 443 Democrats and 247 Republicans. It has a credibility interval of about 4 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Joe Biden appeared in the White House East Room on July 8 to stress that the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan was proceeding apace, he declared that a Taliban takeover of the country was not inevitable.
Five weeks later, the Taliban is in charge, scenes of chaos at the Kabul airport from the evacuation of Americans and U.S.-aligned Afghan citizens has transfixed the world, and Biden is scrambling to defend himself from a series of miscalculations that have damaged U.S. credibility.
While insisting that ""the buck stops with me,"" Biden has doled out blame to others over America's humiliating end to the 20-year involvement https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/americas-longest-war-20-years-missteps-afghanistan-2021-08-16 in Afghanistan that included missteps by four administrations - two Republican and two Democratic.
He has assailed the Afghan military for refusing to fight, denounced the now-ousted Afghan government and declared he inherited a bad withdrawal agreement from his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.
""I made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring America’s military involvement in Afghanistan to an end.  And while it’s been hard and messy - and yes, far from perfect - I've honored that commitment,"" Biden said in a speech https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-us-mission-afghanistan-was-never-supposed-be-nation-building-2021-08-16 on Monday.
Biden came to office promoting himself as an international statesman with a steady hand on the tiller after Trump's four storm-tossed years in office.
He quickly rejoined international agreements abandoned by Trump and sought to rejuvenate traditional alliances that Trump had spurned.
But his first big international challenge is generating an intense political backlash as Democrats and Republicans alike raise questions about his strategy.
A prediction by U.S. intelligence https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-fighters-capture-eighth-provincial-capital-six-days-2021-08-11 that the Taliban could be held off for three months following U.S. withdrawal proved to be wrong. U.S. military commanders who sought a more deliberate approach to the withdrawal were dismissed.
Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan took the White House podium on Tuesday to offer a broad defense of Biden's actions. He said that signaling support for the Afghan government ""was a considered judgment"" that did not save it, however.
""When you conclude 20 years of military action in a civil war in another country, with the impacts of 20 years of decisions that have piled up, you have to make a lot of hard calls. None with clean outcomes,"" Sullivan said.
CALLS FOR INVESTIGATIONS 
Members of the U.S. Congress, increasingly frustrated with events in Afghanistan, want to investigate what went wrong.
Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic Intelligence Committee chairman, had said on Monday he intended to work with other committees ""to ask tough but necessary questions"" about why the United States was not better prepared for the collapse of the Afghan government.
Republicans continued their harsh criticism of Biden's policies.
""The security and humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Afghanistan could have been avoided if you had done any planning,"" Republicans on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee said in a letter to the White House on Tuesday.
The crisis appears to have taken a toll. Biden's approval rating dropped by 7 percentage points and hit its lowest level - 46% - since he took office in January, a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted on Monday found.
Biden, managing the crisis from the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin mountains, went several days without talking to any foreign leaders about Afghanistan. He spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday.
""The prime minister stressed the importance of not losing the gains made in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, or protecting ourselves against any emerging threat from terrorism and of continuing to support the people of Afghanistan,"" said a Downing Street spokesman.
Former President George W. Bush, who began the ""war on terror"" in Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and started a second war in Iraq in 2003, sounded a note of regret in a statement issued late on Monday with his wife, Laura Bush.

""Our hearts are heavy for both the Afghan people who have suffered so much and for the Americans and NATO allies who have sacrificed so much,"" they said. ""The Afghans now at greatest risk are the same ones who have been on the forefront of progress inside their nation.""
Sullivan, however, argued on Tuesday that while the images from the airport were ""heartbreaking"" Biden ""had to think about the human costs of the alternative path as well, which was to stay in the middle of a civil conflict in Afghanistan.""

""The events of recent days have been the culmination of a series of mistakes made by Republican and Democratic administrations over the past 20 years,"" Senator Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.
""We are now witnessing the horrifying result of many years of policy and intelligence failures,"" Menendez said.
Menendez said his committee would hold a hearing on U.S. policy toward Afghanistan, including negotiations between former Republican President Donald Trump's administration and the Taliban and the Biden's administration's execution of the withdrawal.
Committee Republicans said they wanted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to testify, ""to understand why the State Department was so ill prepared for the contingencies unfolding before us,"" according to a letter sent to Menendez.
""Updates from the State Department have been inconsistent, lacked important detail, and not be responsive to Members and the American people,"" the Republicans wrote.
The date of the hearing was not immediately announced.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association has failed to root out rampant internal corruption, even after a bankruptcy case designed to avoid that obligation was thrown out, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a court filing seeking to dissolve the gun rights group.
In an amended complaint filed on Monday, James said the NRA's concealment of questionable transactions, awarding perks to longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre and other insiders, disregard of good governance, and evasion of accountability have ""continued unabated"" since she sued the nonprofit last August.
The amended complaint was filed after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas dismissed the NRA's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in May, calling it an improper effort to gain an ""unfair litigation advantage"" and avoid James' oversight.
William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, accused James of quoting ""selectively"" from Hale's opinion to support her case.
""It is now more evident than ever that the NYAG's action is a politically-motivated attack,"" Brewer said in a statement. ""The fact is, those proceedings underscored the NRA's commitment to good governance--and undermine the NYAG's case.""
James' accusations include that the NRA told the Internal Revenue Service for the first time late last year that LaPierre had ""spent charitable assets to benefit himself personally."" 
She also said the group's treasurer at the time wouldn't sign an Internal Revenue Service tax form because several NRA officials wouldn't assure it was accurate. LaPierre signed the form, and the treasurer was fired soon afterward, James said.
Founded in 1871 in New York, the NRA has accused James of violating its free speech rights because the Democrat disliked its politics and support of Republicans, many of whom have made expanded gun rights a priority.
Hale faulted LaPierre for arranging the bankruptcy without telling many top NRA officials, calling it ""nothing less than shocking,"" but said 12 days of trial testimony suggested that the group ""now understands the importance of compliance.""

James is also seeking LaPierre's ouster.
The case is New York v. The National Rifle Association of America Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451625/2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Last summer, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser played a high-profile role in the protests sweeping America over police killings of Black suspects. She renamed a street Black Lives Matter Plaza and joined thousands of demonstrators there, many shouting what had become the movement’s slogan: “Defund the police!”
Earlier this year, the mayor, a Democrat, proposed cutting the police budget and redirecting money to social services.
Now, however, Bowser and many other Democratic city leaders are scrambling to boost police budgets and hire more officers amid the deadliest crime wave in two decades. Local and national Democrats are distancing themselves from “defund” politics and policies, a reflection of how deeply unpopular the concept has become among most voters - and how effective a weapon it can be for Republican candidates.
The crime wave has laid bare tensions between progressive Democrats, who still aim to overhaul U.S. policing, and mainstream Democrats now pushing traditional enforcement to combat crime.
The division has chilled efforts to reshape police departments and hold officers more accountable for excessive force. In New York, Atlanta and Seattle, Democratic city politicians have abandoned or scaled back police budget-cutting efforts and other proposals they touted amid the uproar over the 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police in Minneapolis. In Congress, a policing bill named after Floyd - sponsored by Vice President Kamala Harris when she was still a senator - remains stalled more than a year later.
New York pivoted from slashing almost $1 billion in police funds last year to adding $200 million this year. Oakland, California, boosted its police budget in June by $38 million after last year setting a goal to cut it by $150 million. Austin, a liberal bastion in conservative Texas, this year passed its largest-ever police budget under pressure from state Republicans over rising crime. Last year, Austin had diverted $150 million in police funds to other priorities.
In Washington, Bowser asked the city council last month for $11 million to hire 170 new police officers after a series of shootings. The council agreed to fund 40 officers.
Bowser, who declined to comment for this story, has defended her reversal on police funding by saying she is responding to a crime wave and pleas for money from the city’s police chief.
""I am outraged. The chief is outraged. The community should be outraged,"" she told reporters on July 22, after a shooting on an affluent restaurant row near downtown that left two wounded. The incident followed the July 16 shooting of 6-year-old Nyiah Courtney, who was killed on her scooter by a stray bullet. A day later, a shootout outside the Washington Nationals baseball park left three wounded, including two shooting suspects.
Violence nationally has upended the dynamics in key mayoral races. Centrist Democrats campaigning on their support for police have won or emerged as favorites in party primary elections. In New York, former police officer Eric Adams captured the Democratic nomination for mayor in June, defeating more progressive candidates by vowing to hire more officers and support aggressive tactics.
In advance of next year’s midterm Congressional elections, Republican party officials are making crime a central issue - and casting all Democrats as enemies of law enforcement.
“Every voter knows that Democrats are the party of Defund the Police,” said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Most mainstream Democrats, however, never embraced the defunding movement pushed by party progressives. Democratic President Joe Biden rejected the idea during the 2020 campaign, even as he supported calls for reforms to address racial inequities and excessive force.
Voters reject cutting police budgets by large margins, polls show. A USA Today/Ipsos survey last month found that about two-thirds of respondents believe crime is worsening and that 7 in 10 support bigger police budgets. Only 22% said they support defunding police.
Advocates for diverting police funds to social services concede they now face long odds. Christy Lopez, a former U.S. Justice Department official, chairs the police reform commission formed last year by the Washington city council. She still believes spending on mental health and other programs would control crime better than more officers. But she acknowledged that advocates have not convinced voters.
“That is a failure of us educating the public,” she said.
DEFUNDERS RETREAT
Such efforts have been hobbled in part by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, say academics who study policing. The pandemic destabilized communities, emptied downtowns, strained municipal budgets and limited police patrols, all factors contributing to the surging violence, said Wesley Skogan, a policing expert at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University.
Atlanta was among many cities that last summer saw massive protests demanding racial justice and police accountability. Its city council was poised last year to slash $73 million in police funds. The measure failed by one vote, in favor of a proposal of giving the mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms - who opposed cutting police budgets - time to develop a new policing model.
Atlanta has since become one of America’s deadliest cities. Murders are up 58% so far this year, compared to the same period in 2019. Talk of reinventing the police department has quieted, and the council added 7%, or about $15 million, to this year’s police budget. Last month, Bottoms said she wanted to hire 250 more officers.
Bottoms is not seeking re-election. Two leading candidates to replace her have both vowed to add more cops. One of them, Felicia Moore, said the city doesn’t have to defund the police to fund social and mental health services. It should do both to fight crime.
“I don’t think they are mutually exclusive,” she said. 
'PEACE OFFICERS' IN MINNEAPOLIS
In Minneapolis - where George Floyd was killed - the movement to overhaul policing retains momentum despite a murder rate this year that could break a record.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a member of the city’s dominant Democratic-Farmer-Labor party (DFL), has opposed cutting police budgets. Fewer officers, he told Reuters, is “not a realistic solution given the circumstances our city is facing - all cities are facing.”
Frey, however, has lost support among the party’s progressive base in the mayoral race to candidate Sheila Nezhad, a community activist who backs a radical overhaul of policing. A recent caucus of party voters showed Nezhad with a solid lead.
When voters choose a mayor on Nov. 2, they will also vote on a citizen-led referendum that would abolish the police department and replace it with a “department of public safety” employing “peace officers” and taking a “comprehensive public health approach.” Nezhad backs the measure; Frey opposes it.
“We need to shift the conversation from policing to safety,” Nezhad said. “Violence prevention requires investment in the community.” 
CAPITAL MURDER
Republicans labeled most Democrats as police-defunders in the 2020 Congressional elections. It worked, according to voter interviews and polling data reviewed by Democratic political groups.
Democrats are looking to limit the damage. In July, President Joe Biden invited Bowser, New York’s Adams and other urban leaders to the White House for a summit on gun violence, urging cities to use federal stimulus money to hire new officers.
In the nation’s capital, homicides rose 20% in 2020 to a 16-year-high and remain on that pace this year. The rising violence followed the city council’s decision last year to cut police funding by 5%, or $15 million.
Bowser’s shifting stances on funding illustrate how Democrats are struggling to appease both progressives and mainstream voters. Last year, Bowser - a two-term mayor with strong business-community support - had unsuccessfully opposed the council’s move to cut the police budget. Then in May of this year, she proposed slicing $36 million from the department in her budget proposal for 2022. She reversed herself after the July shootings, pivoting to a request for more funding to hire officers.

Charles Allen, the council member who led the effort to cut police budgets, said the council compromised in recognition of the rising violence, giving a portion of the policing funds she requested.
“We have to be able to step into the middle” on policing issues, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frustration and anger at U.S. President Joe Biden’s handling of evacuations from Afghanistan https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/talibans-rapid-advance-across-afghanistan-2021-08-10 are mounting among administration officials, lawmakers of both parties and advocacy groups. 
As U.S. diplomats hunkered inside, thousands of desperate Afghans thronged Kabul airport where five people were killed on Monday, prompting the U.S. military to temporarily suspend flights to clear the airfield.
In a televised address on Monday, Biden acknowledged there were concerns about why Afghans had not been evacuated earlier, but said his administration had been discouraged to do so by the Afghan government at the time. 
""Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier, still hopeful for their country,"" Biden said.
But five U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that weeks before the Washington-backed Afghan government collapsed, the U.S. military wanted a bigger role in helping to evacuate Afghans at risk because they worked for the United States. The officials believe that a more orderly withdrawal would have been likely.
""We could have done a lot more to help. The administration waited too long,” a military official said.
In response, a senior administration official cited comments on Monday by national security adviser Jake Sullivan who said Biden's team has been ""engaged for months of extensive scenario planning and was ready for this challenge.""
Despite the government's rapid collapse, Sullivan said the embassy was closed ""safely and swiftly"" and that, ""We are now laser-focused on getting people out safely and swiftly.""
There were also issues with the intelligence, with one assessment last week saying Kabul would not be isolated for the next 30 days at least.
A person familiar with the situation said the Biden administration was behind the curve as things deteriorated in Afghanistan. ""Every decision has come too late and in reaction to events that make the subsequent decision obsolete,"" the source said.
Local embassy employees who have been at home for weeks were left to make their own way to the airport, the source said, adding that emails were sent to them on Sunday after sporadic gunfire to remain in their houses or some other safe location.
The pandemonium hampering the evacuations prompted some embassy officials to raise concerns that there was an insufficient number of U.S. troops to secure the airport, reflecting poor planning and intelligence failures, said the source. 
The source and another U.S. official told Reuters that the administration so badly misjudged the situation that the State Department flew a regular rotation of diplomats into Kabul last Tuesday even as the Taliban advanced toward the capital.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers also weighed in with criticism.
“The withdrawal of U.S. troops should have been carefully planned to prevent violence and instability, and to ensure that the hard-fought progress gained over the past two decades —particularly when it comes to Afghan women and girls — would not be lost,"" said Tom Carper, a U.S. senator from Biden's home state of Delaware and fellow Democrat.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), an opponent of Biden’s withdrawal decision, said it was unlikely that American personnel and at-risk Afghans could be evacuated by Aug. 31 - Biden's deadline for a full withdrawal. Graham said that “artificial” deadline “will likely result in thousands of Afghans who have helped America being left behind for slaughter.”
Biden announced in April that he would be withdrawing the remaining 2,500 troops from Afghanistan as part of a 2020 deal made with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump. 
Military officials recommended against it, but some officials said they felt their views had been heard and the American public was ready to end America's longest war.

The events of the past week, however, have replaced resigned acceptance with anger. 
""Frustrated, disgusted and in disbelief today,"" said a military official who served in Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Monday he stood ""squarely behind"" his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan despite searing images of chaos in Kabul that exposed the limits of U.S. power and plunged him into the worst crisis of his presidency.
Breaking his silence on the U.S. pullout after scenes of bedlam dominated television news channels for days, Biden blamed the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan on Afghan political leaders who fled the country and the unwillingness of the U.S.-trained Afghan army to fight the militant group.
He warned Taliban leaders they would face ""devastating force"" should they interfere with the U.S. pullout. Biden was forced to send U.S. troop reinforcements to Kabul to ensure a safe withdrawal of American diplomatic personnel and civilians as well as Afghan citizens who worked with the United States and could face reprisals.
The panicked evacuation, coming weeks after Biden predicted the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan was not inevitable, has dented America's image on the global stage just as Biden has sought to emphasize to world leaders that ""America is back"" after former President Donald Trump's tumultuous four years.
The pullout has also raised fears that militant groups like al Qaeda could reconstitute under Taliban rule.
Biden, rejecting harsh criticism of his Afghan policy from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, some former generals and human rights groups, was resolute in defending his withdrawal from a 20-year war that endured through four presidencies.
""I stand squarely behind my decision,"" Biden said in a televised speech at the White House. ""After 20 years I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. That's why we're still there.""
Biden said he found some of the scenes of chaos in Kabul ""gut-wrenching"" but that he did not start moving out evacuees sooner because Afghan President Ashraf Ghani did not want a mass exodus.
POLITICAL RISKS UNCLEAR
He acknowledged that the Taliban's speed in retaking the country was unexpected. The rapid advance stunned American officials who predicted that the Afghan army would either repel the militants or hold them off for months.
""The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we anticipated. So what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military gave up, sometimes without trying to fight,"" Biden said.
He also doled out criticism to his Republican predecessor, Trump, whose administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that Biden said left the group ""in the strongest position militarily since 2001.""
Critics of Biden have focused on the way the U.S. withdrawal is being carried out, as video showed Afghans flooding runways at the Kabul airport and desperately trying to grab the fuselage of a U.S. plane rolling on the tarmac.
""The president's failure to acknowledge his disastrous withdrawal provides no comfort to Americans or our Afghan partners whose lives hang in the balance,"" Republican Senator Mitt Romney said in a tweet.
Biden singled out for criticism the two main Afghan leaders, Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, head of the country's High Council for National Reconciliation, saying they had ""flatly refused"" his advice to seek a political settlement with the Taliban.
""How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans - Afghanistan’s civil war, when Afghan troops will not? How many more lives - American lives - is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?"" Biden asked.
On Monday night, Biden on Monday authorized up to $500 million from an emergency fund to meet ""unexpected urgent"" refugee needs stemming from the situation in Afghanistan, including for Afghan special immigration visa applicants, the White House said.
The United States is preparing to begin evacuating thousands of Afghan applicants for special immigration visas (SIVs) who risk retaliation from Taliban insurgents because they worked for the U.S. government.
Whether Biden will face a long-term political risk for Afghanistan is unclear. Foreign policy does not typically play a major role in U.S. elections. Many Americans have expressed support for Trump's and Biden's decision to leave Afghanistan, America's longest war. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/americas-longest-war-20-years-missteps-afghanistan-2021-08-16
But Republican Representative Mike McCaul signaled his party might try to frame the Afghan chaos as a national security issue that makes the United States more vulnerable to terrorist attack.
""I think it is going to taint this presidency, to a large degree, on national security,"" he said.
The United States and allies invaded Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and toppled the Taliban, who had hosted al Qaeda militants responsible for the attack.

Biden also said his decision was a result of the commitment he made to American troops that he was not going to ask them to continue to risk their lives for a war that should have ended long ago.
""Our leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as (a) young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""I know my decision will be criticized but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another president.""
 
"
215,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. State Department on Monday declined to say if the United States still recognized Ashraf Ghani as the president of Afghanistan after he left the country on Sunday as insurgent Taliban fighters toppled his government in a matter of weeks.
""So this is something that we are working on with the international community,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price responded when asked who Washington recognized as the leader of Afghanistan.
In a briefing, Price also declined to say whether U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who had a phone call with Ghani on Saturday, knew at the time where the president was or was informed by Ghani of his departure.
""The political situation was evolving very quickly. We'll leave it to President Ghani to characterize what he may have told the secretary,"" Price said.
""There has not been a formal transfer of power,"" he added.
Al Jazeera reported that Ghani had flown to Uzbekistan. Reuters was unable to verify this report.

First elected president in 2014, Ghani took over from Hamid Karzai, who led Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Ghani oversaw the conclusion of the U.S. combat mission, the near-complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country and a fractious peace process with the insurgent Taliban.
An increasingly isolated figure, he made ending decades of war a priority, despite continuing attacks on his government and security forces by the Taliban. Ghani began peace talks with the insurgents in the Qatari capital, Doha, in 2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Lawmakers in the New York State Assembly will issue a report on their investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo after abandoning an impeachment effort in light of his resignation over complaints of sexual harassment, members said.
The Assembly's Judiciary Committee began an impeachment investigation in March after two women who worked for Cuomo went public with complaints of sexual harassment.
The state's attorney general released a separate report this month concluding that the Democratic governor had kissed, groped or made unwelcome sexual advances to at least 11 women, including aides and a state trooper. Cuomo said last Tuesday he would step down in two weeks, and lawmakers later said they would no longer seek to impeach and remove him.
Even so, the Judiciary Committee is still reviewing evidence amassed on accusations of sexual harassment and efforts by his administration to withhold data showing the true extent of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and committee Chair Charles Lavine said in a joint statement.
New York Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul is set to succeed Cuomo when he leaves office next week, which would make her the first woman to lead the state. Hochul said last week she intended to root out officials who behaved unethically under Cuomo's watch to ensure her administration does not foster a ""toxic work environment.""
Her comments came one day after Cuomo announced his resignation, triggered by the report from New York Attorney General Letitia James that concluded the three-term governor had created a hostile workplace. 
The five-month independent investigation accused Cuomo of violating U.S. and state laws, though James deferred to local authorities on pursuing criminal charges.
At least one of Cuomo's accusers, Brittany Commisso, has filed a criminal complaint with the Albany County Sheriff's Office. Commisso alleged that Cuomo groped her breast at the Executive Mansion in late 2020.

The sexual harassment probe was one of numerous investigations launched by the Democratic attorney general's office into Cuomo this year. In January, James announced a probe into accusations that the Cuomo administration had undercounted the number of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents.
Her office is also investigating whether he improperly used state resources to publish a book about governing through the early days of the COVID-19 health crisis. The book deal is reportedly worth more than $5 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Saturday that he had approved additional military forces to go to Kabul to help safely draw down the American embassy and remove personnel from Afghanistan.
In a lengthy statement, Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, arguing that Afghan forces had to fight back against Taliban fighters sweeping through the country. 
""Based on the recommendations of our diplomatic, military and intelligence teams, I have authorized the deployment of approximately 5,000 U.S. troops to make sure we can have an orderly and safe drawdown of U.S. personnel and other allied personnel,"" Biden said. 
A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the 5,000 Biden announced, 4,000 were already previously announced. About 1,000 were newly approved and would be from the 82nd Airborne Division. 
Biden said his administration had told Taliban officials in Qatar that any action that put U.S. personnel at risk ""will be met with a swift and strong U.S. military response.""
But he also said an indefinite U.S. military presence was not an option.
""One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country. And an endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me,"" Biden added.
The troops will also support evacuation of some Afghans going through a special visa program. 
The State Department has reached out to advocates to request names of Afghans in Kabul who have worked with the Americans and need to be evacuated, two sources familiar with the matter said. The list could include journalists and human rights activists.
Biden has set a formal end to the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan for Aug. 31 as he looks to disengage from a conflict that started after al Qaeda attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.
Biden's move on Saturday came amid growing pressure to adjust a withdrawal plan that is generating some of the harshest criticism of his six months in office.

A Twitter post from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) reflected some of the criticism: ""If President Biden truly has no regrets about his decision to withdraw, then he is disconnected from reality when it comes to Afghanistan.""
The Taliban have swept through much of Afghanistan, capturing a major city in northern Afghanistan on Saturday and drawing closer to Kabul, where Western countries scrambled to evacuate their citizens from the capital.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a new terrorism warning bulletin, said violent extremists could view the reimposition of COVID-19-related restrictions following the spread of coronavirus variants as a rationale to conduct attacks.
The new DHS bulletin also warned of the risk of ""targeted violence"" around the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington and around religious holidays.
The department said that COVID-19-related stress has ""contributed to increased societal strains and tensions, driving several plots by domestic violent extremists, and they may contribute to more violence this year."" 
In a bulletin issued in May, DHS had warned that domestic extremists could take advantage of moves earlier this year to ease COVID-19 restrictions to launch attacks on a broader range of targets.
In an interview with CNN, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said his department considered domestic violent extremists to constitute ""the greatest terrorist-related threat to our homeland."" He said the Department was seeing expressions of extremism fueled by ""false narratives"" and ""ideologies of hate.""
U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, welcomed the DHS warning but said it was ""troubling that the terrorism threat increasingly is based on grievance-based violence and conspiracy theories, especially related to the election and former President Trump."" 
The rapid spread of the Delta variant and a related spike in COVID-19 infections has caused some U.S. states to reimpose stiffer guidelines related to mask-wearing and gatherings. 
The latest DHS bulletin also noted that al Qaeda's Arabian Peninsula branch had recently released the first English-language version of its ""Inspire"" magazine in four years, which DHS says is evidence that violent foreign militants are still trying to inspire U.S. followers to engage in attacks. 

DHS said it was promoting ""authoritative sources of information"" in order to ""debunk"" and if possible ""pre-empt"" disinformation. 
DHS warned that media outlets linked to the Russian, Chinese and Iranian governments had ""repeatedly"" amplified conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Lawmakers in the New York Assembly will suspend their impeachment investigation of Governor Andrew Cuomo in light of his promise to step down from office over sexual harassment complaints, Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement on Friday.
The Assembly, controlled by Cuomo's fellow Democrats, opened the impeachment investigation in March after at least two women who formerly worked for the governor went public with complaints that Cuomo had sexually harassed them. The decision means that Cuomo will not face the prospect of a ban from seeking elected office again in New York.
A damning report released this month by New York Attorney General Letitia James, also a Democrat, concluded Cuomo had broken state and federal law by kissing, groping or making lewd comments to at least 11 women, including aides and a state trooper.
Cuomo said in a widely seen video broadcast on Tuesday he would resign after a decade running the state and leave office in two weeks. He has denied harassing anyone, though he has acknowledged making some women uncomfortable by engaging in what he characterized as well-intentioned efforts to show affection, which he attributed in part to his Italian-American upbringing.
Heastie said the impeachment inquiry was no longer needed since its purpose was ""to determine whether Governor Cuomo should remain in office.""
He also said lawmakers have been advised by legal counsel that the state's constitution does not allow the legislature to impeach an elected official who is no longer in office; many observers have noted the constitution does not explicitly address that scenario. 
Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly in December, called the Assembly' decision an ""unjust cop out.""
""The public deserves to know the extent of the Governor's misdeeds and possible crimes,"" she wrote in a statement shared on social media. 
Some lawmakers also objected, arguing that Cuomo can and should still be impeached even after leaving office. Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat and a frequent Cuomo critic, said he would be releasing a legal memo explaining why impeachment is allowed under the law.
If impeached in the Assembly, Cuomo would have faced a trial in the state Senate, which also has a Democratic majority. A conviction would permit lawmakers to bar Cuomo from ever holding public office in New York again.
Prior to his resignation, Cuomo appeared almost certain to be impeached and ousted from office, as Democratic legislators abandoned him following the report from Attorney General Letitia James' office.
The impeachment probe was not limited to the harassment allegations. 
Investigators were also examining why the Cuomo administration withheld data showing the true extent of nursing home deaths during the coronavirus pandemic as well as whether Cuomo improperly used state resources in penning a published memoir.
While incomplete, the inquiry had gathered enough evidence to likely result in impeachment had Cuomo not stepped down, Heastie said. The evidence will be turned over to the ""relevant investigatory authorities,"" Heastie said, though he did not indicate whether the findings would be made public, as some lawmakers have proposed.
Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing with regard to nursing home data as well as his book.
He still faces potential criminal investigations from several district attorneys' offices.
A former assistant, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo with the Albany County sheriff's office last week, alleging that the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion in November.

Cuomo has denied fondling her, and his private lawyer has sought to discredit her story.
Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, will become the state's first female governor when she takes over for Cuomo. She announced on Thursday she intends to run for a full term in 2022.

(Reuters) - Here is an overview of the civil lawsuits and criminal investigations likely to face New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for months to come as he returns to private life following his resignation on Tuesday over a sexual harassment scandal.
HAS CUOMO BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIMES?
No. He is under criminal investigation.
Prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County, Westchester County and Oswego County have requested evidence from an independent inquiry launched by New York Attorney General Letitia James while looking into the matter. 
These local prosecutors, known as district attorneys, would be the ones to bring any criminal charges.
The report for James found he groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including government workers past and present - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing. He said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous but said he would resign in two weeks for the good of the state.
Cuomo's lawyer Rita Glavin has said James's probe, which was civil in nature, “was conducted to support a predetermined narrative” and “left material out.”
One of Cuomo's accusers, Brittany Commisso, last week filed a complaint with police in Albany, alleging the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion last November.
Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said at a news conference that his office would conduct a thorough investigation.
WHAT CRIMES COULD PROSECUTORS BE CONSIDERING?
Apple said Commisso's complaint alleging Cuomo groped her could lead to misdemeanor charges.
The two most applicable crimes under New York law would be ""forcible touching"" and ""sexual abuse in the third degree,"" said Julie Rendelman, a criminal defense attorney and former Brooklyn prosecutor.
Forcible touching, the more serious of the two misdemeanors, can lead to a maximum sentence of one year in jail, but Rendelman said a prison sentence was ""very unlikely"" for any defendant who had not previously been charged with a crime.
DOES CUOMO'S STATURE MAKE HIM MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO BE CHARGED?
Ross Garber, a lawyer who focuses on political investigations, said Cuomo's resignation could take some public pressure off New York prosecutors to charge him.
""Given the variety of criminal probes, the divergent issues, and various jurisdictions, it’s impossible to say with certainty"" whether Cuomo will be charged, Garber said. ""But resignation does take a bit of oxygen out of the wildfire that has been building for consequences for Cuomo’s actions.""
ARE THERE OBSTACLES TO A CRIMINAL CASE?
In criminal cases, the prosecution must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Deborah Tuerkheimer, a Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University law professor and former prosecutor, said Cuomo's accusers may be reluctant to put themselves through the emotional turmoil of a criminal trial if he is only charged with misdemeanors.
""It's really difficult to testify in a criminal trial,"" Tuerkheimer said.
Judith Olin (NYSE:OLN), a University at Buffalo law professor and a former New York state prosecutor who specialized in sexual assault cases, said any prosecution could face an uphill climb given the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.
WHAT ABOUT CIVIL LAWSUITS?
A lawyer for Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly last December, has said she plans to file a lawsuit against Cuomo. Other accusers could follow her lead, Rendelman said.
A landmark federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment, in the workplace.
Cuomo accusers who invoke this law would be suing the state of New York - their employer - rather than Cuomo directly, said Ann Juliano, a Villanova University law professor.
Under New York law, sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature - from sexual jokes to unwanted flirtation - that creates an offensive work environment, regardless of intent. 
Juliano said Cuomo's accusers could rely on a landmark New York law, championed by Cuomo in 2019, that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their cases in court. Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is ""severe and pervasive.""
To prevail in a civil lawsuit, Cuomo's accusers would only need to convince jurors that there was a greater than 50% chance that their allegations were true. 
WHAT OTHER LEGAL PROBLEMS DOES CUOMO FACE?
Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether, as governor, Cuomo deliberately played down the number of deaths in nursing homes related to COVID-19. 

New York health officials released a report in July denying that their policies had caused any increase in deaths.
James, the attorney general, has also been investigating whether Cuomo misused state resources to write and promote a book he published last October about his leadership during the early months of the pandemic.

(Reuters) - New U.S. census data released on Thursday show the white population declined for the first time in history last decade, with significant increases among people who identify as multi-racial, Hispanic and Asian driving much of the population growth between 2010 and 2020.
The release from the U.S. Census Bureau also marks the start of what will be a fierce partisan battle over redistricting, as states use the local data to begin drawing congressional and state legislative districts for the next 10 years.
The data offered a portrait of an increasingly diverse nation. The non-Hispanic white population, which remains the largest race or ethnic group, shrank by 8.6% over the decade and now accounts for 57.8% of the U.S. population - the lowest share on record.
People who identify as multi-racial increased by 276%, from 9 million in 2010 to 33.8 million in 2020.
For the first time as a U.S. state, California's largest ethnic group is Hispanic, at 39.4% of the population, according to the data. In Texas, another large state, the non-Hispanic white population stood at 39.7%, just slightly larger than the Hispanic population at 39.3%.
The figures also offered new details on the country's slowing rate of population growth, which was the lowest of any 10-year period save the Great Depression in the 1930s.
More than half of all U.S. counties lost population from 2010 to 2020, census officials said, and almost all growth occurred in metropolitan areas. As in recent decades, the South and West saw more growth than the Midwest and Northeast.
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix are the five largest U.S. cities; Phoenix, which grew faster than any other city in the top 10, pushed Philadelphia down to No. 6.
The fastest-growing cities across the U.S. are in suburban areas, data showed. Buckeye, a suburb of Phoenix, saw its population increase by nearly 80% to lead the nation.
The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, is the fastest-growing metro area in the country, the census said. 
The data, which offers demographic and racial details of every community down to the block level, arrived months later than originally expected after the census took longer to complete due to the coronavirus pandemic. The delay has forced some states to go to court to postpone their redistricting deadlines.
States use the data to redraw district lines for the U.S. House of Representatives after each decennial census, based on where people now reside.
In April, the bureau published state-level totals, showing that six states will gain congressional seats next year based on increased populations, as well as additional Electoral College votes starting with the 2024 presidential election. Another seven states will lose seats next year.
Electoral analysts have said Republicans, who control more statehouses than Democrats, could potentially erase the Democrats' thin advantage in the House through redistricting alone.

Some experts have questioned whether the census data may have undercounted certain populations, given both the pandemic as well as the Trump administration's unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the survey. Civil rights groups had expressed concern that the failed attempt could nevertheless have dissuaded some immigrants from filling out census forms.
""While no data is perfect, we are confident that today's redistricting results meet our high data quality standards,"" Ron Jarmin, the bureau's acting director, said on Thursday.

(Reuters) -Texas Democratic lawmakers, scattered around the country, said on Thursday they were more determined than ever to block voting restrictions in their state, after the state supreme court ruled they could be arrested for fleeing Austin in July to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the bill.
From Houston, Washington, D.C., and undisclosed locations, four of the absentee lawmakers told Reuters they would continue to defy Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott's order to return to the legislature, despite arrest warrants served on Wednesday for them and 48 other Democrats.
The lawmakers' exodus on July 12 set up one of the most prolonged showdowns over U.S. state bills limiting voting access. Republicans have pushed the measures, citing former President Donald Trump's baseless claims that voter fraud cost him the November election.
The state supreme court decision prompted Democratic lawmakers to seek protection from other sources, such as Harris County District Court, which on Wednesday granted state Representative Gene Wu a writ ordering all attempts to ""compel his appearance at the Capitol"" to cease.
However, the Texas Supreme Court on Thursday temporarily blocked the district court ruling - allowing for the civil arrests of any absent lawmakers found within Texas. The arrest warrants are not valid outside the state. 
Before that Supreme Court ruling on Thursday, Wu told Reuters by phone that the Democrats had ""more cards up our sleeves"" if the defense strategy failed. He declined to provide further details.
The Sergeant-at-Arms office in the Texas House of Representatives confirmed to Reuters that no actual arrests had been made as of Thursday. Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, the Republican who issued the arrest warrants, did not immediately return calls for comment.
Wu and another absentee Democratic lawmaker said their caucus had considered returning to the legislature to deal with other pressing issues, such as spiking COVID-19 cases in Texas and allocation of federal emergency funding.
""We don't want the governor to divert billions of dollars in coronavirus aid to go into his funding of the Texas border wall,"" said state Representative Alex Dominguez in a Wednesday phone call from an undisclosed location.
But state Representative Trey Martinez Fischer said it was premature for Democrats to consider returning to the statehouse, because he thought Republicans had created a ""toxic"" culture of mistrust by attacking Democratic lawmakers rather than negotiating. 
""I don't have any plans to do anything this session other than to defeat it,"" he said in a phone call from Washington.

All four lawmakers agreed unity for the Democratic caucus was important.
""We're deciding everything as a group, and we remain committed to each other in sticking together,"" said state Representative Erin Zwiener in a phone call from an undisclosed location. ""I am confident that we will move together as a caucus.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst on Thursday pressed the FBI for details after the Justice Department's internal watchdog revealed that FBI agents were using ""provocative"" photos of female office staff as bait in sex-trafficking investigations.
In a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, Ernst, who is a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence, said the ""careless actions"" of the agents who asked female staff to pose for photos in the undercover stings amounted to ""crimes"" that could put those women in danger.
""Due to the reckless actions of these special agents and the indifference of the FBI, there is no way of knowing how many times these images have been downloaded, copied, or further shared across the internet,"" wrote Ernst, a Republican from Iowa.
A FBI spokeswoman confirmed receiving the letter, but declined to comment further.
On Aug. 2, Inspector General Michael Horowitz revealed his office has been investigating a special agent who asked female office support staff to pose as minors and sex workers to assist with undercover sex-trafficking operations. 
The agent allegedly told them not to tell their bosses about their participation, and never obtained their written consent.
In the course of that investigation, the inspector general's office discovered that other agents had also used female staff photos in similar operations, and that the FBI had no policy in place concerning the use of photos of non-certified undercover staff in operations.

The FBI in its response to the report said it would evaluate and update its policies, and said the Office of Professional Responsibility was reviewing the conduct of the agent at the heart of the probe.
Ernst, in her letter, said she wanted to know what resources were being provided to the women to help get their photos scrubbed from the internet, how many agents had engaged in similar conduct, and what other steps the FBI was taking to address the concerns laid out in Horowitz's report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A long-running court fight between Donald Trump and a House of Representatives committee over his financial records is heading back to an appeals court after a judge issued a split decision https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-says-some-trump-financial-records-should-be-turned-over-house-panel-2021-08-11 this week.
In court documents filed on Thursday, Trump's lawyers and attorneys for the House Oversight Committee both asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review a decision issued on Wednesday.
In that ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said Trump's accounting firm, Mazars, should turn over some financial documents to the Democratic-led House committee but not all of the records the panel had sought.
Mehta's ruling came in a long-running lawsuit brought by the House Oversight Committee, which first issued a subpoena for Trump's financial records in 2019.
The lawsuit was back in Mehta's courtroom after a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a July 2020 decision, the high court said Mehta needed to redo his legal analysis and weigh the House's needs for Trump's financial records against the burden such a request puts on the former president.
Mehta on Wednesday said Mazars should turn over documents relating to Trump's hotel in Washington, D.C., saying the committee proved that it needed them to evaluate potential legislation and conduct government oversight.

But he did not allow House investigators to see disclosure forms Trump submitted to the government that outlined his assets and liabilities.
Unlike other recent presidents, Trump refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.

(Reuters) -For $325, Rudy Giuliani will tell you a story or wish you a happy birthday.
The longtime Donald Trump adviser, facing mounting legal bills and a criminal investigation, said on Tuesday he had signed up for Cameo, a website that lets celebrities sell video greetings to fans.
""Hi, it's Rudy Giuliani, and I'm on Cameo,"" Giuliani says in a welcome video posted to his page. ""If there's an issue of concern you would like to discuss, or a story you would like to hear or share with me, or a greeting that I could bring to someone that would bring happiness to their day, I would be delighted to do it. It can be arranged, and we can talk through the magic of Cameo.""
Giuliani's page on Cameo initially listed the price of a video message as $199. But sometime on Wednesday, the price was changed to $325.
Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment. His lawyer, Bob Costello, declined to comment.
In June, Giuliani's allies created a ""Freedom Fund"" for public donations to help the former New York mayor and Manhattan U.S. attorney with his legal woes.
Giuliani's business dealings with Ukrainian oligarchs while he was working as a lawyer for Trump, the former president, are the subject of a probe by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Federal agents searched his home and office in April, seizing phones and computers. 
Giuliani has denied claims of wrongdoing, and his lawyers have suggested the investigation is politically motivated. 
He also faces a $1.3 billion lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems, the equipment maker he falsely asserted stole the 2020 presidential election from Trump by flipping votes. He has argued his statements were free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

On Wednesday, a judge denied a request by Giuliani to dismiss the case on technical grounds. Giuliani is expected to make another attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.
A New York court suspended Giuliani from practicing law in June, finding that he had made ""demonstrably false and misleading"" statements against the integrity of the election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House expressed frustration on Wednesday about the U.S. Senate's slow pace in confirming nominees to serve in key roles in the Biden administration and as envoys overseas, saying it needed all hands on deck.
""What's the holdup?"" press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, saying nearly 275 of President Joe Biden's nominees were awaiting confirmation, including many who were ""non-controversial"" and had ""a lot of Republican support."" 
""We are frustrated over the slow pace of confirmations,"" she said, adding Biden had submitted more nominees to the Senate than his predecessor, Donald Trump, at this point in his tenure, and a comparable number to former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.
The Senate early on Wednesday confirmed the nomination of Ken Salazar, a former U.S. senator from Colorado and interior secretary, to be the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, only the second of Biden's 57 ambassador nominees to be confirmed, along with Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden's envoy to the United Nations.
The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan think tank, said the Senate confirmed a total of 11 nominees on Wednesday before adjourning, bringing the total of Biden's nominees confirmed to 144 of the 442 nominations formally submitted.
While Democrats control the Senate, the confirmation process has been slowed by a number of holds placed by Republicans, including Ted Cruz, to register frustration over issues including the Biden administration's handling of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline being built from Russia to Germany.
Partnership for Public Service Chief Executive Max Stier said all modern presidencies had faced similar issues due to steady growth in the number of Senate-confirmed positions and the use of holds to slow down the process.

The problem is ""getting worse, not better,"" he added, saying it meant important decisions were left in the hands of acting officials, instead of those chosen for the job, with the average time of service for those confirmed being two years, half a presidential term.
By the time of the August recess during Obama's first year, the Senate had confirmed 304 of the 430 nominees submitted by that point. Trump had 130 of his 308 nominations confirmed by the same period. That is out of some 1,200 Senate-confirmed positions overall.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered Donald Trump's accounting firm Mazars to turn over some of the former president's financial records to a U.S. House of Representatives committee but not all of the documents sought by the congressional panel.

Mehta said Mazars should turn over documents relating to Trump's hotel in Washington, D.C., saying the committee proved that it needed them to evaluate potential legislation and conduct government oversight.
But the judge did not allow House investigators to see disclosure forms Trump submitted to the government that outlined his assets and liabilities.
Mehta said he was ""left wondering about the necessity (or even unique usefulness) of President Trump’s personal papers.""
The lawsuit is back in Mehta's courtroom after a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a July 2020 decision, the high court said Mehta needed to redo his legal analysis.
In that 7-2 decision, the justices said that in Mehta's courtroom House Democrats needed to further explain their need for the records, and that Mehta should weigh that stated justification against the burdens placed on Trump by complying with the subpoena.
Unlike other recent presidents, Trump refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. has separately obtained Trump’s tax returns, but that does not mean the public will see them.
The records were obtained in connection with a grand jury investigation, and New York law requires that grand jury materials be kept confidential.

In a statement, House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said she was pleased the court recognizes the panel is ""entitled to a broad set of President Trump’s financial records as part of our critical investigation aimed at preventing presidential conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and constitutional violations.""
She added that she is also disappointed the ruling ""narrowed the subpoena"" in some respects and said the panel is ""actively considering next steps.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A New Jersey woman on Monday became the first person associated with the ""Three Percenters"" militia to agree to plead guilty to a charge related to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
A plea hearing for Rasha Abual-Ragheb, a Lebanese-born resident of Fairfield, New Jersey, was scheduled for Aug. 23, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols told prosecutor Michael Liebman and defense lawyer Elita Amato during a brief hearing on Wednesday.
The charge to which Abual-Ragheb will plead guilty was not specified but she faces four misdemeanor charges related to the riot. 
An FBI agent said in an affidavit that in November 2020, a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account under the name Rasha Abu participated in online chats ""involving the New Jersey chapter of the American Patriot 3%."" The FBI said that in chats Rasha Abu said ""civil war is coming and they need to show support, and rise up and fight for our Constitution.""
The FBI said that on Jan. 6, a confidential source told its Philadelphia office about meeting a woman outside a Washington hotel who called herself ""Rasha"" and ""said she was in the U.S. Capitol and saw a woman get shot.""

More than 570 people have faced charges arising from the riot in which Trump supporters sought to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory. At least 36 have pleaded guilty to riot-related charges.
Investigators have linked seven defendants still facing riot-related charges to the ""Three Percenters,"" a group which takes its name from the erroneous idea that only 3% of American colonists took up arms against the British during the American Revolution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate will make another attempt to pass a bill promoting voting rights next month, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday, even as he acknowledged it is likely that ""Republicans won't join us.""
Schumer said he had huddled with nine Democratic senators ranging from moderates to progressives, and they will produce legislation to be the first order of business when the Senate returns to session in mid-September.
He did not rule out making an exception to Senate rules, such as the filibuster, to advance the measure. The Senate is divided 50-50 between the parties, so Republicans are able to stop Democratic initiatives under the filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance.
In June, Republicans blocked debate on the Democrats' proposed elections overhaul, which was aimed at combating a wave of voting restrictions https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-erect-voting-barriers-politically-crucial-us-states-2021-06-16 passed by Republican-led state legislatures. 
""We have made progress and we are showing very clearly to every one of our 50 senators that Republicans won't join us. And yet the importance of voting rights, if anything, has strengthened in the minds of everybody,"" Schumer told a news conference. ""Republicans refusing to support anything on voting rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing."" 
But if the next attempt is to avoid the same fate as the previous one, some Democrats, including Senator Patty Murray, have suggested carving out an exception to the filibuster rule. Still, other Democrats could be an obstacle to such a move, like moderate Senator Joe Manchin who has said he opposes any exception to the filibuster.
Currently, there are 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who align themselves with Democrats in the Senate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said that voting rights are not a federal issue and should be left to the states.
The Democratic measure that Senate Republicans blocked in June would have ended partisan gerrymandering and overhauled campaign finance laws, as well as created national standards for voting registration and early voting. It passed the House of Representatives earlier this year.

Civil rights groups say Republican-led efforts to enact restrictions in a number of states would make voting more difficult for many Black and Hispanic citizens, many of whom are supporters of Democrats.
The state restrictions follow Republican former President Donald Trump's false claim that voting fraud was widespread in the 2020 election that he lost to Biden, a Democrat.

""Given the variety of criminal probes, the divergent issues, and various jurisdictions, it’s impossible to say with certainty"" whether Cuomo will be charged, Garber said. ""But resignation does take a bit of oxygen out of the wildfire that has been building for consequences for Cuomo’s actions.""
ARE THERE OBSTACLES TO A CRIMINAL CASE?
In criminal cases, the prosecution must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Deborah Tuerkheimer, a Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University law professor and former prosecutor, said Cuomo's accusers may be reluctant to put themselves through the emotional turmoil of a criminal trial if he is only charged with misdemeanors.
""It's really difficult to testify in a criminal trial,"" Tuerkheimer said.
Judith Olin (NYSE:OLN), a University at Buffalo law professor and a former New York state prosecutor who specialized in sexual assault cases, said any prosecution could face an uphill climb given the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.
WHAT ABOUT CIVIL LAWSUITS?
A lawyer for Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly last December, has said she plans to file a lawsuit against Cuomo. Other accusers could follow her lead, Rendelman said.
A landmark federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment, in the workplace.
Cuomo accusers who invoke this law would be suing the state of New York - their employer - rather than Cuomo directly, said Ann Juliano, a Villanova University law professor.
Under New York law, sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature - from sexual jokes to unwanted flirtation - that creates an offensive work environment, regardless of intent. 
Juliano said Cuomo's accusers could rely on a landmark New York law, championed by Cuomo in 2019, that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their cases in court. Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is ""severe and pervasive.""
To prevail in a civil lawsuit, Cuomo's accusers would only need to convince jurors that there was a greater than 50% chance that their allegations were true. 
WHAT OTHER LEGAL PROBLEMS DOES CUOMO FACE?
Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether, as governor, Cuomo deliberately played down the number of deaths in nursing homes related to COVID-19. 

New York health officials released a report in July denying that their policies had caused any increase in deaths.
James, the attorney general, has also been investigating whether Cuomo misused state resources to write and promote a book he published last October about his leadership during the early months of the pandemic.

232,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate is prepared to pursue President Joe Biden’s plan to remake the economy, but an all-night voting session to approve the legislative vehicle to begin that process exposed some cracks in Democrats’ no-room-for-error majority.
Democrats largely hung together on key votes protecting the underlying budget blueprint teeing up Biden’s $3.5 trillion package -- paid for in part with tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations -- and rejected amendments opposing tax increases. The Senate passed the budget resolution on a party-line vote, shifting focus toward the House later this month.
The amendments offered during the marathon voting session, which ended about 4 a.m. Wednesday in Washington, are largely just for messaging and don’t compel Congress to act, but the vote tallies shed light on how lawmakers’ stances on specific issues and highlight areas of division.
Here are highlights from the 41 amendments offered during the Senate’s so-called vote-a-rama:
Dissenting Duo
Moderate senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia bucked their own party on several votes, demonstrating their ideological distance from colleagues on some issues. The two senators are regarded as those most likely to object to Biden’s plans and to request changes to make the bill less costly.
Manchin repeatedly voted with Republicans on some social issues, including a proposal opposing federal funding to promote “critical race theory” in schools and one to keep the Hyde Amendment, which limits federal funding for abortions.
Sinema was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans on an amendment that supported shielding family businesses from inheritance taxes, but called on the wealthy to pay their “fair share.” A similar proposal that didn’t include that reference to the wealthy passed unanimously.
After the vote, Manchin released a statement saying that he had “grave concerns” about the $3.5 trillion price tag. Sinema late last month also said in a statement that “while I will support beginning this process, I do not support a bill that costs $3.5 trillion.”
Electric Vehicles
Manchin and Sinema, along with Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly, defected from their party on a Republican proposal to recommend limits on electric-vehicle tax credits -- exposing a split on energy-policy issues ahead of tough negotiations on what Democratic leaders and the White House intend to be the most ambitious climate package in history.
Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska proposed to prohibit people making more than $100,000 a year from claiming EV tax credits and to end tax credits for EVs that cost more than $40,000 -- levels that would exclude many of the electric vehicles on the market or planned to come out in the next few years, including those promoted by Biden recently at the White House.
Fracking Fractures
Democrats also continue to be cautious about sweeping energy policy that would quickly displace legacy fossil fuels. The chamber unanimously agreed to an amendment that disapproves of the Green New Deal, the framework to overhaul the country’s energy use and convert to 100% emissions-free power sources.
Eight senators who caucus with Democrats also voted for a measure that asks the Council on Environmental Quality and Environmental Protection Agency not to issue any regulations that restrict fracking. Curbing that extraction method is a key priority for progressives, but important to Democrats who represent states like Colorado, Montana, and Pennsylvania, where it’s a lucrative industry.
‘Fund the Police’
Democrats turned tables on the GOP’s political talking point characterizing them as backing a “defund the police” campaign. All 99 senators present backed GOP Senator Tommy Tuberville’s amendment opposing defunding police, with Democratic Senator Cory Booker jumping up to shout about how the amendment was a gift to Democrats and countered the lie that any senator backed the idea.
The Senate then voted, after 1 a.m., by 95-3 in favor of Republican Josh Hawley’s amendment supporting the idea of hiring 100,000 more police officers; Democrat Dick Durbin congratulated Hawley for backing an idea written into law by then-Senator Joe Biden decades ago. Only Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Republicans Pat Toomey and Mike Lee voted against it.
Immigration Debate
Democrats were split on immigration, in several cases backing GOP proposals with the blessing of party leadership. Democrats are contemplating using the budget bill to address immigration, but divisions over how to approach the issue, along with the arcane rules governing what can qualify for inclusion in the so-called budget reconciliation process, could complicate the effort.
About half of Senate Democrats joined Republicans on an amendment from Republican Jerry Moran that supports increased immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats also overwhelmingly backed an amendment from Republican Roger Marshall that disapproves of transporting migrants without negative Covid-19 tests.
Durbin, the lead Democrat on immigration talks, railed against the proposal in a floor speech only to ultimately vote in the affirmative, along with 38 of his Democratic colleagues.

233,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden, fresh off his first major bipartisan victory, is turning to larger efforts aimed at shoring up faith in democracy and convening a summit with other world leaders later this year.
Biden, who took office in January after a hotly contested election still criticized by his rival Donald Trump and his supporters, will gather heads of state from other democratic nations for a virtual summit on Dec. 9 and 10, the White House said on Wednesday.
The summit will also include representatives of ""civil society, philanthropy, and the private sector,"" who will make commitments for a year of action, with a follow-up, in-person session one year later, it said in a statement.
""The challenge of our time is to demonstrate that democracies can deliver by improving the lives of their own people and by addressing the greatest problems facing the wider world,"" it said.
Those attending will discuss ""the challenges facing democracy so as to collectively strengthen the foundation for democratic renewal,"" focusing on ""defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting respect for human rights,"" it added.
Biden has been heavily vested in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday with 19 Republicans backing the Democratic president's plan, saying the bipartisan effort shows the United States can tackle big issues together and compete with countries like China, which have divergent political systems.
A record 155 million Americans cast ballots in the November 2020 election that Biden won by more than seven million votes. Multiple courts, state election officials and Trump's own government rejected Trump's false claims of election fraud, but Trump and his supporters have persisted in pushing baseless conspiracy theories, with his supporters leading a deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.
Western democracies cast a wary eye at the United States under Trump, who tore up traditional alliances and praised stronger ties with Russia and China. Other democratic nations have also seen their systems fray.

At home, Biden and fellow Democrats must also contend with voting rights that advocates say have been weakened by a number of blows since they were put in place during the Civil rights era of the 1960s, including two major Supreme Court rulings and new efforts under Republican-led state legislatures.
Republicans have balked at proposed legislation in Congress, arguing it would give the federal government too much control in local elections.

Prelogar, a Washington lawyer who served as an assistant to the solicitor general from 2014 to 2019, has been acting as the DOJ's representative at the nation's top court since January.
She has represented the Biden administration before in cases involving immigration, the Medicaid health insurance program, drug sentencing, political donors and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
The Justice Department's Office of the Solicitor General, handles the federal government's cases at Supreme Court.
The Harvard Law School graduate earlier worked as a clerk for then U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, who now serves as U.S. attorney general under Biden. 
Prelogar, who studied Russian and held a Fulbright fellowship in St Petersburg, also previously worked an assistant special counsel to Robert Mueller, who served as special counsel led the federal government's probe into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
She also worked as a clerk for two Supreme Court justices -- Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last year.

(Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Tuesday nominated veteran prosecutor Damian Williams to be the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, which would put him in charge of one of the most high-profile federal prosecutor offices in the country.
Biden also announced seven other U.S. attorney nominations, including the Eastern District of New York as well as the Eastern and Western districts of Virginia.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Williams would become the first Black man to oversee https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-sdny/schumer-urges-three-black-nominees-for-top-u-s-attorney-jobs-in-new-york-idUSKBN2BF2ME the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. He currently serves as chief of a securities task force in that office.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan handles many of the country's most complex prosecutions of Wall Street executives. Its cases range from insider trading and securities fraud, to corruption and terrorism cases.
It is currently investigating former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who headed the office in the 1980s, and more recently became known for representing then-President Donald Trump.
The office is also prosecuting British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, charged with helping financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein groom teenage girls for sex. 
She has pleaded not guilty.
Before Williams' current post, he prosecuted former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for bribery and extortion and also prosecuted the case against former U.S. Representative Christopher Collins for insider trading and lying to the FBI.
For U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, headquartered in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Biden nominated Breon Peace, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner with the law firm Cleary Gottlieb. 
That office is handling a high-profile criminal case against Trump's billionaire charges of illegal lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates ally Thomas Barrack, who faces charges of illegally lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Barrack has pleaded not guilty.
For the Eastern District of Virginia, an office best known for handling many of the country's high-profile terrorism and national security-related prosecutions https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN2AV2W2, Biden nominated veteran federal prosecutor Jessica Aber.

He also is tapping Christopher Kavanaugh, an assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute self-professed neo-Nazi James Fields for killing a counterprotester at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia.
The other nominees were Carla Freedman for the Northern District of New York, William Ihlenfeld for the Northern District of West Virginia, Darcie McElwee for the District of Maine, and William Thompson for the Southern District of West Virginia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a range of political experience that has taken her from a town board in upstate New York to Capitol Hill in Washington, Kathy Hochul is soon to become the first woman to serve as governor of New York.
As lieutenant governor, the No. 2 statewide position, she will take over in two weeks from Governor Andrew Cuomo, her fellow Democrat who resigned on Tuesday over a sexual harassment scandal.
""I agree with Governor Cuomo's decision to step down. It is the right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers,"" Hochul (pronounced HO-kul), 62, wrote on Twitter. 
""As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State’s 57th Governor.""
She served 14 years as a town board member in Hamburg, a town of some 55,000 people near her native Buffalo, a more-than-six-hour drive from New York City.
""She's homegrown from the town of Hamburg, and for her to be the first female governor in New York state - we just couldn't be prouder,"" said Joan Kesner, a Democrat who served alongside Hochul on the town board from 1997 to 2007.
Kesner watched her friend broker compromises between at-odds residential subdivisions and create Hamburg's first haven house for domestic violence survivors.
She said Hochul's experience working on a range of issues in her part of western New York, from waterfront revitalization to improved medical capacity and local business expansion, equipped her to serve New York, the fourth most populous U.S. state.
Steven Walters, a Republican who was Hamburg's supervisor from 2006 until 2017, said he and Hochul at times disagreed during the two years they worked together but he always found her open-minded and professional.
Walters remembered Hochul's passion for the environment and for development projects that kept wilderness intact. 
After her Hamburg experience, then-Governor Eliot Spitzer appointed Hochul clerk of Erie County. In 2008, Spitzer quit as governor over his patronage of prostitutes.
In 2011, Hochul won a special election for a U.S. congressional district no Democrat had won in 40 years. 
Although elected as lieutenant governor in 2014 on Cuomo's ticket, the two have seldom appeared together. She was almost never present at Cuomo's much publicized briefings at the start of the coronavirus crisis. 
""The lieutenant governor of New York is a relatively weak position,"" said Christina Greer, a Fordham University associate professor of political science. ""As far as some of the heavy hitting issues that are plaguing the state ... she was largely on the sidelines."" 
But her distance from Cuomo, 63, may prove to be a blessing now as well as in November 2022 if Hochul decides to run for governor.
""A lot of people are looking forward to a type of leadership that doesn't feel toxic or bullying,"" Greer said. 
Hochul issued a statement shortly after New York Attorney General Letitia James released the results https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-ag-says-probe-found-gov-cuomo-sexually-harrassed-multiple-women-broke-2021-08-03 of a five-month independent investigation that concluded Cuomo had engaged in misconduct with 11 women that violated U.S. and state laws.
""The AG's investigation has documented repulsive & unlawful behavior by the Governor towards multiple women. I believe these brave women & admire their courage coming forward,"" Hochul wrote on Twitter.

Responding to Cuomo's resignation on Tuesday, James in a statement expressed support for the soon-to-be governor. 
""I know our state is in good hands with Lieutenant Governor Hochul at the helm, and I look forward to continuing to work with her,"" James said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Next January will be the earliest possible start of any trial for members and associates of the Oath Keepers militia movement facing charges for rioting at the U.S. Capitol, giving prosecutors and defense lawyers time to examine evidence and prepare, attorneys told a court hearing on Tuesday. 
Four people connected to the right-wing Oath Keepers have already pleaded guilty to riot-related charges. Lawyers for 16 people facing felony riot charges appeared at a status hearing before U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Tuesday.
Eugene Rossi, a lawyer for defendant William Isaacs, said prosecutors had deluged defense lawyers with an ""avalanche of documents"" like the flow ""out of a fire hydrant"" and extensive videos from Jan. 6, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump sought to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory.
Michelle Peterson, a public defender representing accused rioter Jessica Watkins, who is still in pre-trial custody, complained that there were areas of the Capitol without government video cameras but where amateur videographers may have captured ""exculpatory"" behavior by some participants.
A government affidavit said defendants traveled to Washington carrying paramilitary gear and wearing clothes with Oath Keepers insignias. At the Capitol, investigators said, 10 defendants formed a ""stack"" which marched single file up stairs into the building, with hands on the person in front, then forced their way through the central Rotunda.

More than 535 people face charges from Jan 6. 
Also on Tuesday, Virginia residents Douglas Sweet, 59, and Cindy Fitchett, 60, who posted a video of herself in the Capitol declaring ""Patriots Arise"", pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols to misdemeanor charges carrying maximum six month prison terms. Sentencing was set for November. Illinois resident Bradley Rukstales also signed a plea agreement, but it was not officially entered.

(Reuters) - For much of last year, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was perhaps the most trusted politician in America; his daily televised coronavirus briefings, accompanied by a PowerPoint slide deck, made him a widely admired source of comfort in his home state and beyond.
On Tuesday, however, Cuomo https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-governor-cuomo-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-findings-2021-08-10resigned in the wake of a report by New York Attorney General Letitia James that found he sexually harassed 11 women. That report created a tidal wave of political pressure on Cuomo, with calls from President Joe Biden and others to step aside.
Cuomo's televised announcement capped a stunning fall from grace for a man who had gone from a national party leader to a political https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cuomos-resignation-casts-shadow-over-four-decade-political-career-2021-08-10 pariah in the span of a few months.
The scandal erupted in February, when two former aides accused the governor of sexually harassing them. Several other women came forward soon after that with their own accounts of misconduct.
In his remarks on Tuesday, Cuomo, 63, again denied all of the sexual harassment accusations but said the report and an investigation by state lawmakers - which appeared likely to lead to impeachment - would create too much of a political and legal distraction for him to continue governing.
""I think given the circumstances the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to government - and therefore that's what I'll do,"" he said. 
Prominent members of his own party previously called on him to step down, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York's senior U.S. senator, and almost the entire state congressional delegation.
Cuomo had been expected to pursue a bid for a fourth term in 2022. 
MUST-WATCH TV
His coronavirus briefings last year, often carried live by nearly every television network, became appointment television at a time when President Donald Trump, a Republican, was struggling to reassure the public and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was confined to his Delaware home.
Still, Cuomo faced some criticism for not closing down the state sooner, as well as scrutiny over whether his administration sought to conceal the extent of nursing home deaths. Cuomo defended his response to the pandemic and denied any wrongdoing with respect to death statistics.
The New York City-born Cuomo began his political career as a top campaign adviser to his father, Mario Cuomo, who served three terms as New York governor from 1983 to 1994.
After a stint as a prosecutor and lawyer, Andrew Cuomo joined President Bill Clinton's administration and eventually became U.S. secretary of housing and urban development. He also married into a political dynasty when he wed Kerry Kennedy in 1990, though they would divorce in 2005. Cuomo's brother, Chris, is a high-profile anchor for CNN.
Andrew Cuomo's first foray into statewide politics went poorly, when he lost the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2002 despite strong fundraising. In 2006, he successfully ran for attorney general, leading some Democratic politicians to label him the state's ""comeback kid.""
He was largely viewed as a ideological centrist - in 2018, he beat back a liberal challenge from ""Sex and the City"" actor Cynthia Nixon - though he has moved left in recent years with the rest of the Democratic Party.
As his power grew, Cuomo built a reputation as an ambitious, ruthless politician who was willing to retaliate against perceived enemies and whose abrasive style in private often alienated others.
Earlier this year, Cuomo called a state assemblyman, Ron Kim, who had criticized the governor over the nursing home crisis, and threatened to attack him publicly, according to Kim. Cuomo would do just that a week later at a news briefing.
His years-long feud with liberal New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio gave the city's tabloids plenty of fodder, from the serious to the ridiculous. In 2016, the pair fought over the fate of a wayward deer that had found its way into Manhattan; when the deer died, each administration blamed the other.
At times their animosity caused confusion during the pandemic. In the spring of 2020, de Blasio announced city schools would close for the rest of the year, only to be corrected by Cuomo, who said only the governor had the authority to do so. 

""Cut the crap,"" a frustrated Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, implored both men in a Twitter post. Adams, now the Democratic mayoral nominee, is widely expected to win a November election and succeed the term-limited de Blasio.
Cuomo had weathered other potential scandals. In 2014, he disbanded an anti-corruption panel only nine months after he convened it, triggering a U.S. Justice Department inquiry. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan eventually concluded there was insufficient evidence to show any crimes occurred.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The internal watchdog for the National Security Agency (NSA) said on Tuesday it was launching an inquiry into allegations that the agency had improperly spied on a member of the U.S. news media.
The inspector general's office did not identify the reporter or media outlet at the heart of its review, but the development comes a few months after Fox News conservative host Tucker Carlson claimed he had heard from a whistleblower who told him the NSA was monitoring his communications in a plot to leak them and force him off the air.
In late June, the NSA took the unusual step https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-intelligence-agency-says-it-isnt-spying-foxs-tucker-carlson-2021-06-30 of publicly denying those allegations.
""This allegation is untrue. Tucker Carlson has never been an intelligence target of the Agency and the NSA has never had any plans to try to take his program off the air,"" the NSA said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Inspector General Robert Storch said in a written statement his office ""is examining NSA's compliance with applicable legal authorities and Agency policies and procedures regarding collection, analysis, reporting, and dissemination activities, including unmasking procedures, and whether any such actions were based upon improper considerations.""
The inspector general's office declined to comment further.
The Wall Street Journal quoted an unidentified person saying the review concerns Carlson.

Fox News, a unit of Fox Corp, is ""gratified"" to learn the alleged surveillance ""will now be independently investigated,"" a spokesperson said. ""As we have said, for the NSA to unmask Tucker Carlson or any journalist attempting to secure a newsworthy interview is entirely unacceptable.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday delivered a victory for President Joe Biden's Democrats, passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill with bipartisan support, but the newly minted leader's most challenging days are just ahead.
The 69-30 vote https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-poised-pass-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-debate-35-trillion-budget-2021-08-10 for one of the most far-reaching bills https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-us-senates-bipartisan-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-03 in decades to improve and expand transportation systems, high-speed internet, drinking water and school facilities extended a string of victories Schumer has celebrated since becoming Senate majority leader in January.
Working in tandem with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the 70-year-old New Yorker helped Biden get his presidency off the ground with the March enactment of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. 
By midyear a COVID-19 hate crimes measure had also passed, along with bipartisan legislation helping the United States compete against China, especially in technology. 
Now comes the harder part, as Schumer plunges his 50-member caucus -- exactly half the Senate -- into partisan warfare. It will be a drive to hand Biden $3.5 trillion in ""human infrastructure https://www.reuters.com/world/us/paid-leave-clean-energy-preschool-democrats-35-trln-plan-2021-08-09"" spending.
Republicans have made clear they will not back that wide-ranging measure, which includes funds to fight income inequality and climate change, while expanding social welfare programs. It will hit on a series of hot-button issues in the run-up to the 2022 elections that will determine whether Democrats keep their slim margins of control in Congress.
""A united (Democratic) caucus is going to be absolutely crucial or a significant part of the Democratic agenda is going to fail,"" said Jim Manley, a former Senate Democratic leadership aide.
'NEGOTIATING SKILLS'
With some maverick Democrats, especially Senator Joe Manchin, poised to pick apart bits, Manley added that Schumer's ""negotiating skills are going to be at a premium in weeks to come."" In all likelihood, he said, Pelosi and Biden will have to scale back some items to win the backing of moderates.
But with all 50 Democratic and independents' votes needed for victory under a special procedure known as ""reconciliation,"" they must also be careful to keep influential progressives aboard, such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who work in concert with a vibrant House progressive caucus.
The battle is expected to rage for months, testing Schumer like no other time in his 40-year congressional career.
At stake this week is a budget measure providing the framework setting the stage for the colossal bill to be tackled this fall.
Other major bills that could surface this fall include a voting-rights measure as well as funding the federal government beyond the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.
It is a daunting agenda, but one that even some Republicans say suits Schumer's frenetic personality.
""He walked into this job with strong relationships on both sides"" of the aisle following four years as minority leader, said a former Senate Republican leadership aide, who added, ""that allows him to operate in a sphere of good faith.""
The low point in Schumer's Senate leadership career came in early 2018 when Democrats failed to win concessions from Republican then-President Donald Trump during a budget fight for protecting young immigrants living in the United States illegally.
In protest, Democrats uncharacteristically triggered a partial government shutdown that lasted a weekend before Schumer's will collapsed, angering liberals.
More than three years later, Schumer was buffeted during the recent roller-coaster $1 trillion infrastructure negotiations. But the result was different.
""He's had to sit back and watch multiple bipartisan groups come up and fall apart and people telling him to stop waiting around"" for a bipartisan deal, said former Schumer spokesman Matt House.
That, House said, forced the normally hard-charging Schumer to be patient, which paid off during Tuesday's victorious vote after months of haggling.
When he's not in Washington, Schumer is likely to be traveling across New York state, from his political base in New York City to Republican-dominated rural counties upstate.
Nowhere does he seem more at ease than on his solitary bicycle rides through the neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he grew up and still resides. He has described those forays as ""better than any movie.""
Local media recount him crashing a barbecue along the way to talk to constituents -- and grab some food. It's like the Schumer who schmoozes fellow senators in the Senate gym or the Schumer who attempts to offer a humorous quip at a press conference that falls flat, only to pivot into touting his party's goals amid messy legislating.

It's all part of what supporters describe as the ""authentic"" Schumer. 
""You haven't quite lived until you've seen Senator Schumer on the dance floor,"" Manley observed. ""It ain't done well, dude. But he throws himself into it.""

244,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers on Tuesday vetoed six voting restriction bills passed by Wisconsin's Republican-controlled legislature, blocking the latest Republican effort to limit access to the polls in a politically divided U.S. state.
""These bills add unnecessary and damaging hurdles for Wisconsinites to participate in our democracy,"" Evers, a Democrat, said at a news conference where he officially vetoed the bills, flanked by a group of voter advocates.
The Republican speaker of Wisconsin's State Assembly, Representative Robin Vos, said in a statement on Tuesday that he was ""disappointed"" by Evers' move because the bills would have ""closed loopholes, standardized procedures, established uniformity, guaranteed only the voter can correct their own ballot and protected votes of seniors in long-term care.""
The bills Evers vetoed would have limited how and by whom an absentee ballot could be returned, curtailed municipalities' ability to organize ballot collection events, and added voter identification requirements for voters confined to their homes due to age or disability. 
Wisconsin's State Assembly is one of several Republican-controlled state legislatures that have pushed new voting restrictions in the name of enhancing election security, citing former President Donald Trump's false claims that his November election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Similar bills have failed in other states with Democratic governors, such as Pennsylvania, where Democratic Governor Tom Wolf vetoed a bill in June that would have imposed new voter identification requirements. 

But laws limiting voting access have passed in several states whose governor's office and legislature are controlled by Republicans. 
The biggest showdown is currently underway in Texas, where Democratic lawmakers fled the state in July to prevent a special session of the legislature from achieving the quorum needed to pass voting restrictions backed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate has set a Tuesday vote on passage of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that is one of President Joe Biden's top priorities, and then will immediately begin to debate a more far-reaching $3.5 trillion bill.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced late on Monday that a week-long debate on the bipartisan bill will conclude at 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) Tuesday when a vote is held on passage, which is expected.
The Senate is then expected to vote to begin debate of the larger bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/paid-leave-clean-energy-preschool-democrats-35-trln-plan-2021-08-09 - a budget blueprint that is a key goal for progressive Democrats.
Documents unveiled earlier on Monday showed that it would set the stage for legislation later this year providing tax incentives for ""clean"" manufacturing, making community college free for two years and providing a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrant workers.
The budget plan also envisions new federal aid for social programs, including home healthcare for the elderly.
The first bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-us-senates-bipartisan-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-03, which is 2,702 pages, sits atop Biden's domestic agenda and includes $550 billion in new spending on roads, bridges and internet access.
""This is a very good day. We have come to an agreement after all the long, hard negotiating,"" a smiling Schumer said of Tuesday's vote.
The $1 trillion infrastructure bill is popular among many lawmakers in both parties because of the federal dollars it would deliver to their home states. Polls also show that Americans at large are supportive of it.
Democrats are aiming to debate and pass the nonbinding $3.5 trillion resolution in coming days, which would serve as a framework for more detailed, binding legislation later this year. Republicans have strenuously objected to the size and cost of the follow-up package, which Democrats aim to pass without their votes through a process called ""budget reconciliation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senates-reconciliation-process-its-not-way-it-sounds-2021-06-16.""
PARLIAMENTARIAN'S POWER
The ambitious goals of the $3.5 trillion budget plan will be reviewed by the Senate parliamentarian, who has the power to strip out provisions found to be at odds with Senate rules. The full Senate could, however, vote to overrule such decisions.
That wide-ranging bill would include about $726 billion to provide universal preschool for 3- and 4-year olds as well as free community college, $332 billion for affordable housing and $198 billion for clean energy. 
A Democratic memo said the $3.5 trillion cost would be fully paid for by a combination of tax increases, savings in federal health-care programs and projected long-term economic growth. The latter claim is debated by many economists who often disagree over the accuracy of the economic impact stemming from new policies enacted by Washington. 
There would be no tax increases for those making under $400,000 a year, Democrats said.
The tax increases, which already have been previewed by the Biden administration and Senate Democrats, would hit high-income earners and be coupled with beefed-up IRS tax enforcement. The measure also calls for a ""carbon polluter import fee.""
The plan would extend a new, expanded child tax credit that progressives wanted to make permanent. And it would provide ""relief"" to tax filers bumping up against a cap on a state and local tax deduction tightened by a 2017 Republican-backed tax law.
Still unclear was whether Democrats will attach a debt limit increase to the reconciliation bill that will be developed in coming weeks or seek another way of raising Washington's nearly exhausted borrowing authority. The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, has said his party will not vote for raising the debt limit.
""Democrats want Republicans to help them raise the debt limit so they can keep spending historic sums of money with zero Republican input and zero Republican votes,"" McConnell said. ""So our friends across the aisle should not expect traditional bipartisan borrowing to finance their non-traditional, reckless taxing and spending spree. That's not how it's going to work."" 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday again urged Congress to take quick action in a bipartisan way.

Passing any major legislation is difficult given the 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, with Democrats claiming a majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote. Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives.
If the $1 trillion bill is approved by the Senate, as expected, the House would still have to debate and vote on it, sometime after it returns in late September from its summer break.

(Reuters) - Four members of the U.S. Congress working to abolish capital punishment wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday to ask that he order Department of Justice attorneys to stop seeking the death penalty.
Garland has already ordered a pause on scheduling execution dates for any of the 46 men on federal death row, saying in his July announcement a moratorium was necessary while his department reviewed whether the government's protocols for capital punishment were fair and humane.
The four Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives say he and his department's attorneys should go further and ""halt all participation in the capital punishment system.""
""In conjunction with the moratorium on executions, Department of Justice prosecutors must stop seeking the death penalty,"" Adriano Espaillat, Ayanna Pressley, Jerrold Nadler and Cori Bush wrote in their letter. ""The inconsistent logic of halting executions while, at the same time, advocating for its use has grave consequences.""
Espaillat and Pressley have sponsored separate bills that would abolish the federal death penalty. 
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in January as the first president to promise to end capital punishment, but has not yet issued any orders related to the practice. Most other countries have outlawed capital punishment, as have a majority of U.S. states.
The Justice Department previously had a de facto moratorium on carrying out executions during the administration of Barack Obama, but capital punishment prosecutions continued and the federal death row grew larger.
Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, revived the use of capital punishment in an extraordinary spree of 13 executions over his final months in office - 12 men and one woman all convicted of murders and sentenced to death in federal courts. Prior to Trump, a Republican, the U.S. government had executed only three prisoners since 1963.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent months, the department has directed attorneys to withdraw capital punishment requests before federal courts in seven prosecutions, the New York Times reported. 

The lawmakers ask in their letter why those cases were chosen, and whether any broader policy exists.
The department has not withdrawn efforts to seek capital punishment in other cases, including that of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing three people and wounding hundreds. Department attorneys are preparing to argue before the Supreme Court later this year that it should reinstate Tsarnaev's death sentence, which was overturned by a lower court.

247,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 08:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A senior aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned on Sunday in the wake of a state attorney general's report that the governor sexually harassed 11 women.
Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor, was linked in the report to efforts to cover up the governor's actions and retaliate against one of his accusers. Her name was mentioned 187 times in the 168-page report that was released on Tuesday.
""Personally, the past 2 years have been emotionally and mentally trying. I am forever grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such talented colleagues on behalf of our state,"" DeRosa said in a statement.
The report found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to 11 women in violation of the law, prompting local prosecutors to launch a criminal investigation and re-igniting calls for him to resign or be impeached.
Cuomo has thus far resisted widespread calls for him to step down, including from fellow Democrats such as President Joe Biden, but he could soon face impeachment and removal from office by state lawmakers.
The New York State Assembly's Judiciary Committee has scheduled a meeting to address impeachment proceedings on Monday at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT).
Meanwhile, a former assistant who filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo last week on accusations he groped her in the Executive Mansion in Albany is speaking publicly for the first time in a televised interview to be broadcast on Monday, saying the governor ""needs to be held accountable.""
Brittany Commisso, one of the 11 women Cuomo is accused of sexually harassing, was identified only as ""executive assistant #1"" in the report.
She told state investigators that Cuomo fondled her breast on one occasion, the most serious allegation the governor faces. She also said he rubbed her backside while taking a photo.
Last week, she filed a criminal complaint with the Albany sheriff's office. The sheriff, Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), told reporters on Saturday his agency and the county district attorney's office would conduct a thorough investigation before determining whether a criminal charge is supported.
In an interview with CBS News and the Albany Times-Union that is scheduled to air on Monday morning, Commisso said she filed the report to hold Cuomo responsible for his actions.
""What he did to me was a crime,"" she said in an excerpt released by CBS on Sunday. ""He broke the law.""
Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing, though he has acknowledged that his efforts to be affectionate with people he encounters may have made some people uncomfortable.
His lawyer, Rita Glavin, told reporters on Friday that Commisso's account was fabricated, citing emails and other documentary evidence she said undermines her story.
In another excerpt released by CBS, Commisso said occasional hugs and kisses on the cheek escalated when one time Cuomo quickly turned his head and kissed her on the lips.

Yet she ""didn't say anything"" at the time, Commisso said.
""People don't understand that this is the governor of the state of New York. There are troopers that are outside of the mansion and there are some mansion staff. Those troopers that are there, they are not there to protect me. They are there to protect him,"" Commisso said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump mounted an intense pressure campaign on the U.S. Justice Department to overturn his election defeat in his final weeks in office, the department's head during that time testified to lawmakers, a senior Senate Democrat said on Sunday.
Former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen provided ""invaluable"" testimony during seven hours of closed-door testimony on Saturday, in which he implicated Trump in an attempt to subvert the election result, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin told CNN's ""State of the Union.""
According to Durbin, Rosen testified that Trump directly pressured him to falsely assert that continuing election fraud investigations cast doubt on President Joe Biden's victory.
""It was real. Very real. And it was very specific,"" Durbin said of Trump's pressure on Rosen. ""The former president is not subtle when he wants something.""
Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, praised Rosen, a conservative lawyer, for his voluntary cooperation with the committee's ongoing investigation into Trump's actions after the election.
""I have to say history is going to very kind to Mr. Rosen when this is all over. When he was initially appointed, I didn't think that was the case. I was wrong,"" Durbin said, adding: ""It's a good thing for America we had someone like Rosen in that position.""
Rosen's testimony came a week after a House of Representatives committee released Justice Department documents showing Trump had urged top officials last year to falsely claim his election defeat was ""corrupt.""
""Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen,"" Trump told Rosen, referring to Republicans, in a Dec. 27 phone call, according to handwritten notes taken by a Rosen aide.
The notes showed Rosen told Trump the department could not and would not ""change the outcome of the election.""
Durbin said in the CNN interview that his committee also wants testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who Rosen replaced during the final weeks of Trump's presidency.
Barr stepped down in December, shortly after the Electoral College confirmed Trump’s loss to Biden.
Barr had angered Trump by not supporting his false claims that the Nov. 3 election result had been tainted by widespread fraud. Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's administration rejected those claims as unfounded.
Durbin said he also wants to hear from former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, who reportedly plotted with Trump to try to oust Rosen so he could take over the Justice Department.
""I would like to bring in Jeffrey Clark, for example,"" Durbin said. ""He was the heir apparent in Trump's mind if Rosen was not going to do his bidding. And Rosen stood fast and didn't.""

When asked if Trump engaged in an attempted coup, Durbin said: ""It was leading up to that process.""
Durbin declined to say whether Trump should face criminal charges for his efforts to subvert the election, saying it was too early in the investigation to answer that question.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted to advance a $1 trillion infrastructure package on Saturday but remained on a slow path toward passage with two Republicans openly opposing behind-the-scenes efforts to wrap up work on one of President Joe Biden's top priorities. 
In a 67-27 vote demonstrating broad support, senators agreed to limit debate on the legislation, the biggest investment in decades in America's roads, bridges, airports and waterways.
Eighteen of 50 Senate Republicans voted to move the legislation forward, with Senators John Cornyn and Deb Fischer backing the package for the first time. 
But on Saturday evening, progress stalled on an agreement on amendments that could have allowed the Senate to speed up consideration of the legislation.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate would convene at noon ET (1600 GMT) on Sunday to resume consideration of the infrastructure bill. ""Hopefully we can come to some agreement tomorrow,"" he said on the Senate floor. 
Without that agreement, the Senate will hold a next procedural vote on Sunday evening, a Senate Democratic aide said.
Republican Senator Bill Hagerty took to the Senate floor to underscore his opposition to expediting the process, saying the legislation would add to the national debt and set the stage for Democrats to move forward with a separate $3.5 trillion spending package which Republicans vehemently oppose.
""There's absolutely no reason for rushing this,"" Hagerty, a freshman senator who was former President Donald Trump's ambassador to Japan, said in a floor speech. ""While I believe in hard infrastructure, I cannot participate in doing it this way.""
With the consent of all 100 senators, the chamber could have moved through amendments to passage later on Saturday. Otherwise, passage could take until Monday or Tuesday.
Hagerty, who voted against Saturday's measure, first registered opposition to an expedited path after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday the legislation would increase federal budget deficits by $256 billion over 10 years.
The CBO analysis https://www.reuters.com/article/biden-infrastructure-costs/factbox-cbo-estimate-leaves-u-s-budget-shortfall-for-infrastructure-bill-backers-idUSL1N2PC30J did not include $57 billion in added revenue that senators estimate Washington would collect over the long term from the economic growth benefits of infrastructure projects. It also did not count $53 billion in unused federal supplemental unemployment funds to be returned from states.
Multiple bipartisan groups of senators on Saturday could be seen clustered around Hagerty, at times gesticulating. They included Republicans Rob Portman and Lisa Murkowski, Democrats Joe Manchin and Chris Murphy and staffers for top Republican Mitch McConnell.
""Part of the conversation is senators saying to Hagerty, you realize that what you’re doing is making it impossible for me to get my amendment, because if you insist on the whole thing and you don’t compromise on timing, then nobody gets an amendment. And we pass the bill,"" Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a Biden ally, told reporters. 
OVERDUE INVESTMENTS
Passage would be a major victory for Schumer, Biden and a bipartisan group of senators who spent months crafting the package, and would send the bill on to the U.S. House of Representatives.
Biden tweeted his support ahead of the vote, saying the ""once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure"" would create good-paying jobs refurbishing America's roads, bridges, water systems and electrical grid.
""We can't afford not to do it,"" the president said. ""We can't just build back to the way things were before COVID-19, we have to build back better.""
McConnell also signaled his support before voting for the bill.
""Republicans and Democrats have radically different visions these days, but both those visions include physical infrastructure that works for all of our citizens,"" McConnell said in a speech. ""The investments this bill will make are not just necessary, in many cases, they are overdue. Our country has real needs in this area.""

As he left the Capitol, McConnell told Reuters, ""We'll be back at it tomorrow.""

Biden chose Scott Miller, an LGBTQ activist and philanthropist, for the top U.S. diplomatic role in Switzerland as well as Liechtenstein.
Switzerland has often served as an intermediary between the United States and Iran, which are deeply at odds over issues including sanctions and talks to revive a nuclear deal. Switzerland also played host to Biden's June 16 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Biden also selected Marc Stanley, a Dallas-based civil trial lawyer who helped organize attorneys in support of Biden's presidential campaign, as ambassador to Argentina. The country is trying to engineer a recovery from a three-year-long recession exacerbated by the pandemic in 2020.

Taiwan is excluded from most global organizations such as the WHO, the U.N. health agency, because of the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces and not a separate country.
The legislation, passed by unanimous consent, was sponsored by Senators Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The two are also co-chairmen of the Senate Taiwan Caucus.
""The U.S. must continue to stand by Taiwan, and do more to reaffirm our support for our ally’s international engagement,"" Menendez said in a statement on Friday.

The measure directs the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for obtaining observer status at the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO.
The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee approved a similar bill earlier this year, but there has been no word on when the measure might come up for a vote in the full House.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat with a track record of winning districts with large numbers of conservative voters, on Friday launched a bid for the U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania held by retiring Republican Senator Pat Toomey.
Lamb's entry shakes up an already crowded Democratic field seeking the party's nomination for what could be one of the most competitive races in the 2022 congressional elections.
It also highlights divisions within the Democratic party.
Lamb will face Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman - known for his advocacy of progressive policies like universal health care as well as for his casual dress, tattoos and 6-foot 9-inch (2.06 m) frame - in the Democrats' nomination contest next June.
Lamb has said progressives in his party have veered too far to the left, such as by pushing police funding cuts to address police brutality and systemic racism. 
""You have this progressive versus centrist battle going on,"" said Jessica Taylor, a political analyst at the Cook Political Report, which rates the Pennsylvania race as a likely toss-up between whichever candidates the Democrats and Republicans ultimately field.
Moderate Democrats have recently prevailed over progressives in high-profile contests including a special Ohio primary for a U.S. House seat and the New York mayoral primary.
Other Democratic candidates for the Pennsylvania Senate seat include Valerie Arkoosh, who chairs the county board of commissioners for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
While Democrats lost ground in 2020 congressional races even as Democrat Joe Biden won the presidency, Lamb has won three straight elections in tightly contested swing districts. 
Taylor said the Pennsylvania contest is likely the best chance Democrats have to pick up a Republican-held seat in the Senate, which Democrats currently control by the narrowest of margins.
On the Republican side of the contest, fealty to former President Donald Trump promises to be a key issue in the party's nomination contest. 
Republican candidate and conservative commentator Sean Parnell has backed Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's winning of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential contest. Businessman Jeff Bartos, another leading Republican candidate, has said he voted for Trump, but he has not backed Trump's baseless claims that Biden's victory owed to fraud.
In a video announcing his candidacy, Lamb said the election would be a key battleground for heading off Trump's influence.

""The other side denies reality and worships Trump. They're making it harder to vote and lying about our elections,"" he said.
Fetterman has dominated the field in fundraising, ending June with $3 million in the bank. Lamb had $1.7 million while Bartos had $1.8 million and Parnell about $600,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A battle to win a path to citizenship for ""Dreamer"" immigrants, following two decades of defeat, is underway in the U.S. Senate as Democrats face tough challenges on several fronts, including within their own ranks.
For the millions of immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas, an obscure Senate procedure known as ""budget reconciliation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senates-reconciliation-process-its-not-way-it-sounds-2021-06-16"" could determine their future this year.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hopes to use it to bypass the need for Republican support on legislation that would have Dreamers and possibly millions of other immigrants hitch a ride toward citizenship via a $3.5 trillion measure they call ""human infrastructure"" investments.
The stakes could not be higher. ""If we don't have reconciliation, I'm not sure there's a pathway forward,"" said Democratic Senator Robert Menendez.
Separate efforts to craft bipartisan legislation to protect the immigrants who were shielded from deportation under former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program have collapsed, said a Senate aide who asked not to be identified.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) reflected the opposition from many in his party to any reforms until immigrant arrivals at the southern border slow. ""I'm not willing to provide legal status to anybody with a broken porous border because it will create more problems. Everybody will come and want to be the next generation of DACA,"" he said.
To move ahead, Schumer must keep his 50 Democrats and independents united on reconciliation this autumn. Opposition by any would sink the effort, along with Dreamers' hopes of living normal lives in the United States.
Moderate Democratic Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia already stand out as potential obstacles. But other Democrats facing re-election next year may need convincing, too.
Complicating matters is the politically difficult task of pursuing reforms when migrant border arrests are at 20-year highs, fueling Republican attacks on President Joe Biden.
Greisa Martinez Rosas, executive director for the immigrant-youth group United We Dream was in Washington in 2010 when the Dream Act failed.
""I remember crying with hundreds of young undocumented people,"" she said.
Besides Dreamers, Democrats might include farmworkers, healthcare and other employees deemed ""essential"" and those who fled wars and natural disasters -- a potential total of over 6 million people, according to experts.
A July court ruling striking down DACA, which currently protects around 640,000 young immigrants from deportation, has made a legislative remedy all the more pressing. Their status was maintained pending other court proceedings but new enrollments were halted.
Already, there are political cracks in the Democratic effort.
""I'm totally supportive of immigration,"" Manchin told Reuters when asked about attaching reforms to the massive infrastructure bill.
But he quickly added he supports the Senate's ""Byrd rule,"" allowing ""extraneous matter"" to be removed from reconciliation bills by the Senate parliamentarian's office.
Early this year, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough barred a minimum wage increase from being included in a COVID-19 aid bill. Attempts to overrule the decision failed.
Many Democrats argue a properly drafted immigration provision can survive parliamentary challenges like an immigrant visa measure did in 2005. 
Sinema told the Arizona Republic newspaper she opposes the $3.5 trillion plan because of its high cost. Aides would not say whether she supports including immigrant protections in infrastructure legislation.
THE LURE OF RECONCILIATION
Talks between Senate Democrats and Republicans have failed to produce a bipartisan bill, fueling Democrats' go-it-alone approach through reconciliation.
""I have several (Republicans) who are just determined to stop whatever bill is offered"" under conventional legislative procedures, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said in a hallway interview.
That leaves all eyes on the parliamentarian, who in coming months is expected to decide whether to allow such sweeping immigration reforms.While voters largely support helping certain immigrants seeking legal protection from deportation, a July Reuters/Ipsos poll found only about 8% see immigration as a top priority.

Republican Senator John Cornyn, who has opposed some past reform efforts, now wants a stripped-down bill giving permanent legal status to the 640,000 Dreamers protected by DACA, leaving many others behind. Durbin rejected that idea.
""We've been talking about this for the entire time I've been here in the Senate,"" said Cornyn, who became a senator in 2002. ""And there's never any action.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's Save America fundraising committee has raised more than $90 million since his election defeat last year, one of the biggest hauls by any Republican group.
The massive sum illustrates the former president's grip on the party but also poses a problem - Trump's war chest is so large that even if the committee were to make the $5,000 maximum donation to a Republican in every congressional election it would take decades to spend it.
But a disclosure filed by Save America on Saturday highlights what experts expect will be a primary outlay: It could fund years of Trump rallies, preparing for a possible 2024 White House run while ostensibly helping other candidates.
Campaign finance experts say that under Federal Election Commission rules, Save America can fund Trump's political travel and activities, but not his presidential campaign should he launch a bid, something he has yet to do. 
Save America spent more than $700,000 on events in the first half of 2021, according to the FEC filing.
The spending, among the largest expenditures made by the committee, helped pay for his first post-White House rally https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-revenge-tour-kicks-off-with-saturday-rally-ohio-2021-06-26 in Wellington, Ohio, in June, as well as prepayments for a July rally in Sarasota, Florida, and a news conference at his New Jersey golf course, Trump's office said.
The rally on June 26, attended by close to 30,000 supporters, marked a return to the freewheeling format Trump relished during his presidency: speeches before big crowds.
An aggressive schedule of rallies could burn through many millions of dollars, while also remaining within campaign finance rules so long as the events support other candidates, said Michael Beckel, research director at Issue One, a nonpartisan group that advocates for campaign finance reform.
""There's a lot that he could do with $90 million to bolster his own brand,"" Beckel said.
Trump's war chest rivals those held by the Republican party's biggest fundraising committees. In the first six months of this year, Save America raised $62 million, compared to $85 million by the Republican National Committee and $79 million by the party's committee that supports congressional candidates.
Trump also controls his former campaign's fundraising committee, which this year has aimed most of its $13 million in spending at covering legal fees https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-raises-big-money-early-2021-doesnt-spend-much-2021-08-01 and Trump's efforts to reverse his November election loss.
NO CONTRIBUTIONS YET
With vast funds at his disposal, Trump will need to find ways to support other Republican candidates.
Other Trump-aligned groups have made large outlays in recent weeks along those lines. One last month made a last-minute $100,000 TV ad buy to help a candidate he had endorsed in a U.S. House of Representatives race in Texas, who lost her race https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-backed-candidate-ballot-us-house-runoff-texas-2021-07-27, and also spent over $400,000 in support of a House candidate in Ohio, who won his Tuesday primary https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congressional-elections-ohio-test-trump-clout-progressive-influence-2021-08-03.
The Save America committee would have no limits on such spending as long as it was not coordinated with allied campaigns. 
But it has yet to make any such expenditures, according to the disclosure which covered its activities through June. The filing showed no contributions to candidates, though a Trump spokesperson said $5,000 checks were sent in July to candidates he has endorsed. 
After next year's congressional elections, when the Democrats' razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress will be on the line, it could be harder for Save America to argue that its rallies serve interests other than Trump's, said Paul Ryan, an attorney at Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that advocates for government reform.
""It will be incumbent on the Federal Election Commission to crack down and declare that an illegal use of non-candidate funds for a presidential campaign,"" Ryan said. 
At the Ohio rally, Trump touted his support for Republicans Max Miller and Mike Carey, who are seeking seats in the U.S. House. But he spoke at greater length about his own presidency and the shortcomings of President Joe Biden, while hinting he could be on the ballot in 2024.
Trump's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
Save America's biggest outlay in early 2021 was a $1 million contribution to a pro-Trump policy group whose leadership includes veterans of Trump's administration. 
The committee also spent more than $65,000 at Trump hotels.

That raises additional concerns, said Erin Chlopak, director of campaign finance strategy at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for strict enforcement of campaign finance laws. 
""It's not just paying for fancy dinners or lodging, it's having the double effect that the person using that donated money is also personally profiting off of it,"" Chlopak said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday honored police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol against insurrectionists on Jan. 6 by signing legislation that awarded them Congressional Gold Medals and urging the country not to rewrite the history of that day.
The legislation, passed by the Senate earlier this week, honors members of the Capitol Police and Washington's Metropolitan Police Department who fought with a mob of then President Donald Trump's supporters as they attempted to overturn his election defeat.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held an emotional ceremony in the White House Rose Garden with several police officers and lawmakers to commemorate the signing.
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, following a fiery speech in which he repeated his false claims of election fraud. Biden, who beat Trump in the November election, was inaugurated on Jan. 20.
""While the attack on our values and our votes shocked and saddened the nation, our democracy did survive. It did. Truth defeated lies. We did overcome,"" Biden said, giving credit to the men and women of law enforcement. 
Four people died on the day of the violence. A Capitol Police officer attacked by protesters died the following day. Four police officers who guarded the building have since died by suicide. More than 100 officers were injured.
The law will place the medals in four locations — Capitol Police headquarters, the Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Capitol and the Smithsonian Institution.
Biden addressed attempts by some Republican lawmakers to downplay or outright deny the violence of the insurrection.

""Fellow Americans, the tragedy that day deserves the truth, above all else. We cannot allow history to be rewritten. We cannot allow the heroism of these officers to be forgotten,"" he said.
Harris called the officers heroes.

The bipartisan Cambodia Democracy and Human Rights Act planned by Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Dick Durbin and Republican Marco Rubio would also require the U.S. president to submit a report to Congress on China's activities in Cambodia assessing whether this had caused a deterioration of democracy and human rights.
A statement from Markey's office said sanctions would include blocking of assets and that the bill - an earlier version of which was introduced in the previous Congress and passed the House - would codify exiting visa restrictions on Cambodian officials.
It would also allow the suspension of sanctions if the president certified that Cambodia was ""making meaningful progress towards ending government efforts to undermine democracy, ending related human rights violations, and conducting free and fair elections.""
Markey and Rubio focused their criticism on Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power for more than 35 years.
""This legislation makes clear that the United States will not stand by as Hun Sen and his cronies corrupt Cambodian democracy, persecute and jail opposition and political activists, target free speech and independent media, and enrich themselves through rampant corruption,"" Markey said in the statement.
Rubio referred to Hun Sen as a ""dictator"" who had cracked down on opponents, including the U.S. radio station Radio Free Asia. He said Cambodia ""continues to backslide"" after making progress in earlier decades toward democratization.
In June, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman expressed concern during a visit to Cambodia about China's military presence there and sought clarification on the demolition of U.S.-funded buildings.
Sherman, the most senior U.S. official to visit Cambodia in years, urged it to ""maintain an independent and balanced foreign policy, in the best interests of the Cambodian people.""

Ahead of that meeting, Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan called for dialogue between Cambodia and the United States.
""There are some issues that the United States doesn't understand clearly about Cambodia and that Cambodia does not understand the intentions of the United States,"" Phay Siphan told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two senior U.S. senators planned legislation on Thursday that would fight ransomware attacks on U.S. infrastructure by sanctioning countries the harbor cyber criminals, as well as by strengthening protections against attacks.
Senators Marco Rubio, the Republican vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, a senior member of the intelligence and judiciary committees, planned to introduce the ""Sanction and Stop Ransomware Act"" on Thursday.
According to a copy of the bill seen by Reuters, it would require development of cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure, tighten regulation of cryptocurrency - which is often demanded as ransom - and direct the State Department and intelligence community to designate as a ""state sponsor of ransomware"" any country deemed to provide support for ransomware demand schemes.
The threat of ransomware attacks against U.S. infrastructure came home to Americans on the east coast when an attack against the Colonial Pipeline Co. In May led to widespread shortages at gas stations.
The Justice Department was later able to help the company recover some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom it paid to hackers.

About $350 million in ransom was paid to cyber criminals in 2020, a more than 300% increase from the previous year, the department said. 
President Joe Biden last month warned that if the United States ended up in a ""real shooting war"" with a major power it could be the result of a significant cyber attack on the United States, highlighting what Washington sees as a growing threat posed by hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

258,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are heading for a standoff over the federal government’s debt limit that risks throwing financial markets into chaos if both sides refuse to budge.
Republicans have signaled all summer that they are unlikely to support a debt limit suspension or increase, a move they say would be tantamount to endorsing the trillions in social spending that Democrats are planning on their own later this year. But some moderate Democrats are wary of the political hazard of voting to allow the federal debt to grow if it isn’t part of a bipartisan package to fund the government.
Senate Democrats currently have two options. They could convince at least 10 Republicans to vote for the debt ceiling in a stop-gap funding measure that must pass by the end of September to avert a government shutdown. Or they could opt to go-it-alone by including it in a budget resolution that only requires 50 votes and will serve as the framework to pass President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday issued his strongest warning so far, stating bluntly on the Senate floor that Senate Republicans won’t offer support for a debt limit increase in light of Democrats’ partisan drive to push through $3.5 trillion in new spending for climate change, health care and other priorities.
“If they don’t need or want our input, they won’t get our help with the debt limit increase that these reckless plans will require,” McConnell said. “I could not be more clear.”
It’s not yet known how quickly Congress needs to act to avoid a potential default, which would wreak havoc on financial markets and could trigger a downgrade of government credit. The debt limit, or the total debt the Treasury can issue to the public and other government agencies, snapped back into effect on Aug. 1 when a two-year suspension expired. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has told lawmakers that Treasury could exhaust its special measures and run out of cash “soon after Congress returns from recess” in September.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that lawmakers likely have a wider window of time -- until October or November -- to raise or suspend the debt limit. The public debt outstanding is currently $28.4 trillion.
Relying on Republicans to join Democrats could be courting chaos, with most GOP senators adamant that they won’t support extending the debt limit in a short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution. Agencies will run out of spending authority when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and absent so-far elusive consensus on appropriations bills the government would shut down without the must-pass stop-gap measure.
“I don’t think the Republicans would vote for the CR with that in it,” Missouri Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Republican leadership team, said. “I don’t see that kind of negotiation being fruitful at a time when Democrats are talking about spending $5 trillion or $6 trillion outside of the normal budget spending.”
Blunt said he’s not worried about a stand-off, but Democrats have control of Congress and the White House and they need to raise the debt ceiling themselves. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said it would be “a big risk” and irresponsible for Democrats not to raise the debt limit on their own in Democrats-only bill.
“I think the majority has to solve this,” Blunt said. “They control the House and the Senate and the White House and it’s easy for them to deal with if they want to.”
Decision Time
Democrats are more confident that they can convince Republicans to vote for a debt ceiling increase, a hike that will be needed regardless of whether or not Biden’s economic agenda is approved this fall.
“That decision hasn’t been made, how it’s going to happen,” Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said. “We’ve supported it in the past, Democrats, I expect Republicans to support it, it’s what you’re supposed to do when you are running a country and we are all in this.”
Democrats could opt to include an instruction to raise the debt ceiling in a fiscal blueprint they aim to pass early next week that could allow the $3.5 trillion economic package to pass later this year with only Democratic votes along with any new limit on the nation’s borrowing.
No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin said it was possible the Democrats could act on their own, but “I don’t think a decision has been made.”
Montana Senator Jon Tester, a moderate Democrat, said he would prefer to keep the debt ceiling provision out of the Democrats-only reconciliation bill.
“If the Republicans want to crash this economy and hand the keys to this over to China, then that’d be pretty irresponsible, so I think they need to play in the game too,” he said.
A default on payment obligations “would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy and the livelihoods of all Americans,” Yellen told lawmakers in a letter last month. “Even the threat of failing to meet those obligations has caused detrimental impacts in the past, including the sole credit rating downgrade in the history of the nation in 2011,” the letter said.

(Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday challenged in court last week's U.S. Justice Department order to turn his tax returns over to a House of Representatives committee, part of his long campaign to keep details of his wealth secret.
In a filing https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.208895/gov.uscourts.dcd.208895.113.0.pdf in federal court in the District of Columbia, Trump's lawyers said the House Ways and Means Committee lacks a legitimate basis for seeking his federal tax returns, and that the Justice Department erred when it backed https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-urged-justice-dept-overturn-vote-results-house-panel-chair-2021-07-30 the committee's request.
The department, reversing course from the stance it took when Trump was in office, on Friday told the Internal Revenue Service to provide the Republican businessman-turned-politician's tax records to congressional investigators - a move he has long fought.
Trump was the first president in 40 years to not release his tax returns, as well as other documents, as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.
The Democratic-led Ways and Means Committee has said it wants the tax data to determine whether the IRS is properly auditing presidential tax returns in general and to assess whether new legislation is needed.
Trump's lawyers called that a ""pretextual"" rationalization.
""The requests are tailored to, and in practical operation will affect, only President Trump,"" they said in Wednesday's court filing. ""The requests single out President Trump because he is a Republican and a political opponent.""
Trump's arguments will likely be rejected by the judge, said James Repetti, a tax law professor at Boston College Law School.
The House Ways and Means panel has invoked a provision of U.S. law that lets it obtain tax returns from the IRS to further a “legislative purpose.""
The Justice Department's order ""does a very good job of explaining"" why that standard has been met, Repetti said.
Critics accused Trump of using the Justice Department to advance his personal and political interests during his four years in office, and the department has moved to reassert its independence since Democratic President Joe Biden took office.

After another legal fight, the Manhattan district attorney's office in February separately obtained Trump tax and financial records in a criminal investigation centering on his company, though the material was not publicly disclosed. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Trump in that case.
The Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer early this month were charged https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-company-cfo-plead-not-guilty-criminal-charges-2021-07-01 in what a New York prosecutor called a ""sweeping and audacious"" tax fraud. Trump himself was not charged in that case.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate could vote in the next few days on the $1 trillion infrastructure package that is one of President Joe Biden's top domestic priorities, said members of the bipartisan group of senators who negotiated the sweeping bill.
The bill, the result of months of negotiations, includes $550 billion in new spending on roads, bridges and broadband internet access, on top of $450 billion in previously approved funds. 
Since unveiling its text late Sunday, the Senate has been voting on a series of amendments to it, so far agreeing to five on topics including health care for Native Americans and highway costs.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose party holds a razor-thin majority, has threatened to keep senators in Washington past the start of their scheduled five-week recess, until the package is passed. His Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, has warned Democrats against rushing.
A key moment will come on Thursday when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office releases its cost estimates of the bill. Multiple Republican senators have said their support for the bill will hinge on whether it contains enough new revenue-generating measures to cover its costs.
Bill negotiators indicated votes could wind down in coming days, though they also admitted things remained uncertain.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said that in a brief interview he thought the Senate could wrap up its work on the $1 trillion bill and vote on passage sometime on Saturday. 
Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who has voted twice to advance the infrastructure bill, told Reuters the Senate could pass the measure Saturday or Sunday.
""My guess is, it's going to go into Saturday,"" the North Carolina lawmaker said of the infrastructure measure, predicting that Schumer's plans to follow up with a Democrats-only $3.5 trillion bill could carry senators into next week.

Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Jon Tester said they thought the amendment process on the bill could wrap up by Thursday evening. This would clear the way to final votes on the bill, although those can also require several days of time under Senate rules. 
Schumer has repeatedly said he plans to follow the bipartisan legislation with an even larger $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package that will address other priorities including social initiatives and climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congressional Budget Office said it will release on Thursday its cost estimate for the bipartisan infrastructure bill now being debated in the U.S. Senate, according to a posting on the CBO's website.
The estimate of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's budgetary costs over the next 10 years could heavily influence the level of support it has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Summaries of the bill highlight $550 billion in new spending over a decade, but revenue offsets totaling only $480 billion.

“My concern is that over and over he has weakened the regulation here,” she said of Powell on Bloomberg TV’s “Balance of Power with David Westin.” “We need someone who understands and uses the monetary policy tools and the regulatory tools to keep our economy safe. Let’s not forget what happened in 2008.”
The Massachusetts Democrat is a member of the Banking Committee and a key voice in discussions ahead of a decision by President Joe Biden on who should lead the nation’s central bank. Powell’s term ends in February.
While stopping shy of endorsing Brainard for the top job, she touted her many dissents to Fed moves to loosen regulations.
“I read Lael Brainard’s dissents in many of the deregulatory actions the Fed has taken, and I have to say they are strong and powerful dissents,” Warren said. “She makes a good case for why it is the job of the Federal Reserve to be that cop on that beat, and to make sure the largest financial institutions are not putting our economy at greater risk.”
Some White House aides are eyeing Brainard as a possible chairman who -- while remaining independent -- already fully backs Biden’s economic agenda, though Powell still enjoys broad support within the administration, according to people familiar with the matter.
No decision is expected before September at the earliest.
Warren reiterated her focus on the top job at the Federal Reserve, rather than just other jobs like vice chair, which some have speculated could be the landing spot for Brainard if Biden nominates Powell for another term.
“The problem is the chair of the Federal Reserve is where the power is concentrated,” she said. “It is the chair who decides what policies go forward. It is the chair who decides when to call a vote.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Mo Brooks asked a federal judge on Wednesday to grant him immunity from a civil lawsuit alleging a speech he delivered to then-President Donald Trump's supporters on Jan. 6 helped incite the attack on the Capitol.
In a series of court filings, Brooks addressed a decision by the Justice Department issued last week https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-wont-defend-republican-lawmaker-capitol-riot-lawsuit-2021-07-28, which determined it could not defend the Alabama congressman because he was not acting within his scope of employment as a member of Congress when he spoke at the rally.
Brooks is a co-defendant with Trump and several others in a lawsuit brought by Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell in the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia, before Judge Amit Mehta. 
After the Jan. 6 rally, where Trump and others repeated the false claim that the election was marred by widespread fraud, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.
Brooks had previously asked the Justice Department to declare he was covered by the Westfall Act, which protects federal employees from being sued for actions taken as part of their jobs.
The department declined, saying his speech was a campaign activity not covered by the Westfall Act, adding that inciting an attack on Congress ""is not within the scope of employment of a Representative - or any federal employee.""
Brooks, who is representing himself in the lawsuit, rejected those findings on Wednesday.

""Brooks was asked on Jan. 5, 2021 by a person who identified himself as a White House employee to give a speech,"" he wrote about himself in the third person.
He added the event was not considered a campaign rally, he was not paid out of Trump's campaign and was speaking to the crowd in part about his duties as a U.S. congressman to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Mike Carey, a coal lobbyist endorsed by former President Donald Trump, won a crowded primary contest on Tuesday for the Republican nomination to a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 15th district.
With 96.5% of precincts reporting, Carey was ahead of his closest contender, state representative Jeff LaRe, by 37% to 13.3%, results from the Ohio secretary of state's office showed. 
The outcome in Ohio's traditionally Republican 15th District south of Columbus was being closely watched as a measure of Trump's clout in the Republican Party, coming just a week after a Trump-backed candidate for the U.S. Congress suffered a surprise loss to a fellow Republican in north Texas.
""Tonight, Republicans across Ohio's 15th Congressional District sent a clear message to the nation that President Donald J. Trump is, without a doubt, the leader of our party,"" Carey declared in a statement after his victory.
Trump also issued a statement thanking Ohio voters and praising the ""Great Republican win for Mike Carey. Big numbers!"" 
In another crowded primary race for a vacant U.S. seat in the Democratic enclave of Ohio's 11th District, progressive Nina Turner conceded to local establishment Democrat Shontel Brown. With 85.9% of precincts reporting, Brown was leading 50.5% to 44.2% for Turner.
""We have looked across the promised land, but ... we will not cross the river,"" Turner told supporters at an election night watch party outside Cleveland.
Winners of the 15th District Republican primary and the 11th District Democratic primary are expected to also win their general election races in November. The two seats were left vacant after former Republican Representative Steve Stivers' resigned and former Democratic Representative Marcia Fudge's became Biden's housing secretary.
Democrats currently have a narrow 220-212 majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Carey, a political neophyte, cast himself in the Trump mold. ""No industry has been as targeted by the left wing liberal elites, the fake news, as the coal industry,"" Carey told a June rally headlined by the former president.
An independent fundraising committee backed by Trump spent over $400,000 on advertising for Carey, federal election records show. This included over $3,000 spent on Monday and Tuesday on calls urging Carey supporters to cast their ballots.
Several other contenders also had prominent backers. LaRe was backed by Stivers, the popular former congressman who vacated the seat in May.
In northeastern Ohio's Cleveland-based 11th District, meanwhile, the Democratic Party's schisms were on full display.
With 13 candidates on the Democratic primary ballot, the central battle was between two Black women: Brown, 46, a member of the Cuyahoga County Council endorsed by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and progressive Turner, 53, who was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders. 
Brown emphasized her support for Biden's administration, and Brown's supporters highlighted Turner's past criticism of the president. Turner was the co-chair of Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign; last year she compared voting for Democratic President Joe Biden to eating excrement.
A number of Democratic establishment figures, including House Majority Whip James Clyburn, campaigned for Brown, while Sanders and other progressives, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, rallied for Turner. 

The candidates raised over $6 million, making it the most expensive special House election this year, according to OpenSecrets.org, the website for the Center for Responsive Politics.
""Establishment Democrats likely feel that Brown would be more a team player and reliable vote for leadership than Turner, whereas progressives see Turner as someone who could help pull the Democratic House caucus a bit more to the left,"" said Kyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo should resign in light of a report by the state attorney general that found the Democratic governor had sexually harassed 11 women. 
""I think he should resign,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. 
New York's attorney general, Letitia James, unveiled the results of an investigation earlier on Tuesday that showed Cuomo had engaged in unwanted groping, kissing and hugging and made inappropriate comments to multiple women.
Biden previously said that if the investigation determined Cuomo acted inappropriately, he would call for his resignation. On Tuesday, Biden said he stuck by those comments in calling for the Democratic governor to step down. 
The investigation found Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to 11 women and created a ""toxic"" workplace in violation of the law.

In a recorded statement after the attorney general unveiled the findings of the five-month independent inquiry, Cuomo denied he had acted inappropriately and made clear he has no plans to resign. 
The civil investigation will not directly lead to criminal charges against Cuomo.

(Reuters) - For her five-month probe of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, state Attorney General Letitia James tapped a former top federal prosecutor at one of Manhattan's white-shoe law firms and a lawyer known for working on employment and discrimination cases.
The investigation, which found on Tuesday that Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women in violation of state and federal law and created a climate of fear within his office, was led by Joon Kim, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, along with partner Anne Clark of Vladeck, Raskin & Clark.
Kim joined the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan in 2013 and rose to become the deputy U.S. attorney under Preet Bharara. Bharara was fired by former President Donald Trump in 2017 and Kim was appointed acting U.S. attorney.
Kim joined Cleary in 2018, where he has represented clients such as Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, which is facing scrutiny over allegations of misconduct by its former chief executive officer Carlos Ghosn.
James hired both Kim and Clark's firms in March, tapping 12 attorneys from Cleary and four from the Vladeck firm. The state has agreed to pay more than $3.5 million for their work, according to public, including $2.552 million to Cleary and $950,000 to the Vladeck firm.
Cuomo, who has denied any inappropriate conduct, questioned the credibility of James' investigators during a July 26 press conference. 
""I have concerns as to the independence of the reviewers,"" he said, before telling reporters to research them on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Kim has investigated Cuomo before - the U.S. attorney's office in 2014 looked into Cuomo's decision to disband the Moreland Commission, an anti-corruption panel, nine months after he convened it. The office said there was ""insufficient"" evidence to prove any crimes had occurred.
Press inquiries to Kim and Clark were forwarded to the attorney general's office, where a spokesman deferred to James' comments during a press conference on Tuesday.
""Miss Clark and Mr. Kim, and their respective firms, were chosen to lead this investigation because of their decades of work at the highest levels, their deep expertise on matters in question, and their careers fighting to uphold the rule of law,"" James said.
Kim said at Tuesday's press conference that the governor's workplace was ""rife with bullying, fear and intimidation"" and crossing Cuomo or his senior staff meant you would be ""written off, cast aside or worse.""

Clark is an employment law lawyer who joined Vladeck nearly 30 years ago. She successfully represented Demos Parneros, the former CEO of Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS_old) Inc in litigation after he was fired in July 2018. The bookstore chain said he was fired, in part, due to claims he had sexually harassed a female employee; Parneros denied the allegations, saying the company made up reasons to fire him.
She and Kim ""ensured this investigation was both independent and thorough,"" James said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce a revised eviction moratorium on Tuesday after a prior government ban on evictions expired Saturday at midnight, two sources briefed on matter said. 
Details were still being finalized and the new order comes as congressional Democrats urged the White House to take action. The New York Times and Washington Post reported the planned new order earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats on Tuesday pushed the White House to reinstate an expired moratorium on residential evictions that kept millions of people from being forced out of their homes for unpaid rent during the pandemic, but which expired over the weekend.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both called for reinstatement of the ban on evictions that expired at midnight on Saturday.
Congress wants the Biden administration to reinstate the ban, while the White House says a Supreme Court ruling in June means it lacks legal authority to do so without congressional approval.
On Sunday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rejected President Joe Biden's request for a new scaled-down pandemic-related moratorium on residential evictions, the White House said.
Democratic Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) tweeted ""every minute wasted means another family could be forced onto the streets. Biden, #ExtendTheMoratorium now!""
A Supreme Court opinion last month indicated that legislative approval would be required to impose a new moratorium. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that if the White House extends the moratorium without congress authorizing the CDC's power to do so, it could risk an adverse court decision. 
On Sunday, Biden asked the CDC to target a new moratorium on counties with higher COVID-19 case rates, the White House said.
White House officials said Biden has not given up as he asked officials to look at any potential authority to reinstate the eviction moratorium.
Biden also called on state and local governments to extend or put in place eviction bans for at the least the next two months, Psaki said.
On Friday House Democrats tried to advance legislation to extend the moratorium to Oct. 18, but a Republican congressman blocked their bid to pass the measure by unanimous consent. 
Pelosi told lawmakers such an extension would provide more time to speed distribution of $46.5 billion in rental relief already allocated by Congress. Only about $3 billion of that sum has been distributed so far.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it ""doesn’t seem to me to require any additional legislative action to get the money out there that’s already been made available, so it can solve the problem.""
More than 15 million people in 6.5 million U.S. households are currently behind on rental payments, according to a study by the Aspen Institute and the COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project, collectively owing more than $20 billion to landlords.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration backs repeal of the 2002 congressional authorization for the war in Iraq, feeling it is not needed to protect U.S. interests, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Tuesday.
""For the State Department, repealing the 2002 AUMF (Authorization for the Use of Military Force) would not affect our diplomatic initiatives. And the administration has made clear that we have no ongoing military activities that rely solely on the 2002 AUMF, and that repeal would have minimal impacts on military operations,"" Sherman, the No. 2 U.S. diplomat, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. 
The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. But that authority has shifted toward the White House, due partly to the passage of ""forever war"" authorizations like the 2002 AUMF that do not expire.
Tuesday's hearing was part of an ongoing effort by lawmakers from both parties to wrest war powers back from the executive branch.
Senator Bob Menendez, the committee's Democratic chairman, said he hoped consideration of the Iraq AUMFs would also jump-start discussion of reforming an AUMF passed just after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for the fight against al Qaeda.
""We must have an honest conversation about the scope of this authority and the power of Congress in Article One of the Constitution to declare war,"" Menendez said.
Sherman said the administration would ""provide expert guidance"" to assist Congress as it considered that repeal. 
Presidents from both parties have used the 2001 and 2002 authorities to justify a wide range of international military action without congressional approval.
Former President Donald Trump cited the 2002 AUMF in early 2020 as a justification for attacking an Iranian military commander at an airport in Baghdad. Biden cited the 2001 AUMF for recent strikes in Somalia.
Some Republicans said repealing the Iraq AUMF - and one passed in 1991 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait - would convey weakness in a volatile part of the world. They also do not want to revoke current authorities before writing a replacement.
""I'm concerned that the repeal of the 2002 AUMF only adds to the wrong message that the administration, and I think all of us, are already sending to Iran, and our allies in the region,"" Senator Jim Risch, the committee's top Republican, said.

Democrats said the Iraq War is over. ""After World War Two, we didn't keep a military authorization against Japan just in case. We didn't keep an authorization live against Germany, just in case,"" said Senator Tim Kaine, a leader of efforts to repeal the AUMFs.
The foreign relations panel is expected to approve legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 Iraq AUMFs on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -The District of Columbia's police department on Monday said two more police officers who responded to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol have died by suicide, bringing to four the number of known suicides by officers who guarded the building that day.
Metropolitan Police Officer Gunther Hashida was found dead in his home Thursday, department spokesman Hugh Carew said in a statement.
Hashida joined the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in May 2003.
Another MPD officer who responded to the Capitol on Jan. 6, Kyle DeFreytag, was found dead on July 10, Carew said. DeFreytag’s cause of death was also suicide, Carew said.
He had been with the police department since November 2016.
MPD Officer Jeffrey Smith and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood also responded to the Capitol riot and later died by suicide.
Hundreds of then-President Donald Trump supporters stormed the building that day in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election win.
Four people died on the day of the violence.
A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. More than 100 police officers were injured.

The mayhem led to Trump's second impeachment trial. More than 500 people have been arrested for their roles in the violence.
During emotional testimony last week, four police officers told a House of Representatives special committee that they were beaten, threatened, taunted with racial insults, and thought they might die as they struggled to defend the Capitol against the mob.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) revealed on Monday that he has tested positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, has flu-like symptoms and will be self-quarantining for 10 days.
The announcement on the heels of a weekend gathering of senators that Graham attended, sent lawmakers scrambling for COVID-19 tests and raised the possibility of a congressional outbreak as the Senate prepares to advance President Joe Biden's agenda with a landmark $1 trillion infrastructure bill. 
""I am very glad I was vaccinated because without vaccination I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now. My symptoms would be far worse,"" Graham, 66, wrote on Twitter.
The South Carolina Republican, a leading conservative voice in the Senate, said he began experiencing flu-like symptoms on Saturday and sought medical attention on Monday morning. He was later informed by a congressional physician that he had tested positive.
""I feel like I have a sinus infection and at present time I have mild symptoms,"" Graham, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, wrote in a pair of tweets. ""I will be quarantining for ten days.""
His announcement comes at a crucial time for the closely divided Senate, where Democratic leaders hope to advance Biden's agenda in coming weeks by pushing through a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.
Graham was among as many as a dozen senators who attended a weekend gathering that Senator Joe Manchin hosted at his houseboat named ""Almost Heaven"" in the Washington area. Manchin, a leading Democrat in infrastructure negotiations, described the event as an effort to encourage bipartisanship as the Senate prepared to debate and vote on the infrastructure bill this week.
Manchin told reporters that all the invited senators were vaccinated and they were socializing outside for the time it takes to eat a couple of hamburgers. 
Manchin said he has tested negative for COVID-19 since the event. Another Democrat at the gathering, Senator Chris Coons, said he was awaiting results. Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, tested negative for COVID-19 after the get-together.
Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine after contact with an infected person unless they develop symptoms, but should be tested 3-5 days after exposure.
Members of the House of Representatives left Washington for a seven-week break on Friday. 
Graham is among a group of 17 Senate Republicans who have backed the bipartisan infrastructure legislation in procedural votes. The measure needs Republican votes to achieve the 60-vote threshold required for most legislation in the 100-seat chamber.
The Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, who control the chamber only because of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. 

Graham did not say whether he had tested positive for the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has been blamed for a recent surge in infections in the United States, particularly Southern states with relatively low vaccination rates.
Forty-six percent of South Carolina's population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, well below the national average of 58%, according to the Reuters COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker. ((https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/))

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will try to complete work this week on a $1 trillion infrastructure investment bill that would bring long-awaited improvements to roads, bridges and mass-transit systems, even as some Republicans began complaining about the details.
Following long weekend sessions, senators on Monday began voting on amendments to the 2,702-page bill.
But battles already were shaping up.
Republican Senator Pat Toomey said in a statement that the bill's proposed tax reporting regime for cryptocurrencies was overly broad and unworkable. He said he plans to offer an amendment to change it.
Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the provision would raise $28 billion in new revenue over 10 years, which is important to lawmakers' goals of paying for the costs of the infrastructure bill.
""Congress should not rush forward with this hastily-designed tax reporting regime for cryptocurrency, especially without a full understanding of the consequences,"" Toomey said in an emailed statement.
Senate leaders were trying to reach a deal on the number of amendments that would be put to votes, as the chamber's 100 senators were eager to begin an August recess.
The legislation, if enacted, would be the largest U.S. infrastructure investment in decades. Its passage would mark a major win for President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and the deeply divided Congress. It would come on the heels of a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and coronavirus aid bill that was enacted earlier this year without Republican support.
The measure would include $550 billion in new spending over five years for items such as roads, rail, electric vehicle charging stations and replacing lead water pipes on top of $450 billion in previously approved funds.
Its wide-ranging provisions include $343 billion for improvements on highways, bridges and related projects, $48.4 billion to make drinking water and water infrastructure safer, $7.5 billion to help construct electric vehicle charging stations - far below what Biden had sought - and $350 million over five years for reducing vehicle collisions with wildlife. The bill would provide grants for ""wildlife crossing structures.""
The Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan research arm of the U.S. Congress, projected tax provisions of the bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill would increase federal revenue by $51 billion over 10 years.
While the $1 trillion bill represents a large investment, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that over the next two decades the United States needs to spend around $13 trillion to upgrade aging public works projects that they have graded at a ""C-"" level currently. 
The group said in its 2021 assessment that there is a $5.6 trillion gap between infrastructure funding that is needed and what is being planned across the country.
The $1 trillion bill also would clear the way for Democrats, acting without Republican support, to begin work on a budget framework that would sketch out plans for a $3.5 trillion ""human infrastructure"" bill. 
That bill would shovel federal dollars toward fighting climate change, help millions of immigrants gain legal protections and fund an expansion of healthcare, including for senior citizens needing assistance at home. 
The Senate first needs to put the finishing touches on the infrastructure bill, which also would expand high-speed internet access to rural areas where economies have been hobbled by old technology.

Barring surprise developments, the bill could be ready for a final vote as early as this week, according to some senators.
Nevertheless, on Monday, three Republican senators - John Cornyn, Rick Scott and Martha Blackburn - criticized the infrastructure bill, saying they had inadequate time to consider it and taking issue with one of the ways it would be financed.

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump will challenge a recent U.S. Justice Department order that his tax returns should be turned over to a House of Representatives committee, one of his personal lawyers signaled on Monday.
""There is no evidence of any wrongdoing here and I object to the release of the returns not only on behalf of my client but on behalf of all future holders of the Office of the President of the United States,"" said Trump lawyer Ronald Fischetti in a statement.
""This politicization and harassment of Mr. Trump is uncalled for and outrageous,"" Fischetti said, adding that he had ""never seen anything like this"" in his career as a lawyer.
The Justice Department on Friday ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over Trump's tax returns to a House committee, saying the panel has offered ""sufficient reasons"" for requesting the material.
House Democrats have said they need Trump's tax returns to see if the IRS is properly auditing presidential tax returns in general and to assess whether new legislation is needed.
The order marked a reversal for the Justice Department. In 2019, when Trump was still in office, the department's Office of Legal Counsel declared that the request for his taxes by the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee was based on a ""disingenuous"" objective aimed at exposing them to the public. 
Unlike other recent presidents, Trump did not publicly disclose his tax returns.
In 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit in hopes of forcing the Trump administration to comply with its request for the tax returns.

That lawsuit, which is still pending, provides a vehicle for Trump to argue that the Justice Department's order from last week is unlawful.
U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, who is hearing the case, has given Trump and his lawyers a Wednesday deadline for explaining their view of how the case should proceed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. senators introduced a sweeping $1-trillion bipartisan plan to invest in roads, bridges, ports, high-speed internet and other infrastructure, with some predicting the chamber could pass this week the largest public works legislation in decades.
The massive infrastructure package, a goal that has eluded Congress for years, is a top legislative priority for Democratic President Joe Biden, who billed it on Sunday as the largest such investment in a century.
Senators said the 2,702-page bill included $550 billion in new spending over five years for items such as roads, rail, electric vehicle charging stations and replacing lead water pipes on top of $450 billion in previously approved funds.
""I believe we can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in days,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said of the legislation after it was announced by a bipartisan group of senators.
""This is a really important bill because it takes our big, aging and outdated infrastructure in this country and modernizes it. That’s good for everybody,"" said Senator Rob Portman, the lead Republican negotiator.
However, some Republicans criticized the bill as too costly.
""I’ve got real concerns with this bill,"" Republican Senator Mike Lee said in a floor speech. ""All is not well with the way we spend money.""
It was not yet clear whether senators outside the bipartisan group that negotiated the bill will offer amendments that could possibly upset the delicate coalition that was cobbled together.
If the bill passes the Senate, it must be considered in the House of Representatives, where some Democrats have blasted it as too small and the Democratic leadership has paired it with a $3.5 trillion ""human infrastructure"" bill to pour money into education, child care, climate change and other priorities.
Democrats want to offset that social spending with tax hikes on corporations and wealthy Americans earning more than $400,000 a year, measures opposed by Republicans, leaving the fate of both bills up in the air.
Sunday night's developments capped months of negotiating, and infighting, among several groups of senators and the White House.
Initially, Biden said he was seeking about $2 trillion in a bipartisan bill, an amount that Republicans rejected as wasteful and unnecessary.
A group of Republican senators then worked on a plan to spend far less, an effort that eventually died, raising questions if Congress could fashion a deal allowing the Democratic president to fulfill his Jan. 20 inauguration promise of working cooperatively with Republicans.
A bipartisan group of senators, led by Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate, and the conservative Portman toiled for months, adding input from House centrists, on a new plan closer to what Biden would accept.

Late in June the group said it had reached a $1.2-trillion deal, but filling in details took more than a month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A fundraising group run by former President Donald Trump raised $62 million in the first half of the year but only spent $3 million, with the biggest chunk of money going to a pro-Trump research center and more than $65,000 to Trump's own hotels, according to federal records published on Saturday.
Trump, a Republican, established the Save America committee in November shortly after losing the presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden. Under Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules, the committee has broad leeway in how it can use its money.
A filing with the FEC showed Save America made a $1 million contribution in June to the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit run by veterans of his administration. 
The group's leadership includes Brooke Rollins (NYSE:ROL), who led the White House's Domestic Policy Council under Trump, and Larry Kudlow, who led Trump's National Economic Council.
The money spent at Trump hotels was described as covering lodging or meals, according to Save America's filing.
Another Trump-controlled committee, a former campaign account now known as the Make America Great Again PAC, spent an additional $13 million in the first half of the year, mostly to cover legal fees and Trump's efforts to reverse his November election loss, according to a separate FEC filing.
Together, the two committees brought in the bulk of the nearly $82 million that Trump's office said he helped raise between January and June. 
Committees affiliated with Trump ended the period with nearly $102 million in cash, a sum that could help the former president exert considerable influence ahead of next year's elections when Republicans hope to win control of Congress. Democrats have narrow majorities in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. 
But while Trump is his party's top fundraiser and continues to raise large sums for the Republican National Committee, his committees did not give any money to political candidates during the first half of the year. 
A spokesperson for his office said $5,000 checks were sent in July to candidates he had endorsed. Details on those contributions are expected in FEC filings due later in the year.
Many of the candidates Trump has endorsed, particularly those challenging incumbent Republicans or seeking open seats, lag far behind their opponents in fundraising. Trump-backed Kelly Tshubaka, who is challenging Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had about $2 million less in her campaign's bank account at the end of June than did Murkowski.

Republicans will face a well-funded slate of Democrats in next year's elections.
Democrats raised over $373 million in online donations in the first six months of the year through ActBlue, the party's dominant payment processor, according to a disclosure filed on Saturday. That outpaced the $258 million that Republicans raised during the same period through their online payment processor WinRed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate in a rare Saturday session worked on a bill that would spend $1 trillion on roads, rail lines and other infrastructure, as lawmakers from both parties sought to advance President Joe Biden's top legislative priority.
The ambitious plan has the backing of Democrats and Republicans alike and has already cleared two hurdles by broad margins in the closely divided Senate.
But so far lawmakers have not seen the final text of the bill, which includes about $550 billion in new spending and was still being written on Saturday. Earlier votes were for a shell bill that will incorporate the actual legislation once it is complete.
U.S. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that the bipartisan group working on the legislation needed additional time. 
""The staffs are still working and say they will have the final legislative text ready tomorrow,"" Schumer said on Saturday night.
""When the legislative text is ready, I will offer it as the substitute amendment and after that, we can begin voting on amendments,"" the top Senate Democrat said.
After passing the $1 trillion bill, Schumer aims to push forward on a sweeping $3.5 trillion package that focuses on climate change and home care for the elderly and children. That faces staunch Republican opposition and some dissent among moderate Democrats.
""The Senate is going to move forward on both tracks of infrastructure before the beginning of the August recess. The longer it takes to finish, the longer we'll be here. But we're going to get the job done,"" Schumer said earlier on Saturday.
The Senate voted 66-28 on Friday to take up the bill, with 16 Republicans joining all 48 Democrats and two independents in support.
The package would dramatically increase the nation's spending on roads, bridges, transit and airports. Supporters predicted it will ultimately pass the Senate and House of Representatives, eventually reaching Biden's desk for him to sign it into law.
It includes about $550 billion in new spending, on top of $450 billion that was previously approved. It also includes money for eliminating lead water pipes and building electric vehicle charging stations.
The bill does not include funding for most climate change and social initiatives that Democrats aim to pass in the separate $3.5 trillion measure without Republican support.
Democrats hold razor-thin margins in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning the party must stick together to achieve its legislative goals. 

Progressive (NYSE:PGR) members of the House Democratic caucus have already suggested the $1 trillion package is inadequate, and the Senate could likewise impose changes that could complicate its chances of becoming law. 
But supporters, including Schumer and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been optimistic about its prospects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump suffered twin setbacks on Friday when the Justice Department cleared the way to release his tax records and disclosed a memo showing he had urged top officials last year to falsely claim his election defeat was ""corrupt."" 
The department, reversing course from the stance it took when Trump was in office, told the Internal Revenue Service to provide the Republican businessman-turned-politician's tax records to congressional investigators - a move he has long fought.
Trump was the first president in 40 years to not release his tax returns, as well as other documents, as he aimed to keep secret the details on his wealth and activities of his family company, the Trump Organization. The Democratic-led House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee has said it wants the tax data in part to examine whether Trump had taken inappropriate advantage of U.S. tax laws.
Handwritten notes taken by Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue in December and released on Friday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee painted a damning picture of Trump as he desperately sought to get the Justice Department to take the unprecedented step of intervening to try to upend his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.
The fact that the Justice Department let congressional investigators obtain the notes marked a dramatic shift from the Trump administration's repeated assertion of executive privilege to skirt congressional scrutiny.
""Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen,"" Trump told Jeffrey Rosen, referring to Republicans, in a Dec. 27 phone call days before Rosen was appointed acting attorney general. 
The notes showed Rosen told Trump the department could not and would not ""change the outcome of the election.""
Trump's representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
The Justice Department ordered the IRS to provide Trump's tax returns to the House panel, saying the panel has invoked ""sufficient reasons"" for requesting it.
The department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded it had erred in 2019 when it found the committee's request for Trump's taxes to be based on a ""disingenuous"" objective aimed at exposing them to the public. The committee engaged in a two-year legal battle with the Treasury Department after then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin defied a subpoena for Trump's taxes.
In a court filing late on Friday, the Treasury Department said it was prepared to hand over Trump's tax returns to the committee and would not object to giving him 72 hours' notice before the documents are handed over.
After another legal fight, the Manhattan district attorney's office in February separately obtained https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump-taxes/new-york-prosecutors-digging-into-trumps-tax-financial-records-idUSKBN2AP2MS Trump tax and financial records in a criminal investigation centering on his company, though the material was not publicly disclosed.
During Trump's presidency, the Justice Department was accused by Democrats of bending to his personal and political goals. Its recent actions illustrate a different approach under Biden.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, welcomed the department's action, saying access to the documents represents ""a matter of national security.""
'CRITICALLY IMPORTANT'
The department ""is no longer going to simply kowtow to Donald Trump,"" said University of Minnesota law professor Richard Painter, who was ethics counsel to former President George W. Bush.
""Every other president has disclosed their tax returns, and finding out what the conflicts of interest are on the president or a former president who may have made decisions that now have to be revisited - that's critically important,"" Painter added.
It has been a tough week for Trump. Four police officers on Tuesday testified https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-who-defended-us-capitol-testify-riot-probes-first-hearing-2021-07-27 to a House panel about the violence of his supporters during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
That same night, the Justice Department revealed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-wont-defend-republican-lawmaker-capitol-riot-lawsuit-2021-07-28 it would not defend a Republican congressman named along with Trump in a civil lawsuit accusing them of helping incite the riot, while a U.S. congressional candidate he endorsed in Texas lost https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-backed-candidate-ballot-us-house-runoff-texas-2021-07-27 her run-off election. Trump also fumed as a bipartisan agreement on Biden's massive infrastructure bill advanced in the Senate https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-vote-open-debate-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-07-30, a feat Trump failed to achieve. 
The Justice Department this week cited ""compelling legislative interests"" as it authorized six former Trump administration officials to be interviewed by the House oversight panel. Among them were Rosen, Donoghue, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark.
Clark is at the heart of a Justice Department inspector general's office inquiry https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice/watchdog-to-probe-if-justice-dept-officials-improperly-tried-to-alter-2020-election-idUSKBN29U21E after news surfaced that he had plotted with Trump to try to oust Rosen so he could launch an investigation into alleged voter fraud in Georgia. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.
In the Dec. 27 call with Rosen, Trump threatened to put Clark in charge, the notes showed. Throughout the call, Trump pushed his false election claims. ""You guys may not be following the internet the way I do,"" Trump said.

Rosen and Donoghue tried multiple times to tell Trump his information was incorrect.
""We are doing our job,"" the notes stated. ""Much of the info you're getting is false.""

(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department sued Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday, seeking to block an executive order that restricts the transport of migrants through the state and authorizes state troopers to pull over vehicles suspected of doing so.
In a lawsuit filed in El Paso federal court, the Justice Department said Abbott's order, which he said was aimed at preventing migrants from potentially spreading the coronavirus, illegally infringes upon the federal government's jurisdiction over immigration matters.
The order, which Abbott signed on Wednesday, permits only ""law enforcement officials"" to provide ground transport for migrants detained for illegally crossing the southern border. It also gives the state's public safety department the authority to stop any vehicle suspected of carrying migrants and send it back to its point of origin.
The order would interfere with the U.S. government's ability to transport migrants between facilities, including unaccompanied children, according to the lawsuit. The government regularly employs contractors and other non-law enforcement personnel to transfer migrants.
Texas has become a battleground on immigration as Republicans and supporters of former President Donald Trump push back against Biden's efforts to relax the restrictionist policies of his predecessor. Republicans want to galvanize opposition to Biden's immigration policies to mobilize voters ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.
The Republican governor said the order was aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus, citing a ""dramatic rise in COVID-19 cases"" among migrants.
There is no clear evidence that migrants are primarily responsible for an increase in coronavirus cases in the state. Texas, where about 44% of residents are fully vaccinated, has seen cases surge by more than 200% in the last two weeks.
The lawsuit made good on a threat https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-attorney-general-garland-tells-texas-rescind-order-limiting-immigrant-travel-2021-07-29 issued on Thursday by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who urged Abbott to rescind the order immediately.

In response to the lawsuit, Abbott said the Biden administration had created a ""constitutional crisis"" between the federal government and the state of Texas.
""This stems from the Biden administration's refusal to enforce immigration laws and allow illegal immigrants with COVID-19 to enter our country,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Georgia Republicans on Friday triggered a formal review of election officials in Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Atlanta, the first step in a process that could lead to their removal and allow the Republican-controlled state legislature to take control of local election operations.
Republican House lawmakers from Fulton County released a letter calling for a performance review of the county's election officials, where Democratic President Joe Biden won heavily in the 2020 election, propelling his surprise victory over former President Donald Trump in the battleground state.
The letter, following a similar request from state senators this week, sets in motion a formal review under a sweeping new voting law state Republicans passed in March. Along with new ballot restrictions, the law granted the legislature more control over a state election board, while giving the board the ability to suspend county officials for poor performance or election code violations.
Republicans say Fulton County has a long history of mismanaging their elections and the review was being requested to assure ""voter confidence in our elections.""
Robb Pitts, who is chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, did not respond to telephone and email inquiries from Reuters. On Thursday, he sent a letter to Georgia Democrats stating his ""fear"" that the review was for ""political reasons,"" and questioned its legality.
Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, has repeatedly insisted the 2020 election result in Georgia was accurate. Still, Raffensperger joined other Republicans in calling for a review of Fulton County election procedures.
Democrats, voting rights groups and non-partisan experts said the move was part of an effort by Republicans to take control of the most consequential local election board in the state - Fulton is Georgia's largest county and home to 10 percent of its population.
They also said it was the first example of Republicans actively trying to take control of an election board, a move that could become a model for Republicans nationally in states they control.
Under Georgia's new voting law, the State Elections Board can remove county elections officials after a review if they find ""nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections"" in at least two elections within two years.
Rebecca Sullivan, a Republican who is acting chair of the State Election Board, said the request for a performance review of Fulton County would likely be discussed at the board's next meeting on Aug. 18.
The review comes amid persistent and false claims by Trump that the 2020 election was stolen from him because of massive voter fraud. In Georgia, which Biden won by roughly 12,000 votes, two Republican-led recounts of the 2020 results turned up no evidence of widespread fraud.
Edward B. Foley, a Constitutional and elections expert at Ohio State University, said having a partisan legislature taking over local election operations is deeply troubling. Local election boards typically tally votes and then send the vote counts to a central state database.
""That’s the warning bell – it can lead to the corruption of the process and the undermining of the will of the people,"" Foley said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday resumed fast-track deportation flights for migrant families that recently arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, amid a sharp increase in the number of migrants at the southern border.
The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the flights would transport Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran migrant families who could not be immediately expelled under a coronavirus-related public health policy and did not have a legal basis to stay in the country. 
""We are making clear that those who do not qualify to remain in the United States will be promptly removed,"" the statement said.

Migrant crossings typically taper off in the hot summer months, but arrests at the southern border rose in June to the highest level since April 2000. The tally in July is expected to be similar or even higher, according to two border patrol officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Immigration, and particularly the arrival of asylum seekers at the U.S. southern border, has been a hot-button issue for decades. Multiple attempts to reform U.S. laws and create a pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants living in the country illegally have failed in Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, a long-serving Democratic leader who strenuously opposed the Iraq War and investigated U.S. detainee abuse while fighting corporate fraud, has died at age 87, his family said late on Thursday.
Levin had been battling lung cancer, a diagnosis he revealed in a memoir published in March this year.
He died at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, surrounded by loved ones, according to family spokesperson Jim Townsend, director of the Wayne State University law school's Levin Center.
The Detroit native, known for his rumpled appearance and sharp mind, was the longest-serving senator ever from Michigan, elected to six consecutive six-year terms starting in 1978, when he defeated a senior incumbent Republican.
Levin long served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and led a separate investigations panel from which he grilled business executives engaged in misconduct, including the Enron scandal, then the largest case of U.S. corporate fraud on record.
In 2002, with Republican President George W. Bush moving toward a U.S. invasion of Iraq the following year, Levin tried to head off the war. He voted against authorizing the use of force and unsuccessfully offered an alternative calling on Bush to pursue a tougher U.N. weapons inspection program in Iraq.
Bush's main justification for the war was to eliminate the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were ever found. Levin also accused Pentagon official Douglas Feith of exaggerating the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda, the Islamist network responsible for the 2001 attacks on the United States, in the build-up to the Iraq war.
The war descended into a long and messy counter-insurgency effort, with U.S. troops not exiting Iraq until 2011.
Levin criticized the way Donald Rumsfeld, Bush's first defense secretary, carried out the war - making the case that the Pentagon proceeded with too few troops, inadequate supplies and too little training of Iraqi forces to take over. He investigated detainee abuse during Rumsfeld's tenure.
Levin was the top Democrat on the Armed Services panel in May 2004 - Republicans controlled the Senate at the time - when Rumsfeld was called to a hearing on the emerging scandal over detainee treatment, including beatings and sexual humiliation by U.S. forces at the Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad.
""Our troops are less secure and our nation is less secure because these depraved and despicable actions will fuel the hatred and the fury of those who oppose us,"" he told Rumsfeld.
Rumsfeld consistently blamed others for the detainee abuse. In 2009, Levin as committee chairman released a report offering detailed evidence that the military's use of such methods as stripping prisoners, placing them in ""stress positions"" and depriving them of sleep was approved at high levels of the Bush administration, including Rumsfeld.
He also criticized Bush's costly missile defense system.
'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'
On the domestic front, Levin monitored the conduct of businesses and federal agencies and worked for laws to protect whistleblowers and ensure competition in government contracting.
In 2002, he called a hearing with members of the board of Enron, the once high-flying Texas energy company that collapsed. Investors lost billions of dollars and thousands of employees lost their jobs.
""You're the board. You're the captain of the ship that went down, and you're denying any responsibility,"" Levin told them. ""There were plenty of things you were told and that you knew which should have triggered much stronger action on your part.""
In 2003, he held hearings showing how large accounting firms had created illegal tax shelters. Congress passed laws following the Enron and accounting scandals aimed at halting such abuses.
Levin held hearings in 2007 on abusive credit card industry practices, helping lead to new consumer protections.
He was among the most liberal members of the Senate, but was a defender of Michigan's auto industry. Levin tried to marshal federal aid for automakers during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and resisted efforts by fellow Democrats on vehicle fuel-efficiency standards.
""I consider myself pro-business,"" he told BusinessWeek magazine in 2002. ""I'm a pro-growth guy. When businesses participate in deceptive practices, we've got to change that. It's important to have cops on the beat.""
His brother Sander Levin, three years his senior, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, representing the Detroit suburbs. In 2010, when Carl Levin led the Armed Services panel and his brother headed a House panel, they became the first brothers since 1881 to serve as congressional committee chairmen at the same time.
Levin was born in Detroit on June 28, 1934. After Harvard Law School, he worked as a civil rights lawyer and public defender before being elected to the Detroit City Council in 1969. He later served as council president before running for the Senate in 1978.

""It's been a long and wonderful run,"" Levin, known for wearing his eyeglasses at the end of his nose, said after winning re-election in 2008 at age 74. In 2013, he announced he would not seek re-election in 2014.
Levin married his wife, Barbara, in 1961. They had three daughters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's refusal to defend a Republican congressman accused in a civil lawsuit of helping to incite the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol could hamper former President Donald Trump's legal defense in the same case, experts said.
The department late Tuesday told a federal judge it had declined https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-wont-defend-republican-lawmaker-capitol-riot-lawsuit-2021-07-28 a request by Representative Morris ""Mo"" Brooks to grant him immunity by covering him under the Westfall Act, which shields federal employees from being sued for their words or actions in the course of their employment.
Experts said the move appeared to send a message to Trump, a co-defendant in the case, ruling out immunity when it warned that inciting an attack on Congress ""is not within the scope of employment of a Representative - or any federal employee.""
Donald Ayer, a senior Justice Department official in the Republican administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said: ""The government's filing sends a clear message... No leader in our government is acting within the scope of his employment when he acts to subvert the free and fair election by getting people to go up and riot and interfere."" 
""The leaders who perpetrated these travesties are personally responsible for their actions."" he added. A spokesman for Brooks could not be immediately reached for comment.
Brooks and Trump are co-defendants in a lawsuit by Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell that accuses them of inciting people during a Jan. 6 rally to attack the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.
Trump is a defendant in two other similar lawsuits, one filed by Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson and another on behalf of two U.S. Capitol police officers.
Trump has so far not publicly requested Justice Department protection in the case, nor has his attorney Jesse Binnall said whether he intends to ask the department to take a position.
In a statement, Binnall said: ""The Supreme Court has been clear that presidents cannot be sued for actions that are related to their duties of office. Addressing Americans about congressional action is a quintessential presidential duty.""
The Justice Department declined to comment.
The department riled some Democrats https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-defending-presidency-not-trying-save-trump-recent-legal-moves-2021-06-08 with a pair of recent decisions that seemed to shield Trump or members of his administration, though legal experts said the moves were intended to protect the office of the presidency, not its former occupant.
Trump's primary legal defense in the Swalwell suit has not rested on the Westfall Act but on a legal doctrine that argues the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution broadly grants the president immunity during his time in office.
""Rousing and controversial speeches are a key function of the presidency. That is especially true when, as is the case here, the President is advocating for or against congressional action,"" his lawyer wrote in a May 24 filing.
In a footnote, the lawyer added: ""Even if former President Trump is not covered by absolute immunity, as a governmental actor, the claims against him are also foreclosed by immunity under the Westfall Act.""
Attorney Anne Tindall of the advocacy group Protect Democracy said the department's filing contains a lot of signs that are ""bad news for Trump.""

""Trump's role is even more limited than Brooks' is,"" said Tindall, who is representing two Capitol Police officers in a separate lawsuit alleging Trump incited the riot. 
""Brooks has a role in the certification. He has a vote in Congress. DOJ concluded that the conduct at issue in the litigation is not sufficiently related to his vote,"" Tindall said. ""Here Trump has no role at all.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday warned Texas Governor Greg Abbott to ""immediately rescind"" a new executive order aimed at curbing the travel into the state of undocumented immigrants who may pose a risk of transmitting COVID-19.
""The order violates federal law in numerous respects, and Texas cannot lawfully enforce the executive order against any federal official or private parties working with the United States,"" Garland told Abbott in a letter.
He added that if Texas continues to implement the ground restrictions on migrants, then the Justice Department will ""pursue all appropriate legal remedies.""
Garland's letter comes just a day after Abbott signed the order, which states that ""no person, other than a federal, state, or local law-enforcement official, shall provide ground transportation to a group of migrants"" who have been detained by federal immigration officials for crossing the border.
It also directs the state's Department of Public Safety to ""stop any vehicle upon reasonable suspicion of a violation"" and gives the department authority to ""reroute such a vehicle back to its point of origin or a port of entry.""

The executive order states that the new policy is warranted because of President Joe Biden's ""refusal to enforce laws passed by the United States Congress"" and the measure is aimed at protecting Texans from exposure to COVID-19.
Garland said the order ""would jeopardize the health and safety of noncitizens in federal government custody"" and it will also interfere with the implementation of federal immigration law.

(Reuters) -A Republican lawmaker in Pennsylvania has come out against his colleagues' ""forensic"" audit of the 2020 election, becoming the party's first statewide official to publicly call for an end to the effort and warn of electoral consequences.
In an op-ed on Thursday, state Senator Dan Laughlin says that moves to investigate Donald Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the state are being made ""absent credible evidence of fraud"" and won't change the outcome, as some voters hope.
""The current attempt to discredit the 2020 election results runs headlong into an unmistakable truth,"" wrote Laughlin, a centre-right Republican from Erie County. ""Donald Trump lost Pennsylvania because Donald Trump received fewer votes.""
His comments mark a rare public rebuke of Republican state Senator Doug Mastriano from within his own party. Mastriano has been arguing for a comprehensive ""forensic"" investigation involving the inspection of voting equipment, modeled on a contentious partisan probe ongoing in Maricopa County, Arizona.
Mastriano, who has promoted Trump's baseless stolen-election claims, launched the investigation earlier this month with requests to Tioga, Philadelphia and York counties for access to their voting machines. Mastriano has said he would subpoena the counties if they did not comply by July 31.
Tioga and York have indicated they would not comply after the state's top election official said she would decertify their voting equipment if they were handed over to a third party, triggering large costs for taxpayers. Philadelphia is also expected to reject Mastriano's request after debating the issue at a commissioner's meeting on Friday.
On Thursday, Tioga sent a letter to Mastriano saying it remained open to cooperating if he could arrange for funding to cover the $1 million it needed to buy new machines after the state's expected decertification. The rural county of about 40,000 people said it must have new equipment in place by Aug. 20 to be ready for elections later this year.
So far a prior assurance that funding could be arranged had not materialized, said Chris Gabriel, the county's solicitor.
""We have a responsibility to ensure that our voters can vote in the Fall,"" Gabriel wrote in the letter. ""We therefore decline your request at this time."" 
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the 2020 election, and all counties audited a sample of their votes. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud to put in question Trump's loss to Biden in the state by 81,000 votes.
Mastriano, who is seen as a potential contender for governor in 2022, has said he would issue subpoenas to the counties, a move they will likely challenge in court. Mastriano did not respond to a request for comment.
Laughlin, who is also eyeing a run for governor, said an effort to ""rummage through already counted ballots while employing statistical tricks"" in search of fraud would only help Democrats raise money and harm his party in upcoming elections.

Laughlin noted that Republicans generally did well in Pennsylvania in 2020, capturing the posts of state treasurer and auditor general for the first time in decades.
""That's not a sign of a stolen election,"" he wrote, urging his fellow lawmakers to focus instead on issues such as lower taxes and economic growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day after the U.S. Senate passed a major bipartisan milestone on infrastructure, Republicans in the House of Representatives lapsed into bitter partisanship and infighting, attacking both Democrats and Republican opponents of former President Donald Trump.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans poured scorn on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and blamed President Joe Biden for a host of national ills including inflation, violent crime, illegal border crossings and what he termed politically motivated COVID-19 health guidelines.
""We just need to make sure we fire Nancy Pelosi,"" McCarthy said while delivering a 2022 campaign-style message that House Republicans will echo to constituents during a seven-week break that begins on Friday. Republicans repeatedly referred to Pelosi as a ""lame duck"" speaker. 
Hardline conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus, which includes some of Trump's staunchest allies, later called for Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger to be ousted from the party caucus for joining a House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters despite Republican opposition to the panel.
The House Republican invective contrasted with actions in the evenly split Senate, which advanced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senators-reach-deal-major-points-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-2021-07-28 a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Wednesday and then passed a $2.1 billion emergency measure to aid Capitol security and Afghan allies on Thursday in a 98-0 vote. 
""These members should not be allowed in our closed-door private meetings or even the Republican cloakroom,"" Representative Lauren Boebert, a Republican freshman who has been accused by Democrats of aiding the mob attack.
""Both Liz and Adam have simped for Pelosi as she has consolidated power,"" she added, using slang for being obsequious.
The Freedom Caucus includes lawmakers who could be called to testify before the Jan. 6 committee. It urged McCarthy to help eject Cheney and Kinzinger, who both voted to impeach Trump for allegedly inciting the Capitol attack by falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. 
The caucus also asked McCarthy to pursue politically risky parliamentary action to seek Pelosi's ouster.
McCarthy's office did not respond to a request for comment.
A Cheney spokesman said in a statement that Freedom Caucus members ""represent a dangerous rot that is rooted in the Big Lie, conspiracy theories, bigotry and disrespect for the rule of law and our law enforcement."" 
""These are the same members who push conspiracy theories to their constituents and outright lie for their own personal gain,"" a Kinzinger spokeswoman said. 
Partisan House feuds over the Jan. 6 probe and new COVID-19 mask restrictions were already surging by the time McCarthy and other House Republican leaders held their ""Country in Crisis"" press conference on the Capitol steps. 
Tempers flared after the House chief physician urged lawmakers to resume wearing masks to slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19. Republicans defied the guidance and railed against Pelosi's ""tyranny"" after learning that U.S. Capitol Police could arrest visitors and staff who refuse to comply. 
McCarthy dismissed the physician's guidance as ""a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state."" A Pelosi aide denounced his comments as ""moronic"" after reports that the top House Democrat herself had called McCarthy a ""moron.""
Like McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has sharply criticism Biden and Democrats over spending measures and blocked Pelosi's effort to launch a Jan. 6 commission. 
But McConnell also backed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, after using his influence to trim the package back from the White House's original $2.3 trillion goal, focus it on physical infrastructure and reject proposed tax hikes.

As a result, McConnell again became a target for Trump, who was unable to broker an infrastructure agreement as president. Trump issued a statement accusing the top Senate Republican of ""weak leadership ... giving Democrats everything they want and getting nothing in return."" 
Asked to name something good that Biden has done since taking office in January, McCarthy instead doubled down on his criticism before concluding: ""I haven't found many things that they have done right, no.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tempers flared in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday after its chief physician urged lawmakers to resume wearing masks to slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, with the top Democrat labeling Republican opposition as ""moronic.""
A high-ranking aide to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped short of confirming a report based on garbled audio that Pelosi called her Republican counterpart ""such a moron"" because of his opposition to the new directive.
""The Speaker believes that saying a mask requirement is 'not a decision based on science' is moronic,"" Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in a tweet https://twitter.com/Drew_Hammill/status/1420391351997304834.
Hammill was referring to a tweet by McCarthy https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1420209661735804934 in which he said, ""Make no mistake - The threat of bringing masks back is not a decision based on science, but a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state.""
The high-level spat came as COVID-19 cases in recent days have been rising, along with deaths, across the United States.
Since early in the pandemic, mask-wearing and vaccinations have been U.S. political flashpoints, with Republicans, encouraged by former President Donald Trump, resisting and Democrats urging compliance with medical advice.
Many Republicans have complained that such government edicts infringe on individual liberties.
Late on Tuesday, Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, required the use of masks indoors where people are congregating. It followed a similar move by the White House after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new mask recommendations to stem the spread of the new variant.
""Mask and vaccine mandates: Bullying, Controlling, Unconstitutional, Threats to Liberty!"" Republican Representative Jody Hice of Georgia tweeted https://twitter.com/CongressmanHice/status/1420365111747911683 on Wednesday morning.
Some 57.6% of Americans have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with the lowest rates across the heavily Republican U.S. Southeast. Four of the five U.S. states with the lowest vaccination rates have Republican governors: Mississippi, Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska, according to a Reuters COVID tracker. The governor of the fifth state, Louisiana, is a Democrat.
The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, is rolling out a campaign ad https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mcconnell-strives-counter-bad-advice-boost-us-republican-vaccination-rate-2021-07-28 in his home state of Kentucky to counter what he called ""bad advice"" prompting some Americans to opt not to get vaccinated.
""For the Congress, representing a collection of individuals traveling weekly from various risk areas (both high and low rates of disease transmission), all individuals should wear a well-fitted, medical-grade filtration mask ... when they are in an interior space,"" Dr. Monahan said in a memo late Tuesday.
The rule applies to all House of Representatives office buildings, in the hall of the House and in committee meetings, he said.
Even before the recommendation, many congressional Democrats had resumed wearing masks in the Capitol this week.
At her weekly news conference, Pelosi attempted to cool passions somewhat by refusing to comment directly on whether McCarthy's position was ""moronic."" Instead, in response to a reporter's question, Pelosi said, ""To say that wearing a mask is not based on science, I think is not wise.""
Throughout the pandemic, the 100-member Senate and the 435-member House have taken different precautions to contain COVID-19 infections in the sprawling Capitol.

Monahan's latest directive did not require renewed mask-wearing on the Senate side of the Capitol - a decision that did not escape McCarthy.
""If she (Pelosi) knows so much about science explain to me where the science changes in the Rotunda,"" McCarthy said of the massive room that separates the House and Senate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Joe Biden entered office, his administration made clear it intended to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on getting the country vaccinated. With the Delta variant of the coronavirus now raging and a large chunk of Americans rejecting vaccines, that strategy is under scrutiny. 
When Biden, a Democrat, took over from Republican President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, roughly 400,000 people in the United States had died from COVID-19 and thousands more were dying every day. Inoculations had only just become available.
Biden's team pushed a major vaccine rollout and incentive campaign involving 42,000 pharmacies, dozens of mass vaccination sites, ride-share companies, a beer maker, and 5,100 active duty troops. Top officials fanned out across the country to preach a well-honed message: getting vaccinated means a return to normal.
In many parts of the United States, it worked. Millions lined up for shots and, as the vaccination rate increased nationwide, daily COVID-19 cases https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/index.html, hospitalizations and deaths dropped. 
But the focus on vaccines accompanied a decline in COVID-19 testing, mixed messages on masking, and a failure to anticipate potent anti-vaccination sentiment, misinformation and the virus' own ability to mutate rapidly into more formidable variants, some critics said.
""To protect the country from COVID, you need to have multiple strategies,"" said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We jumped on the vaccine bandwagon and excitement at the expense of other core strategies in the pandemic."" 
COVID-19 cases are rising in nearly 90 percent of jurisdictions in the United States, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with outbreaks in areas with low vaccination rates.
The new spike in cases has clouded what had been a full-steam ahead economic recovery, and could be especially risky if consumers become more cautious and spending slows as pandemic-era unemployment benefits, rent moratoria and other supports begin to expire.
""Vaccination remains the most important thing we can do to prevent the spread of the virus, and so we need to be pulling all levers to support vaccination,"" said Carole Johnson, the White House's coordinator on COVID-19 testing.
White House officials said Biden's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, known as the American Rescue Plan, invested billions of dollars into COVID testing for schools and people who are uninsured.
UNDERESTIMATING ANTI-VAX MOVEMENT 
Americans' refusal to take free, widely available vaccines that shield them from serious illness and death has confounded the Biden White House. 
While vaccines largely protect people from contracting and transmitting the Delta variant, there are rare cases where fully vaccinated people get the virus and may be able to pass it on.
Biden has increasingly referred to the pandemic as one of the unvaccinated. 
""It's the just unfortunate conflation of two things, and that is a virus that has evolved to be extraordinarily efficient in transmitting from person to person ... superimposed upon an almost inexplicable resistance to vaccinations,"" top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told Reuters.
Fauci said that the federal government would rely at least in part on vaccine mandates from schools and businesses for their students and employees to spur lagging vaccination rates.
""If you can't get people on their own volition ... to do what is important for their own health and for that of the country, then you talk about pressure. And pressure is local mandates,"" he said.
About 163.3 million people, or 49.2% of the total U.S. population, have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The agency's data shows a slight uptick in the vaccination rate in recent weeks. Testing has increased as well.
Many experts had suggested that vaccinating 70% or more of the population could help curb COVID-19 transmission through so-called herd immunity, when combined with people who developed immunity following an infection.
But the ability of the coronavirus to mutate quickly into new, highly transmissible variants has cast doubt on whether herd immunity can be achieved. 
As of July 27, the United States was on pace to vaccinate 70% of the entire population by Dec. 16, far later than many developed economies, Reuters analysis shows. https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access
Politics is at least partly to blame. 
Some Republican lawmakers have refused to say whether they have taken a vaccine and opposed Biden's efforts to get more people vaccinated. 
The spread of misinformation sparked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the Biden administration's toughest policy opponents, to plan pro-vaccination commercials https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mcconnell-strives-counter-bad-advice-boost-us-republican-vaccination-rate-2021-07-28 funded with money from his re-election campaign in his home state of Kentucky, the 79-year-old lawmaker told Reuters.
Anti-vaccination sentiment did not come out of the blue. Reuters/Ipsos polling showed hesitancy https://polling.reuters.com/topic/coronavirus was ripe through 2020 and early 2021.
The White House has repeatedly pushed back against misinformation, targeting social media platforms in particular.
Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said the Biden administration's acknowledgement of the ""terrible impact"" of the anti-vaccine movement was important, but he said the government could do more.
""Anti-science is arguably one of the leading killers of the American people, and yet we don't ... treat it as such. We don't give it the same stature as global terrorism and nuclear proliferation and cyber attacks,"" he said. 
The Kaiser Family Foundation said earlier this month its surveys showed Democrats were much more likely to say they have been vaccinated than Republicans. 
Former Trump administration officials argue Biden should have given his predecessor some credit for pushing speedy development of the vaccines, to boost vaccination rates among his supporters.
Trump, who has continued to claim falsely that he won the 2020 election, is the only living president who has not participated in public service announcements to encourage people to take the vaccine. 
The White House has rejected criticism that it did not engage Trump more.
MASKS OFF AS A REWARD 
The Biden administration sought to create incentives for people of all political stripes by emphasizing, in line with CDC guidance updated in the spring, that those who received their shots could move around without covering their mouth and nose.
""If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask,"" Biden said in a May 13 speech in the White House Rose Garden.
But critics say the guidance on mask-wearing has been confusing. 
On Tuesday the CDC partially reversed course, encouraging vaccinated Americans to go back to wearing masks in indoor public places in regions where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading.
""I honestly think it's like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube,"" said Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine and infectious disease epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta, referring to getting people to mask up again.
Meanwhile, as the Delta variant spreads, a lack of testing makes it harder to track asymptomatic cases. 
Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said rapid testing would help vaccinated people check themselves before traveling or dining in a restaurant.
""That's blatantly missing,"" he said.
Biden's American Rescue Plan invested $4.8 billion for testing of uninsured people and $10 billion for testing in schools, the White House said.
""Testing has tended to ebb and flow with cases,"" said Johnson, the testing coordinator. ""Because ... we have worked so hard to get people vaccinated, there were not as many people seeking testing."" 

In 2020, U.S. regulators worked on overdrive to authorize dozens of COVID-19 tests, including low cost, rapid antigen tests, with the goal of boosting national testing capacity to some 200 million per month by the end of 2020.
But demand for tests declined as vaccination rates increased. Earlier this month,  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) said it laid off 400 workers at two of its test-making facilities in response to falling demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday ordered pre-trial detention of a former Virginia police officer who had 34 firearms on order at a gun dealership months after his arrest and initial pre-trial release on charges related to the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot.
In a court order, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found there was ""probable cause to believe that Robertson committed a felony - willfully shipping or transporting firearms and ammunition despite being under felony indictment - while on pretrial release"".
The judge said that on June 30, prosecutors sought Robertson's arrest, resulting in the judge issuing a warrant leading to his arrest and detention on July 7 pending a ruling on the government's request to revoke his pre-trial release - the ruling the judge issued late on Wednesday.
A lawyer for Robertson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Arguing for Robertson's pre-trial detention, prosecutors said Robertson, then still serving as a police officer in Rocky Mount, Virginia, was photographed in the Capitol during the riot making an obscene gesture in front of a statute.
Prosecutors cited social media postings by Robertson touting the Capitol riot and appearing to endorse further political violence.
Following his initial release, prosecutors said the FBI learned Robertson was still ""buying firearms and ammunition online and shipping these items in interstate commerce.""
In a June 29 search of Robertson's home, the judge said, the FBI found a loaded M4 military-style assault rifle as well as what ""appears to be a partially assembled pipe bomb.""

And on June 29, a Roanoke, Virginia gun dealer told the FBI Robertson had 34 guns waiting to be picked up.
""Robertson’s procurement of these dangerous weapons under the surrounding circumstances heightens the risk to public safety,"" the judge said, ordering Robertson's continuing detention.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed union lawyers Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty to seats on the National Labor Relations Board, paving the way for a Democratic majority that is likely to reverse a series of employer-friendly Trump-era decisions.
The Democrat-led Senate voted 52-47 to approve the nomination of Wilcox, a partner at Levy Ratner in New York, and 53-46 to confirm Prouty, the general counsel of New York City service worker union SEIU 32BJ.
A White House spokesperson hailed the confirmations and said Biden has ""made it a priority to appoint members to the NLRB who will protect worker organizing, collective bargaining, and workers' rights to engage in concerted activity.""
The NLRB hears unfair labor practice cases brought by workers and unions and oversees private-sector union elections.
Wilcox will fill a vacant seat with a term expiring in August 2023. Prouty will serve a five-year term beginning next month, when Republican William Emanuel's term ends.
The Senate last week voted 51-50 to confirm https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/vp-breaks-tie-bidens-pick-nlrb-general-counsel-2021-07-21 Jennifer Abruzzo, a career NLRB attorney who more recently worked for the Communication Workers of America union, to serve as the board's general counsel. Biden fired Trump-era GC Peter Robb on his first day in office in January. 
Wilcox and Prouty did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Wilcox has worked on a series of high-profile cases in her decades-long career, including a major recent NLRB case accusing McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) https://www.reuters.com/article/employment-mcdonalds/mcdonalds-intervenes-to-defend-joint-liability-settlement-amid-shakeup-in-nlrb-leadership-idUSL1N2LK275 of retaliating against franchise workers who participated in an organizing campaign. 
Prouty was previously general counsel of the union UNITE HERE and served as a senior lawyer for the Major League Baseball Players Association from 2008 through 2017, when he joined SEIU 32BJ. The union represents about 175,000 workers in New York City.

Biden's nominations https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/unions-hail-nomination-high-profile-labor-lawyer-nlrb-2021-05-27 of Wilcox and Prouty were hailed by the country's largest labor unions, who said their deep experience, including Wilcox's stint as an NLRB field attorney, made them uniquely prepared to tackle challenges faced by workers.
But Republicans, who have criticized the changes Biden has made at the board as showing favoritism to unions over workers, have expressed concerns https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/republicans-call-nlrb-dol-nominees-very-troublesome-2021-07-15 about the NLRB nominees' union ties and progressive records.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday issued legal guidance aimed at curbing voting rights abuses in U.S. states such as Arizona, where Republican officials launched a contentious audit in a failed bid to reverse former President Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.
In the guidance, the U.S. Justice Department raises concerns about the ""unusual second round of examinations"" into 2020 election results cropping up in various states even though none of the prior state recounts had ""produced evidence of either wrongdoing or mistakes that casts any doubt on the outcome of the national election results.""
Trump has falsely said the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, and his Republican allies sought on this basis to undo his losses to Biden in key states. Numerous states have passed new Republican-backed voting restrictions in the aftermath of Trump's false claims.
The Justice Department also issued guidance laying out the federal voting rights laws governing elections in a direct response to states such as Georgia that have, among other restrictions, limited early voting and voting by mail.
""I think the reason we're issuing this as guidance is to tell jurisdictions generally that we are concerned that if they're going to conduct these audits ... they have to comply with federal law,"" a Justice Department official told reporters on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This document sets down a marker.""
The legal guidance fulfills a pledge that https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-attorney-general-vows-aggressively-defend-voting-rights-2021-06-11 Attorney General Merrick Garland made in June when he vowed to aggressively enforce voting rights laws. Following that speech, the department sued Georgia, accusing the state of unlawfully violating the rights of Black voters with its new voting restrictions https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-sue-georgia-over-restrictive-new-state-voting-law-source-2021-06-25.
In May, Arizona halted plans to knock on voters' doors https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/auditors-halt-plans-knock-arizona-voters-doors-amid-justice-department-scrutiny-2021-05-10 as part of the audit after a top official in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division warned that canvassing could run afoul of federal laws banning voter intimidation.

Trump allies in Pennsylvania https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-ally-pennsylvania-pushes-arizona-style-audit-2020-election-2021-07-07 and Florida have recently said they are hoping to launch audits similar to Arizona's.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A California man accused of attacking police with bear spray and a large metal sign during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol assault by supporters of then-President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to federal charges including riot-related felonies.
Maria Jacob, a lawyer for accused rioter Sean McHugh, told U.S. District Judge John Bates during a video hearing that her client was entering not guilty pleas to all charges against him including assaulting police using a dangerous weapon and engaging in violence on the Capitol grounds or in the building.
McHugh, 34, is being held in pre-trial detention. McHugh listed an Auburn, California address on an airplane reservation he made for a Jan. 5 flight to Washington. 
More than 535 people face charges arising from the riot in which Trump supporters sought to block Congress from formally certifying now-President Joe Biden's election victory. Before the riot, Trump delivered a speech to supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Federal prosecutor Jacob Strain told the judge the government would be willing to engage in plea negotiations in McHugh's case. Bates set a further hearing for Sept. 30.
In an affidavit describing the grounds for McHugh's arrest, an FBI agent said that videos showed McHugh ""assaulting"" Capitol Police officers by shoving a large metal sign at them and spraying them with what the affidavit described as an ""unknown chemical."" A July 7 indictment stated McHugh attacked police with bear spray.
Police have said the hundreds of rioters attacked them with a variety of weapons including chemical irritants.

The FBI said McHugh was on probation following a 2018 conviction for driving under the influence. A Superior Court official in California's Placer County said McHugh in 2010 pleaded guilty to engaging in unlawful sex with a minor. 
In another case, a federal judge approved the release on bail of Daniel Christmann, a New York City plumber facing misdemeanor riot charges. Christmann, who last year ran unsuccessfully for a New York State Senate seat, posted videos taken inside the Capitol on a website called ""dannyforsenate.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) told federal agencies they must mandate masks indoors in federal buildings for all employees and visitors regardless of vaccination status in areas of substantial or high COVID-19 community transmission, according to an email seen by Reuters.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance on Tuesday that vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in areas of substantial or high COVID-19 transission.
In an email sent to all federal agencies late on Tuesday, Jason Miller, OMB's deputy director for management, said in line with the CDC guidance, ""in areas of substantial or high community transmission, agencies must require all federal employees, onsite contractors, and visitors, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask inside of federal buildings. As of today, that includes the Washington, D.C., area.""
It added that people ""not fully vaccinated also need to continue to physically distance consistent with CDC guidance.""
The CDC said on Tuesday at least 63% of U.S. counties are considered substantial or high risk. 
President Joe Biden's administration on Monday required that all Veterans Affairs staff receive vaccinations, and on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a Twitter post all of its 240,000 employees, will need to wear a mask indoors and physically distance, effective immediately and regardless of vaccination status.

As the virulent Delta variant of the coronavirus blazes through parts of the United States and immunizations lag, the federal government is once again racing to contain the pandemic that began more than a year ago, in the hopes of avoiding future nationwide shutdowns.
Biden is expected to announce further mandates for federal agencies on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump's preferred candidate for a U.S. House seat in Texas was projected to lose a special runoff election on Tuesday, defeated by a fellow Republican who raised far more campaign cash, the Texas Tribune newspaper said.
Susan Wright, a 58-year-old Republican activist whom Trump endorsed in April, had sought to finish her late husband Representative Ron Wright's term in the House.
But the newspaper projected that Wright would lose to Texas state legislator Jake Ellzey in Texas' 6th congressional district, a longtime Republican-held district outside Dallas. Ellzey was ahead 52.9% to 47.1% for Wright, with 90% of precincts reporting, according to state data that stopped short of declaring a winner.
The two Republicans emerged from 23 candidates in the first round of voting May 1, with Democrats shut out of the contest.
Wright had been expected to do well because Trump weighed in for her in a special election, normally a low-turnout affair.
The state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in a statement congratulated Ellzey, calling him ""a strong and effective leader.""
Trump endorsed Wright in April. His political action committee made a last-minute $100,000 television ad buy for her over the weekend, campaign finance records show, and he made a personal pitch for her during a telephone rally Monday night.
""Ellzey’s victory suggests a Trump endorsement may not be all that is cracked up to be, while also highlighting Wright’s weakness as a candidate and the ineffectual campaign she and her advisors ran, hoping to coast to victory based on Trump’s endorsement,"" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.
The result will reduce Democrats' narrow 220-211 majority in the U.S. House by one seat as Congress prepares to try to pass Democratic President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. 
Ron Wright died of COVID-19 on Feb. 7.
In addition to being a Texas state senator, Ellzey is a former Navy fighter pilot who flew combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. He far exceeded Wright in fundraising, taking in $1.7 million through July 7, $1 million more than Wright, according to Federal Election Commission data. 
Trump won the district by three percentage points in the 2020 presidential election, a nine-point slide from four years earlier.

The Trump-allied fund-raising arm of the conservative Club for Growth based in Washington, D.C., says it has spent over $1 million in television ads and mailers for Wright. The ads proclaimed Trump's endorsement of Wright and sharply attacked Ellzey, charging that Democrats are trying to get him elected.
Ahead of the voting, Democrats said they were not keen about turning out to vote for either Republican. Jana Lynne Sanchez, the Democrat who was edged out of the runoff by 354 votes in May, when there were 23 candidates on the ballot, said of the candidates: ""They are both very far right.""

Brooks had asked the Justice Department consider him covered by the Westfall Act, which protects federal employees from being sued for actions taken as part of their jobs, in relations to the lawsuit brought by Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell.

The Justice Department said in the court filing that it had determined that Brooks' appearance at the Jan. 6 rally - in which then-President Donald Trump exhorted his supporters to stop the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory - was a campaign activity.
""It is no part of the business of the United States to pick sides among candidates in federal elections,"" the department said in the filing. ""Members of Congress are subject to a host of restrictions that carefully distinguish between their official functions, on the one hand, and campaign functions, on the other,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Four police officers on Tuesday told lawmakers they were beaten, taunted with racial insults, heard threats including ""kill him with his own gun"" and thought they might die as they struggled to defend the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 against a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters.
Often tearful, sometimes profane, the officers called the rioters ""terrorists"" engaged in an ""attempted coup"" during a 3-1/2 hour congressional hearing in which they also criticized Republican lawmakers who have sought to downplay the attack.
""I feel like I went to hell and back to protect the people in this room,"" said District of Columbia police officer Michael Fanone, referring to lawmakers. ""The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful,"" Fanone added, slamming his hand onto the witness table.
It was a dramatic first hearing for a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee formed despite opposition by Trump's fellow Republicans to investigate the worst violence at the Capitol since the British invasion in the War of 1812.
Some Democrats have suggested Trump, who made an incendiary speech to supporters before the riot repeating false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, be called to testify. The officers recounted how rioters fought on Trump's behalf, seeking to prevent Congress from formally certifying now-President Joe Biden's election victory.
""He himself helped create this monstrosity,"" Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell said of Trump as he described rioters wielding weapons including police shields, batons, sledgehammers, flag poles, Taser devices, chemical irritants, metal pipes, rocks, broken table legs and metal guard rails.
The officers urged lawmakers to determine what happened, including whether Trump or others helped instigate it. 
""There was an attack carried out on Jan. 6, and a hit man sent them. I want you to get to the bottom of that,"" Capitol police officer Harry Dunn said.
Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson and Republican panel member Liz Cheney warned against ""whitewashing"" a riot in which more than 535 people now face criminal charges, even as Trump allies portray the panel as politically motivated.
Cheney, stripped of her House Republican leadership post after denouncing Trump's election falsehoods, said she hopes the nation does not become so blinded by partisanship that ""we throw away the miracle"" of American democracy.
The committee, expected to explore questions about how the riot was organized and financed as well as law enforcement's lack of preparedness, heard the most detailed public account to date of what police encountered during the rampage. More than a hundred officers were injured by the hundreds of rioters.
Fanone said he was pulled into the crowd, beaten, shocked repeatedly with a Taser, robbed of his badge and knocked unconscious, suffering a heart attack. Fanone said he heard a rioter say ""kill him with his own gun.""
'MEDIEVAL BATTLEFIELD'
""What we were subjected to that day was like something from a medieval battlefield,"" Gonell said.
Dunn, who is Black, said rioters repeatedly called him a racial slur. Dunn said he challenged their claims that no one had voted for Biden by telling them that he had done so.
Gonell, a naturalized American citizen born in the Dominican Republican who served in the U.S. Army in Iraq, recalled rioters calling him a traitor who should be executed. Gonell said he thought to himself, ""This is how I'm going to die.""
Washington officer Daniel Hodges called the rioters ""terrorists,"" citing the term's legal definition. He said they told him: ""You will die on your knees!""
Hodges said many rioters appeared to be white nationalists. While his Black and Hispanic colleagues faced racial slurs, Hodges, who is white, said rioters tried to recruit him, asking, ""Are you my brother?""
The rioters sent lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence scrambling for safety. Four people died on Jan. 6, including one rioter shot by police and three others who experienced medical emergencies. A policeman who was attacked by rioters died the following day. Two others later committed suicide. 
""Some people are trying to deny what happened, to whitewash it, to turn the insurrectionists into martyrs,"" Thompson said. ""And all of it for a vile, vile lie.""
Democrats created the panel after congressional Republicans blocked formation of an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the riot. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy acted to prevent fellow Republicans from joining the panel after Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to seat two of his choices amid concerns they would undermine its integrity. Two Republicans picked by Pelosi are serving.
The Senate on Tuesday inched closer to approving around $900 million in emergency aid to bolster Capitol police funding and establish a ""quick-reaction force"" to respond to any future attacks, among other things.

During the hearing, Democrat Stephanie Murphy asked Hodges what he was fighting for as he confronted the rioters.
""Democracy,"" Hodges replied.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sanket Bulsara accepted Barrack's plea on seven counts, including secretly lobbying the Trump administration for the UAE between 2016 and 2018. Barrack, 74, also pleaded not guilty to lying to investigators about his dealings with the Middle Eastern country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday nominated a slate of eight people to serve as U.S. attorneys, including the top federal prosecutor who will oversee the Jan. 6 Capitol riots cases if he is confirmed, and a progressive prosecutor in Massachusetts.
Matthew Graves, a former federal prosecutor now with the corporate law firm DLA Piper, is Biden's choice to run the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, which has been overwhelmed with a flood of cases stemming from the riots.
Federal prosecutors have arrested more than 535 people on charges of taking part in the violence, in which followers of then-President Donald Trump fought police, smashed windows and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for safety.
Graves earlier in his career served as a prosecutor in the same U.S. Attorney's Office he would lead, securing a guilty plea from former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr for misusing campaign funds and investigating banks for sanctions violations.
Biden also nominated Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-progressives/democrats-eye-three-progressive-prosecutors-for-u-s-attorney-posts-idUSKBN2AW18M, a local prosecutor in Boston who is part of a growing national movement of ""progressive prosecutors"" who support efforts to eliminate racial disparities by rejecting the traditional ""tough on crime"" culture that has led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black men.
The nominations must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Rollins, who earlier in her career worked as a federal prosecutor, was elected in 2018 as the first Black woman to serve as the district attorney in Suffolk County, which covers Boston. She would be the first Black woman to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts.
Rollins campaigned on a promise to decline prosecution for some low-level crimes, and she had been vocal about the need for police reform even before the nationwide protests following the May killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

Some other progressive district attorneys have also been under consideration to serve as U.S. attorneys.
Other nominees to serve as U.S. attorneys include Erek Barron for the District of Maryland, Nicholas Brown for the Western District of Washington, Clifford Johnson for the Northern District of Indiana, Zachary Myers for the Southern District of Indiana, Trini Ross for the Western District of New York and Vanessa Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.

""There must be a pathway to citizenship,"" Biden told reporters as he returned to the White House after spending the weekend at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.
Dreamers are immigrants brought to the United States as children who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Democrats hope to provide legal status to some immigrants in the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation measure they plan to pass with a simple majority, but details have not been released. 
Asked if the reconciliation measure needed to include the pathway to citizenship, Biden said that ""remains to be seen.""
Senate Democratic leaders this month told other members the budget measure would open the door to legislation on climate measures, social spending, and extension of a child tax credit. 
However, it remains unclear if the Senate parliamentarian, who decides which provisions may be included in a budget package, will approve inclusion of an immigration measure.
The DACA program, created by former President Barack Obama while Biden was vice president, faces new legal challenges.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen this month sided with a group of states suing to end the program, arguing that it was illegally created by Obama in 2012.

Biden last week vowed to preserve the DACA program and urged Congress to provide a path to citizenship.
DACA protects recipients from deportation, grants them work authorization and access to driver's licenses, and in some cases better access to financial aid for education. It does not provide a path to citizenship. People protected under DACA primarily are young Hispanic adults born in Mexico and countries in Central and South America.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday formally named Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger to serve on a select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
Kinzinger, Pelosi said in a statement, ""brings great patriotism to the committee’s mission: to find the facts and protect our democracy.""
It was unclear whether she would name additional Republicans. Earlier in the day, Pelosi was interviewed on ABC's ""This Week"" and said that other Republicans also had expressed interest in working on the panel.
Kinzinger, 43, is an Air Force veteran and an outspoken critic of Trump. He was one of seven House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump earlier this year on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol.
He now joins fellow Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney on the panel as it prepares to hold its first hearing on the deadly attack on Tuesday.
House Republican leaders opposed the creation of a bipartisan, independent commission and subsequently also opposed the bipartisan House select committee.
Pelosi has already appointed Democratic members of the committee, along with Cheney. She rejected two of the five Republican members chosen by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, saying their participation could threaten the integrity of the panel's work.
In reaction, McCarthy said his remaining three appointees would be withdrawn unless Pelosi installed all of his choices.
Kinzinger and Cheney, who was ousted from a House leadership position after she criticized Trump, were not on his list. 
Four people died on Jan. 6 when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol while Congress was certifying Joe Biden's November election win over Trump, who has continued to make false claims of widespread election fraud.

One person was shot dead by police, and three others died of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day, and two police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than 100 police officers were injured. 
One of the Republican lawmakers rejected by Pelosi, Representative Jim Banks, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the House speaker rejected him and fellow Republican Jim Jordan because she ""does not want to hear the other side"" of events in the Jan. 6 attack.

ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden tested his political muscle in the state of Virginia on Friday in a campaign stop for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, who Biden said was running against an ""acolyte"" of former President Donald Trump.
The off-year state race could be a sign of Democrats' strength or weakness ahead of the 2022 midterm congressional elections, as well as a test of the political strength of the president and his Republican predecessor.
Democrats hope next year to keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives, in which they have a slim majority, and the Senate, in which there is a 50-50 split, while Republicans hope to take over leadership of both chambers.
Biden traveled the short distance from Washington to a park in Arlington, Virginia, for the event for McAuliffe, a long-term fixture in Democratic politics who is running for a second term as Virginia governor in November's election.
""Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump and so is Terry,"" Biden said. ""I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia and so will Terry.""
Trump lost Virginia in both 2016 and 2020. 
McAuliffe's opponent in the governor's race is Virginia businessman Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who has been endorsed by Trump. “The guy Terry’s running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump for real,” Biden said. “I don’t know where these guys come from.” 
A poll released earlier this month by the Trafalgar Group said the race was tight, with McAuliffe at 46.8% support and Youngkin with 45%. Virginia in recent years has been trending Democratic based on overwhelming support from the northern part of the state. Biden won the state in 2020.
“Terry McAuliffe must be worried about his terrible poll numbers if he’s already calling in political favors this early in the campaign,"" said Youngkin's spokesperson Macaulay Porter.
Biden kicked off his remarks by tweaking some conservatives who have recently begun recommending vaccination against COVID-19.
""Some of our very conservative friends have had an altar call. They've seen the Lord,"" he quipped. 
The Virginia race is likely to be seen as a referendum on Biden's first year in office and a test of strength for the Democratic president. The party that holds the White House usually loses seats in Congress in the first midterm elections after a new president takes over.

McAuliffe eagerly sought to inject Trump into the race. McAuliffe said of Youngkin: ""He's not running for you. He's running for Donald Trump.""
McAuliffe, who has raised millions of dollars for Democratic candidates and was a close ally of then-President Bill Clinton, is running four years after ending his first term. State law forbids a governor from running for re-election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrats are threatening to scrap plans to create an infrastructure bank in the $1.2 trillion bipartisan spending bill after Republicans opposed a provision intended to lift workers' wages, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
A decision to remove funding for the bank would be aimed at resolving a logjam over U.S. President Joe Biden's top legislative initiative, as lawmakers scramble to finalize key details of the plan ahead of the Senate's typical August recess.
The group of bipartisan lawmakers seeking to hammer out Biden's infrastructure bill want to include $20 billion for a newly created infrastructure bank that would attract investment through private-public partnerships.
But Republicans oppose attaching requirements from the Davis-Bacon Act, a decades-old law requiring contractors to pay prevailing wages, typically higher levels secured by unions.
A White House spokesman declined to comment.
The $20 billion in funding would attract significantly more from the private sector and could be used to pay for green energy projects, such as wind and solar, that the administration is counting on to help curb climate change and meet Biden's net-zero carbon targets. 
While most of the bipartisan spending bill would come under the Davis-Bacon Act, Republicans are reluctant to make wage laws apply to private companies, even when they are relying on public financing.
Democrats, who are closely tied to large labor unions, also want prevailing wage laws to apply to high-speed broadband contractors, but that also faces Republican opposition.
If the funding falls out of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, Democrats could add it back in to their multi-trillion spending package that they hope to pass later along party lines. But the lengthy negotiations are also drawing consternation from progressive Democrats who worry that key policies are being jettisoned or watered down.
Lawmakers are hoping to hold a procedural vote as soon as Monday that will allow the bipartisan bill to move forward. Other key issues remain unresolved heading into the weekend, including a disagreement over how much funding would be allocated to public transit.
The bipartisan framework with $1.2 trillion in funding over five years includes about $579 billion in new spending on roads, bridges, ports and other public works projects.

Democrat Biden has said it is essential, but he also wants it to be followed by a much larger $3.5 trillion budget framework that would allow for spending on some of his other priorities, including climate measures and social spending.
Republicans say they will not back the larger plan.

(Reuters) -A judge in Los Angeles on Friday signed off on a deal that allows former U.S. President Donald Trump's billionaire ally Thomas Barrack to be released from custody while he awaits trial on charges of illegal lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.
Under the agreement approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue, Barrack will wear an ankle bracelet that tracks his location, surrender his passport and submit to a curfew. The agreement, reached with prosecutors, also calls for Barrack to put up a $250 million bond, secured by $5 million in cash.
The deal spares Barrack, who was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-ally-barrack-arrested-foreign-lobbying-charges-us-justice-department-2021-07-20, from being transferred in government custody to Brooklyn, where the case against him was filed.
An attorney for Barrack, Matt Herrington, said during the court hearing that lawyers worked intensely on the bail package so that the businessman would not remain in jail over the weekend.
""We have moved great mountains to ensure that Mr. Barrack is able to get out before the weekend,"" Herrington said.
Barrack, who chaired Trump's inaugural fund and was a frequent guest at the White House, was charged with illegally lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of the UAE.
A spokesperson for Barrack said he will plead not guilty.

Barrack, 74, is a longtime Trump ally and founder of the digital infrastructure-focused private equity firm DigitalBridge Group Inc, which was known as Colony Capital (NYSE:DBRG) Inc before a rebranding announced in June.
A seven-count indictment filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn accused Barrack, a former employee and an Emirati businessman of failing to register as lobbyists and using their influence to advance the UAE's foreign policy goals in the United States. Barrack also was accused of repeatedly lying during an FBI interview about his dealings with the UAE.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who was one of the youngest women in Congress before losing her re-election bid last year, on Thursday said she would run for the Iowa U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Chuck Grassley.
Finkenauer faces an uphill battle in a Republican-leaning state should she win the Democratic nomination for the November 2022 congressional elections, which will determine which party controls Congress during the second half of President Joe Biden's term.
Grassley, 87, is a seven-term senator first elected in 1980 who easily won re-election in 2016 with 60% of the vote. Former President Donald Trump, also a Republican, carried Iowa in 2020 with 53% of the vote. 

Finkenauer, who filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday declaring her candidacy, is personally and politically close to Biden, who campaigned for her in her 2018 House of Representatives campaign when she unseated Republican Rod Blum. 
She held office for a single two-year term, losing to Republican Ashley Hinson last November.

(Reuters) - One of the Pennsylvania counties targeted in a Republican lawmaker's ""forensic investigation"" into the 2020 election has beefed up security around its courthouse following threatening posts on social media, one of its commissioners told Reuters.
The incendiary Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts appeared targeted at members of Tioga County's all-Republican board of commissioners after they decided not to comply with the lawmaker's request to turn over their voting machines, Commissioner Erick Coolidge said.
One individual, in an apparent reference to the county's three commissioners, called them traitors and said there were ""plenty of trees"" in a nearby gorge to ""hang ropes from,"" according to a post viewed by Reuters on a Facebook page.
In response, the law enforcement presence was strengthened around their offices at the courthourse in the town of Wellsboro, Coolidge said, without providing details. The Tioga County sheriff's office did not reply to a request for comment.
""We’ve kind of beefed up security around the courthouse,"" Coolidge said. ""I'm more concerned about our personnel than myself.""
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the November election, and all counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud to put in question Donald Trump's loss to President Joe Biden in the state by 81,000 votes.
State Senator Doug Mastriano, a promoter of Trump's baseless stolen-election claims, has nevertheless argued that a deeper probe involving the inspection of equipment was needed because so many people doubted Trump's defeat. Earlier this month, he started the probe with requests to Tioga, Philadelphia and York counties for access to their voting machines.
Tioga, a rural county of 40,000 people on the state's northern border with New York, told Mastriano they could not comply after the state's top election official warned counties that their equipment would be decertified if they cooperated.
The move angered many Trump supporters. Audit the Vote PA, a group that has been promoting Mastriano's effort, said in a Facebook post on Thursday that it had been informed of death threats against Tioga County commissioners. ""We never ever would condone violence and we would never advocate for that,"" it said. 
Coolidge, a Trump supporter and veteran of Republican politics in the state, said Mastriano was partly to blame for the tensions. He described his approach as ""terribly offensive"", saying he had led people to believe that a lack of immediate compliance meant counties were trying to conceal something.
Mastriano, who did not respond to a request for comment, has given counties until July 31 to comply or face a subpoena. ""There is nothing to fear if there is nothing to hide,"" he wrote in a July 7 editorial explaining the rationale for his probe.
""He owes us an apology for the way he conducted this because he incited all of those who believe this needs to take place,"" Coolidge said. ""I am as angry at this individual as I can humanly possibly be.""
Coolidge said the county was open to complying with the investigation as long as it was deemed legal, Mastriano was able to get the committee he chairs to issue a subpoena for access to the equipment, and taxpayers did not bear any costs.

He said he was confident Tioga's results were accurate.
""I would rather we spent time or money in arenas that change the quality of life of those we represent,"" he said.

Pelosi had earlier rejected Representatives Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, staunch defenders of former President Donald Trump, from serving on the panel investigating the Trump supporters who assaulted Congress in an attempt to stop it from certifying President Joe Biden's election.
The violence followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud and urged his supporters to ""fight"" the election outcome.
""With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee,"" Pelosi said in a statement. “The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.""
Pelosi created the 13-member panel after congressional Republicans rejected a bipartisan panel to probe the violence, which saw hundreds of Trump supporters storm the building, assaulting police, smashing windows and sending lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence scrambling for safety.
""Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement withdrawing his nominees.
Pelosi had previously appointed one Republican, Liz Cheney, to the panel. Pelosi had said she would accept McCarthy's other three nominees -- Representatives Rodney Davis, Kelly Armstrong and Troy Nehls -- and had asked him to pick two new members. 
Cheney, who was stripped of her leadership position among House Republicans for rejecting Trump's false claims, told reporters she would remain on the commission and agreed with Pelosi's decision.
""I am absolutely confident that we will have a non-partisan investigation,"" she told reporters.

Jordan is an ardent Trump supporter who served as one of his main defenders during his two impeachment trials, the latter of which was on a charge of inciting the Capitol riot. The then-Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Trump both times.
Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the following day. Two police officers who responded to the assault on the Capitol later took their own lives. More than a hundred police officers were injured.

(Reuters) -A U.S. Senate committee on Thursday voted 10-10 along party lines on President Joe Biden's nomination of Montana conservationist Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the Bureau of Land Management, setting the stage for a vote by the full Senate.
The bureau, a division of the Interior Department, manages more than a tenth of the nation's surface area. Its director will be central to Biden's effort to address climate change through the management of public lands, including a current review of the federal oil and gas leasing program.
Because of the tie vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat will have to take procedural steps to bring the nomination to the full chamber for debate and a vote.
Following the vote, Schumer voiced his support for the nominee.
""We need someone like Ms. Stone-Manning to manage our public lands: A staunch advocate for conservation but also an honest broker,"" he said on the Senate floor.
All of the Republican members of the committee voted ""no"" on Stone-Manning. In the weeks leading up to the vote and at Thursday's hearing, Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming, Steve Daines of Montana and others voiced vehement concerns about her ties to a radical environmental group when she was a student in the 1980s.
Most recently, Stone-Manning was senior adviser for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation, advocating against former President Donald Trump's push to maximize fossil fuel production at the expense of other public land uses.
Prior to joining the NWF in 2017, Stone-Manning served as chief of staff to the Democratic former governor of Montana, Steve Bullock.
During the hearing, Democrats and Republicans disagreed over whether Stone-Manning lied to the committee when she said she was never the target of an investigation by law enforcement. Stone-Manning received immunity decades ago for her testimony in a case involving tree-spiking by the radical group Earth First! in an Idaho national forest.
Tree spiking involves hammering a metal rod into a tree to prevent logging.

Calling the debate ""one of the more emotional ones we've had"" in his more than a decade on the committee, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin, a Democrat, praised Stone-Manning's track record working with both political parties during her time in state government in Montana.
""She's had an exemplary performance,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Pennsylvania's top election official has decertified the voting equipment of a rural county that participated in an audit of the 2020 election requested by a Republican state lawmaker and staunch ally of former President Donald Trump.
Acting Secretary of State Veronica Degraffenreid said on Wednesday that Fulton County violated the state election code by giving a third party access to its election databases and other certified equipment in an audit of the 2020 results.
The audit was conducted in December at the request of Republican state Senators Doug Mastriano and Judy Ward, who asked county officials to allow Wake Technology Services Inc to probe the county's results, according to media reports.
Degraffenreid's announcement was the latest salvo in a battle between Mastriano, a promoter of Trump's false stolen-election claims who is now waging an effort to conduct a wider ""forensic investigation"" into Trump's loss in the state, and the administration of Democratic Governor Tom Wolf.
""These actions were taken in a manner that was not transparent,"" Degraffenreid said. ""As a result of the access granted to Wake TSI, Fulton County's certified system has been compromised.""
Fulton County officials and Wake TSI, based outside of Philadelphia, did not respond to requests for comment. The company was at one point also involved in a contentious audit of the vote in Arizona.
Neither Mastriano nor Ward responded to an email seeking comment on Wednesday.
Degraffenreid said that Dominion Voting Systems, which leases tabulation machines to the county, also could not verify that its equipment was safe to use. 
Fulton County received notification from Dominion that it was in violation of its contract and needed to pay $25,000 to lease new equipment for the May 2021 primary, the Fulton County News reported last month.
There has been no indication that the Fulton County audit turned up any irregularities.
ELECTORAL BATTLEGROUND
Trump carried Fulton, a south-central Pennsylvania county of about 15,000 residents, with nearly 86% of the vote. But he lost Pennsylvania to Democratic President Joe Biden.
Republicans there and in other battleground states have pursued audits of the November election, repeating Trump's baseless claims that widespread fraud cost him a second White House term.
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the 2020 election, and all counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud.
Mastriano has nevertheless argued that a more comprehensive probe involving the examination of equipment was needed. Earlier this month, he launched his ""forensic investigation,"" starting with requests to Tioga, Philadelphia and York counties for access to their voting machines.
Tioga's three Republican commissioners have said they cannot comply, citing the likely cost to replace its machines. While Philadelphia has not commented on the matter, the Democratic stronghold is also expected to deny Mastriano's request.

At a meeting on Wednesday, York County Commissioner Julie Wheeler said a letter had been sent to Mastriano seeking clarity on various issues, including what audit firm would be used and who would pay for it.
Wheeler warned that replacing all York's voting equipment would cost more than $2.7 million, and said that ""if there is support for a forensic analysis at the state level, it seems that all counties should be included"" rather than just the current three.

""Look, it's real simple. We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple,"" Biden said at a town-hall event in Ohio that was broadcast on CNN.
""Ten thousand people have recently died. Nine thousand nine hundred and fifty of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated,"" he said.
Biden fielded roughly a dozen questions from Democrats and Republicans about the economy and crime, infrastructure and the filibuster, in a Cincinnati district that Trump won by a heavy margin. The entire audience was vaccinated, the news network noted. 
Swiftly rising coronavirus cases across the United States and abroad have fueled fears of a resurgent pandemic and rattled stock markets as the highly contagious Delta variant appears to be taking hold.
Many of the new U.S. outbreaks are in parts of the country where COVID-19 vaccinations have lagged. The White House's vaccination efforts have met waves of disinformation and skepticism. 
Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may approve new vaccines for children under 12 as soon as the end of August, ahead of previous estimates. 
""My expectation talking to the group of scientists we put together ... is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year, at the end of August, beginning of September, October, they'll get a final approval,"" Biden said. 
He also said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would likely issue guidance encouraging children who have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus to wear masks in schools.
INFRASTRUCTURE, INFLATION 
Biden that the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal he struck last month will eventually get passed because Republicans will stick to the bargain. 
The fate of the deal, one of the president's top priorities, is uncertain in Congress where Democrats hold slim majorities.
""You had up to 20 Republicans sign the letter saying we think we need this deal. We think we need this deal. ... I come from a tradition in the Senate, you shake your hand, that's it,"" said Biden, a longtime senator.
He said concerns about inflation, as pent-up demand combined with supply-side challenges pushes up prices for consumer goods, were temporary. 
""The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand,"" Biden said. 
Asked by the host, Don Lemon, why he wanted to protect the filibuster, which requires 60 senators to advance certain bills in Congress, Biden said he thought repealing it would throw the ""entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done."" 
Voter turnout is going to overcome the impact of a wave voting restrictions, Biden seemed to suggest, saying ""More people voted last time than any time in American history in the middle of the worst pandemic in history...They're going to show up again.""
No matter the party, there is only one way to view the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters, he added. 

""I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated, the fact is you can't look at that television and say nothing happened on the 6th"" of January, Biden said. ""You can't listen to people who say this was a peaceful march.""
Biden also promised the crowd - to some of the loudest applause of that night - that he would ""fix that damn bridge of yours,"" a reference to the local Brent Spence bridge that his two predecessors had also pledged without success to repair.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top U.S. Senate Republican has demanded an investigation into new Justice Department grant-management software, after Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-47-billion-grant-programs-tech-woes-take-toll-justice-groups-2021-07-12 that technological glitches in the system have delayed funding programs from police departments to victims' service providers.
Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Charles Grassley in a letter on Wednesday asked Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to launch a formal probe into the department's roll-out of the new software, known as JustGrants, which manages a $4.7 billion grant program.
In his letter, Grassley cited a variety of reports from Horowitz's office that have documented troubles with JustGrants, including a May 6 alert in which Horowitz said problems with JustGrants had even hampered his own staff's ability to access vital information needed to oversee the grants to root out waste, fraud or abuse.
The letter also cited a July 12 Reuters article about how widespread technological glitches have plagued the system since it was launched in October 2020, prompting more than 38,000 help desk requests through May 10 and delaying many grant recipients from receiving vital funding. 
""The Reuters piece, as with the OIG (Office of Inspector General) reports cited in this letter, describes the clear adverse consequences of failures in the JustGrants system,"" Grassley wrote.
""I am asking your office to investigate the transition to JustGrants. Circumstances around the program raise many troubling questions.""
A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately comment, noting the request came after business hours.
A spokeswoman for Horowitz's office declined to comment.
In prior statements to Reuters, the department acknowledged the system has faced challenges, but said staff were trying to correct the glitches and has worked closely with grant winners to assist them.
Reuters interviewed more than two dozen department staff and grant recipients for its report, all of whom described similar frustrations with the system.
Built by General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) under a contract with a $115 million ceiling price, JustGrants was intended to consolidate the grants in one place and be compatible with a new government-wide payment system. To date, the Justice Department has spent just above $70 million on it.
The department told Reuters in July that JustGrants was built using an agile style of development, in which systems are created piece by piece and evolve based on user feedback.
""The development strategy for JustGrants was not to have an end-to-end system fully functional in October 2020,"" the department said.
Grassley, in his letter to Horowitz, raised concerns with this approach and asked the inspector general to probe whether the department followed all contract-making regulations and had carefully monitored the company's performance.

Grassley also said he wanted to know ""the full scope of programs that have been impacted or currently are being impacted by the inability of award recipients to access their awards.""
A spokesperson for General Dynamics could not be immediately reached, but in a prior statement, the company told Reuters it was committed to developing a ""seamless, user-friendly"" system.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday handed down new policies governing the Justice Department's interactions with the White House aimed at minimizing political interference in law enforcement, the Justice Department said.
Garland said in a statement that the new policies further ""longstanding Departmental norms of independence from inappropriate influences"" and ""the principled exercise of discretion.”
The new rules, which follow criticism of Justice Department actions under Republican former President Donald Trump, generally prohibit prosecutors from discussing pending or contemplated law enforcement investigations with White House officials, although there are exceptions for matters of national security, according to a memo released by the Justice Department.
""These policies reaffirm President Biden’s commitment to restoring faith in institutions of government and the independent role of the Department of Justice in law enforcement matters,"" the White House said in a statement.
The Justice Department under former Attorneys General William Barr and Jeff Sessions was regularly accused by Democrats of putting Trump's personal and political interests ahead of the law.

Barr, in particular, faced criticism over his decisions to intervene in cases against Trump associates, including longtime political adviser Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Some prosecutors quit in response to Barr's interventions.
Barr has defended his interventions in the cases, saying in speeches that he overruled career prosecutors in order to ensure just outcomes and fair sentences.

326,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell enjoys broad support for his renomination among top White House advisers, though the decision is expected later this year and hasn’t yet been put in front of President Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.
But Biden officials are keeping an open mind about how the administration can put its stamp on the central bank through personnel choices, including the chair, the people said. In addition to Powell, Randal Quarles’s term as vice chair for supervision -- an important regulatory post -- will expire in October, and the board term for Governor Richard Clarida expires in January.
Powell was appointed Fed chair by President Donald Trump, who also installed both Quarles and Clarida at the central bank.
The people familiar with White House discussions asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
White House officials have not yet spoken to Biden about a potential Powell renomination or replacement, two of the people said. A decision isn’t expected until September at the earliest.
His aides are considering the expiring leadership positions and Clarida’s seat as a potential package of nominations that could together satisfy various constituencies in the Democratic Party. Many Democratic lawmakers have publicly complimented Powell’s leadership of the central bank.
While Fed board members typically resign when their leadership terms end, Quarles has indicated he may stay on, denying Biden the opportunity to replace him altogether.
In a response to a request for comment, a White House official said that Biden will engage his senior economic team to appoint a Federal Reserve chair in a timely manner, and that he will choose candidates for the central bank’s board and leadership posts that he thinks will be most effective in implementing monetary policy. The official asked not to be identified.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who will have a key role in Biden’s personnel decisions for the central bank, has told those close to her that she has a good relationship with Powell and is pleased with how he has steered monetary policy through the pandemic-induced crisis.
Asked last week by CNBC whether she supported a second term for Powell, Yellen said: “That’s a discussion I’m going to have with the president.”
Powell’s four-year term as chair ends in February, and historically presidents have decided in the late summer or fall whether to renominate a central bank chief. Trump denied Yellen a second term that would have begun in 2018, picking Powell instead. Quarles’s tenure as vice chair for supervision ends Oct. 13, but his term as a Fed governor isn’t up until 2032.
Experts and outside analysts say that if Biden is looking to change leadership at the Fed, current Governor Lael Brainard is a likely candidate. The president passed her over for Treasury secretary, with progressives criticizing her record on climate change and financial regulation, but they have indicated openness to her being Fed chair.

In a series of tweets, Julie Chung, the acting assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said President Joseph Biden’s administration is “actively pursuing measures that will support the Cuban people and hold the Cuban regime accountable.”
She didn’t spell out what kind of sanctions might be levied against the leadership of the tightly-controlled island.
The U.S. also wants to boost staffing at its embassy in Havana and expedite humanitarian and medical exports to Cuba. In 2020 U.S. companies exported $176 million worth of goods to the island, including food and medicine, Chung said.
In addition, she said the US. government has set up a “remittance working group” that will focus on how money can be transferred directly to Cubans without falling “into the hands of the oppressors.”
Cuba saw its biggest demonstration in decades on July 11, when thousands took to the streets to demand food and liberty. Human rights groups say anywhere from 500 to 600 people have been detained in an ongoing crackdown.
Havana has blamed a long-standing U.S. trade embargo for the tanking economy and the shortages that are driving the discontent.

329,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Democratic senators rejected any attempt by Republicans to set conditions for increasing the federal debt limit, showcasing an escalation in partisan bickering as a two-year suspension of the ceiling approaches expiration.
“Nobody is going to hold the American economy hostage, period, full stop,” Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden said Wednesday following a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the debt-ceiling. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was also in the discussion, said, “The Republicans are trying to extract something, and say that their leverage is they will have the United States default on its legal obligations, which is fundamentally wrong.”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) said earlier Wednesday he could back an increase in the federal debt limit if it were tied to setting up a commission charged with bolstering the financial stability of Social Security and Medicare programs and other reforms he plans to unveil next week.
Warren said there would be “no compromise.”
The debt limit is looming as a major pressure point in fiscal talks in Congress, as a two-year suspension of that limit concludes July 31. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that, while there are a raft of measures available to avoid hitting the limit, it is difficult to tell how long they can last amid volatility in government spending and revenue flows due to the pandemic.
“I can’t imagine a single Republican in this environment that we’re in now -- this free-for-all for taxes and spending -- to vote to raise the debt limit,” Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell told the news outlet Punchbowl. He said that instead Democrats should seek to raise the borrowing limit in a broad economic measure they want to pass later this year under Senate procedures that might let it move without GOP support.
That package is intended to carry the bulk of President Joe Biden’s longer-term proposals, including a ramping up of social spending paid for with tax hikes on the wealthy and companies.
Graham said that he thought Democrats wouldn’t put a debt-ceiling boost into the reconciliation package, however, given the negative publicity in backing an increase in what’s been an historic surge in U.S. borrowing.
“I don’t think they will take him up on his suggestion -- it would make a great campaign ad” for Republicans, Graham said.
Democrats could also try to pass a stand-alone budget reconciliation bill, just increasing the debt ceiling, once they have agreed on and passed a budget outline for the Biden economic agenda. That would allow them to act before completing work on the multi-trillion dollar tax and spending measure they are hoping to enact in the autumn but which could drag on for months past the debt ceiling payment default deadline.
“We want to get it done,” Wyden said, “and we’re going to make sure it’s done correctly, quickly.”
Schumer, on the Senate floor Wednesday, attributed some of the need for the debt-limit increase to former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax-cut package, passed with Republican votes, as well as to the need for emergency spending to battle the pandemic.
“This debt is Trump debt, it’s Covid debt,” Schumer said. “Leader McConnell should not be playing games with the full faith and credit of the United States.”
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday afternoon is scheduled to release an estimate for when the federal government will run out of time to avoid hitting the ceiling. Yellen is also expected to release a letter to Congress later this month outlining the Treasury’s plans.
While observers fully expect the U.S. to avoid any default on its obligations, the political path to boosting the limit is unclear.
Asked about addressing the debt limit, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Tuesday said, “I am hopeful that we will be able to on a bipartisan basis.”
Hoyer said he hopes the House either raises the debt ceiling by a substantial figure -- his preference -- or “move it to a date future, as we have done.”

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Thomas Barrack, a billionaire friend of Donald Trump who chaired the former president's inaugural fund, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with illegally lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.
A seven-count indictment filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, alleged that Barrack, a former employee and an Emirati businessman failed to register as lobbyists and used their influence to advance the UAE's foreign policy goals in the United States.
Barrack, who was arrested in Los Angeles, is also alleged to have repeatedly lied during an FBI interview about his dealings with the UAE.
Barrack's spokesperson refuted the charges. ""Mr. Barrack has made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset. He is not guilty and will be pleading not guilty,"" the spokesperson said.
U.S. Department of Justice official Mark Lesko said in a news release that ""the defendants repeatedly capitalized on Barrack’s friendships and access to a candidate who was eventually elected president, high-ranking campaign and government officials, and the American media to advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing their true allegiances."" 
Barrack, 74, is a longtime Trump ally and founder of the digital infrastructure-focused private equity firm DigitalBridge Group Inc , which was known as Colony Capital (NYSE:DBRG) Inc before a rebranding announced in June.
Barrack stepped down as DigitalBridge's chief executive in 2020. In April, he resigned as executive chairman of the firm but has remained as a non-executive director. Forbes estimates his wealth at $1 billion.
DigitalBridge has about $32 billion in digital assets under management, which includes data centers across North America and the UK. Barrack owns about 5.7% of DigitalBridge, whose shares closed down 1.4% at $6.93 on Tuesday.
A spokeswoman for DigitalBridge declined to comment.

Barrack was a prominent supporter of Trump’s successful 2016 presidential campaign and directed his inaugural committee. 
Federal prosecutors are seeking to have Barrack held in detention, saying in a court filing that his vast wealth, access to private jets and history of international travel indicate he could become a fugitive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden nominated lawyer and Google critic Jonathan Kanter as the Justice Department's antitrust chief on Tuesday in the latest sign the White House is determined to rein in the world's biggest corporations, especially Big Tech.
Progressives who advocate tougher enforcement of antitrust law pushed for the nomination of Kanter, who recently started his own law firm, Kanter Law Group LLP, which bills itself as an ""antitrust advocacy boutique.""
The White House called Kanter ""a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.""
He has spent years representing rivals of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which the Justice Department sued last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals. 
The Biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise, Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan to be a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. 
Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, said Kanter ""has crafted many of the most successful legal arguments driving the major antitrust investigations into Big Tech."" 
Kanter declined comment on the nomination.
If confirmed by the Senate, Kanter, who previously worked for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP and two other big law firms, will take the reins of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division amid calls for tougher enforcement overall, with special criticism aimed at Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The tech giants have been under investigation for about two years, with a U.S. House of Representatives panel issuing a report in October that said they used ""killer acquisitions"" to fend off rivals, charged exorbitant fees and forced small businesses into ""oppressive"" contracts in the name of profit.
The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.

The Justice Department Antitrust Division under Kanter will play a key role in implementing the Biden executive order aimed at promoting competition across the U.S. economy. In addition to suing Google, the Justice Department is also investigating Apple.
The Federal Trade Commission shares the job of antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department.

332,"<span>Jul 20, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s attempt to begin Senate debate Wednesday on a still-unfinished bipartisan infrastructure bill is on track to fail, with Republicans saying that there is no way a deal can be reached by then and that they won’t vote to open debate without text spelling out the deal.
A bipartisan group of 22 senators announced a deal on a $579 billion infrastructure outline with President Joe Biden nearly one month ago, but have been unable to agree on the details of the package -- particularly how to pay for the new spending. Schumer on Monday scheduled a Wednesday test vote to begin debate and would need 60 votes, including 10 Republicans if all Democrats and independents vote yes.
“We’re not going to have a product ready tomorrow for consideration,” lead GOP negotiator Rob Portman of Ohio said. Portman said that until there is an actual bill to consider he won’t support moving forward.
Utah Republican Mitt Romney, also a member of the group, urged Schumer to delay the vote until Monday to give the talks more time.
“I think all of the issues will be resolved,“ Romney told reporters, estimating that a deal can be had by the end of this week. He said that over the last two days, 75% of outstanding issues had been resolved. He said there needs to be time to write up the deal and circulate it to members before holding a vote.
Other GOP members of the bipartisan group such as Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) of South Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas told reporters they would also vote against beginning debate on Wednesday -- virtually guaranteeing Schumer’s deadline would not be met.
Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, another member of the group, said he “hopes” a deal can be reached by the end of the week but was uncertain because the timing depends on getting feedback from the White House, budget scorekeepers and lawmakers outside the group.
Democrats in the group were reluctant to estimate when a deal could be had. Schumer has argued that the Senate frequently votes to begin debate on a bill that is still being negotiated and that Wednesday is not the final deadline for bill text, rather a milepost to quicken the pace of talks.
Speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday morning, Schumer said Wednesday’s vote is nothing more than a kick-off for a days-long debate on infrastructure, and that there are “many, many opportunities” for a bipartisan deal to be substituted as the bill under debate once a deal is reached.
“In order to finish the bill, we first need agree to start,” Schumer said. “That’s the first step.”
Dick Durbin, the second-ranking House Democrat, said he expects that all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats would vote Wednesday in favor of beginning debate on infrastructure.
Core members of the infrastructure group plan to huddle Tuesday afternoon to try to make more progress on an agreement.
The group agreed over the weekend to drop enhanced tax enforcement audits from the bill, something the group was hoping would raise $100 billion. Portman said the group may substitute a delay in a Trump-era rule aimed at reducing rebates given to pharmaceutical benefit managers under Medicare Part D. Delaying the rule a few years could yield the group $80 billion or more, senators have said.
Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who isn’t a part of the bipartisan group but previously attempted to strike a deal with Biden on infrastructure, said the issue of how to pay for the bipartisan infrastructure plan “was always going to be the most difficult and it remains that way.”
Capito said Tuesday on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power with David Westin” the demands from House Democrats including linking the infrastructure deal to a budget framework for additional spending and climate measures remains “an enormous problem for the White House and the bipartisan group.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he would set a procedural vote on a bipartisan infrastructure package that is a key part of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda for Wednesday, increasing pressure on negotiators as they struggled with ways to pay for the cost of the measure.
Schumer said the Wednesday vote did not require Senate negotiators hammer out every provision in the bill by then and that Democratic leaders of the bipartisan group supported his approach.
""The motion to proceed on Wednesday is simply about getting the legislative process started here on the Senate floor. It is not a deadline to determine every final detail of the bill,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor.
The announcement came as Republicans urged Schumer to delay the Wednesday vote if the legislation was not yet fully written. 
""If he moves ahead arbitrarily, before they actually come to some sort of a deal, then yeah, all it's going to do is drag it out, make it harder to get a deal in the end,"" Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, told reporters.
Thune said provisions for covering the cost of the bill were ""a long ways from being ready."" 
It was unclear if the bipartisan bill under negotiation could garner the necessary 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to advance.
Republican Senator Rob Portman, one of the leaders of the group, has said he would vote against the bill if legislation was not ready. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said that the upper chamber should not vote on agreeing to debate a bill before senators see the text of it.
Portman said on Sunday the group had scuttled a proposal for the Internal Revenue Service to step up its pursuit of tax cheats.
But Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who was one of the members of the bipartisan group, suggested the group had not made a final decision to jettison the tax proposal, telling reporters: ""Who said we're taking the IRS enforcement out?""
Senators in the group said they had met late into Sunday evening and had planned to meet again for hours on Monday. They said they were considering provisions to reinstate fees on chemicals to fund the Superfund program, which cleans up contaminated waste sites, as well as other possible fees to cover costs.
Democratic Senator Jon Tester said he thought the group could have legislative text by Wednesday, Tester told reporters.

Schumer has said infrastructure was moving on two tracks. Aside from the first, bipartisan track, Democrats are also moving forward with a different $3.5 trillion infrastructure package using a procedural tool known as reconciliation. It allows certain bills to advance through the Senate with only a simple majority of votes, instead of the 60 needed for most legislation.
Republicans oppose the second track.

Vice President Kamala Harris had met on Tuesday with two of the lawmakers who have since tested positive.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Political foes of Alaska's Republican governor have legally sufficient grounds to pursue their campaign to oust him from office through a recall election, the state’s highest court ruled on Friday.
The campaign to recall Governor Mike Dunleavy, who has about 17 months left in his term, is legal and may proceed, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled.
Whether Dunleavy's detractors have made their case that his alleged shortcomings - that he is incompetent and corrupt - justify his removal from office is up to the voters, the court said. 
“The people asked to sign petitions must decide whether the allegations are serious enough to warrant a recall election; each voter in the voting booth must decide whether the allegations are serious enough to warrant removal from office,” the opinion said.
Dunleavy, a former teacher, school administrator and legislator representing Wasilla, was elected governor in 2018, positioning himself as a political acolyte of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. His tenure has been rocky as Alaska struggled with financial difficulties and its dependence on dwindling oil revenues.
The governor's foes argue that he deserves to be recalled because he is unfit and has abused his power. Among grounds cited by recall supporters, Duleavy is accused of illegally using his budget veto to punish judges for abortion-rights rulings and violating ethics laws by using state funds for partisan campaign purposes.
To qualify a gubernatorial recall for the Alaska ballot, campaigners must satisfy a two-phase test, gathering petition signatures totaling 10 percent of votes cast in the previous statewide election and, subsequently, gathering signatures totaling 25 percent of the votes cast. The Recall Dunleavy campaign reported it had 81 percent of the required second-phase signatures as of April.
In a statement Friday, Dunleavy blasted the court’s ruling, saying it will subject elected officials “to baseless, expensive, and distracting recall elections by their political opponents.”
Dunleavy faced problems other than the recall threat.

In a showdown with the legislature, he vetoed this year’s entire Alaska Permanent Fund dividend, a cherished oil-wealth payout to residents made annually since 1982.
This week CNBC ranked Alaska’s business climate dead last among all 50 U.S. states. CNBC cited Dunleavy’s actions specifically, saying he “relentlessly slashed” University of Alaska funding and made other poor decisions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will nominate Tom Udall, a former U.S. senator who represented New Mexico, to be his ambassador to New Zealand, the White House said on Friday.
The decision comes as Biden works to shore up alliances in the Asia-Pacific to present a united front on what he has described as Washington's key foreign policy challenge: China.
Biden officials have had little high-level, face-to-face contact with Beijing since a first senior diplomatic meeting in March in Alaska, where the Chinese side expressed anger at U.S. sanctions announced just ahead of the talks.
New Zealand has been an important ally in the region, and on Friday hosted Biden, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and China's Xi Jinping for a virtual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on managing the global pandemic. 
Biden hopes to use the 21-member forum and other multilateral groups to combat what it sees as China's unfair trade practices and other issues. The Biden administration on Friday announced a new round of sanctions on Chinese officials over their crackdown on Hong Kong, just one of several flashpoints between the two countries.

""This position - working with one of our closest partners and allies - is integral as we work closely with New Zealand to confront the challenges facing our nations - including COVID-19, climate, and China,"" Udall said in a statement.
On Friday, the White House also said Biden would nominate career U.S. foreign service members as ambassadors to Brunei, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Botswana. Brunei is also an APEC member. All of the positions require Senate confirmation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is ""110 percent"" behind a legislative push to overhaul the military justice system to better serve victims of sexual assault and other major crimes, the bill's champion, Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, said on Thursday.
Gillibrand's remarks to defense reporters came nearly two weeks after Biden endorsed a key component of her legislation: taking decisions about prosecuting sexual assault away from military commanders and giving them to independent prosecutors. 
But Biden and his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, have stopped short of publicly backing Gillibrand's bill, which would take other serious crimes like murder out of the chain of command as well.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Many U.S. military officials have long been wary about taking power away from commanders.
Gillibrand said she received a congratulatory call from Biden when she reached 66 co-sponsors for her legislation. She declined to offer many details from that call but strongly suggested she and Biden were closely aligned.
""There was an indication that he would love to sign that into law. So I believe that the president 110 percent supports what we're doing,"" she told the Defense Writers Group
At another point, she said: ""I do not think we are in opposition to the administration at all.""
Gillibrand's bill has been blocked from consideration on the floor of the Senate by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee over concerns it is too sweeping.
Gillibrand noted Pentagon data showing the military justice system was not just failing women but minority service members. The data shows minorities are far more likely to face charges than their white peers.
""In the Marines, for example, you are 2.61 times more likely to be given a general court-martial, which tend to be given for more serious crimes with harsher punishments,"" she said.
Democratic Representative Anthony Brown, a retired Army Reserve colonel and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, voiced strong support for the broader overhaul in companion legislation moving through the House of Representatives. 

""The current military justice system is not serving our country's higher values of justice, equity and fairness,"" Brown wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.
""It has put service members of color at a disadvantage and left them subject to a commander-controlled system they do not trust.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee advanced legislation on Thursday intended to boost competitiveness with China, without support from Republicans who objected to some climate-related provisions and said it was too soft on Beijing.
The ""Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act,"" or Eagle Act, passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee by 26-20, with Democrats voting yes and Republicans opposed.
The vote came as President Joe Biden's administration and both parties in Congress seek to push back against China's increasing international influence.
Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks, the committee's chairman, said the bill included robust provisions addressing issues such as China's alleged human rights abuses of the Uyghur Muslim minority in its Xinjiang region, closer ties to Taiwan and the need to provide special immigration status to residents of Hong Kong.
Republicans said they felt the Eagle Act called for too many studies and would be a missed opportunity to take meaningful action like tightening control of technology exports to Beijing.
Democrats said they would not give in on the bill's climate provisions, calling them essential to compete on green energy.
Among other things, the measure would provide billions of dollars for the United Nations Green Climate Fund, which Republicans dismissed as a ""slush fund"" for the world body.
The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, which is narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats.
The administration is planning to impose sanctions on Friday on a number of Chinese officials over Beijing's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. On Wednesday the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ban the import of all products from the Xinjiang region.
The Senate on June 8 passed by a strong bipartisan majority its own sweeping China bill authorizing about $190 billion for provisions to strengthen U.S. technology and research, and approving $54 billion to increase U.S. production and research in semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.

However, rather than vote on the Senate bill, various House committees have been writing their own legislation, meaning it will take months for the House to pass something equivalent to the Senate measure.
It was not immediately clear when the Eagle Act might come up for a vote in the full House.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Wednesday to ban the import of products from China's Xinjiang region, the latest effort in Washington to punish Beijing for what U.S. officials say is an ongoing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim groups.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would create a ""rebuttable presumption"" assuming goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor and therefore banned under the 1930 Tariff Act, unless otherwise certified by U.S. authorities.
Passed by unanimous consent, the bipartisan measure would shift the burden of proof to importers. The current rule bans goods if there is reasonable evidence of forced labor.
The bill must also pass the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law. It was not immediately clear when that might take place.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who introduced the legislation with Democrat Jeff Merkley, called on the House to act quickly.
""We will not turn a blind eye to the CCP's ongoing crimes against humanity, and we will not allow corporations a free pass to profit from those horrific abuses,"" Rubio said in a statement. 
""No American corporation should profit from these abuses. No American consumers should be inadvertently purchasing products from slave labor,"" Merkley said. 
Democratic and Republican aides said they expected the measure would get strong support in the House, noting the House approved a similar measure nearly unanimously last year.
The bill would go beyond steps already taken to secure U.S. supply chains in the face of allegations of rights abuses in China, including existing bans on Xinjiang tomatoes, cotton and some solar products.

The Biden administration has increased sanctions, and on Tuesday issued an advisory warning businesses they could be in violation of U.S. law if operations are linked even indirectly to surveillance networks in Xinjiang.
Rights groups, researchers, former residents and some Western lawmakers and officials say Xinjiang authorities have facilitated forced labor by detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities since 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump said on Wednesday it would hold its first hearing on July 27.
Members of the Democratic-led panel, known as the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, said in a statement the hearing would include testimony from U.S. Capitol Police officers.
Congressional Democrats establish the special committee after Senate Republicans blocked the creation of an independent commission House Speaker Nancy Pelosi originally sought.
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building that day in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election win. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Republicans have argued that existing committee probes as well as prosecutors' investigations make an outside commission or a select committee unnecessary. More than 500 people have been charged with taking part in the violence.
Pelosi on July 1 announced eight members of the committee, including Republican Representative Liz Cheney, an outspoken Trump critic.
Chairing the panel is Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who also heads the House Homeland Security Committee that has been looking into the Jan. 6 events.
Other members of the new panel include Representative Adam Schiff, who took the lead in the December 2019 impeachment of Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead prosecutor in last January's second impeachment of Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection. 

In both cases, the Senate did not convict Trump.
The special committee, which will have subpoena power, could keep questions alive about Trump's activities on Jan. 6 and possibly complicate Republicans' efforts to win majority control of the House in the 2022 congressional elections.

(Reuters) - One of the three Pennsylvania counties asked to provide access to voting machines for a Republican lawmaker's probe of the 2020 election has decided it cannot comply due to a directive from the state's top election official, the county's solicitor told Reuters.
Tioga County's three Republican commissioners met on Tuesday and determined that acting Secretary of State Veronica Degraffenreid was within her authority in directing counties not to allow third parties to access their election equipment, according to the solicitor, Chris Gabriel. 
The decision poses a potential hurdle for state Senator Doug Mastriano, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump. The legislator announced his ""forensic investigation"" into the election last week, starting with Tioga, Philadelphia and York counties. He had no immediate comment on Tuesday.
Democratic President Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by about 81,000 votes, four years after Trump's victory there helped propel the Republican to the presidency. Republicans in Pennsylvania and other battleground states won by Biden have pursued audits of the November election, repeating Trump's baseless claims that widespread fraud cost him a second White House term.
Tioga, a rural county of 40,000 people on the state's northern border with New York, is the first of the three to disclose its stance on Mastriano's probe following Degraffenreid's July 9 directive warning counties that their equipment would be decertified if they complied.
""The secretary of state runs elections and has the responsibility for certifying those machines,"" Gabriel said, estimating that replacing decertified machines with new ones would cost the county hundreds of thousands of dollars.
""Tioga County will always comply with the law.""
While Philadelphia has not said whether it intends to comply, one of its commissioners told Reuters on Monday that replacing decertified equipment could cost its taxpayers $40 million.
York County did not respond to a request for comment.
The potential burden on taxpayers is also an issue in a contentious Republican-led audit of the vote in Arizona, with Maricopa County saying last month it would purchase new machines due to concerns the audit had compromised their security.
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the 2020 election involving the statistical sampling of ballots. All counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud.

Mastriano has nevertheless repeated Trump's stolen-election claims and argued that a more comprehensive probe involving the examination of equipment was needed because a large proportion of voters had doubts the 2020 vote was secure.
He has given the three counties until July 31 to respond and is threatening to issue subpoenas through the Intergovernmental Operations Committee, which he chairs and which is majority Republican.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday nominated writer, surgeon and public health expert Atul Gawande to lead global health development at the U.S. Agency for International Development, including for COVID-19, the White House said.
Gawande, author of four New York Times best-selling books and a professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, would serve as the assistant administrator of USAID's Bureau for Global Health, if confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
His role at USAID will focus on efforts to prevent child and maternal deaths, control the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combat infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, a White House official said.
Gawande appears to be taking his own advice. Last month, he told advanced degree graduates at Stanford University to be ""open to trying stuff – to saying yes"" to new opportunities.
On Tuesday, he said he was honored to be tapped for the job. ""With more COVID deaths worldwide in the first half of 2021 than in all of 2020, I'm grateful for the chance to help end this crisis and to re-strengthen public health systems worldwide,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Gawande, an outspoken critic of his industry's practices, was hired in 2018 by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to lead Haven, a joint healthcare company aimed at cutting costs for U.S. employees.
But the Boston-based venture was short-lived and shut down in February. 
Gawande's 2014 book, ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End"" explores the limitations and failures of the medical profession in grappling with the realities of aging and death.
Gawande, a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998 and the winner of a MacArthur Fellowship, is also founder and chair of Ariadne Labs, a center for health systems innovation, and of Lifebox, a nonprofit organization aimed at making surgery safer globally.

During the pandemic, Gawande co-founded CIC Health, which operates COVID-19 testing and vaccination nationally, and served on Biden transition's advisory board on COVID-19. 
He served as a senior adviser in the Department of Health and Human Services during the administration of former President Bill Clinton.

""Given the strategic importance of the United States’ relationship with our long-time NATO Ally, the Republic of Turkey, I am honored and humbled by the trust President Biden has placed in me with this ambassadorial nomination,"" Flake said in a statement.
""This is a pivotal post at an important time for both of our countries,"" he said.
Flake served as a U.S. senator from Arizona from 2013 to 2019 and was a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump. 
Relations between Washington and Ankara have soured over the past few years over a host of issues, including Ankara's purchase of Russian weaponry and policy differences in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean.
As president, Biden has adopted a cooler tone than Trump toward Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Biden quickly recognized the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide - a position that angers Turkey - and stepped up criticism of Turkey's human rights record.

But the two leaders sounded upbeat last month in Brussels about the future of bilateral ties following their first in-person meeting since Biden took office on Jan. 20, although no concrete breakthrough was announced.
One potential area of cooperation has been Afghanistan, where Ankara has offered to guard and operate Kabul's airport after U.S. and NATO forces withdraw. Turkey has been in talks with the United States on financial, political and logistical support.

(Reuters) -Dozens of Democratic lawmakers left Texas on Monday as part of an orchestrated move to derail their Republican colleagues' efforts to pass new voting restrictions and other conservative measures during a special legislative session.
Calling from an airplane headed to Washington, D.C., on Monday afternoon, Texas state Representative Alex Dominguez told Reuters that ""nearly everyone"" in the House of Representatives' 67-member Democratic caucus had fled the state.
The exodus is intended to deny the legislature the quorum needed to approve any of the measures on Republican Governor Greg Abbott's special-session agenda, including bills restricting abortion access and blocking transgender students from competing in athletics that correspond with their gender identity.
""If they keep wanting to throw oppressive bills, then we'll keep fighting them, in whatever way we have to,"" Dominguez said.
""We are determined to kill this bill in this special session, which will end on August 7, and we will stay out until then in order to do that,"" Representative Chris Turner, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, told a news conference on Monday night at Washington's Dulles International Airport, flanked by dozens of his colleagues.
Democratic lawmakers staged a similar walkout on May 30 to boycott a vote on an earlier version of the voting legislation just before the legislature's regular session ended, prompting Abbott to call the special session.
Texas Republicans including the governor and Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan condemned the strategy.
""The Democrats must put aside partisan political games and get back to the job they were elected to do,"" Abbott said.
Texas is one of a number of Republican-led states pushing new voting restrictions in the name of enhancing election security, citing former President Donald Trump's false claims that his November election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. 
On Sunday, House and Senate committees in the Texas legislature passed new versions of the voting measures, which would prohibit drive-through and 24-hour voting locations, add new identification requirements to mail-in voting and empower partisan poll watchers.
Votes in the full chambers were expected this week. Instead, Democrats bolted.

President Joe Biden's administration has pledged to continue pushing Congress to pass legislation that protects the right to vote. But Senate Republicans have not backed the measure, likely dooming it.
Biden will discuss steps the administration plans to take to shore up voting rights in a speech on Tuesday, the White House said.

(Reuters) - Philadelphia could face $40 million in costs to replace voting machines if forced to comply with a ""forensic investigation"" into the 2020 election launched by a Republican state lawmaker and ally of former President Donald Trump, a city commissioner told Reuters.
The estimate by Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, a Republican, highlights the potential burden on taxpayers from state Senator Doug Mastriano's attempt to gain access to election equipment from Philadelphia and at least two other counties for inspections, similar to costs that have arisen out of a contentious Republican-led audit of the vote in Arizona.
After Mastriano announced his probe last week, the Pennsylvania Department of State issued a directive to the state's 67 counties warning it would decertify any equipment handed over to third parties because the chain of custody would be broken.
Democratic President Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by about 81,000 votes, four years after Trump's victory there helped propel the Republican to the presidency. Republicans in Pennsylvania and other swing states won by Biden have pursued audits of the November election, repeating Trump's baseless claims that widespread fraud cost him a second White House term.
Schmidt, who has repeatedly defended the integrity of the vote count in heavily Democratic-leaning Philadelphia, said Mastriano's request for a wide array of equipment could force the city to replace some $30 million worth of voting machines and an additional $10 million in central programming and tabulation equipment. 
""We just got all our new voting equipment in 2019, so replacing it would be very expensive for taxpayers,"" Schmidt said on Monday.
His estimate is higher than one by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who has said Mastriano's investigation could cost the three targeted counties - Philadelphia, York and Tioga - $30 million.
Mastriano, who has increased his profile among conservative voters in part by touting Trump's stolen-election claims, did not respond to a request for comment on the cost estimate for Philadelphia.
He said in a statement earlier on Monday that the secretary of state did not have the legal authority to retire election machines after third-party access or to force counties to pay for new equipment.
Mastriano has given the three counties until July 31 to respond and is threatening to issue subpoenas through the Intergovernmental Operations Committee, which he chairs and which is majority Republican. In addition to 2020, he also wants to investigate municipal elections this past May.

Jay Costa, the Pennsylvania Senate minority leader, said Democrats would likely take legal action to try to stop the subpoenas. ""There could be a significant amount of state and local dollars being spent for this unnecessary sham of an audit."" 
Pennsylvania has already conducted a so-called risk-limiting audit of the 2020 election involving the statistical sampling of ballots. The counties also audited a sample of their votes as mandated by law. Neither effort turned up widespread fraud.

“We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba’s authoritarian regime,” Biden said in a statement Monday.
The U.S. president went on to call for Cuba’s government “to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves.”
Videos posted online over the weekend showed police attacking demonstrators, and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on his supporters to confront protesters in the streets during a televised address.
Biden’s statement comes after criticism from some Republican lawmakers, who seized on a tweet Sunday by Acting Assistant Secretary of State Julie Chung. She characterized the protests as oriented around “concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages.”
In a series of tweets and videos posted to the social media network, Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said it was “ridiculous” to frame the demonstrations as “simply because of COVID.” Rubio also criticized Biden for not commenting on the protests earlier.
Democrats have struggled with Cuban-American voters in recent years, with Republicans frequently attacking former President Barack Obama’s attempts to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba. Former President Donald Trump won a majority of Florida’s Cuban-American vote in the 2020 election, according to network exit polls, and the Republican’s strong showing in Miami-Dade County helped propel him to victory in the state.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than six months after the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, the remaining high-security fence surrounding the white-domed building has been removed, police said on Sunday. 
Workers began removing the last of the eight-foot-high (2.4-m) black mesh fencing on Friday, which at one point surrounded several blocks of Capitol Hill and interfered with pedestrian and vehicle traffic. 
The decision to take down the remaining fencing was based on the current threat environment and recent enhancements to the Capitol Police's response capabilities, according to a statement released by the agency.
""We are prepared to quickly enhance our security posture should the need arise,"" said Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman in the statement. 

More than 535 people have been charged in taking part in the Jan. 6 violence, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s election win.
Five people died on the day of the violence and the day after, including a Capitol Police officer. Two police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than a hundred police officers were injured.

352,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s new plan to promote competition across industries and in the labor market can deliver long-run gains for the U.S. economy by boosting productivity and wages, economists say.
The president announced an executive order on Friday that directs federal agencies to ban or limit non-compete agreements -- which make it harder for workers to switch jobs in search of higher pay -- along with a raft of proposals aimed at barring unfair competition between large and small businesses.
While there’s a focus on the technology, agriculture, transportation and drug industries, some of the measures will apply across the economy. The aim is to counter a trend that’s seen market share in many industries become concentrated in a small number of businesses, widening gaps in income and wealth, the administration says.
“If it’s successful, that’s going to create more competition, improve mobility in the labor market, and in the longer run we could see maybe some upside risk to our forecasts for wage growth and productivity,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics.
Waning competition and the dominance of large firms has been a hot topic for economists in recent years. A series of studies have found that in most U.S. industries there is more concentration now than there was a few decades ago.
Many researchers have argued that this is one reason why wage increases have been slow: with markets for goods or services divided up among a smaller number of competitors, workers in those industries end up with less bargaining power.
‘Flawed Belief’
Reducing the trend toward corporate consolidation will promote competition and provide benefits for workers, consumers, farmers and small businesses, the White House said in a statement outlining the executive order. The measure also aims to step up enforcement of antitrust laws.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business group, called the idea that the economy has become too concentrated a “flawed belief,” and warned the administration against neglecting the importance of large firms for economic growth.
“In many industries, size and scale are important not only to compete, but also to justify massive levels of investment,” the group said in a statement Friday. “Larger businesses are also strong partners that rely on and facilitate the growth of smaller businesses.”
The move to ban non-compete agreements -- contractual clauses in which workers agree that if they quit or are fired, they can’t leave to work for a competitor, at least for a time -- could remove a barrier to better pay in many industries.
The clauses are meant to prevent trade secrets from being exchanged. Instead, they often end up locking workers into bad jobs and reducing their bargaining power, said Karla Walter, director of employment policy at the Center for American Progress.
What’s a ‘Competitor’?
In 2014, for example, it was revealed that sandwich chain Jimmy John’s was requiring workers to sign non-compete agreements that banned them from working at one of the sandwich chain’s competitors for a period of two years following employment there. The company’s definition of a “competitor” was wide-ranging, encompassing any business that was near a Jimmy John’s location or derived 10% of its revenue from sandwiches.
Walter said that by barring non-compete agreements -- which an estimated one-third of Americans have signed -- worker mobility would increase and entrepreneurs would find it easier to attract talent.
It’s “an important change that will give workers more leverage for higher wages,” said David Jaeger, a labor economist at the University of St. Andrews. “Stockholders in large corporations may feel a pinch in the short run, but the increased competition will likely spur overall growth over the longer term.”
The executive order also calls on regulators to take steps to lower drug prices, toughen merger enforcement in technology and banking, and ensure transparency in airline and shipping fees.
The breadth of the order makes its economic impact hard to gauge, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum. He said the enforcement of non-compete agreements is something that often happens at the state level.
Sweet at Moody’s said that growth benefits from an increase in competition could take years to emerge, but he sees a possible boost to entrepreneurship in the shorter term that could help job creation.
“The net benefit to GDP is down the road,” Sweet said. “But if it boosts productivity even a little bit it’s going to raise the speed limit of the economy.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. civil rights leaders emerged from a White House meeting with President Joe Biden on Thursday vowing a ""summer of activism"" to battle new voting restrictions enacted in Republican-led states in recent months.
Vice President Kamala Harris said the Democratic Party would invest $25 million in voter registration and education efforts.
Harris, who was assigned by the president to lead the administration's efforts on voting rights, made the announcement Thursday at her alma mater, Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington.
Biden and Harris met with civil rights groups including the NAACP, National Urban League and the National Action Network.
Biden and Harris pledged to continue to push for Congress to pass legislation that protects the right to vote while continuing to rely on existing executive powers to ensure full voter participation and elections that reflect the will of the people, according to a White House read-out of the meeting.
NAACP President Derrick Johnson said the meeting was ""encouraging,"" but it was up to Congress to act with urgency to pass legislation that protects the right to vote. 
""Time is of the essence. We cannot forget that justice is an ongoing struggle, and democracy an ongoing fight,"" Johnson said.
Senate Republicans, however, have shown no intention of approving any voting rights legislation, likely dooming efforts in the chamber, which is thinly controlled by Democrats and where 10 Republican votes would be needed to pass a bill.
The Rev. Al Sharpton told reporters after the White House meeting to expect ""a summer of activism."" He also had a warning for lawmakers: ""You may be going home, but it's going to be warmer politically than you think."" 
Biden's fellow Democrats have struggled along with civil rights groups to fight a spate of voting restrictions in states including Georgia and Florida that critics say are aimed at Black, Hispanic and younger voters, who have helped elect Democrats.

Republican state legislators say their new voting laws are designed to enhance election security, citing former President Donald Trump's false claims that his November election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Those claims were rejected by multiple courts, state election authorities and Trump's own administration.
Last month, Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic-backed national election reform bill that would have expanded opportunities to vote before Election Day, made certain campaign contributions more transparent and reformed the process for the drawing of congressional districts. Republicans said it violated states' authority to set their own election laws.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has frustrated allies by keeping in place a Trump-era border expulsion policy opposed by human rights activists and health experts, and has appeared to gain little politically as Republicans criticize his handling of the border.
The so-called Title 42 order has allowed U.S. officials to immediately expel migrants who cross the border illegally. The Biden administration is now aiming to exempt families from the policy at the end of July after defending it for months as necessary to help stop the spread of COVID-19 across the southern border, according to three people familiar with the matter.
    Human rights groups and migration advocates have cheered the potential move, but some say the Democratic president made a politically costly mistake in keeping it in place for so long. They argue that it has done little to deter hundreds of thousands of migrants, nor has it insulated him from Republican attacks that his policies have fueled a spike in migration from Central America. 
""No matter what President Biden does at the border, many will criticize him for it,"" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the immigrant advocacy group American Immigration Council, who has called for an end to Title 42. ""So he should just do the right thing and take the action that respects the law and allows people to seek protection.""
The Title 42 order has also given Republican critics ammunition, as it helped inflate the number of arrests to 20-year highs in recent months. Because many migrants are simply expelled to Mexico and not deported to their home countries, one person can be arrested repeatedly for multiple crossings, making it appear more people are crossing the border than is the case.
Crucially, keeping the policy in place has also cost Biden much-needed support among migrant advocacy groups who traditionally play a key role in providing legal representation and basic services to recently arrived migrants and whose members have worked closely with the Biden administration.
Clara Long, an associate director with the New York City-based Human Rights Watch, said the Biden administration squandered goodwill with advocates who are now worried future Biden plans could limit asylum access.
""If they had lifted Title 42 right away, there would have been a lot more reason to trust they would settle on a principled and generous approach,"" she said.
The groups have added to the Republican pressure on Biden by publicly opposing some of the options the administration is reportedly considering to replace Title 42, such as using ankle bracelets to monitor migrants' movements or putting migrants through an expedited process to obtain asylum or be deported.
While Biden came into office promising a more humane immigration system he has repeatedly found that unwinding the web of restrictionist policies of his predecessor Donald Trump has been logistically and politically difficult.
Underpinning the administration's decision to keep Title 42 has been a fear that lifting the restrictions could encourage even more migrants from Central America and elsewhere to come to the border, potentially undermining public support for Biden's broader immigration agenda.
    A White House spokesperson defended the administration's decision to continue the border expulsions.
    ""We are still in the midst of a global pandemic and there are many people coming to our border who come from high transmission countries,"" the spokesperson said. ""Because we have to process people in congregate settings, we are still working under COVID protocols that restrict the number of people in our facilities.""
Biden officials stress that they have made humanitarian exceptions to Title 42, allowing unaccompanied migrant children and many families to enter the United States to pursue their cases for asylum or other forms of protection.
INCREASINGLY ISOLATED
But the administration has appeared increasingly isolated in its determination to hold onto the policy, which human rights groups and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees say has led to expelled migrants facing violence and kidnappings in northern Mexico.
One prominent Biden ally who previously defended the administration's decision to keep Title 42 has reversed course.
    Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, tweeted in February that keeping Title 42 in place while reworking the asylum system and immigration enforcement would help avoid an increase in migration. 
    Selee told Reuters he has now changed mind and believes its effectiveness as a deterrent is questionable, as border arrests have climbed in recent months.
    ""It doesn't make sense to keep it in place if it's not actually deterring migration,"" said Selee, who briefed Vice President Kamala Harris on migration issues in April. ""My hope was that they would buy some time to build a real functioning system at the border. But that didn't quite happen.""
The Biden administration is considering ending Title 42 for families by the end of July, according to those familiar with the deliberations, but this is unlikely to placate migrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers.
If the administration ends Title 42, it could be faced with the choice of either releasing the migrants into the United States to pursue their immigration cases, which can take years to resolve at the current pace, or placing them in detention. 

If Biden ramps up deportation and detention - which are opposed by advocates and some Democrats - he could alienate allies who have assisted with the processing of asylum seekers at the border and supported other parts of his more welcoming approach to immigration.
    More than 100 immigrant advocacy organizations said in a June letter that the possible use of ankle monitors, expanded detention and a faster deportation process known as ""expedited removal"" to deal with incoming migrants would be both inhumane and ineffective.

Ahead of this week’s meeting in Venice among finance ministers from the Group of 20 economies, U.S. Treasury Department officials indicated in a call with reporters Tuesday that a potential digital-tax proposal might fall afoul of a deal struck last week that aims to eliminate so-called digital service taxes. The U.S. believes such taxes discriminate against U.S. companies.
Treasury officials on Tuesday’s call acknowledged that European officials are under political pressure not to abandon plans to tax tech giants. They said that while EU officials see the new measure as complying with the international agreement, the U.S. officials emphasized that it’s impossible to know if it will be compatible until the full text of a broader accord is reached, which is targeted for October.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was scheduled to speak Tuesday with Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president for digital issues, according to Vestager’s online calendar. Vestager was due to propose a new EU tax on technology companies’ revenues on July 20, a week later than planned, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News.

In a deal brokered at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 130 countries and jurisdictions last week endorsed a plan to set a minimum rate for corporations along with rules to share the spoils from multinational firms. The latter portion is meant to deal with companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which garner much of their business through cross-border digital commerce. That agreement comes with a deal on repealing existing laws -- and preventing new laws -- that attempt to tax cross-border digital sales.
In the briefing, Treasury officials also answered questions about how U.S. domestic politics represent a hurdle for the nascent global agreement. One official said the portion of the deal agreeing to a redistribution of corporate taxes based on where companies do business -- not just where they have headquarters -- would require a multilateral treaty.
The U.S. Constitution requires international treaties struck by a president receive a two-thirds majority for approval in the Senate, which may represent a significant challenge given President Joe Biden’s Democrats make up just half the chamber.
Treasury officials said the U.S. proposal that led to the tax-redistribution deal was designed to appeal to lawmakers from both parties, as it avoided a focus on only digital companies or targeting U.S. business. The Treasury has also claimed the U.S. will not lose tax revenue in the deal.
Following the announcement of last week’s OECD agreement, Kevin Brady of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone of his party’s response when he issued a statement calling the deal a “dangerous economic surrender.”
Separately, regarding the International Monetary Fund’s plans to create $650 billion of new reserves, Treasury officials said the U.S. supports alternative methods for channeling so-called special drawing rights to needy countries, including a proposal for a new trust.
The G-20 meeting is also expected to focus renewed attention among rich countries on the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as on efforts to continue containing the virus.
An official said Yellen will urge other countries that it’s not yet time to withdraw fiscal support for measures aimed at fighting the virus and its economic impact.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden celebrated the nation's 245th birthday on Sunday by opening the gates of the White House and calling on Americans to do their part to end the COVID-19 pandemic once and for all.
""This year, the Fourth of July is a day of special celebration for we are emerging from the darkness of ... a year of pandemic and isolation, a year of pain, fear and heartbreaking loss,” Biden told a White House party opened to around 1,000 people, including military families and workers involved in the COVID-19 response.
“We never again want to be where we were a year ago today,” he added.
The largest White House event since Biden took office in January included burgers and fireworks and was geared toward giving Americans something to celebrate as signs of normalcy have returned following a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 600,000 Americans.
Still, the country has fallen short of Biden's goal to have 70% of U.S. adults get at least one vaccine shot by Sunday. The figure is around 67%, as some people have resisted getting inoculated, raising concerns among health officials as the more aggressive Delta variant threatens to generate another surge.
Biden mourned the people who died, praised Americans who aided in the country's emergency response and said vaccines were the best defense against new variants of the virus.
“It’s the most patriotic thing you can do,” he said of getting vaccinated.
But his administration was also eager to celebrate what it sees as its signature accomplishment - restoring some normality for a country weary of pandemic restrictions and hardship, burdens that have eased but not disappeared with the widespread availability of inoculations.
The pandemic forced cancellation of nearly all celebrations last year and led to a toned-down January inauguration for the Democratic president, who had to do without traditional black-tie galas and bipartisan comity as Republican former President Donald Trump disputed his election loss. 
Fortress-like security around Washington following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was eased as crowds marked the Declaration of Independence from Britain in 1776. 
Fencing surrounding the White House has been dramatically scaled back, and the streets filled on Sunday with people who snapped photographs of the president's motorcade returning from a weekend trip to a Michigan cherry farm, the golf course and his Delaware family home.

Speaking to people on the south lawn of the White House who had shed their masks to eat watermelon slices and drink beer, Biden said the coronavirus ""no longer paralyzes our nation, and it's in our power to make sure it never does again."" 
After the speech, the president greeted guests and posed for photographs ahead of a 17-minute fireworks display to be set off later from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool (NASDAQ:POOL).

SARASOTA, Fla. (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday condemned New York prosecutors for bringing charges against his namesake company and longtime financial adviser, using a campaign-style rally to air a host of grievances.
""It's really called prosecutorial misconduct. It's a terrible, terrible thing,"" Trump told thousands of supporters gathered outdoors in Sarasota, Florida.
The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to what a New York prosecutor called a ""sweeping and audacious"" tax fraud, arising from a probe into Trump's business and its practices.
Weisselberg and other executives were accused of receiving perks and benefits such as rent-free apartments and leased cars, without reporting them properly on their tax returns. The outcome of the investigations and other lawsuits facing Trump could impact whether he decides to run again for president in 2024. 
""They've mobilized every power of government to come after me, my family, my wonderful employees and my company solely because of politics,"" Trump told the crowd.
The rally was billed as a Fourth of July celebration with fireworks, the latest in a series of appearances as the former president tries to keep Republicans' focus on him.
Trump used his speech to denounce the policies of his successor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and repeat his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud.
He urged his supporters to back his allies in their midterm campaigns as Republicans fight to take back control of Congress from the Democratic Party next year. 
Trump dwelt heavily on Biden's policies along the U.S. border with Mexico and rising crime, two issues that Republicans hope to use to their advantage in the 2022 midterm elections.
Trump's image took a beating after the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. But some 53% of Republicans believe Trump won last year's election and blame his loss on illegal voting, and one quarter of the overall public agreed Trump won, a May 17-19 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. 
BUILDUP TO 2024 
Trump, 75, has dangled the possibility of running for president again in 2024, and his latest rallies mark an effort to keep his base energized and in his camp. 
""We are looking at the election, more than looking at it,"" said Trump of 2024, prompting cheers from the Sarasota crowd. 
Many Republicans see an appealing option for a 2024 party nominee in Florida's 42-year-old governor, Ron DeSantis. A longtime Trump ally, DeSantis has been at the forefront of Republican-led fights against strict anti-coronavirus lockdowns, racial justice protests and expanded ballot access.
In a straw poll of potential 2024 candidates at a conservative conference in Denver in June, DeSantis finished ahead of Trump, 74% to 71%. 
DeSantis' office has said the governor is focused on winning re-election in Florida next year, not aspiring to national office. 
Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Gordon, a 35-year-old Sarasota resident who works in retail, said it was her third time attending a Trump rally and she was excited to show her support for the former president. She said she hopes Trump runs again, but thought DeSantis might be a better, less-polarizing alternative.
""I think DeSantis would probably have a better opportunity seeing as he's younger,"" Gordon said. ""Because he's still new and fresh there's still a chance to get people to understand where he's coming from. There isn't as much of this negativity.""
DeSantis did not attend Trump's rally. A spokesperson said he was spending the weekend in Surfside, Florida, where rescuers have spent more than a week searching the rubble of a condo building collapse that killed at least 24 people and left scores missing. 
During his speech at the rally, which lasted about 90 minutes, Trump called out by name a number of Republican politicians who he described as warriors on his behalf, including embattled U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz. 

Trump did not mention DeSantis, but told Newsmax in an interview backstage that he and DeSantis had ""mutually agreed"" that the governor should continue to assist with the rescue and recovery operation in Surfside.
""I told him you should stay there,"" said Trump.

(Reuters) -Eleven heavily armed, self-professed militia members were arrested near Boston Saturday, ending an overnight stand off that shut down a major U.S. Interstate at the start of the Independence holiday.
The group, identified by multiple media outlets including WBZ Boston, a CBS affiliate, are members of the ""Rise of the Moors"", a group that does not recognize American laws, but professes to be peaceful.
Two of the men were taken into custody early in the morning, as officers negotiated with the leaders, seeking their peaceful surrender. Another 7 were apprehended after 10 a.m., police said in a statement.
Police remained on the scene and found two additional people, bringing the arrest total to 11. No other information was immediately available on the arrests.
No shots have been reported fired, and no injuries were reported during the encounter, which started about 1 a.m. when a state trooper saw two cars stopped in a breakdown lane with groups of men armed with rifles and pistols standing around, police said.
The group, whose self-professed leader told police that the men were traveling from Rhode Island to Maine for some ""training"", scattered into the nearby woods off Interstate 95 after police asked for their identification and gun permits.
Police closed the highway near Wakefield, about 14 miles north of Boston, and asked local residents to ""shelter in place"". The Interstate has since reopened.
State Police Colonel Christopher Mason said in a 7 a.m. news conference that the police were committed to a negotiation with the group. As the hours stretched on, some of the members talked to police near their cars, while others remained in the woods, according to local media reports.

""The self-professed leader wants it very much known that their ideology is not anti-government,"" Mason said, but added that police do not know what their ideology is.
""But the quick, down and dirty observation (is that) their actions have had a significant impact on the motoring public, particularly given that this is a holiday weekend.""

360,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A senior Democratic lawmaker predicted that his party’s legislators will be able to pass a budget resolution by the end of July, a key step in setting up legislation to enact President Joe Biden’s vision of trillions of dollars worth of social spending and tax hikes.
“The goal is very much to do that -- or, we’ve already been warned if we don’t get it by July 30, we could be here the first or second week of August to get it done,” Representative Don Beyer, who chairs the Joint Economic Committee, said in an interview Friday with Bloomberg TV when asked if a budget resolution can be completed by the August congressional recess.
Beyer highlighted that House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth has deferred to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders on taking the first step on a budget resolution, a vehicle that allows for a reconciliation bill, which can bypass a Republican filibuster in the 50-50 Senate. Sanders has outlined a $6 trillion proposal.
“Six sounds a little high to me,” Beyer said about the proposed size. “Most of us, at least in the House, would like to pay for some or all of it,” he said of the spending, adding that $6 trillion is “a very big number for new revenue measures.”
Biden earlier Friday urged Congress to enact his American Families Plan proposal, which features trillions of dollars of support for lower and middle-income households. “Maybe the most important thing among them was extending the childcare tax credit,” for five years, he said. “Human infrastructure is as essential as our physical infrastructure.”
Infrastructure Plan
Beyer recognized that the plans would need to be passed on a partisan basis, amid Republican opposition. As for physical infrastructure, the Virginia Democrat noted that the House this week passed a surface transportation and water infrastructure plan of more than $700 billion, while a bipartisan group of senators has reached a $973 billion compromise framework.

Beyer, who built his family auto business in northern Virginia over four decades, highlighted that Biden has called for significant investments in rail transportation, while both the Senate and the House plans aim to shift the automobile industry toward electric vehicles.
While Beyer said it’s too soon to predict how those changes might affect profit margins, he noted that the automobile industry has already had to adapt to a changing market. Business has boomed for used-car dealers throughout the pandemic as people moved away from transit and carpools, he said, while new car production has stalled due to a global chip shortage.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday turned away a case challenging libel protections for journalists and media organizations, but conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the action and questioned such protections enshrined in a landmark 1964 ruling.
Citing a rapidly changing media environment increasingly rife with disinformation, Thomas and Gorsuch said in separate opinions that the court should take a fresh look at its precedents that make it harder for public figures to sue for defamation. 
The court declined to take up an appeal by Shkelzën Berisha, the son of a former Albanian prime minister, concerning his defamation lawsuit over corruption allegations against him made in a 2015 book by author Guy Lawson called ""Arms and the Dudes."" The book was turned into the 2016 Hollywood film ""War Dogs"" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005151 starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller.
A lower court ruled in favor of Lawson, the book's publisher Simon & Schuster and several other defendants because it determined Berisha was unable to show that allegations of his involvement in an arms-dealing scandal were made with ""actual malice."" That standard, which protects against libel suits, involves statements made with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were true or false.
The standard was established in the court's watershed 1964 ruling in a case called the New York Times v. Sullivan.
Thomas and Gorsuch said the court should have taken the appeal. They said that in today's media environment, actual malice can protect lies instead of truth, with real-world consequences. Citing the false ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory that claimed that a Washington pizzeria was a front for a pedophile ring led by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Thomas said, ""Public figure or private, lies impose real harm."" 
Thomas previously urged https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-cosby/justice-thomas-assails-landmark-u-s-libel-ruling-that-protects-media-idUSKCN1Q81T0 the court two years ago to reconsider its libel precedents when it refused to consider reviving a defamation lawsuit against actor Bill Cosby by a woman named Kathrine McKee who said the entertainer falsely called her a liar after she accused him of rape. 
Thomas on Friday mentioned McKee again, saying that ""surely this court should not remove a woman's right to defend her reputation in court simply because she accuses a powerful man of rape."" Cosby was released https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-cosbys-sexual-assault-conviction-is-overturned-2021-06-30 from prison on Wednesday after Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his sexual assault conviction in a separate case. 
Gorsuch said justifications for the actual malice standard may be less in an era when technological changes and social media mean that disinformation can be better amplified and more profitable than traditional news with fact-checkers and editors.
""Not only has the doctrine evolved into a subsidy for published falsehoods on a scale no one could have foreseen, it has come to leave far more people without redress than anyone could have predicted,"" Gorsuch said.
Berisha sued Lawson and the other defendants in federal court in 2017 over brief passages in Lawson's book, which chronicled how three ""stoner dudes"" from Miami Beach scored a $300 million U.S. defense contract in 2006 to supply ammunition to the Afghan military, and sought to fulfill it by procuring weapons from stockpiles in Albania. 
The book recounted their dealings with an Albanian government-linked mafia. It placed Berisha in one of the meetings, describing him as having ""dark hair, a soft chin, and sharklike eyes"" and accused him of being part of the corrupt arms-dealing cabal. 
The three Miami men were eventually convicted in the United States on federal fraud charges. 

In 2020, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed the lawsuit. The 11th Circuit found that Berisha could not overcome the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment free speech protections for defendants accused of defamation by public officials or figures as recognized in a line of Supreme Court precedents dating back to New York Times v. Sullivan. 
In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Berisha said those precedents should be overturned to limit the actual malice standard to public officials only.

(Reuters) - On Sept. 14, Californians will vote on whether popular Democrat Gavin Newsom should be removed as governor. While Newsom retains support among most voters, the recall process may give his opponents in the Republican-backed challenge an edge they would not have in a typical election.
Here's what you need to know.
What are the rules?
Opponents of a sitting governor petitioning to hold a recall election need signatures from the equivalent of 12 percent of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. In this case that was 1,495,709 signatures.
Voters decide whether they want to remove the sitting governor and then on the same ballot choose a replacement. If more than 50% choose to end Newsom's term, the replacement candidate with the most votes to succeed him, even if less than a majority, becomes governor.
Who's behind the effort to recall Newsom?
A former sheriff's deputy named Orrin Heatlie and a group called the California Patriot Coalition began the recall campaign in February 2020, accusing Newsom of favoring illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens. They also complain that taxes are too high and that Newsom favored rationing water, an apparent reference to regulations during the state's frequent droughts.
Pundits initially said the group was unlikely to gather enough signatures. But a judge in Sacramento ruled recall proponents could have extra time because of delays caused by coronavirus restrictions. That allowed the group to continue seeking signatures as frustration with some coronavirus-related shutdowns grew. And recalling Newsom was embraced by state and national Republicans and conservative media.
Could Newsom be recalled?
Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor and California lieutenant governor, was elected in 2018 with 62% of the vote, a greater share than any other Democratic governor in the state's history. His opponent, Republican John Cox, garnered about 38% of the vote. A survey released in May by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) showed that six in 10 Californians would vote to keep him in office if a recall election were held, while four in 10 would not.
Republicans have a chance. By law, Newsom is not allowed to appear on the second part of the ballot as a replacement for himself. So far, only Republicans have expressed interest in replacing him. A Democrat could jump in, but Newsom's team fears that could make the governor more vulnerable.

Who is seeking to replace Newsom?
While the state has not yet certified any official candidates, several Republicans are campaigning, including Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and transgender celebrity Caitlin Jenner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Some of former President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, including Republican Representative Liz Cheney and the Democrats who led the two impeachments against him, were named on Thursday to serve on a special congressional panel probing the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced eight members of the committee investigating the events leading up to and on Jan. 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Democrat Joe Biden from being certified the winner of last November's presidential election against Republican Trump.
Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer. Other law enforcement officers suffered severe injuries as they battled the angry mob. 
Just before the attack, Trump delivered fiery remarks at the White House and then encouraged his supporters to march to Capitol Hill.
Accepting the assignment, Cheney said she considered her duty to the U.S. Constitution to be above politics.
""We have an obligation to have a thorough, sober investigation of what happened leading up to January 6, and the attack on the Capitol on that day,"" she told reporters after attending a first meeting with the other seven committee members, all Democrats, in Pelosi's office.
Addressing reports that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy threatened to strip any Republican member of their regular committee assignments if they accepted an offer from Pelosi, Cheney said she had not been told this.
McCarthy denied issuing such threats, but said Cheney's fellow Republicans would make decisions about committee memberships.
""I was shocked that she would accept something from Speaker Pelosi,"" he said. He did not say whether he will name any of the members to the remaining five seats on the panel.
Cheney was removed from her House Republican leadership position in May after voting in January to impeach Trump and continuing to repudiate his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him by massive voter fraud.
""A BLACK EYE ON OUR DEMOCRACY'
Chairing the panel is Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who also heads the House Homeland Security Committee that has been looking into the Jan. 6 events.
He sidestepped a question about whether the panel might call Trump or other former administration officials to testify. The committee will have the power to subpoena witnesses.
Thompson said the committee would look at unanswered questions and systems that had failed. ""January 6 was a devastating black eye on our democracy, and we have to make sure that it never happens again,"" he said.
He said the panel hoped to start with a hearing at which Capitol Police officers would testify.
Other members of the new panel include Representative Adam Schiff, who took the lead in the December 2019 impeachment of Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead prosecutor in last January's second impeachment of Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection. 
In both cases, the Senate did not convict Trump.
On Wednesday the House voted to establish the special committee after Senate Republicans blocked the creation of an independent commission Pelosi originally sought.

Republican leaders have resisted any special panel to investigate the Jan. 6 riot, noting existing congressional committees have been doing their own probes and that separately more than 500 people already have been charged with crimes.
A new, high-profile congressional investigation likely would keep questions alive on Trump's activities on that day and possibly complicate Republicans' efforts to win majority control of the House in the 2022 congressional elections.

BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (Reuters) - Sitting next to one of his fiercest critics on Thursday, President Joe Biden managed to find a silver lining in the grave tragedy that brought them together. 
""You know what's good about this?"" Biden asked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, not waiting for an answer. ""We're letting the nation know we can cooperate.""
DeSantis, a Republican rising star closely tied to former President Donald Trump, is at the forefront of partisan fights across the country over anti-coronavirus lockdowns, racial justice protests and efforts to restrict voter access.
Yet in recent days the two rivals have come together over the collapse of a 12-story building in Surfside, Florida, more than a week ago that has killed at least 18 people, with another 145 missing and feared dead.
Biden has sent millions of federal dollars and scores of search-and-rescue personnel to assist local officials in combing the rubble of the Champlain Towers South for survivors, capped by the visit on Thursday. 
As he spoke about unity during the brief portion of their meeting that was open to reporters, Biden looked DeSantis squarely in the eyes and the governor nodded in agreement.
""Thank you, Mr. President,"" DeSantis said. ""You recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one and you've been very supportive."" 
""We've had no bureaucracy"" and no delays in getting federal resources to Florida, he continued. 
The encounter may be important to the Biden White House as it pursues a ""reach across the aisle"" strategy to build and showcase support for his presidency, particularly with a small group of ""swing"" voters. That's an uphill battle with many Republicans, some of whom believe Trump's repeated false claims that voter fraud led to Biden's victory.
The effort seemed to impress at least one observer, Moshe Horowitz, who was staying at the hotel where Biden and DeSantis met.
""There should always be dialogue between both sides,"" the New Yorker told Reuters as he tried to get a glimpse of the president outside the hotel. He said he opposes Biden's policies so far but supported the show of bipartisanship.
""DeSantis and Biden meeting each other is a wonderful thing, and they should continue to do that,"" he said.
In his January inaugural address, Biden pledged to ""fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did."" He pushes for Republican support in Congress for his massive spending plans, and has made a point of visiting Republican-voting states to push infrastructure and COVID-19 vaccines. In Texas, following a deadly winter storm, he worked closely with Governor Greg Abbott, another Trump-tied Republican who did not initially acknowledge the Democrat's election win.
DeSantis, who is widely seen as weighing a potential 2024 challenge for the presidency, has refused to comment on whether the 2020 election was rigged as Trump claims, but has complained about the Biden administration's policies.

His office has declined to say whether he will attend a campaign-style rally Trump plans for Saturday in Sarasota. 
Although Trump no longer holds public office and has only hinted at another presidential run, he continues to cast a long shadow over Republican politics. Officials close to the former president say he has instructed his team to collect relief aid for Surfside families at the rally.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Stephen Breyer, the U.S. Supreme Court's oldest member, remained mum about his future on Thursday after it issued the final two rulings of a nine-month term during which some liberal activists had urged him to retire.
Breyer, 82, has served on the court for 27 years. These activists want him to step aside to give Democratic President Joe Biden the chance name a replacement who could serve in the lifetime post for decades. 
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority after Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump was able to name three justices during his four years in office, most recently appointing Amy Coney Barrett last year after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan make up the court's liberal bloc.
Breyer has given no public indication that he plans to retire. In an April speech he said it was important for the justices not to appear driven by political considerations. Justices often announce their retirements soon after the court issues its final rulings.
Biden during the 2020 presidential election campaign pledged to nominate a Black woman to fill any Supreme Court vacancy, which would be a historic first. Democrats hold a slim majority in the U.S. Senate, which under the U.S. Constitution has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees.
Some liberal activists are concerned that if Breyer does not retire while the Democrats control the Senate, Republicans could block confirmation of his successor or a future Republican president could name his replacement and shift the court even further to the right.

Breyer authored the court's major June 17 ruling rejecting a Republican bid to invalidate Obamacare, preserving the landmark healthcare law formally called the Affordable Care Act for the third time since its 2010 enactment. He also wrote the June 23 ruling in a major free speech case that sided with a cheerleader who had been punished by her high school for a profanity-laced social media post.
In the past, Breyer has written important rulings upholding abortion rights and has become a persistent critic of the death penalty.

(Reuters) -The indictment of a top official at former U.S. President Donald Trump's company marks a critical shift from probe to prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
New York lawyer Mary Mulligan could play a key role in what happens next.
Mulligan, a former federal prosecutor turned criminal defense attorney, is representing Allen Weisselberg https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-organization-cfo-expected-be-charged-thursday-wsj-2021-06-30, the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer. After a nearly three-year investigation, Vance's office unsealed tax charges against Weisselberg on Thursday. 
Weisselberg was charged in the 15-count indictment with avoiding taxes on $1.7 million of income and pleaded not guilty to second-degree larceny and other charges. 
Mulligan, who declined to comment on her multi-year representation of Weisselberg, is no stranger to high-profile assignments. 
She previously defended an ex-Lehman Brothers broker https://www.reuters.com/article/insidertrading-devlin/broker-who-stole-business-secrets-from-wife-avoids-prison-idINDEE82M0OX20120323 who stole corporate secrets from his executive wife and shared them with friends, and a South African pilot who was arrested alongside https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-bout/accomplice-to-arms-dealer-bout-handed-five-year-prison-term-idUSBRE84M1KV20120523 Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in an undercover sting by U.S. agents posing as Colombian guerrillas looking to buy weapons. 
She also represented Chuck Blazer https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-blazer/banned-former-fifa-executive-chuck-blazer-dies-idUSKBN19Y08J, the former FIFA executive committee member who pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering for accepting bribes in the bidding process for the 1998 World Cup in France and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Mulligan was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1997 to 2002. In that role, she investigated and prosecuted fraud, corruption and financial crimes cases, according to her LinkedIn profile. 
She joined law firm Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman in 2006, after a stint in-house at Universal Music Group. Her practice includes defending clients against allegations of money laundering, insider trading, corruption, campaign violations and various types of fraud.
Weisselberg is a close Trump confidant, making his cooperation potentially crucial to any future case against Trump himself.
Trump, a Republican, released a statement on Thursday calling the prosecution a ""witch hunt.""

Harris told the Generation Equality Forum at a summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron that gender equality was paramount to strengthening democracy.
""Use the tools for democracy, whether that is the freedom of speech or the freedom to vote. And if you do not yet have those freedoms, fight for them and know we will fight alongside you,"" Harris told the summit by video link.
Democracy was in peril in countries around the world, Harris said.
""If we want to strengthen democracy, we must fight for gender equality. Because here is the truth: Democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker when people are left out,"" the vice president said.
Two months after entering office, Harris said President Joe Biden's administration would revitalize Washington's partnership with U.N. Women - a U.N. body dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women.
Under former President Donald Trump, the United States led a push at the United Nations against the promotion of women’s sexual and reproductive rights and health because it saw that as code for abortion.
Harris struck a different tone. 
""When women have access to reproductive healthcare to stay healthy, they can participate more fully and our democracy grows stronger,"" she said.

Melinda Gates said the Gates Foundation would direct $2.1 billion in new money to strengthening gender equality. More than half would go to sexual health and reproductive rights, while $100 million would be spent on helping get women into positions of power in government and the workplace.
""Women should not only have a seat at the table, they should be in every single room where policy and decisions are being made,"" Gates said.

SURFSIDE, Florida (Reuters) - A Republican firebrand who relishes partisan warfare, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has tried to abstain from politics in the wake of a fatal building collapse near Miami, spending much of his week meeting with rescue workers and grieving families at the disaster scene.
But politics will be unavoidable on Saturday, when former President Donald Trump will stage a campaign-style rally 250 miles across the state, as part of his return to public life following his election defeat last November. Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that he defeated Democratic President Joe Biden.
The event in Sarasota will be the latest episode in the evolving dynamic between Trump and DeSantis, allies who potentially could be rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. 
Trump, 75, could be considered DeSantis' political patron. He backed DeSantis, 42, when the then little-known U.S. congressman ran for governor in 2018, propelling him over a more established Republican contender. 
But things have shifted as DeSantis' profile rises, people close to the political situation in Florida say. 
As Trump nursed grievances over his election loss at his home in Palm Beach, DeSantis has been at the forefront of Republican-led fights against strict anti-coronavirus lockdowns, racial justice protests and expanded ballot access, enjoying the kind of platform that Trump now lacks. In addition, Trump is suspended or banned by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and YouTube, which all determined he incited violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
For some Republicans who grew weary of the incessant turmoil of Trump’s four years in the White House, DeSantis offers the promise of a presidential candidate who shares many of Trump’s views but is less incendiary, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republican voters, party officials and strategists.
Trump has been watching closely, a person familiar with the situation said, requesting anonymity.
""He thinks that Ron DeSantis is probably the only present threat to him winning a Republican nomination, that he is the only sort of serious speed bump in President Trump's way,"" the person said. 
Trump, the person said, is confident that if he were to face DeSantis in a party presidential nomination contest he would beat him, ""but DeSantis is making moves that I don't think the president particularly cares for, clearly deliberatively making moves that are presidential politically motivated.""
In a straw poll of potential 2024 candidates at a conservative conference in Denver in June, DeSantis finished ahead of Trump, 74% to 71%.
""If Donald Trump has any plans for 2024, he needs to stop Ron DeSantis' ascent right now,"" said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida, ""because DeSantis is quickly becoming the leader of the party.""
Still, Trump remains the most popular figure in his party.
The fight for the 2024 nomination will most likely hinge on what he decides to do, said Justin Sayfie of Ballard Partners, a Florida based lobbying firm with ties to both men.
""It's Donald Trump's if he wants it,"" Sayfie said. ""There will never be a Donald Trump-Ron DeSantis primary.""
FOCUS ON RE-ELECTION
DeSantis, whose office declined an interview request citing the Surfside tragedy, has maintained that his only political focus is on winning re-election in Florida next year. 
At the same time, he has been wooing Republican donors nationwide, embarking on a fundraising tour that took him to places such as Kentucky and Southern California. His political action committee has taken in more than $30 million this year alone. 
DeSantis' leading Democratic opponent, former Governor Charlie Crist, raised about $1.3 million in a month after announcing his candidacy in May. State Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried is also bidding for the Democratic nomination.
Kelly Craft, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, had a fundraiser for the governor at a friend's horse farm in Lexington, Kentucky that brought in about $245,000. 
DeSantis, Craft said, ""did not talk about the presidency other than complementing former President Trump. He was really focused on Florida and the re-elect.""
She said, however, that he made an impression on the attendees. ""We were just very impressed with his leadership skills during the pandemic.""
DeSantis repeatedly clashed with both the federal government and local Democratic-led cities in Florida over COVID-19 policies, pushing to relax restrictions on businesses and open schools and overriding local regulations such as mask mandates.
That has given DeSantis a story to tell at conservative gatherings. As the featured speaker at a Republican dinner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in May, DeSantis talked about ""free states"" versus ""lockdown"" states, said Sam DeMarco, chairman of the Allegheny County Republicans.
DeMarco said he hopes DeSantis runs in 2024, even if Trump chooses to run. ""This is no disrespect to President Trump. People deserve a choice."" 
Tyler Voyik, a 64-year-old retiree, was one of the roughly 15,000 supporters who showed up for Trump when he held his first campaign-style rally in northern Ohio last week. Voyik voted for Trump twice, but wants him to support DeSantis for president.
""If he runs the country like he runs the state of Florida we'd be almost as good a shape as we were with Trump,"" Voyik said.
'HOT TICKET'
Since the condominium building collapse a week ago, DeSantis has flown back and forth between Miami and his office in Tallahassee. On Wednesday, the governor, stone-faced in jeans and a blue blazer, stood upright with his hands folded, surrounded by local and state officials briefing the public on the search for survivors in the rubble. 
DeSantis' office has not said whether he will attend Trump's rally. Officials close to Trump say it will go on as planned, and the former president has instructed his team to collect relief aid for Surfside families on site.
Jessica Taylor, a political analyst for the Cook Political Report in Washington, said DeSantis' fortunes have improved since the start of the year, and he's now in a better position to be reelected. 
""He’s in good position for an incumbent,"" she said. ""At the same time, that has benefited his 2024 aspirations.""

But Scott Reed, a Republican strategist, thinks DeSantis’ surge risks a backlash from his benefactor.
""This is Trump 101. Anyone who gets more attention than him becomes a political enemy,"" Reed said. ""DeSantis is the hot ticket right now. But in a way he's peaking two years too early.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the creation of a new Democratic-majority select committee to probe the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, after Senate Republicans in May blocked https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-slow-act-probe-into-deadly-capitol-attack-2021-05-28 an independent commission.
The vote was 222-190, largely along party lines. Just two Republicans, Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, voted for the panel.
Kinzinger, one of the most prominent Republican critics of former President Donald Trump in the House, said before the vote that he is open to joining the Democratic-led probe.
On Jan. 6, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election win over his Republican rival. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
The House voted earlier this year to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, but the Senate acquitted him.
""I hope we can begin to uncover exactly what happened and take reasonable steps to prevent the events of Jan. 6 from reoccurring, and yes, yes, find out who is responsible. Who is responsible for inciting a mob to come to the Capitol of the United States to overturn the election of the president of the United States,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said during debate. 
The Jan. 6 panel will have subpoena power, presumably allowing it to call Trump as a witness, said Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security think tank. However, ""they'll have to make decisions about whether they want to engage in litigation over subpoenas,"" she said.
Republican leaders have not said whether the party will participate, but recommended voting against creation of the committee, saying it was likely to pursue a partisan agenda.
Kinzinger, who with Cheney was among a handful of the Republicans who voted earlier this year to impeach Trump for inciting the riot, said he was open to serving on the panel.
""It's not my favorite option, but the point is, we can't keep pretending like Jan. 6 didn't happen,"" he told Chicago television station Fox32 Wednesday. ""We just need answers. We need to know whether members of Congress, members of the administration, that were involved in coordinating this.""
Cheney said she would have preferred an outside commission whose members would have been evenly divided between the political parties. Such a plan passed the House earlier this year with the support of 35 Republicans, but Senate Republicans blocked it.
""That effort was unfortunately blocked. A select committee is now the only remaining option,"" Cheney said in a statement. She told reporters it would be up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as to whether she will serve on the panel.
Other Republicans pointed to the select committee's planned makeup, with Democrats in the majority, as inherently unfair. 
Representative John Katko, a Republican who helped broker the earlier failed bipartisan commission proposal, denounced the select committee plan as ""a turbocharged partisan exercise."" He has compared the proposed panel to a previous, Republican-majority House select committee on the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
Republicans also argued that existing committee probes as well as prosecutors' investigations make an outside commission or a select committee unnecessary. More than 500 people have been charged with taking part in the violence.
The select committee plan calls for Pelosi to appoint the panel's chairman and all 13 members, although five members would be selected by the speaker ""after consultation with"" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.
This suggests Pelosi could block a Republican attempt to name someone like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an ally of Trump who told CNN she would like to be chosen.
An aide said Pelosi was considering a Republican among her appointees.

The resolution gives no deadline for finishing the probe, meaning it could spill over into next year, when 2022 midterm elections will determine control of Congress.
Pelosi invited several police officers who battled the mob on Jan. 6 to sit in the House gallery during Wednesday's debate, including Michael Fanone, a Washington cop who was beaten unconscious by rioters after he rushed to the Capitol to help. She also invited the mother and partner of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died a day after the violence.

WESLACO, Texas (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump, in his latest effort to regain the national spotlight, traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday to accuse President Joe Biden of neglecting national security by dismantling border controls.
Speaking in front of an unfinished section of border wall, Trump said his Democratic successor's decision to undo his hard-line policies had led to increased illegal immigration and drug smuggling. 
""Biden is destroying our country,"" Trump said.
Trump remains one of the most influential figures in Republican politics and has flirted with running for president again in 2024. 
His appearance near Weslaco at the southern tip of Texas, his second https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-revenge-tour-kicks-off-with-saturday-rally-ohio-2021-06-26 public event in recent days, had the trappings of a miniature campaign rally as he revived old grievances from his time in office, including his 2020 loss to Biden and questions about Trump's mental and physical fitness while president.
At least 31 Republicans in the House of Representatives skipped out of work to attend the event and were recognized from the stage by Trump. Texas Governor Gregg Abbott, a fellow Republican and possible 2024 presidential candidate, accompanied Trump on the visit.
Trump has struggled to maintain a high profile following his loss to Biden in November and after being permanently banned from Twitter and suspended for two years by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for making false claims of election fraud. 
An accelerating criminal investigation into his business empire could complicate any return to campaigning. The Wall Street Journal reported https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-organization-cfo-expected-be-charged-thursday-wsj-2021-06-30 on Wednesday that the Manhattan district attorney is expected to charge his company and its chief financial officer with tax-related crimes on Thursday. Trump did not respond to reporters' questions about the investigation. 
Trump's comments on Wednesday come as arrests at the southwest border have risen to the highest monthly levels in two decades since Biden took office, according to preliminary figures first reported by Reuters. 
Since he took office in January, Biden has reversed many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies. He halted construction of Trump's signature border wall and ended a program that forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico pending resolution of their U.S. asylum cases.
Republicans have blamed the increased border arrests on more welcoming policies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children-explainer/explainer-why-more-migrant-children-are-arriving-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-idUSKBN2BA11B.
They have also signaled that immigration will be a focus of the party's campaign to retake control of Congress from Democrats in next year's midterm elections.
Reuters/Ipsos polling suggests their attacks are having little effect. About 10% of 4,420 adults ranked immigration as the nation’s top priority in a June 11-17 poll, down 5 points from a similar survey in April. Among Republicans, 19% listed immigration as a top priority, down 10 points from April. 
Americans' approval of Biden’s handling of border issues is nearly unchanged over the past few months, with 47% saying they disapproved of his leadership on immigration, while 40% said they approved.
Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has tasked with addressing the root causes of migration from Central America - poverty, crime, corruption, and the effects of climate change - urged officials to focus on practical solutions during her visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/harris-visits-us-mexico-border-amid-criticism-republicans-2021-06-25.

Democrats called on Republicans in Congress to work with them to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.
""Anything less is political theater,"" Democratic National Committee spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump's namesake company and its chief financial officer were indicted on Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said, the first charges to arise from a more than two-year probe by New York prosecutors of Trump and his business dealings.
The charges by a Manhattan grand jury against the Trump Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg are expected to be unsealed on Thursday. 
Weisselberg is expected to surrender to authorities on Thursday morning, the person said, and will be formally charged in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday afternoon. 
Trump himself is not expected to be charged this week, his lawyer has said, though the blowback from the case could complicate Trump's political future as he considers a 2024 White House run.
The criminal case stems from the probe by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance in collaboration with New York state Attorney general Letitia James. It is expected to focus on whether Weisselberg and other officials received perks and benefits such as rent-free apartments and leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns, people familiar with the probe have said.
A spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney declined to comment. A lawyer for Weisselberg also declined to comment. And lawyers for Trump and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Trump's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, told Reuters on Monday that prosecutors suggested the charges would be related to taxes and fringe benefits and said Trump himself would not be charged in the indictment.
""This will be their first blow,"" Fischetti said of the prosecutors, adding that prosecutors had said in a meeting with them last week that they were still pursuing their investigation.
Trump, during a trip on Wednesday to Weslaco, Texas, near the Mexican border to criticize President Joe Biden's immigration policies, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters about the criminal charges.
In a statement on Monday, Trump called prosecutors biased and said his company's actions were ""in no way a crime.""
The Trump Organization could face fines and other penalties if convicted. 
POTENTIAL 'SCHEME TO DEFRAUD' CHARGES
Charges could increase pressure on Weisselberg to cooperate with prosecutors, which he has resisted. Weisselberg is a close Trump confidant, making his cooperation potentially crucial to any future case against the former president.
Court filings, public records and subpoenaed documents have shown that Weisselberg and his son Barry have received perks and gifts potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including many benefits related to real estate.
The case could be charged as a scheme by the company to pay people off the books in order to hide assets over many years. 
One possible charge would be ""scheme to defraud,"" according to New York attorney Marc Scholl, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office. 
""'Scheme to defraud' is a crime that allows the prosecution to detail a narrative in the indictment describing the criminal conduct and how it originated, no matter how long ago the crime started,"" Scholl said.
Scholl said that the charges could also include a ""scheme to defraud under the tax law,"" which would carry far more serious penalties. 
Prosecutors in Vance's office accelerated their focus on the Trump Organization's use of perks and benefits last fall. The office of New York state Attorney General Letitia James, which had also been looking into the Trump Organization, said in May that its probe had turned into a criminal investigation and that it had joined forces with Vance's office.
Vance, a Democrat, has in his nearly three-year investigation examined an array of potential wrongdoing, including whether Trump's company manipulated the value of its real estate to reduce its taxes and secure favorable loan terms.
Before entering the White House in 2017, Trump put his company into a trust overseen by his adult sons and Weisselberg, who has maintained tight control over its finances. It is unclear what role Trump now has at the company.
The case could complicate Trump's political future, as he flirts with a possible 2024 White House run.
Jennifer Weisselberg, the former wife of Barry Weisselberg, has met with prosecutors half a dozen times.
Her lawyer, Duncan Levin, told Reuters on Wednesday that ""over the past half year, Jen has been cooperating with prosecutors. We have turned over a mountain of evidence to them to support these charges. We're very gratified the DA's office is moving forward with these charges.""

In an interview with MSNBC, Jennifer Weisselberg said she would be prepared to testify while adding: ""My documents at this time are witnesses themselves. They are being used, and they're being walked through the grand jury panel.""
""We've been going through questions pertaining to compensation, perks and taxes just to review how to ... inform a grand jury,"" she added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A lawyer for the man nicknamed the ""QAnon Shaman,"" who faces criminal charges in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, asked a federal judge on Wednesday to release his client, saying he poses no danger to the public.
The man, Jacob Chansley, is in federal custody awaiting trial on six criminal charges, including violent entry. 
On Jan. 6, Chansley joined a crowd of hundreds of supporters of Republican then-President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol in an unsuccessful bid to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory.
Defense attorney Albert Watkins argued in U.S. District Court in Washington that the flagpole Chansley carried inside the Capitol ""was not able to be used as a deadly weapon.""
Rioters beat police officers with flagpoles and other objects during the assault, which ultimately left five dead and scores wounded. 
Also on Wednesday, Mark Grods, a member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction charges for taking part in the attack. [L2N2OC1ZG]
Chansley was famously photographed inside the U.S. Senate Chamber wearing a horned hat, and is known for supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory that casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals. 
He is undergoing a mental health evaluation by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial. 
Watkins said that he expects the results of that exam would ""be forthcoming in short order.""

In the hearing, he acknowledged his client needs mental health services, a problem that was documented as far back as 2006 when Chansley served in the U.S. military. Watkins said Chansley could get the treatment he needs back home in Phoenix.
A federal prosecutor told the judge the time is ""not ripe"" yet to revisit whether Chansley should be detained until the psychiatric evaluation is completed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has seen an erosion in support since April, mainly from fellow Democrats, as his administration wrestles with Congress to make good on campaign promises and more Americans worry about an uneven economic recovery, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. 
A June 11-17 national opinion poll shows Biden is still more popular than his Republican predecessor Donald Trump ever was: 55% of adults approve of Biden's performance in office and 65% like his response to the coronavirus pandemic. At this point four years ago, about 36% of adults approved of Trump's job performance.
However, a growing number of Americans disapprove of Biden's leadership on the economy, gun violence and taxation, with the biggest decline coming within Biden's Democratic Party https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/yxmvjzlmkvr, especially those under the age of 40, non-white Democrats or those who do not have a college degree.
The economy has replaced healthcare and disease as a top concern, with nearly a quarter of adults who were polled calling it the most important problem. A majority of Americans are worried about rising living costs, and the public is almost evenly split over how much the government should do to make things better, according to the poll.
Forty-eight percent of respondents said they approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, which is down 4 points from a similar survey that ran in April. The number of Americans who disapproved of Biden’s economic record rose 4 points to 43%.
Democratic pollster Ryan Pougiales said a lot of people still feel like they are far from back to normal. 
""There’s a huge impatience"" with the economy, Pougiales said. ""Everyone’s been bottled up in their homes. Many have lost their jobs or lost loved ones.""
Just 35% of the country thinks the U.S. economy is headed in the right direction, and 44% say they are ""very concerned"" that prices will keep rising, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Among Democrats, 78% said they approved of Biden's economic agenda, down 7 points from April, while the number of Democrats who disapproved of his economic plan rose 6 points to 15%. That includes an 11-point drop in approval among Democrats under 40 years old, an 8-point drop in approval among minority Democrats and Democrats without a college degree.
Despite an expected 7% growth in the economy this year, government statistics show the post-pandemic jobs recovery has been lagging most among racial and ethnic minorities and those without a college education.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment within the Black community was 9.1% as of May, for example, compared to 5.1% for whites. Unemployment for college degree holders was 3.2% in May, less than half the 6.8% unemployment rate for those with only a high school diploma.
BIDEN'S CHALLENGES
The challenge for Biden will be to find workable solutions while keeping his party together, including many Democrats who initially favored more liberal candidates like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, as well as racial minorities and people with less higher education.
""He's in a delicate position with respect to the economy,"" said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. ""His coalition ranges from people in high tech sectors to suburban swing voters to more traditional Democrats. They all want different things from the economy.""
Meanwhile, the number of Americans who approved of Biden’s stance on gun violence dropped 8 points overall and 11 points among Democrats from April to June.
The eroding support for Biden coincides with Democrats struggling to pass major parts of his agenda in Congress. They failed this month to generate enough support for federal voting rights legislation, and the future of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan is still in flux after months of negotiations with Republicans. 
Biden also faces growing impatience from gun safety activists who want the president to make good on a series of campaign promises to stem an ""epidemic"" of gun violence. He pledged this month to go after illegal gun dealers and boost federal funding and support for local law enforcement as homicide rates have spiked in large cities.

Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said many Americans remain fixated on the coronavirus, an area where Biden remains strong. As the pandemic recedes, the economy will continue to recover, and that would be a win for Biden, Kamarck said.
""Right now, the dynamic is: you handle the virus, and you handle the economy,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia pleaded guilty on Wednesday to conspiracy and obstruction charges for taking part in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Alabama resident Mark Grods, 54, could face more than five years in prison and a fine of up to $200,000 after pleading guilty to the riot-related charges, according to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who received Grods' guilty plea at a hearing in Washington. A sentence will be imposed at a future hearing.
As part of his plea agreement, Grods agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and give trial and grand jury testimony, he confirmed to the judge. 
In court papers, prosecutors said Grods joined a formation of Oath Keepers who rode to the Capitol in golf carts and breached the Capitol along with hundreds of supporters of Republican then-President Donald Trump who were trying to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election.
More than 500 people have been charged with taking part in the attack, which left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer. Grods is one of a group of more than two dozen members of the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and Three Percenters facing more serious charges including conspiracy and obstruction.
""While walking through the restricted area and toward the Capitol building, Grods and others known and unknown moved together in a military 'stack' formation with hands on the shoulders of those in front of them to communicate and effectively move toward the Capitol,"" prosecutors said in the court filing. 
Grods entered the Capitol carrying ""a large stick,"" they said.
In the days before the riot, Grods had communicated via the encrypted app Signal about plans to travel to Washington and whether he should bring weapons, they said, adding: ""Grods brought firearms to Washington, D.C., and eventually provided them to another individual to store in a Virginia hotel.""

Prosecutors said their investigation of Grods was related to an ""ongoing grand jury investigation"" of a group of Oath Keepers who face criminal charges in connection with the riot. 
Brian Lockwood, a lawyer for Grods, said his client had no comment. Another Oath Keepers member, Graydon Young https://www.reuters.com/world/us/member-oath-keepers-plead-guilty-role-us-capitol-attack-2021-06-23, last week pleaded guilty to similar charges.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. officials were still in touch with counterparts in Canada, Europe and elsewhere to determine when and how to lift travel restrictions safely. 

""That's not our intention,"" Psaki told reporters at the White House when asked if the U.S. government would ever require visitors to the United States to have received a COVID-19 vaccine to enter the country.
With the spread of the Delta variant of increasing concern, Psaki announced that the United States plans to ship 2.5 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine to Colombia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will push for electric vehicle rebates, clean energy tax credits, and school funding in the reconciliation bill, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. 
The president agreed to a scaled-down infrastructure package earlier this month worth $1.2 trillion with a bipartisan group of senators that does not include many of his policy priorities, like the tax credits and rebates, federal funding of pre-kindergarten or community college.

380,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 01:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- House Democrats plan to seek changes to the Senate’s $973 billion bipartisan infrastructure framework through informal negotiations in the coming weeks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a key committee chairman said Wednesday.
The House is poised to pass its own $715 billion, five-year surface transportation and water infrastructure plan on Thursday. Unlike the bipartisan Senate deal, the bill doesn’t include a full suite of funding measures. It does contain major changes to highway and climate policies that are lacking in the Senate bill.
“Our caucus is very, very pleased with the bipartisan agreement that the president was able to achieve working with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate,” Pelosi said. “It has many good features to it in terms of numbers, but not policy.”
House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said at the same briefing that the Senate proposals “are within shouting distance, so I believe we can work out the spending levels in the bill, but there is no policy attached to their proposal.”
Rather than waiting for the Senate to pass the bipartisan deal -- which is still being written into legislative language -- and then go into a formal House-Senate conference committee negotiation, immediate, high-level talks to reach a compromise would be preferable, DeFazio said.
Quickest Timeline
“If they want to dispatch of this quickly -- and they’re talking about July, which is a very quick timeline to, you know, negotiate policy in any major way, and the numbers again to help pay for them are outside my realm so I can’t comment on them at all -- then I would suggest it would probably be a much quicker, more informal process,” he said.
House Republicans are expected to mainly oppose the transportation and water package, even though it includes many earmarked projects from GOP members. The Senate’s bipartisan bill -- which amounts to $579 billion in new spending, or $973 billion when regular maintenance spending is factored in -- initially won support from 21 senators, including 11 Republicans, enough for it to pass by regular order in that chamber.
Some of those GOP senators have since objected, after it was linked by Biden to a bigger, Democrat-only budget bill.
The House transportation bill has policies not in the Senate agreement including prioritizing repair of crumbling roads and bridges over new construction; giving states and localities more flexibility to determine best uses of federal dollars; and an $8 billion fund to reduce carbon emissions.
The House has also put forward billions of dollars in earmarked, local projects that Democrats have been touting in their districts for weeks.
Pelosi reiterated that any final infrastructure deal would not be voted on in the House until a separate multitrillion-dollar budget bill carrying President Joe Biden’s tax and social spending agenda clears the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this week called on the speaker to de-link the two bills after Biden clarified that he would be willing to sign an infrastructure bill even if Congress does not send him the other budget bill to sign as well.

Gutmann, 71, who would be the first woman to serve in the role and whose father fled Nazi Germany, is currently president of the University of Pennsylvania.
Her nomination was handed to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in mid-June, one of the sources told Reuters. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Gutmann would replace interim appointee Robin Quinville.
Quinville took over last year from Richard Grenell, a Trump ally who stepped down after little more than two years in the job. 
""With Amy Gutmann, Joe Biden is relying on an experienced bridge builder. She is taking on a difficult legacy after Richard Grenell,"" Johann Wadephul, deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative alliance, told Reuters.
During his tenure, Grenell accused Germany of undermining NATO's nuclear deterrent and criticised Berlin's involvement in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
The standoff over the pipeline has strained bilateral ties. The Biden administration last month waived sanctions on the company behind it.

A German foreign ministry spokesperson said that, while it could not confirm the move, Berlin would welcome the nomination, and that the post had enormous significance for developing future relations.
The U.S. embassy in Berlin was not immediately available for comment.

""This allegation is untrue. Tucker Carlson has never been an intelligence target of the Agency and the NSA has never had any plans to try to take his program off the air,"" the NSA said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Carlson, a conservative talk show commentator and strident critic of the Joe Biden administration, said on his show on Monday night that he ""heard from a whistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn us that the NSA, the National Security Agency, is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air.""
""The NSA captured that information without our knowledge and did it for political reasons. The Biden administration is spying on us. We have confirmed that,"" he said.
The NSA ""has a foreign intelligence mission,"" the agency added on Twitter, and can not target a U.S. citizen without a court order except in limited exceptions. 
Carlson said on his show on Tuesday that NSA's statement did not address the accusation that the agency was reading his emails. 
Fox News had no comment. 

In March, the Pentagon said Carlson ""essentially demeaned the entire U.S. military"" with a segment that decried increasing numbers of female service members.

The move comes amid a hail of criticism from high-profile Republicans of Democratic President Joe Biden for rolling back immigration restrictions introduced by his predecessor Donald Trump, with the number of migrants arriving at the border reaching the highest monthly levels in two decades.
""The Biden Administration has failed in the most basic duty of the federal government: keeping the American people safe,"" said Noem, who was a vocal supporter of Trump's hardline immigration policies. 
Her office said in a statement the action was ""in response to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's request for help to respond to ongoing violations of state and federal law by illegal aliens crossing the unsecured border.""
Trump said earlier this month that he would visit the Texas-Mexico border on June 30 with Abbott.
The initial deployment would last between 30 and 60 days and ""will be paid for by a private donation,"" the statement said, without identifying the donor. National Guard troop deployments are normally funded from federal or state budgets. 
Noem's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Willis Johnson, a Tennessee-based Republican donor, made the donation to pay for the troops, Johnson told Politico. Reuters was unable to contact Johnson for comment.

384,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 08:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill to remove statues honoring those who upheld slavery or backed the Confederacy from the Capitol building, which displays statues selected by all 50 states.
It is the second year in a row that the House passed the bill, which the then-Republican-controlled Senate in 2020 declined to take up. Democrats now have a razor-thin Senate majority, which could allow them to force a vote on the measure, which would need the support of 10 Republicans to pass.
The bill passed the House 285-120 with all the votes against the measure coming from Republicans.
The statues and busts targeted by the ""Remove Hate"" bill include one honoring former U.S. Chief Justice Roger Taney, who authored a key decision supporting slavery. They also include leaders of the rebellious Confederacy -- whose battle flag was seen in the Capitol on Jan. 6 when supporters of then-President Donald Trump launched a deadly attack that attempted to overturn his election defeat.
Taney's bust would be replaced by one of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black man to serve on the high court.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said removing the statues will not erase the stain of racist acts from U.S. history, nor will it erase racism in the United States today. But she asked, ""How can we expect to end the scourge of racism ... when we allow the worst perpetrators of that racism to be lauded in the halls of Congress?""

Opponents said it would be wrong to dictate to individual U.S. states whom they can honor by sending statues to the Capitol. Republican Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama said the bill was an example of ""cancel culture and historical revisionism"" by ""elitists who claim they know more than regular citizens.""
Taney wrote the majority opinion in the 1857 ""Dred Scott"" case, ruling that Black Americans could not be considered citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery. It later was overturned by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which was adopted in 1868.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York prosecutors investigating former U.S. President Donald Trump's business practices are likely to issue one or more criminal indictments this week – but not against Trump himself, according to people involved in the case.
Ronald Fischetti, an attorney representing Trump, said on Monday that based on discussions with prosecutors he expects “no charges” will be brought against Trump in the initial round of indictments. Others familiar with the case said prosecutors are preparing criminal charges against Allen Weisselberg, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, and also are considering criminal charges against the company.
After an almost three-year investigation of Trump’s property dealings, the initial charges by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr will focus mainly on whether Weisselberg and other company officials received corporate perks and benefits, such as rent-free apartments and leased cars, that were not reported properly on their tax returns, according to several people familiar with the investigation. The exact charges prosecutors are preparing are not known
The indictments would be the investigation’s first against top officials at Trump's company, marking a critical shift from investigation to prosecution.
Prosecutors have been pressing Weisselberg, 73, to cooperate with their probe and provide testimony, so far without success. An indictment would increase that pressure. Weisselberg is among Trump’s closest confidants, having worked for the company since 1973 when it was run by Trump’s father, Fred.
New York State Attorney General Letitia James has also joined the investigation. Spokespeople for both the Manhattan and state prosecutors' offices declined to comment. A lawyer for Weisselberg also declined to comment.
Trump’s lawyer, Fischetti, said the case is “embarrassing” and without merit.
“In my more than 50 years of practice, never before have I seen the District Attorney’s Office target a company over employee compensation or fringe benefits,” such as company cars or apartments, said Fischetti, a longtime white collar criminal lawyer.
“They say their investigation is continuing but it’s a pretty shallow indictment for all that,” he said.
Trump released a statement Monday night attacking the prosecutors as “rude, nasty and totally biased” and his company’s actions “in no way a crime.”
“They continue to be ‘in search of a crime’ and will do anything to frighten people into making up the stories or lies that they want, but have been totally unable to get,” Trump said.
MORE CHARGES EXPECTED 
The wide-ranging criminal investigation has examined an array of potential wrongdoing, including whether Trump's eponymous real estate company manipulated the value of its properties to reduce its tax burden and secure more favorable loans from creditors. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, testified to Congress that such practices were routine at the company. He has spoken multiple times with prosecutors.
More charges could be coming against the company or its officers in the weeks ahead, people familiar with the case said.
Since last fall, prosecutors have focused increasingly on the company's use of perks and benefits as a form of compensation for corporate officials. Jennifer Weisselberg, the ex-wife of Allen Weisselberg’s son Barry, has met with prosecutors a half-dozen times, most recently 10 days ago. She provided boxes of tax and bank records as well as financial statements, her lawyer said.
Barry Weisselberg also worked for the Trump Organization, helping to manage two ice-skating rinks and a carousel in New York’s Central Park, all operated by the company under contracts with New York City. Those contracts have been terminated.
""Jennifer Weisselberg is continuing to provide prosecutors with a very wide range of documents and testimony, and was there during first-hand conversations about fringe benefits and other things, and is relaying conversations to prosecutors that she was privy to,” her lawyer, Duncan Levin, told Reuters.
Court filings, public records and documents subpoenaed in the investigation show that Allen and Barry Weisselberg received corporate perks and gifts potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over their years with the Trump Organization. If they failed to account properly for that money on tax returns and other financial filings, it could put them in legal jeopardy.
Many of the benefits reaped by the Weisselbergs revolved around real estate.
In 2005, Barry married and moved into a Trump-owned unit in a building overlooking Central Park. In a 2018 deposition tied to his divorce, Barry said he and his wife didn’t pay rent during the five-plus years they lived there. The couple’s tax returns, subpoenaed by the District Attorney and reviewed by Reuters, do not appear to account for the free rent as either compensation or a gift. 
Similar units rented for several thousand dollars a month at the time, real estate data showed, putting the value of the free apartment at around $200,000 over the couple’s residency.
After Barry's divorce, he again moved into a Trump-owned apartment, where he also lived rent free, court records showed. A lawyer for Barry Weisselberg could not immediately be reached for comment.

During their marriage, Barry and Jennifer Weisselberg enjoyed other gifts and perks provided by his father, raising questions about whether some of those benefits also may have flowed from the Trump Organization.
When asked in his 2018 deposition if he considered that money to be a gift, Barry said he viewed the payments as “financial assistance.” When he was questioned on whether former President Trump ultimately covered any of those costs or other expenses for the couple, Barry said, “I don't know.”

386,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s team is pivoting from saving a bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill from collapse to trying to unify House Democrats behind both that bill and a follow-on, multi-trillion dollar economic package expected to pass on a party-line vote.
White House counselor Steve Ricchetti met Tuesday with the Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus and plans to reach out to other groups on Biden’s strategy to pass a $579 billion bipartisan infrastructure bill in tandem with a bigger, broader tax and social spending package. Progressives have yet to be sold on the substance of the first bill, which they complain lacks climate-change provisions, and differ on the size and scope of the second bill.
“The budget needs to include our priorities, otherwise it won’t have progressive support,” CPC Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington representative, said before the Ricchetti meeting. “We have an agenda that we have to get accomplished and linking the two bills is the only way it is going to get accomplished.”
With Biden in Wisconsin kicking off a campaign to sell the infrastructure deal to voters, Ricchetti and other White House aides are lobbying various Democratic factions, as well as Republicans, on the two-track plan for president’s broader agenda, which GOP leaders are trying to derail.
Key to the strategy is agreeing to a price tag for the second bill that will keep progressives on board without alienating moderate Democrats in both the House and Senate. The House plans to vote on an outline for the tax and spending plan as part of a budget package in July.
Slim Margin
With the House currently split 220-211 between Democrats and Republicans, Speaker Nancy Pelosi can’t afford to lose many votes. In an effort to keep Democrats together, she has promised progressives that she will not allow a House vote on the Senate infrastructure deal, which was brokered by 10 senators, before the Senate passes a follow-on package using a fast-track budget procedure known as reconciliation.
Jayapal said she has some flexibility on the overall cost of the second package, even though she supports a draft put forward by Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders for a $6 trillion bill, half of which would be paid for by tax increases and savings from lower drug prices. That proposal would enact much of Biden’s American Families Plan, including free community college and expanded child care support, as well as make enhanced child tax credits permanent and boost Medicare coverage while lowering its eligibility age to 60.
“We obviously like the $6 trillion number but understand it might be too high for some people,” Jayapal said. “He can’t sign a bill unless we send it to him, so we still control the narrative.”
Representative Ilhan Omar said the caucus discussed with Ricchetti their five priority areas: child and elder care, affordable housing, lowering drug prices and expanding Medicare, climate change, and a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.
Omar said the White House team said they are open to those items in reconciliation, thought they didn’t discuss the price tag. But the Minnesota Democrat said she’s optimistic that the party will be able to come together.
“We feel better about the strategy,” she said after the meeting.
Assurances Sought
Progressives say they need assurances that the Senate, including moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, will go along with a budget reconciliation bill.
“Show me the beef,” New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. “And to me, the beef is cost of reconciliation in the Senate.”
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). as of June 21 was penciling in around $2.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period, with $1.5 trillion of tax hikes, for a reconciliation bill.
Manchin in a television appearance over the weekend said he can only support a reconciliation bill that is fully paid for, and he has also opposed raising the corporate tax rate above 25%, to 28% as Biden has proposed. That would likely cut the size of the package significantly.
Key Moderate
In an interview Tuesday on MSNBC, Manchin said he is prepared to back a follow-on reconciliation package, though he has not agreed on how big it should be.
“I have agreed that that can be done, I just haven’t agreed on the amount,” Manchin said. “I haven’t seen everything that everybody is wanting to put into a bill.”
Ricchetti, along with legislative liaison Louisa Terrell and her deputy Shuwanza Goff, are also engaging the New Democrat Coalition and the Blue Dog Coalition as well as Republicans in the House this week.
“Lots of people are kind of saying you need to make the call on whether you support something. Where’s the document? Where’s the thing we are going to read,” Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin, a member of the New Democrat Coalition, said. “I think a lot of my colleagues have already been talking about how they are going to have concerns on an additional package.”
Oregon Representative Kurt Schrader, a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, has said he will vote against the second, budget reconciliation bill. New Jersey moderate Josh Gottheimer, another Blue Dog member, also said he will not commit to backing a reconciliation bill until he sees what is in it.
House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth has been tasked with finding a compromise between the competing factions, and will also meet the progressive caucus Tuesday as well as the Blue Dogs later in the week.
“It’s going to be tough, but I think the people I’ve talked to -- moderates and liberals -- are all in the same boat and saying we’ll get there,” Yarmuth told reporters. “I can’t imagine that there are four people in this caucus who are going to ultimately vote against childcare, the child tax credit, senior care, climate change investments.”
Budget Committee member Jim Cooper, a fiscally conservative Democrat, said he is open to the range of numbers being discussed and doesn’t believe the bill’s long-term investments need to be fully paid for. “We are still in a Covid pandemic emergency,” he said.
Many Democrats are urging their fellow lawmakers to unify rather than to give in to infighting.
“We need to give the Budget Committee some space and not undermine their work,” Representative Rick Larsen of Washington said.
Others said it is going to be a bumpy few months until Congress takes up the final legislation in September or October.
“What is easy right now? Can you think of a single thing that is easy?” Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz said. “There are a lot of moving parts and members have a lot of priorities, but I am confident we are going to come together and put together a budget and reconciliation package.”

(Reuters) - Young climate activists carrying signs reading ""Biden, you coward - fight for us"" and ""No climate, no deal"" gathered outside the White House on Monday to protest what they called U.S. President Joe Biden's broken promises and pandering to Republicans. ""Biden ran with bold promises for action and climate and we turned out for him,"" said John Paul Mejia, an 18-year-old student from Miami among hundreds at the Sunrise Movement protest, which featured Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive members of Congress. 
""We did everything in our power to get him elected and we need to have some say in our future and the safety of our communities,"" Mejia said.
Mejia's disappointment is being echoed by young climate activists around the country who say Biden's opportunity to fulfill campaign pledges is slipping away as he negotiates with Republicans. 
""We have a Democratic president, we have majority both in the House and the Senate, and it should be a time in which we are able to get things done, and we really haven't,"" said Kallan Benson, a 17-year-old organizer for Fridays for Future, a global activist group. 
""We have incremental gains but nothing that is really a game changer for us,"" Benson said. 
Asked about the climate protest Monday, Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that ""the president is absolutely committed to addressing climate."" 
Many young activists are critical of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal between Republicans and Democrats that includes half of the funding Biden originally proposed for electric vehicle (EV) technology such as charging stations, none for EV rebates, and does not require utilities to meet a clean energy standard.
The White House said Monday the bipartisan deal was just a ""down payment"" on Biden's long-term climate goals. 
Maintaining support from young, liberal Americans is crucial to Biden, who leaned on progressives like New York Representative Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and activist groups including the Sunrise Movement to unify the Democratic Party before the 2020 election. 

""Sometimes folks need a little reminder of the community that took them to the dance,"" Ocasio-Cortez told protesters outside the White House Monday. ""We’re inviting the White House to the dance."" Ocasio-Cortez is among Democrats in Congress critical of the bipartisan deal. 
More than half of Americans aged 18 to 29 voted in the 2020 general election, a Tufts University research group found, up 11 points from 2016. The group estimates 61% of them voted Democratic.

ROME (Reuters) - The United States hopes for more stable and predictable relations with Russia but if the latter continues to ""be aggressive"", then Washington will respond, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday.
""But if Russia is going to continue to take reckless or aggressive actions, we'll respond — not for purposes of conflict, not to escalate, but because we will defend our interests and values,"" he told Italian daily La Repubblica.
Blinken - who was in Rome for a meeting on international efforts to combat Islamist militia - referred to the SolarWind cyberattacks and the attempt to poison jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
Earlier this month U.S. President Joe Biden told Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Geneva that certain critical infrastructure should be ""off-limits"" to cyberattacks. 
China was ""the most complicated"" when it came to relations Blinken added, but said the United States respected the different relations countries had with China and that it would not ask any of them to choose between the two countries.
""I think we see adversarial aspects to the relationship, competitive aspects of the relationship, and cooperative ones. There's no single word that can define it,"" he said
He added that, when dealing with China, ""we are much more effective if we're working together."" 

Blinken also said that Italy had made important efforts in drafting legislation aimed at protecting its 5G network from ""untrusted vendors"" and that it should continue to carry out checks should investments from other countries arrive. 
The United States has lobbied Italy and other European allies to avoid using equipment made by Huawei in their next- generation networks, saying the Chinese company could pose a security risk. Huawei has rejected the accusations.

(Reuters) - California has added five more states to its list of places where state-funded travel is banned because they have laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ community, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Monday.
The list now has 17 states where state employee travel is banned except under limited circumstances. The five news states are Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia.
""There is an unprecedented wave of bigotry and discrimination in this country. California will not support it. When states discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans, we take action"", Bonta said in a statement.
In 2016, California's lawmakers banned non-essential travel to states with laws that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
The five new states added to the list have introduced bills in their legislatures this year that prevent transgender women and girls from participating in school sports consistent with their gender identity, block access to health care and allow the discrimination towards the LGBTQ community, Bonta said.
""On the anniversary of the Stonewall riots and amidst a wave of discriminatory laws passed in state legislatures across the country, California is announcing new additions to the state-funded travel restrictions list"", he said.
A 1969 police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village, triggered angry demonstrations by the gay community, seen as a pivotal moment in the history of the movement.

California's law has exemptions for some trips, like travel needed to enforce California law and to honor contracts signed before the states were added to the list.
The 12 other states on the list are Texas, Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi and Tennessee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans said on Monday they opposed Democratic-led legislation intended to boost competitiveness with China and push Beijing on human rights, meaning the panel will likely advance the bill this week with only Democratic support.
A spokesperson for Representative Michael McCaul, the top committee Republican, said he opposed the ""Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act,"" or Eagle Act, which the committee will consider on Wednesday.
The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, which is narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats.
However, the two parties disagree on how best to deal with China. For example, Republicans object to provisions in the Eagle Act that would authorize funding for climate initiatives.
But Republicans also said they felt the Eagle Act calls for too many studies and would be a missed opportunity to take meaningful action like tightening control of technology exports and regulating access to some types of sensitive personal data, such as Americans' health information.
""It's largely just a messaging bill,"" a Republican aide said.

The Eagle Act was introduced in May by Democratic Foreign Affairs Chairman Gregory Meeks. 
The Senate on June 8 passed by a strong bipartisan 68-32 majority its own sweeping China bill, the ""U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,"" or USICA, which authorizes about $190 billion for provisions to strengthen U.S. technology and research, and approved $54 billion to increase U.S. production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.

Speaking at his first virtual fundraiser since the 2020 election, Obama, a Democrat, said Trump's claims undermined the legitimacy of U.S. elections and helped lead to other anti-democratic measures such as efforts to suppress the vote.
""What we saw was my successor, the former president, violate that core tenet that you count the votes and then declare a winner - and fabricate and make up a whole bunch of hooey,"" Obama said.
Trump has continued to falsely claim that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud, which has been rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
""What's been called 'the big lie' suddenly gains momentum,"" which in turn has fueled moves by Republican-controlled legislatures to reduce access to voting and gain more control over voting operations, Obama said.
""Here's the bottom line. If we don't stop these kinds of efforts now, what we are going to see is more and more contested elections ... We are going to see a further de-legitimizing of our democracy,"" he said, as well as ""a breakdown of the basic agreement that has held this magnificent democratic experiment together all these years.""
Republican governors of Georgia, Arizona, Florida and Iowa have signed new voting restrictions into law this year, and state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Texas are trying to advance similar measures. These states will be battlegrounds in the 2022 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.
The U.S. Justice Department on Friday sued to block the Georgia law, which tightened absentee ballot identification requirements, restricted the use of ballot drop-boxes, and allowed a Republican-controlled state agency to run local voting operations.

Obama said he believed the U.S. Senate will hold a new vote on a Democratic voting rights bill that Republicans blocked last week.
The fundraising call was for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee as the United States heads into the once-a-decade redrawing of congressional districts that will play a critical role in determining whether Democrats keep control of the House of Representatives next year. History and redistricting suggests they are likely to fail.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday put CACI International Inc a step closer to facing a trial in a lawsuit by three Iraqi former detainees who have accused employees of the defense contractor of directing their torture at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.
The justices declined to hear CACI's appeal of a lower court's 2019 decision that favored the three Iraqi men, whose suit against the Virginia-based company was filed in 2008 under a 1789 U.S. law called the Alien Tort Statute that can be used to pursue legal claims over alleged human rights abuses.
The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2019 refused to let the company immediately appeal a federal judge's earlier ruling that said CACI was immune from being sued because it was working as a government contractor. The company has argued that it should be protected under a different and more muscular legal doctrine known as derivative sovereign immunity that can be invoked to shield government contractors from liability under certain circumstances.
The harsh treatment of prisoners held by U.S. forces during the Iraq war at the Abu Ghraib facility became a scandal during former President George W. Bush's administration after pictures of the abuse emerged in 2004. Some detainees said they endured physical and sexual abuse, infliction of electric shocks and mock executions.
The three plaintiffs - Suhail Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and As'ad Al-Zuba'e - are Iraqi civilians who said they were detained at Abu Ghraib and eventually released without charge. CACI has called the lawsuit baseless. 
The lawsuit has bounced around the courts on different legal questions ever since it was first filed. The issue before the justices was on the narrow question of whether the company could immediately appeal the lower court decision and not on the merits of whether the lawsuit should be tossed out.
The lawsuit accused CACI employees who conducted interrogation and other services at Abu Ghraib of directing or encouraging torture, in part to ""soften up"" detainees for questioning, while managers were accused of covering it up.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 narrowed the Alien Tort Statute's reach, saying it was presumed to cover conduct in the United States, and that violations elsewhere must ""touch and concern"" U.S. territory ""with sufficient force"" for plaintiffs to sue.
The justices in that case and two subsequent rulings rebuffed attempts by corporate defendants to find that U.S.-based companies can never be sued under the law. The Supreme Court ruled on June 17 that another lawsuit filed under the Alien Tort Statute accusing Cargill Inc and a Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) subsidiary of knowingly helping perpetuate slavery at Ivory Coast cocoa farms must be thrown out.

The Post, citing two people familiar with the matter, said the deadline was another strong signal that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James are considering criminal charges against the company as an entity.
On Friday, the New York Times reported that Vance could announce charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, as soon as next week.
A lawyer for the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Vance declined to confirm the reports or to comment on them.
Any criminal charges would be the first in Vance's probe into Trump and his business dealings.
Legal experts have said an indictment against the Trump Organization could bankrupt the company by undermining its relationships with banks and other business partners. 
Vance's office has said it was investigating ""possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
It is possible that no charges will be brought.
Vance's probe nevertheless could complicate any return to politics by Trump, who has lost some of his ability to communicate publicly after being permanently banned from Twitter and suspended for two years by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Court filings and records subpoenaed in the investigation show that Weisselberg and his son Barry have received corporate perks and gifts worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in their years associated with the Trump Organization.

If they failed to account properly for that money on tax returns and other financial filings, they could be in legal jeopardy, legal experts have said.
James' office has been investigating whether the Trump Organization inflated the values of some properties to obtain better terms on loans, and lowered their values to obtain property tax breaks.

WELLINGTON, Ohio (Reuters) -At his first rally since leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump on Saturday lambasted the Biden administration's immigration policies and sought to energize Republicans to take back majorities in Congress next year.
Appearing to relish being back in front of thousands of supporters, Trump repeated his false claim that his defeat in the November 2020 election was marred by fraud.
Trump left office in the aftermath of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, shortly after a speech in which he urged a crowd to ""fight"" when then President-elect Joe Biden's victory was about to be certified by lawmakers. 
Trump survived a second impeachment on a charge linked to the violence and has kept broad influence over the Republican Party, in part by leaving open the question of whether he will run for office again in 2024.
He dangled that possibility on Saturday to the crowd.
""We won the election twice and it's possible we'll have to win it a third time. It's possible,"" he said. 
Trump won the 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He lost in 2020.
Whether he runs again could be influenced by the outcome of various legal troubles. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has told Trump's lawyers it is considering filing criminal charges against his family business, the New York Times reported on Friday.
The former president highlighted parts of his regular grievance list at the rally, with particular focus on the rising number of immigrants crossing over the U.S. southern border, an issue Republicans have zeroed in on to rally their voters.
""You have millions of people coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. Joe Biden is doing the exact opposite as we did,"" Trump said. 
Biden's White House has called Trump's immigration policies inhumane.
While keeping his political plans vague, the former president spoke forcefully in favor of getting his party back in control of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.
""We will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,"" he said.
Democrats' razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress will be on the line in the 2022 midterm elections and history favors Republicans' chances of gaining seats in those contests.
REVENGE ENDORSEMENTS
While Trump has made speeches at Republican events since his defeat, the rally in Ohio, a state he won in 2020, marked a return to the freewheeling mass gatherings that have been critical to retaining the support of his enthusiastic base. 
He campaigned for former White House aide Max Miller, who has launched a primary challenge against Representative Anthony Gonzalez, one of the 10 House Republicans https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-republicans-impeachment-idINKBN29I1A8 who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Trump has vowed to campaign against all 10. He endorsed a challenger to Senator Lisa Murkowski, the only one of the seven Senate Republicans https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-senators-factbo/factbox-seven-republicans-vote-to-convict-trump-in-impeachment-trial-idUSKBN2AD0AO who voted to convict him in his January impeachment trial who is up for re-election in 2022.
The Ohio event in Wellington, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Cleveland, was the first of three expected public appearances, followed by a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on June 30 and a rally in Sarasota, Florida, on July 3.
Supporters said they hoped Trump would use such events to help unify the party behind like-minded candidates for Congress.
Trump repeatedly attacked what he called ""woke generals,"" following an exchange this week in which the top U.S. military officer hit back https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-us-general-hits-back-right-wing-uproar-over-racism-teachings-2021-06-23 against a growing conservative movement opposed to teaching certain theories about racism.
""Our generals and our admirals are now focused more on this nonsense than they are on our enemies,"" Trump said.
He criticized the media, a regular foil, and tried to co-opt the phrase ""Big Lie,"" which critics have used to describe his efforts to discredit the 2020 results.
Trump's repeated false claims of election fraud have taken hold of Republican voters. Some 53% of Republicans believe Trump won the 2020 election and blame his loss on illegal voting, and one quarter of the overall public agreed that Trump won, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. 
Rally attendee Tyler Voyik, 64, said he came to the rally to show his support for Trump, who he voted for in 2016 and 2020.

Voyik lives in Ohio but spends a lot of time in Florida. He would support Trump if he got the nomination in 2024 but would prefer Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
""I think he could do better by supporting somebody else, but if he runs I’ll support him,"" Voyik said. ""If he wins the nomination I’ll support him all the way.""

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump joined video platform Rumble on Saturday, the same day he will take the stage at a campaign-style rally in Ohio, his first such event since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump lost his social media megaphone earlier this year when he was blocked by a slew of platforms after his supporters stormed the Capitol. He was permanently banned from Twitter and remains suspended by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) until at least 2023 and by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube until the company determines the risk of violence has decreased.
Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington told Reuters that joining Rumble was in addition to the former president's plan to start his own platform, rather than a replacement for this plan. Trump, who earlier this month shut down his recently-launched blog, has not given details on the proposed platform. 
""It is a great way to reach the American people in a time of unprecedented assault on free speech in our country by Big Tech tyrants,"" Harrington said in an email to Reuters. 
Rumble Chief Executive Officer Chris Pavlovski confirmed Trump's verified account had been set up on the site but declined to comment further. Trump advisor Dan Scavino tweeted that Trump's Ohio rally would be live-streamed on the platform.

Rumble, which was launched in 2013 by Canadian tech entrepreneur Pavlovski as an alternative YouTube-style site, has become popular with U.S. conservatives.
Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and J.D. Vance, the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" are investors in the platform.

The district attorney, Cyrus Vance, could announce charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, as soon as next week, the newspaper said, citing several people with knowledge of the matter.
""It looks like they are going to come down with charges against the company and that is completely outrageous,"" Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told NBC News. ""The corporate office will plead not guilty and we will make an immediate motion to dismiss the case against the corporation.""
Lawyers for the company could not immediately be reached for comment. A lawyer for Weisselberg declined to comment. Vance's office also declined to comment.
Any criminal charges would be the first in Vance's probe into Trump and his business dealings.
Vance's office had said it was investigating ""possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
Company lawyers met on Thursday with top prosecutors in Vance's office to try to persuade them not to go forward, Fischetti told NBC News.
Such meetings are common in white-collar criminal probes. The Times has said developments in the probe could increase pressure on Weisselberg to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against the former president.
Trump has not been charged and it is unclear whether charges will be brought.
Vance's probe nevertheless could complicate any return to politics by Trump, who has lost some of his ability to communicate publicly by being permanently banned from Twitter and suspended for two years by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Court filings and records subpoenaed in the investigation show that Weisselberg and his son Barry have received corporate perks and gifts worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in their years associated with the Trump Organization.
If they failed to account properly for that money on tax returns and other financial filings, they could be in legal jeopardy, legal experts have said.
New York state's attorney general, Letitia James, has also opened a criminal probe into Trump's company.
She has been investigating whether the Trump Organization inflated the values of some properties to obtain better terms on loans, and lowered their values to obtain property tax breaks.
Vance's probe began after Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen paid hush money to silence two women before the 2016 presidential election about sexual encounters with Trump that they claimed to have had.
Trump has denied the women's claims.

Court records show there is some overlap between Vance's and James' separate probes, including their focus on Seven Springs, a 212-acre (86-hectare) estate outside Manhattan that Trump bought in 1995.
James is examining the propriety of a $21.1 million tax deduction taken when Trump agreed not to develop the property, after local opposition derailed his goal of building a golf course, and a separate plan to build luxury homes was shelved.

(Reuters) - A group of Senate Republicans urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday to stop requiring fully vaccinated Americans to wear masks on public transportation, including airplanes, trains and buses but also in airports and train stations.
Roger Wicker, the most senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, and Ted Cruz, top Republican on an aviation subcommittee, along with Susan Collins, Jerry Moran, Cynthia Lummis and Marsha Blackburn introduced a resolution urging the CDC to lift mask requirements in place since Feb. 1.
""Over 150 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated and mask mandates have been lifted across the country. But the CDC inexplicably still hasn’t lifted the mask mandate for public transportation,"" Cruz said. ""It’s long past time for President Biden and the CDC to follow the science.""
The lawmakers argued the change ""would incentivize a greater number of individuals to receive the COVID–19 vaccine."" 
A CDC spokeswoman declined to comment.
In May, the CDC said fully vaccinated Americans could stop wearing masks in nearly all indoor spaces - with transportation one of the few exceptions.
The Transportation Security Administration on April 30 extended orders to enforce face mask requirements through Sept. 13.
Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing nearly 50,000 Flight Attendants at 17 airlines, said the union supported the mandate to help stop the spread of the virus and protect those who don't have access to the vaccine, such as children under 12.

Since January, the Federal Aviation Administration has received 3,100 reports of unruly behavior on airlines, including 2,350 reports of passengers refusing to comply with federal face mask requirements.
On June 10, the CDC said it would no longer require travelers to wear masks in outdoor transit hubs and in outdoor spaces on ferries, buses and trolleys but left indoor requirements unchanged.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee are preparing a $3 billion bipartisan bill to prepare for the next global health crisis, congressional aides said on Friday, trying again to pass a pandemic plan after similar efforts stalled last year.
Senators Bob Menendez and Jim Risch, the Democratic chairman and top Republican on the foreign relations panel, will introduce their International Preparedness Pandemic and COVID-19 Response Act of 2021 as soon as Monday.
The 113-page bill, seen by Reuters, stems from monthslong negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, a contrast with bitter partisan debate during the coronavirus crisis.
A similar bill introduced last year did not become law.
Aides said the senators had worked with President Joe Biden's administration on the legislation. A global health bill is also working its way through the House of Representatives, which like the Senate is narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats. 
The Senate measure would authorize $3 billion over five years for prevention and preparedness, addressing gaps in the global health system by increasing vaccine production and distribution and shoring up the U.S. pandemic defense system.
The bill encourages international cooperation and work with international organizations. It advocates for reforms at the World Health Organization, accused by some of former President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans of promoting China's ""disinformation"" about the outbreak. The WHO denies this.
It sets goals such as ensuring at least 60% of the world's population is vaccinated by the first half of 2022.

The bill notes ""it is in the security and economic interests of the United States"" to assist developing countries' recovery from the pandemic, which has killed millions of people and cratered economies around the world.
It seeks a better international early warning system for potential health crises. And it requires that intelligence agencies update congressional committees on risks posed to the United States by pathogens that could cause future pandemics.

GENEVA (Reuters) -A U.S. delegate told the World Trade Organization on Friday that he saw ""very little scope for negotiated outcomes"" ahead of a major ministerial conference set for later this year, citing the difficulties of negotiating in person among the challenges.
The meeting is set to be a critical test of Nigerian director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's leadership of the global trade body, which was facing the biggest crisis in its 25-year history before she took office in March.
Its top appeals court is paralysed after Washington under former U.S. President Donald Trump blocked judge appointments, citing the need for reforms, and it has not concluded a multilateral deal for years.
The WTO's 164 members are set to negotiate a range of topics at the meeting in November and December, the global trade watchdog's 12th such conference, including trade and the pandemic as well as agriculture and fisheries.
""While we would like to see a successful MC12, we must be pragmatic with respect to the circumstances in which we are operating,"" U.S. Charge d'Affaires David Bisbee told a members-only meeting in a statement seen by Reuters.
""There are a large number of challenging issues facing Members, these have been made all the more challenging to address due to the inability to meet in person and the absence of experts from capitals in the room,"" he added.
While the United States is just one of the Geneva-based body's 164 members which all need to agree new trade deals by consensus, in practice, it calls many of the shots. American lawyer Angela Ellard is one of four deputies of the body.

In the same speech, Bisbee repeated calls for fundamental reforms of the hobbled WTO dispute settlement system, saying the United States ""will engage constructively with members at the appropriate time"".
He also welcomed members' decision to advance negotiations on a possible patents waiver for COVID-19 vaccines. ""We are in a global health crisis and need to move urgently in this area,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Election Day should be a holiday for workers in the United States, President Joe Biden said on Thursday. 
""If I had my way, and I think it is really important, every Election Day would be a day off,"" he said because people who work certain shifts can't make it to the polls. 
Biden told reporters he plans to travel the country to push voting rights, after remarks at the White House about a bipartisan infrastructure agreement. 
""You're going to hear a lot more from the president next week on voting rights,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said later on MSNBC. ""He's going to deliver some remarks to the American people and talk a lot more about what he wants to do.""
How and when U.S. citizens can vote has become a political battleground, as Republicans issue new bills that restrict voting hours, vote-by-mail and other measures designed to bring more people to the polls. 
A sweeping Democratic bill to expand voting hours and methods failed to pass Congress this week. Making Election Day a federal holiday was proposed in at least one of version of the legislation.
Biden has not given up on federal legislation, Psaki said, and will work with Democratic leaders in Congress on next steps.
""There's also work that needs to be done out in states with activists, empowering, engaging and standing by their sides and he's going to do that,"" Psaki said.
Election Day, traditionally the second Tuesday in November in the United States, is not a federal holiday, although some states require employers to give workers time off to vote.

Federal holidays are created through congressional legislation; last week Biden signed a bill to make June 19 a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans.
Biden had sharp words for state Republicans who he said are pushing for vote recounts when they don't like how the vote turned out. ""Who in God's name, as my mother would say, died and left them boss?"" Biden asked. ""Your vote has to count when you cast it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Rudy Giuliani's New York law license was suspended on Thursday, after a state appeals court found he had lied in arguing that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from his client, former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Giuliani, 77, a former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan and New York City mayor, was punished for making ""demonstrably false and misleading"" statements that widespread voter fraud undermined the election, which Democrat Joe Biden won.
Citing the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, the Appellate Division said Giuliani's eagerness to trumpet false claims ""immediately threatens the public interest"" and could erode public confidence in the election process, a hallmark of American democracy, as well as the legal profession. 
""This country is being torn apart by continued attacks on the legitimacy of the 2020 election and of our current president, Joseph R. Biden,"" the court said.
""Where, as here, the false statements are being made by (Giuliani), acting with the authority of being an attorney, and using his large megaphone, the harm is magnified.""
Speaking to reporters outside his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a combative Giuliani called the suspension ""a one-sided decision not based on evidence.""
The Republican also blamed Democrats for his growing legal troubles, including over his dealings in Ukraine, and he said dozens of witnesses could back up his election fraud claims.
""I fight back. That's what I do,"" Giuliani said. ""I go to court and I prove what I'm telling you in court. There are appellate courts. This isn't yet a dictatorship.""
Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that he defeated Biden.
In a statement, Trump expressed disbelief that Giuliani could lose his law license for ""fighting what has already been proven to be a Fraudulent Election.""
The appeals court said Giuliani's temporary suspension could become permanent after a hearing by the attorney grievance committee that recommended it.
John Leventhal and Barry Kamins, two lawyers for Giuliani, said they were disappointed with the suspension but believed that after a hearing he would be reinstated as ""a valued member of the legal profession that he has served so well.""
'INCREDIBLY SERIOUS'
Giuliani's other legal problems include a $1.3 billion lawsuit where Dominion Voting Systems accused him of defamation for claiming its machines helped flip votes to Biden from Trump.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are separately examining Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine, including whether he violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer.
Eighteen devices, including cellphones and computers were seized in April 28 raids of Giuliani's home and office for the Ukraine probe. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.
The appeals court said Giuliani made numerous false statements about voting in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, including over the counting of absentee ballots.
It highlighted a Pennsylvania court hearing on Nov. 17 where Giuliani alleged widespread voter fraud, though his formal written complaint on Trump's behalf made no mention of it.
The court also criticized Giuliani's unsubstantiated claims of voting by dead people, including the boxing heavyweight champion Joe Frazier, who died in 2011.
""There is evidence of continuing misconduct, the underlying offense is incredibly serious, and the uncontroverted misconduct in itself will likely result in substantial permanent sanctions,"" the court said.
Though the court rejected Giuliani's claim that the grievance committee violated his free speech rights, the suspension does not muzzle his ability to speak publicly.
That contrasts with Twitter's permanent ban and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s two-year suspension of Trump from their respective platforms.
Brian Faughnan, a Tennessee lawyer specializing in attorney disciplinary proceedings, said suspensions such as Giuliani's often go to lawyers who commit crimes or stole client money.

Giuliani received his law license in 1969, and as New York City mayor won wide praise for his response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
He began representing Trump in April 2018 as federal Special Counsel Robert Mueller was probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Some 500 people have now been arrested in the sweeping federal investigation into the violence, the Justice Department said on Thursday.
Speaking at a news conference, Pelosi, a Democrat, declined to spell out a timeline for the panel to investigate, saying it will be ""as long as it takes"". She gave no details of the make-up of the panel, but made clear both parties would be expected to name members, saying she hoped that House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy will appoint ""responsible people"" to the panel.
Pelosi said it would have been preferable to have an outside commission, and that she had not totally given up on that idea. The House passed legislation to set up an independent bipartisan commission, but Senate Republicans blocked it, saying existing committee probes as well as prosecutors' investigations made it unnecessary.
""We see this as complementary, not instead of, and hopeful that there could be a commission at some point,"" Pelosi said.
In an assault that stunned America, hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.

Trump has repeatedly falsely alleged that his electoral defeat was due to voter fraud, a claim dismissed by multiple courts, state election officials and his own administration's review.
""The Capitol of the United States has always been a glorious beacon of democracy for the American people and the world,"" Pelosi said.

(Reuters) - For months, as New York City faced a growing spate of shootings, mayoral candidate Eric Adams delivered the same line at one campaign event after another: ""The prerequisite for prosperity is public safety.""
Adams' message, which included a vow to beef up subway patrols, appears to have resonated with a broad swath of New Yorkers as the United States' most populous city undertakes a tough recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and confronts deep challenges including wealth inequality and police accountability.
In initial results from Tuesday's Democratic primary election, Adams was the first choice on more than 31% of in-person ballots. That puts him nearly 10 percentage points ahead of liberal rival Maya Wiley, who has called for cutting one-sixth of the city's $6 billion police budget.
A year ago, amid widespread demonstrations across the city over police brutality and calls to ""defund the police,"" it might have been difficult to imagine a former police captain who advocated for more officers on the street emerging as the Democratic Party's preferred mayoral candidate.
But Adams was able to strike a balance between promising to reform the department and keep New Yorkers safe from crime.
His success could offer clues about where Democratic voters stand on policing issues ahead of next year's congressional midterm elections. With Republicans preparing to blame Democrats and the ""defund"" movement for a spike in homicides across U.S. cities, the Democratic Party could be forced to navigate progressive calls to reduce police budgets with combating rising crime.
On Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced a new effort to curb gun violence amid growing impatience from gun-control activists that the administration has not acted more quickly.
Shooting incidents are up nearly two-thirds over last year in New York City, from 386 through mid-June in 2020 to 634 in 2021. 
Adams' background - both as an officer and as a Black captain who spoke out against his own department's missteps - appears to have granted him credibility on the issue with voters.
""As we've seen crime and public safety dominate the conversation, he's had this insider and outsider status,"" said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University who has followed the mayoral race closely. ""He's been in law enforcement, but he's also been very critical of law enforcement."" 
WINNER UNKNOWN FOR WEEKS
The election's outcome will be determined by the city's new ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. Tuesday's results reflected only the top choices of voters who cast ballots in person.
There are at least 87,000 absentee ballots to be counted. Election officials can then tabulate voters' other ranked choices, a process expected to last until mid-July.
Since 2004, there have been only 15 ranked-choice voting elections, or 3.8%, in which the eventual winner did not lead among first-choice votes, according to Fairvote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for election reform.
The Democratic nominee will be heavily favored against Republican Curtis Sliwa, who founded the civilian safety patrol group Guardian Angels and vowed to run on a ""law-and-order"" platform.
Adams, the current Brooklyn borough president, would be the city's second Black mayor if elected in November.
During the campaign, Adams put his experience patrolling the subways as a transit officer front and center, arguing he alone among more than a dozen Democratic candidates knew how to stem the crime jeopardizing the city's nascent recovery from the pandemic.
But he also spoke of getting beaten by officers as a teenager in Queens and noted his record of calls for reform. As an officer, he co-founded a racial justice group, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, and spoke out against the department's aggressive use of stop-and-frisk, a tactic that disproportionately harassed Black men.
""As a cop, he has spoken up against police abuse; as a candidate, he has spoken up about public safety,"" said Michael Hendrix, an urban policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute. ""He's able to reconcile seemingly contradictory messages on policing.""
Adams understood the city's Democratic electorate is not as progressive as one might think, Greer said, noting that New Yorkers elected Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, both as Republicans, in recent decades.
Adams, who vowed to be a ""blue-collar mayor,"" managed to build a diverse coalition of Black and Latino voters, union members and working-class white voters, finishing well ahead of the field in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Kathryn Garcia, the former sanitation chief who ran as a technocrat and is close behind Wiley in third place, leads among voters in Manhattan.
Wiley, the favored candidate among liberal activists, attacked Adams on policing, noting that he had expressed support for reviving stop-and-frisk as well as a controversial plainclothes unit linked to numerous complaints.
Adams has said he would refocus the department on stopping illegal guns, increase diversity among high-ranking officers and prevent police abuses.

His tough-on-crime message may have seemed out of step with last summer's ""Black Lives Matter""-driven protests. But Adams on Tuesday told reform advocates that police misconduct alone is not to blame.
""If Black lives really matter, it can't only be against police abuse - it has to be against the violence that's ripping apart our communities,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday split along party lines over whether to advance the nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman, President Joe Biden's choice to lead the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).
In the lead-up to the tie vote, Republicans vocally opposed Chipman's nomination, citing his history of advocating stronger gun regulations.
""Mr. Chipman wants to ban assault weapons,"" Ranking Republican Charles Grassley said on Thursday. ""This nomination is like a Republican putting the NRA in charge of ATF,"" he said, referring to the pro-gun rights National Rifle Association.
The U.S. Senate is split evenly among Democrats and Republicans. The tie will require Senate Democrats to jump through some procedural hurdles to advance Chipman's nomination, but it is not an insurmountable roadblock. 
The job of ATF director is so politically fraught that the Senate has only confirmed one ATF director nominee in the last 15 years. The rest of the ATF's leaders served in an acting capacity, making it harder to put their stamp on lasting and meaningful policy.
""This nomination is a test. Can we put someone in charge of the ATF?"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said on Thursday.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, meanwhile, called Chipman the ""leader that ATF needs,"" citing concerns about a rising tide of gun violence in the United States.
Chipman previously worked at the ATF for nearly 25 years, but currently serves as a policy advisor for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group founded by former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Senator Mark Kelly, after a gunman shot her in 2011.
The ATF will play a vital role in Biden's pledge to crack down on a tide of rising violent crime and shootings. 

The administration is looking to regulate self-assembled ""ghost guns"" and stabilizing braces that can be attached to pistols. 
On Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged that the ATF will ramp up efforts to revoke licenses of gun dealers who fail to conduct background checks or assist law enforcement with requests to trace guns used in crimes; who falsify records or sell guns to people prohibited from owning them, or refuse to submit to the ATF's compliance inspections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said on Wednesday it had reached a deal on a ""framework"" for an infrastructure spending bill and planned to discuss it with President Joe Biden on Thursday, although cautioning that unresolved issues remained.
​ ""We came to an agreement on a plan that we have and we're just going to try to wrap it up tomorrow,"" a Democratic negotiator, Joe Manchin, said after the group met with White House officials.
The White House said the meeting had been productive. 
""The group made progress towards an outline of a potential agreement, and the president has invited the group to come to the White House tomorrow to discuss this in person,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
Biden will meet with the lawmakers before heading to Raleigh, North Carolina, to visit a mobile clinic administering COVID-19 shots.
Passing a bill to rebuild roads, bridges and other traditional infrastructure is a major priority for the Democratic president.
Biden, seeking to fuel growth and address income inequality after the coronavirus pandemic, initially proposed about $2.3 trillion be spent on a broad definition of infrastructure, including fighting climate change and providing care for children and the elderly. 
The White House trimmed the offer to about $1.7 trillion in an unsuccessful bid to win the Republican support needed for any plan to get the 60 votes required to advance most legislation in the evenly split 100-seat Senate.
After rejecting a Republican counteroffer just over two weeks ago, the White House turned its attention to the bipartisan group of 21 senators, or ""G-21.""That group has been working on a $1.2 trillion, eight-year bipartisan infrastructure plan, with a mix of new and repurposed funding. The framework now includes $559 billion in new spending, a source familiar with the talks said. Previously, the group had discussed $579 billion in new spending. 
Several members of the G-21 said a framework had been agreed upon, although some details needed to be ironed out, and Manchin said the White House had signed off on the proposal.
After meeting with the group of nine Democrats, one independent and 11 Republicans in the Senate, White House negotiators sat down with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in Congress.
The White House said Schumer, Pelosi and the White House officials discussed the importance of the so-called two track approach, which would see passage of both the compromise infrastructure bill and a separate Democrat-only budget measure to meet the ""full range"" of Biden's priorities.
'MUCH STURDIER'
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, another member of the negotiating group, said the framework was ""much sturdier"" than a previously announced one by a smaller group of 10 senators.
A major sticking point in the negotiations had been how to pay for the investments. Manchin said the framework encompassed a ""long list"" of so-called pay-fors and all new spending would be offset with provisions to cover it, but he gave no specifics.
""We have a good balanced group of pay-fors. That was important to both sides. I will say in good faith we tried to get there. We didn't agree on everything but we were able to get there,"" Republican Senator Rob Portman, another negotiator, told reporters.
Biden has pledged not to increase taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 a year, while Republicans are determined to protect a 2017 cut in corporate taxes.
After meeting with the White House officials, Schumer and Pelosi said they were supportive of the concepts included in the framework and said they hoped to hold votes on the bipartisan bill and the second Democratic-only measure in July.

Pelosi said members realized that both bills were needed, and hoped to have votes on both measures in both houses of Congress in July.
The second bill, which Democrats could pass with the help of a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris, would include significant additional spending on programs such as home healthcare for the elderly and others usually not seen as infrastructure. That maneuver would require all 48 Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them to agree.Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders is working up an ambitious infrastructure blueprint of $6 trillion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' top military officer on Wednesday hit back against a growing conservative movement opposed to teaching certain theories about racism at educational institutions, saying military university graduates should be ""open-minded and be widely read."" 
The remarks to Congress by Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not endorse critical race theory but strongly condemned a drumbeat by Republican lawmakers and pundits against it being taught.
""What is wrong with understanding -- having some situational understanding -- about the country for which we are here to defend?"" Milley asked before the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.
""And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned and noncommissioned officers, of being, 'woke' or something else, because we're studying some theories that are out there."" He was responding after a Republican, U.S. Representative Michael Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, produced a letter from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point acknowledging teaching about critical race theory.
The theory maintains that racism is ingrained in U.S. law and institutions and that legacies of slavery and segregation have created an uneven playing field for Black Americans.
Fueled by right-wing media, controversy surrounding the once-obscure theory has mushroomed into a national debate over how – and which version of - U.S. history is taught in schools. 
""This came to me from cadets, from families, from soldiers, with their alarm, with their concern, about how divisive this teaching is,"" Waltz said, adding it was rooted in Marxism.
Milley tried to respond to Waltz directly but only got the opportunity later, when a Democratic lawmaker gave him a chance.
He noted that university graduates should be aware of all kinds of theories and that just because he read about Marxism didn't make him a Communist.
""I do think it's important, actually, for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read,"" Milley said.
On the issue of racism in America, the general stressed the need for greater understanding of the driving forces behind the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, including white supremacists, who tried to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's election win.

""I want to understand white rage, and I'm white and I want to understand it,"" Milley said.
""What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind here.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday for the first time since taking a lead role in immigration issues, her office said, bowing to pressure that she make the high-profile trip.
Harris will travel to El Paso, Texas, on Friday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Harris spokeswoman Symone Sanders said.
Harris, who visited the U.S.-Mexico border many times as a senator and attorney general from California, was assailed by Republicans when she visited Mexico and Guatemala this month. She said she would go to the border eventually. 
President Joe Biden assigned her the task of addressing the root causes of migration of thousands of people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who cross the U.S. border from Mexico. 
A White House official who asked not to be named said Harris wanted to visit Guatemala and Mexico before going to the border. Since returning, she has been tied up with the vaccination awareness programs, infrastructure negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill and events tied to boosting voting rights, the official said.
""She has always said she will visit the border but it was more like when is it the right time,"" the official said. In Mexico, Harris told reporters she plans to visit the border without offering details.
Former President Donald Trump, who plans a border visit on June 30, said in a statement: ""If (Texas) Governor (Greg) Abbott and I weren’t going there next week, she would have never gone!""
The White House official said Harris's schedule is not dictated by what former President Donald Trump does. ""I can assure you we don't take our cues from the former President.""
The official said more details on Harris's trip and who she will meet is likely to be released tomorrow.
Republican lawmakers criticized the timing of Harris's visit.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Twitter that ""VP Kamala Harris should have visited the border months ago.""
""She now has a chance to see what 100+ Repubs have witnessed firsthand: the Biden admin's open-border policies have created a crisis where children are endangered, families are exploited, and drug cartels are emboldened.""
Biden, a Democrat, has moved to reverse many of the restrictive immigration policies of Trump, a Republican he defeated in the November election.
Biden also has left in place a border policy known as Title 42, expelling in five months more than 400,000 migrants detained at or near the border, including many Central American families and asylum seekers sent back to Mexico.
Publicly, the Biden administration insists the order remains necessary to limit the spread of the coronavirus, although it has yet to provide scientific data to support that rationale and many public health experts have opposed it. 

On Tuesday, a human rights group released a report that said nearly 3,300 migrants stranded in Mexico since January due to a U.S. border policy have been kidnapped, raped, trafficked or assaulted.
The report, by New York-based Human Rights First, documents cases of migrants and asylum seekers stuck in Mexico since Biden took office on Jan. 20. The number of cases has jumped in recent weeks from roughly 500 such incidents logged in April to 3,300 by mid-June.

Biden also nominated Jack Markell, the former Democratic governor of his home state of Delaware, to be the U.S. representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the White House statement said.
The pair were among 17 nominations sent to the Senate for confirmation.
McCain endorsed Biden in November's election in which the Democrat defeated Republican President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly criticized McCain's husband. John McCain died in 2018.
If confirmed to the post, she would represent the United States with the rank of ambassador at the Rome-based U.N. World Food Programme, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.N. International Fund for Agricultural Development.

McCain is chair and director of the Phoenix-based Hensley Beverage Co, which distributes wine, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages.
Other nominees included Massachusetts Democratic state Representative Claire Cronin as U.S. ambassador to Ireland and Fiona Whelan Prine, widow of the late singer-songwriter John Prime, to the National Council on the Arts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress suffered a bruising defeat in their drive to pass a major election reform bill but said there are more tools at their disposal to overcome Republican efforts in several states to roll back expanded voting procedures.
""It will be a long march but it's one we are going to make,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed after Democrats voted in lock-step https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-voting-rights-plan-faces-long-odds-us-senate-2021-06-22 on Tuesday to launch a debate on voting rights legislation - but still fell 10 votes short of advancing such a bill, thanks to the 60-vote threshold required by filibuster rules.
Given Senate Republicans' solid opposition, Schumer has a tough battle ahead. Although he did not detail next steps, there have been hints along the way.
For example, Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, this week spoke of breaking up a voting rights initiative into smaller bits that might test Republican resolve.
Democrats employed tough rhetoric to underscore how important they think it is to establish national standards for voting, before the 2022 midterm elections when Republicans seek to regain majorities in the House and Senate.
""Our American Democracy is in peril, and today, every single Senate Republican voted against saving it. Democrats will not be deterred in our fight,” House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ""Our Republic is at a crossroads, and it is up to us to save it.""
Senate Republicans have argued that Washington ought to stay out of states' decisions on how they conduct their elections for president and Congress.
Republicans have justified the new laws by citing former President Donald Trump's false claim that widespread fraud led to his November election defeat. Numerous court decisions have repudiated that claim, as did Trump's own administration. 
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told reporters on Tuesday that she is continuing to negotiate with moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin over the details of a compromise proposal he has floated.
That could become the basis for another Senate vote.
Klobuchar praised Manchin's efforts and said he has used an ""expansive definition"" of what would qualify for voter identification he wants included in a bill and has agreed to other elements important to Democrats.
Democrats also could pursue a bill that would restore Washington's oversight of certain states' changes to election laws and build a more expansive voting rights bill upon that. Some Republicans are on record as potentially supporting the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named after the late civil rights leader and Democratic congressman.
Klobuchar said after Tuesday's vote that she would launch a series of field hearings to examine the impact of Republican efforts to toughen voting laws in various states. Those hearings could help guide Schumer's decision on future moves.
Hanging over this effort will be the most controversial move Schumer could take: An attempt to change or kill the long-standing ""filibuster"" rule, which now gives minority Senate Republicans the ability to repel Democrats' legislative initiatives, as they did on Tuesday.

Under the filibuster https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-hope-voting-rights-failure-sparks-change-senate-filibuster-2021-06-22, at least 60 votes are needed in the 100-member Senate to advance legislation. 
To change the rule, all 50 Democrats and independents would have to vote yes - a step that Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema so far have opposed.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday harshly criticized Republican lawmakers for downplaying the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, questioning ""what planet"" they are living on.
Hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol that day in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer, and more than 480 people have been arrested on charges linked to the attack.
""I'm especially troubled by the accounts of some members of Congress that Jan. 6 was just a day of tourists walking through the Capitol,"" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said during a court hearing in Washington. ""I don't know what planet these people are on.""
Lamberth, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan - one of the heroes of the Republican Party - said millions of people saw what he called a ""disgrace"" to the country.
""The attempt by some congressmen to rewrite history and say this was all just tourists walking through the Capitol is just utter nonsense,"" Lamberth said.
""It was not an accident that it turned violent,"" he said of the Capitol attack. ""It was intended to draw to a halt the very functioning of our government.""
Lamberth did not name any particular legislator during his remarks, but Republican Representative Andrew Clyde last month likened the attack to a ""normal tourist visit"" during a congressional hearing.
""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos and pictures,"" Clyde said. ""If you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from January the 6th, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.""
Clyde did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Other Republican lawmakers have also downplayed the violence.
Photos from Jan. 6 showed Clyde rushing toward the door of the House of Representatives while guards with guns drawn held off rioters trying to break into the chamber.
Lamberth made his remarks during a sentencing hearing for Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, who was the first of about 500 people charged for participating in the Capitol siege to receive punishment.
Morgan-Lloyd, of Bloomfield, Indiana, agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.

Lamberth sentenced her to three years of probation.
""I went there to support and show support for President Trump, and I’m ashamed that it became a savage display of violence that day,"" Morgan-Lloyd said during the court hearing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A member of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia group pleaded guilty on Wednesday to criminal charges including conspiracy in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
The man, Graydon Young, is one of 14 members of the Oath Keepers group charged with taking part in the assault on Congress, which left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Young, a 54-year-old resident of Englewood, Florida, told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta he was pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy and one of obstructing an official proceeding. Young is the brother of Laura Steele, 52, of Thomasville, North Carolina, who also faces charges in the case.
He agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of his plea deal. Questioned by the judge about the extent of his possible cooperation, Young agreed to give grand jury testimony and to be interviewed by law enforcement investigators without his lawyers being present.
The judge did not impose a sentence at Wednesday's hearing and allowed Young to remain on bail pending a further hearing later this summer.
More than 480 people have been arrested and charged with taking part in the unrest, which saw rioters smash windows, battle police inside and outside the Capitol and sent lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence into hiding.
Another defendant, Robert Reeder, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one misdemeanor charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.
A judge on Wednesday is also scheduled to hand down the first criminal sentence to one of the Capitol rioters. Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, of Bloomfield, Indiana, agreed last month to plead guilty to a single charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Federal prosecutors have recommended three years of probation, a $500 fine, and 40 hours of community service.
The riot followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud and disrupted the formal count by Congress of electoral votes in the race.
Federal prosecutors said in court papers that Young on Dec. 22 made plans to fly from Florida to North Carolina on Jan. 4, with a return trip on Jan. 8. On Dec. 26, prosecutors said, he wrote to a Florida company engaged in firearms and combat training: ""I have joined Oath Keepers. I recommended your training to the team. To that effect, four of us would like to train with you.""
The indictment says Young and eight other indicted Oath Keepers pushed their way in a ""stack"" up the steps on the east side of the Capitol building.
The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, and ""explicitly focus"" on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.
Reeder, a 55-year-old Maryland resident, pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. He faces a maximum of six months in prison.
During a court hearing, Reeder's attorney stressed that his client ""didn't touch anything"" or ""destroy anything"" or ""physically engage in any kind of resistance"" while he was inside the Capitol.

He is due to be sentenced on Aug. 18.
Also on Wednesday, Eduard Florea, a supporter of the Proud Boys movement who was accused of keeping a large weapons cache and making social media threats related to the attack, was denied bail, despite evidence of what his lawyer said were signs of chronic kidney disease. Florea was not in Washington on Jan. 6.

Led by Representative John Curtis of Utah, the Conservative Climate Caucus includes representatives from every committee in the House with jurisdiction over climate policy. Democrats narrowly control the House.
Curtis said the group, which represents about a quarter of the Republican caucus in the House, aims to bring Republicans together to discuss using innovation and resources to cut greenhouse gas emissions while boosting prosperity. ""We do care about climate, and we already have solutions and plan to find more,"" he said. 
Some Republicans, however, have downplayed the severity of the climate change issue while others have branded it a hoax. Former President Donald Trump was dismissive of the problem as he dismantled climate policies and regulations on fossil fuels.
But some of Trump's fellow Republicans helped pass the Energy Act of 2020, which included measures to boost technologies such as carbon capture and storage and renewable energy. 
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, is hoping to push through more climate initiatives in a $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill, but Republicans in the Senate, where Democrats have effective control, have said such proposals do not count as infrastructure. If the measures do not make it into the wider bill, Democrats could look to pass climate initiatives on a party line vote in legislation through a procedure called budget reconciliation.

Conservatives are also organizing at a grass-roots level to promote what they say are private-sector solutions to climate change. Earlier this month the American Conservation Coalition, held what it billed as the country’s first conservative climate rally https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-conservatives-stake-claim-climate-activism-with-miami-rally-2021-06-05 in Miami.
The fixes being pushed by conservative activists and lawmakers include constructing more buildings out of wood, planting a trillion trees around the world, increasing use of emissions-free hydropower, and expanding research and development of advanced nuclear power.

(Reuters) - Tom Perez, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, on Wednesday announced he was running for governor in his home state of Maryland in a bid to succeed outgoing Governor Larry Hogan, a popular Republican who cannot run again because of term limits. 
In an online video announcing his candidacy, Perez vowed to build a Maryland where all residents have access to quality education, affordable healthcare and a good job. 
""My entire life has been about making government work and helping people, and that is exactly what I'll do as your governor,"" the 59-year-old said. 
Perez is the ninth Democrat to announce his candidacy for governor while two Republicans are in the running to succeed Hogan, who has served as Maryland's governor since 2015. 
Hogan, who has enjoyed high approval ratings during his tenure and the pandemic, is barred from seeking a third term.
In the five-minute video announcing his candidacy, Perez highlighted his upbringing as the son of Dominican of Republic immigrants. He touched on his work ethic, saying he had worked as a trash collector to pay for college, and portrayed himself as a family man who coached his daughter's basketball team. 
Perez served as the head of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice and as labor secretary under President Barack Obama. 

He was elected to head the Democratic National Committee in 2016 after Hillary Clinton lost a bitter race for president to Republican Donald Trump. He did not seek another term as DNC chair and served until January of this year.
Perez has also held several other federal and state government positions, including as secretary of Maryland's labor, licensing and regulation department. In May, the Venable law firm said it hired Perez as a Washington, D.C.-based partner.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Proud Boys supporter accused of keeping a large weapons cache and making social media threats tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol was denied bail on Wednesday, despite evidence of what his lawyer said were signs of chronic kidney disease.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Lois Bloom in Brooklyn said Eduard Florea ""presents a significant danger to the community,"" and should not be released into confinement at his mother's Bronx, New York home on $100,000 bond as his lawyer requested.
Florea, a 40-year-old married father of two, has been detained in a Brooklyn jail since January, when he pleaded not guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition and making online threats.
Prosecutors said an FBI search of his home in the Middle Village section of Queens found more than 900 rounds of ammunition, 72 military-style combat knives, two hatchets and two swords.
They also said Florea used the conservative platform Parler to make threats before and during the riot, including by appearing to call Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock a ""dead"" man and writing: ""It's time to unleash some violence.""
Florea was not in Washington on Jan. 6. The Proud Boys are a far-right group that has supported violence and had endorsed former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Bloom directed that a specialist see Florea within one week about his kidney problems, after his lawyers said Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center was providing ""insufficient"" medical care limited to blood and urine tests.

""Putting this off is endangering him, and he is still presumed innocent even if I'm not releasing him on bond,"" Bloom said.
More than 480 people have been charged in connection with the riot, where Trump supporters tried to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election win. Trump falsely claimed that Biden's win resulted from widespread fraud.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Police do not have unlimited authority to enter a home without a warrant when pursuing a person suspected of a minor crime, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday in a case involving a California motorist chased home by an officer for honking his horn while listening to music.
By declining to endorse a broad interpretation of police power, the justices handed a victory to the driver, Arthur Lange, who is challenging his conviction of driving under the influence after the California highway patrol officer entered his garage without a warrant and performed a sobriety test.
The court, in a 9-0 decision authored by liberal Justice Elena Kagan, sent the case back to the California Court of Appeals. The justices rejected the lower court's finding that warrants are not required in any situation in which police are in pursuit, even if the suspected crime is minor.
""The flight of a suspected misdemeanant does not always justify a warrantless entry into a home,"" Kagan wrote.
""An officer must consider all the circumstances in a pursuit case to determine whether there is a law enforcement emergency,"" Kagan added.
Although the justices were unanimous in tossing out the lower court decision, there was some disagreement among them on the law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a separate opinion joined by fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito that police should be able to complete an arrest when they are in pursuit of someone, even if the suspect enters a home.
""The Constitution does not demand this absurd and dangerous result. We should not impose it,"" Roberts wrote
Lange was confronted inside his garage by officer Aaron Weikert in 2016. The ruling did not definitively resolve whether the sobriety test evidence can be used against Lange, who argued that it was obtained in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.
The ruling was issued at a time of heightened scrutiny of police powers and use of force in the United States after several high-profile incidents in recent years involving the actions of law enforcement. Protests erupted in many cities last year against police brutality and racism.
After observing Lange driving and honking his horn, Weikert began following him and intended to stop him for violating local noise restrictions, a minor infraction that carries small fines, but did not immediately turn on the police vehicle's emergency lights, according to filings in the case.
Lange was already in his driveway when the officer caught up with him and activated his emergency lights. Weikert pulled into the driveway as Lange was driving his car into his garage. Lange later said he did not know the officer had been following him.
The garage door was just about to close when Weikert stuck his foot under the door, preventing it from shutting.
Weikert said he smelled alcohol and ordered Lange to take a sobriety test. Lange was found to be more than three times over the legal limit and was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and a noise infraction. 
Lower courts ruled against Lange, deeming the incident a ""hot pursuit"" that allowed a warrantless entry. 
Lange pleaded no contest to the DUI offense and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years of probation.

The California Court of Appeals in 2019 upheld Lange's conviction. Lange then asked the Supreme Court to rule that police officers cannot evade the warrant requirement when chasing someone to their home when the underlying conduct constitutes a misdemeanor offense. 
Under Supreme Court precedent, officers can enter a home without a warrant when they are in pursuit of a suspected felon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police captain who put public safety at the center of his campaign for New York City mayor, was leading a field of 13 Democratic candidates in Tuesday's primary election, though the outcome likely won't be known for weeks.
With 90% of the in-person votes counted, Adams had been picked as the top choice on 31% of ballots. But with at least 87,000 absentee ballots yet to be processed, and a new ranked-choice voting system in place, final results are not expected until mid-July at the earliest.
In remarks to supporters, Adams acknowledged the campaign was far from over.
""But there's something else we know: that New York City said 'Our first choice is Eric Adams',"" he said.
The winner of Tuesday's Democratic contest to succeed term-limited Mayor Bill de Blasio will be an overwhelming favorite in November's general election, given the city's heavily Democratic lean.
Tuesday's totals were enough to force a concession from former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who was in a distant fourth place.
Speaking to supporters less than two hours after polls closed, Yang, an entrepreneur whose surprisingly durable presidential run made him a national figure, said the vote count made it clear he could not prevail.
""I am a numbers guy,"" said Yang, once seen as the front-runner. ""And I am not going to be the next mayor of New York City based on upon the numbers that have come in tonight.""
The race appeared to have narrowed to a trio of candidates, all vying for the chance to lead the country's most populous city in its arduous recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Maya Wiley, the former MSNBC analyst and civil rights lawyer who emerged as the leading liberal candidate, was in second place with 22%. Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation chief who campaigned as an experienced technocrat, was at 20%.
The primary contest is the city's first mayoral campaign to use ranked-choice voting, in which voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. 
Tuesday's results only reflected the top choices for voters who cast ballots in person.
Voters also were choosing among eight Democratic candidates seeking to replace retiring Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The nominee, who will be all but guaranteed to win November's general election, would inherit Vance's criminal probe into former President Donald Trump's business empire.
The next mayor will confront deep challenges, including wealth inequality, police accountability, a lack of affordable housing and a struggling tourism industry.
The unusually fluid campaign was dominated by the issue of crime, as the city confronts a surge in shootings amid an ongoing national debate over policing. The election's outcome could help show where Democratic voters stand on the topic ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
The leading moderate candidates - Adams, Garcia and Yang - all called for increased police resources.
Wiley, by contrast, proposed cutting $1 billion from the nearly $6 billion New York police budget, redirecting the funding instead to other services, such as mental health counseling. 
Any of the top three candidates would make history: Adams as the city's second Black mayor, Garcia as the first female mayor and Wiley as the first Black female mayor.
Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol group, appeared to have won the Republican primary against businessman Fernando Mateo. 
DELAYED RESULTS
The new system of ranked-choice voting operates as a series of instant runoffs. With no candidate exceeding 50% among first-choice ballots, the candidate in last place will be eliminated, and his or her votes redistributed to the voters' second choices.
The process will repeat until there are only two candidates left, and the winner is the one with a majority of ballots.
The Board of Elections intends to announce the first round of ranked-choice results from its tabulation of in-person votes on June 29 and plans to release a second round that includes some absentee ballots a week later. Final results are expected the week of July 12, after the deadline for voters to fix, or ""cure,"" deficient ballots has passed.
At a polling station in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood, voters generally welcomed the new system, though some conceded they felt pressure to do more homework than usual to reach five choices.
""Once you sit and down and read everything, then it's actually pretty easy,"" said Meg Vasu, a 30-year-old attorney.
She ranked Wiley first after coming away impressed by her performance in the mayoral debates.
""I felt that she was the best progressive choice,"" Vasu said.
Michael Hartman, a 41-year-old lawyer, said he ranked Garcia first, in part based on endorsements by the New York Times and the New York Daily News.

""I think she is the most competent candidate,"" he said. ""She has tremendous depth of experience.""
Like some other voters, he approached his ballot strategically, ranking Wiley but leaving off Adams and Yang, whom he disliked as candidates.

With hurricane season under way and a heat wave afflicting the U.S. west, Biden told reporters that he wanted to make sure the United States is in a position to help Americans deal with severe weather.
""We're in for a tough season,"" Biden said at the start of a meeting with Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and other officials.
Biden also vowed to increase wages for federal firefighters, saying their current pay of $13 an hour was ridiculous.
""I just realized - I didn't realize this, I have to admit - that federal firefighters get paid $13 an hour. That's going to end in my administration. That's a ridiculously low salary to pay a federal firefighter.""
Biden said it was critical for the United States to be prepared and have every resource available to address flooding, wildfires and other extreme weather events. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters earlier that Biden wanted to meet with federal emergency management officials to discuss preparedness and response efforts given the onset of peak wildfire and storm season.

In a speech last week, Criswell said 2020 was one of the most active hurricane seasons in U.S. history, coupled with the pandemic, and warned that climate change would exacerbate weather conditions in the future.
""We are now getting accustomed to a ‘new normal’ while the world continues to change before our eyes,"" she said. ""Weather patterns are telling us that the 2021 hurricane and wildfire seasons could be busy again.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump may have an unlikely ally to defend him against lawsuits alleging he incited the U.S. Capitol insurrection: President Joe Biden’s Justice Department.
The Biden administration paved the way for that possibility, say constitutional scholars and lawyers in the cases, by arguing in an unrelated defamation case against Trump that presidents enjoy sweeping immunity for their comments while in office - and the right to a defense by government lawyers. Biden’s Justice Department used that rationale in a surprise decision this month to continue defending Trump in a case filed by E. Jean Carroll, who contends Trump raped her 25 years ago and then lied about it while in office, defaming her.
That decision reaffirms the position the department took under the Trump administration. And it has profound implications for several ongoing lawsuits, including one filed by two U.S. Capitol Police officers seeking to hold Trump liable for injuries they suffered defending the building in the Jan. 6 attack.
Attorney Philip Andonian said he fears the Justice Department, under the same legal rationale, will also defend Trump in a case Andonian is pursuing on behalf of U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. Swalwell alleges Trump incited the deadly Jan. 6 riot in an effort to stop Congress from performing its duty to certify Biden as the election winner. Andonian called the logic behind the department’s decision to defend Trump against Carroll’s defamation suit “alarming.”
The Justice Department appears to put no limits on immunity for speech by a sitting president on any matter considered “of public concern,” Andonian said.
The Justice Department declined to comment on whether it would use the same argument as a basis for intervening in the other lawsuits Trump faces. The White House did not respond to a request for comment but has previously said it had no role in the department’s decision on whether to defend Trump in the Carroll case or others.
Trump faces more than a dozen active investigations and lawsuits involving a wide range of matters, including sexual misconduct allegations, financial disputes and government probes into his business dealings and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But the Justice Department’s assertion of presidential immunity in the Carroll case would only be relevant to other cases involving his statements or actions while in office.
The Justice Department laid out its rationale for defending Trump in a June 7 brief in the Carroll case. After Carroll, a former magazine writer, wrote in 2019 that Trump raped her, Trump - while in office - accused her of lying and said he’d never met her. Carroll is among about two dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. The brief argues that Trump, like any president, is covered by federal laws, including the Westfall Act, that protect federal employees from being sued for actions taken as part of their jobs.
Although Trump’s remarks were “without question unnecessary and inappropriate,” the brief said, he was acting within the scope of his office when he made them. “Elected officials can – and often must – address allegations that inspire doubt about their suitability for office,” the argument says. “Speaking to the public and the press on matters of public concern is undoubtedly part of an elected official’s job.”
‘TITANIC’ LEGAL BLUNDER
One prominent constitutional scholar characterized the department’s position in the Carroll case as a blunder that will be difficult to undo.
“It would be very difficult for the Justice Department to change course now,” said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law professor and a frequent critic of Trump. “The Titanic is aimed at the iceberg.”
Tribe and other critics of the department’s position say it fails to draw obvious distinctions between a president's official conduct and matters that clearly fall outside the duties of the office. When a president says or does something illegal, they say, it does not warrant a taxpayer-financed defense by government lawyers.
Tribe served as a legal adviser for the House of Representatives’ second impeachment of Trump, in which the former president was accused - but eventually acquitted - of trying to overturn legitimate election results to retain presidential power. Tribe said it would be “outrageous” for the department to defend Trump against the lawsuits related to the U.S. Capitol riots “on the basis that fomenting a violent insurrection, as charged in those suits, fell within the president’s job description.”
Trump has denied any responsibility for the violence at the Capitol. His lawyers have said he was making political arguments, protected by the First Amendment, and not inciting people to riot.
Jesse Binnall - a private lawyer defending Trump in the Capitol Police case, the Swalwell case and at least two other ongoing suits - declined to comment on whether he will seek the department's intervention on Trump's behalf in any of those matters. Such a request would require the Justice Department to take an official position.
Binnall has echoed the Justice Department's immunity argument in briefs filed for some of those cases, but he so far has not directly requested that the department intervene in any of them.
If the Justice Department does end up defending Trump in any of the other cases pending against him, he still would be able to retain his private counsel, allowing him to protect his own interests if they diverge from those of the government.
‘MATTERS OF PUBLIC CONCERN’
While Trump was president, the Justice Department argued in the Carroll case that federal law gave him a “broad grant of immunity” against her lawsuit, adding that he was protected because he spoke about her in his role as president. A federal district court rejected that position in October, and the department filed an appeal in the waning days of Trump’s presidency. If the Justice Department wins on appeal, that would effectively end Carroll’s case against Trump.
Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, said it was “shocking” that the department would maintain the same argument under U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was appointed by Biden after the appeal was filed.
In testimony before Congress, Garland defended the position by saying the department had a duty to follow the law rather than to protect any administration. “Sometimes it means we have to make a decision about the law that we never would have made and that we strongly disagree with as a matter of policy,” he said.
The Justice Department’s appeal in the Carroll case is pending before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The outcome could have implications for at least four other federal lawsuits pending against Trump. Three of them seek to hold Trump liable for remarks in a speech on Jan. 6 shortly before the Capitol riots. They include the case filed by injured Capitol Police officers, as well as the cases filed by Representative Swalwell and U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat. Thompson alleges that Trump violated federal law by inciting his supporters to block Congress from executing its official duties.
The fourth case was filed by the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, an advocacy group for low-income people. The lawsuit claims Trump disenfranchised Black voters by trying overturn the results in Detroit, a majority Black city, after the 2020 election.
Andonian, the lawyer in Congressman Swalwell's suit against Trump, said he fully expects that Trump’s lawyers now will adopt the Justice Department's reasoning to argue that the former president was speaking on “matters of public concern” in his Jan. 6 speech. Trump that day continued his false claims that the election had been stolen from him through voter fraud; assailed Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win; and called for his supporters to march to the Capitol.
Andonian and other attorneys argue there’s a legal distinction between Trump’s attacks on Carroll and his incendiary speeches seeking to reverse his election loss. 
Ben Berwick, a lawyer representing the Capitol police officers, said that Trump’s appearance at the Jan. 6 gathering just before the Capitol insurrection amounted to a “campaign rally” unrelated to his official duties. That’s a different setting, he said, than the presidential news conference where Trump made the statements about Carroll.
“He is effectively acting as a candidate,” Berwick said. “He has no official role in the certification of electoral votes.”

Joseph Sellers, an attorney representing Congressman Thompson in his suit against Trump, concurred that Trump had stepped well beyond the cover of presidential immunity.
“I don't think anyone would think it's within the scope of the president’s legitimate duties to encourage people to interfere with the functioning of another branch of government,” Sellers said. “He was promoting an insurrection and a riot.”

(Reuters) -Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and civil rights lawyer, was leading the Democratic nominating contest for Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday, putting him in position to become the first Black person to lead one of the country's highest-profile prosecutor's offices.
With 96% of results reported, Bragg held 34% of the vote by registered Democrats, leading his main rival, former federal prosecutor and former Justice Department official Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who was in second place at 30%.
Six other candidates trailed far behind.
Given Manhattan's heavily Democratic lean, the winner of the primary is almost assured of prevailing in November's general election against Republican Thomas Kenniff, a former Westchester County prosecutor and Iraq War veteran who ran unopposed for his party's nomination.
The next district attorney will likely inherit the office's ongoing criminal probe into former President Donald Trump's business empire, which was initiated in 2018 under the retiring Cyrus Vance Jr.
The new prosecutor will also have to navigate a national debate over criminal justice, race and civil rights, even as the city faces an upswing in crime that has put public safety at the center of Tuesday's mayoral election.
Bragg, who won endorsements from progressives such as Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL), Boston's district attorney, has tried to strike a balance between preserving civil liberties and protecting public safety.
Weinstein, who is seen as more moderate than most of the other candidates, had the backing of former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. She raised far more campaign funds than any other candidate, thanks to her ties to Wall Street via her husband, the hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein.
A win for either Bragg or Weinstein would mark a historic first: there has never been a Black or a female Manhattan district attorney.
Turnover in the office is unusual; the next district attorney will be only the third in nearly 50 years. The Manhattan district attorney's office employs 500 lawyers and has an annual budget of around $125 million. Thanks to Wall Street's location in Manhattan, the office oversees a wide range of financial crimes.
Unlike the mayoral election, voters did not use a ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference.
There are more than 27,000 absentee ballots still to be counted, according to the city elections board.
TRUMP PROBE
The candidates largely refrained from offering specific thoughts on the Trump investigation. But Bragg often reminded voters on the campaign trail that he helped sue the Trump administration ""more than a hundred times"" as a deputy in the New York state attorney general's office.
In an interview with Reuters earlier this year, Weinstein said, ""Nobody is above the law, no matter who you are or what office you went on to occupy.""
Whoever prevails is likely to become a target for Trump, who has dismissed the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and attacked Vance personally.
The winner will also have the opportunity to alter prosecutorial policies in the country's biggest city, following last year's widespread protests over policing and racial injustice.
Most of the candidates have vowed to prosecute fewer low-level crimes as part of a broader effort to address racial bias.
Bragg told Reuters earlier this year that more than 80% of the city's criminal docket consists of misdemeanors or lesser crimes.

""We need to drastically shrink that footprint,"" he said. ""Many of those cases have absolutely nothing to do with public safety.""
Weinstein also said she would shrink the number of cases by declining to prosecute those that do not advance public safety. But she also said she would use resources to ensure New Yorkers are safe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a major break from his predecessors, said on Tuesday that he backed removing the prosecution of sexual assault and other related crimes from the military's chain of command.
Advocates and lawmakers have been calling for years for the military commanders to be taken out of the decision-making process when it comes to prosecuting sexual assault cases, arguing that they are inclined to overlook the issue.
Sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military is largely underreported and the Pentagon's handling of it has come under renewed scrutiny.
""We will work with Congress to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice, removing the prosecution of sexual assaults and related crimes from the military chain of command,"" Austin said in a statement, becoming the first defense secretary to support such a move. 
Austin said he also backed removing other related crimes, such as domestic violence, from the military chain of command. 
He said he would brief President Joe Biden on the recommendation from an independent commission on sexual assault established by the Pentagon. The panel made the recommendations that Austin endorsed.
""As I made clear on my first full day in office, this is a leadership issue. And we will lead. Our people depend upon it. They deserve nothing less,"" Austin said.
There are still questions about what precisely Austin means by working with Congress to make changes and how long it would take to remove the cases from the chain of command without legislation forcing it.
""It is a massive step forward but we still have a ways to go,"" said Don Christensen, president of the Protect Our Defenders advocacy group.
A 2018 Pentagon survey estimated that 20,500 male and female service members experienced some kind of sexual assault that year.
Senior military officials, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Mark Milley, have acknowledged failings in addressing sexual assault in the ranks.
But they have stopped short of endorsing moves to remove the prosecution of such cases from military commanders and argue that preserving commanders' authority over prosecutions is vital to maintaining discipline.
Austin's statement was issued on the same day a senior lawmaker released letters from members of the Pentagon's top brass in which they voiced deep concern over legislation supported by most U.S. senators that would overhaul the military justice system for crimes like sexual assault.
Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has spearheaded the bill to remove military commanders from decisions on pursuing sexual assault cases, but her bill would also do the same for other major crimes, turning such decisions over to trained prosecutors.

In their letters, the military chiefs of the different services said that Gillibrand's bill was too broad and could affect readiness, trust and unit cohesion. 
The bill, which has 64 co-sponsors, is being blocked from consideration on the floor of the Senate by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -After a failed vote on U.S. election reform, some congressional Democrats say they hope that defeat may provide the opportunity to scrap the filibuster https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-senate-filibuster-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-2021-03-10 rule that allows the minority in the Senate to block most legislation. 
The Senate took a procedural vote https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-voting-rights-plan-faces-long-odds-us-senate-2021-06-22 on Tuesday on a sweeping election overhaul bill which they say contains needed measures to counteract laws passed in states that make it harder to vote. 
It was defeated in a 50-50 party-line vote, due to the Senate filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to pass most bills.
""Now is the time for majority rule in the Senate. We must end the filibuster, pass sweeping voting rights legislation, and protect our democracy,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, after the vote.
Activists and many Democratic lawmakers say reforming or scrapping the filibuster is necessary to pass legislation to move forward on key parts of President Joe Biden's agenda, including on voting rights. 
""It's an important step today to get every senator on record about willingness to talk about protecting our democracy. And if that fails, then the Democrats are going to have to talk about what the next path forward is,"" said Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren ahead of the vote.
Two moderate Democratic senators - Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin - have publicly stated they would oppose efforts to end it.
""The filibuster compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy poles,"" Sinema wrote in an opinion column defending the filibuster published in The Washington Post on Tuesday. 

Manchin is the only Senate Democrat who has not cosponsored the ""For the People Act,"" the party's flagship voting bill. Instead, he released a memo of changes to election law that he would support, including mandating 15 days of early voting, automatic registration and making Election Day a public holiday.
""We'll keep talking and we'll keep working with them. We can't give up. We really can't,"" Manchin told reporters as the Senate voted. ""We've got to come together. This is too important to do alone, too important to do alone.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans want to make it easier to vote but most adults also favor strict voter identification laws and remain concerned about election fraud, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.
The latest poll, conducted June 11-17, shows that both Democrats and Republicans can claim some degree of popular support as they debate sweeping changes to the way elections are held. 
Republican-controlled state legislatures have rolled out a series of voting restrictions this year, including limits on early voting hours and tougher ID requirements. Republicans say their efforts are focused on preventing election fraud, even though there was no evidence of widespread fraud in last year's election.
Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to counter that with federal protections that would guarantee a minimum number of early voting days, automatic voter registration, and less restrictive voter identification requirements, for example. 
The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a Democrat-backed election reform bill on Tuesday.
The June poll found that 59% of adults, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans alike, oppose election laws that would cut back on early voting. 
States that automatically send voters ballots by mail are also relatively popular: 46% of Americans said they approve of them, while 37% are in opposition. The responses were divided along party lines, however, with 70% of Democrats in support of automatic mail-in ballots and 64% of Republicans in opposition.
The poll also showed Americans largely back some restrictions that Republicans have said would protect the integrity of future elections: 72% said they support requirements that prohibit voting without government identification, including 62% of Democrats and 88% of Republicans. 
And 55% of Americans support measures that require local election officials to obtain approval from the state legislature before they could set their own voting plans, while 21% were in opposition. 

Americans expressed similar opinions last month. A Reuters/Ipsos survey from May showed that 75% adults felt it was ""very"" or ""somewhat"" important that ""the government place new limits on voting to protect elections from fraud"". At the same time, 82% wanted the government to ""make it easier for people to vote"".
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,420 adults, including 2,015 Democrats and 1,583 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 3 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Tuesday he is reviewing the Justice Department's federal death penalty policies and he expects to issue a statement when his review is complete.
""I said at my confirmation hearing that I have concerns about the death penalty ...and I'm concerned about disparate impact on Black Americans,"" Garland told reporters at the Justice Department.
""I have been personally reviewing the processes of the department with respect to the death penalty,"" he said, adding he expects to issue a statement soon on the issue, without giving a timeline.
The Biden administration has faced increasing pressure from criminal justice advocates to return to a long-standing moratorium on the federal death penalty, after the Trump administration in its waning final months carried out 13 executions.
President Joe Biden pledged during his campaign to support legislation to end the death penalty, and Garland has previously said he has concerns about the practice. 
To date, however, the Biden administration has not taken any steps to curtail its use, and in fact the Justice Department last week urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted in the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
In response last week, that White House acknowledged that the Justice Department should be able to make its own decisions on such criminal cases, although a spokesman said Biden is opposed to carrying out any federal executions.
Garland declined to comment about the department's position on the Tsarnaev case ""for the obvious reason that it is in litigation"".
Tuesday marked the first time that Garland has fielded questions from reporters at the Justice Department since he was sworn into his post in March.
Although he has since reversed course on a number of President Trump's controversial policies, he has also faced criticism from some Democrats for continuing to back some of the legal positions taken by the Trump administration in pending litigation.
One such example was the department's decision to continue to defend Trump against a lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, a writer who accused Trump of raping her decades ago and defaming her during his presidency.

Garland said on Tuesday the department regards Trump's comments about Carroll as ""rude and disrespectful"" but noted that ""defamatory statements by a public official to the press"" are covered under a law protecting federal employees from civil claims while acting in their official capacities.
He also pledged to protect the free press, after news came to light that the Trump administration had secretly secured data on members of Congress, journalists and a former White House lawyer as part of leak investigations.

(Reuters) - The participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol nicknamed the ""QAnon Shaman"" for his horned headdress argued through a lawyer on Tuesday that all Americans - and disinformation - are to blame for the deadly violence.
Jacob Chansley of Arizona is currently in federal custody awaiting trial on six criminal charges including violent entry and disorderly conduct.
He was one of hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election. Five people including a Capitol Police officer died in the violence.
In a court filing seeking Chansley's release from jail while he awaits trial, his lawyer, Albert Watkins, said the attack was the direct result of the divisive U.S. political climate.
Watkins said his client has become ""inextricably and in perpetuity linked to an event which will become known not as a day of infamy, but as a day on which our nation was compelled to commence bellying up to the bar to acknowledge each of our roles in permitting, fostering, tolerating, endorsing or ignoring without action an ever increasing barrage of divisiveness, intolerance, untruths, misrepresentations, and mischaracterizations through an unrelenting multi-year propaganda odyssey.""
Watkins said in an interview that his client was swayed by online disinformation and by Trump's rhetoric.

On June 10, federal agents transferred Chansley to a prison in Colorado where he will undergo a mental health evaluation to assess his competency to stand trial, according to a June 16 court filing submitted by federal prosecutors.
Watkins argued in Tuesday's court filing that prosecutors have intentionally ignored evidence that Chansley was not a leader of the Jan. 6 attack.

430,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Connecticut on Tuesday joined 17 other U.S. states in legalizing adult recreational use of marijuana as Governor Ned Lamont signed a bill that he said would also help heal economic scars left by the war on drugs.
The marijuana measure, which takes effect on July 1, would automatically erase many criminal convictions and would set up a regulatory structure that would direct opportunities and revenue toward communities hard-hit by its prohibition. 
“For decades, the war on cannabis caused injustices and created disparities while doing little to protect public health and safety,” Lamont said in a statement.
Parts of the measure largely mirror a legalization bill signed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in March, which required that largely non-white communities that bore the brunt of drug enforcement efforts get a share of marijuana sales licenses and a share of the tax money it generates.
Noting that some surrounding states had already legalized recreational use of the drug, Lamont said, ""we’re not only effectively modernizing our laws and addressing inequities, we’re keeping Connecticut economically competitive.""
Marijuana has been legally available for sale in neighboring Massachusetts for more than two years.
""Regulating cannabis, rather than criminalizing it, has proven to be a superior public policy - which is why more and more states are rapidly moving in this direction,"" Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORMAL, which advocates for abolition of marijuana laws, said in a statement.
The legalization movement has gained momentum this year as five state legislatures, including Connecticut's, have approved the drug's recreational use, most recently in Virginia, where the law also takes effect on July 1.

Connecticut, whose law allows for personal cultivation of marijuana plants in 2023, becomes the 18th state to approve legalization. Voters in a 19th state, South Dakota, approved legalization last year, but a legal challenge to the measure is now pending before the state Supreme Court. 
Marijuana, which remains prohibited by federal law, has been approved for medical use in 36 states, including Connecticut.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is launching a new strike force aimed at cracking down on illegal firearms trafficking, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Tuesday.
The strike force will be focused on reducing violent crime by targeting activity in ""significant gun trafficking corridors"" including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Monaco said during an event sponsored by the Police Executive Research Forum.
The announcement came as President Joe Biden prepared to deliver a speech on crime on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said he would ""lay out a comprehensive strategy to address violent crime and gun violence as we enter the summer months.""
Monaco said U.S. Attorney's offices in the targeted areas will coordinate with federal, state and local law enforcement to focus on ""where the guns are originating, where they're used in violent crime... and going after the entire network.""
As of June 22, the United States has seen 297 mass shootings, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, and local police departments in some major cities across the country have reported spikes in homicides.

Later this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on whether to support the confirmation of David Chipman, Biden's pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
The department plans to make additional announcements on Wednesday about how it intends to tackle violent crime, Monaco said.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had been due to debate and vote on the repeal at a meeting on Tuesday, but its chairman, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, said he had arranged a briefing for committee members in July after the Republicans' request.
""We will all have an opportunity to hear directly from the administration and to question State and Defense Department officials concerning the proposed repeal,"" Menendez said during a committee meeting.
The House of Representatives has already approved the repeal, and President Joe Biden has said he supports it. 
The Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. That authority has shifted to the president, however, due to the ""forever war"" Authorizations for the Use of Military Force, or AUMFs, which do not expire - including the 2002 Iraq AUMF - passed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Repeal proponents say it is time to rein in outdated authorities that presidents from both parties have used for a wide range of international military action without congressional approval during the past two decades. 
Opponents worry that repeal could dangerously limit presidential powers and send the message that the United States is pulling back from the Middle East.

As they bring it to the U.S. Senate floor on Tuesday, they have a hard road ahead - top Republicans are dead set against the move and not even all Democrats are in agreement. 
Moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin introduced a proposal last week as a narrower alternative to the sweeping ""For the People Act."" The White House and voting-rights activist and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams praised Manchin's ideas, which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately condemned.
Here are some details of the two approaches:
SIMILARITIES:
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Both include the Honest Ads Act and DISCLOSE Act, which contain measures such as requiring super PACs - political action committees - and other organizations that spend money in elections and judicial nominations to disclose donors who contribute more than $10,000, and direct online platforms to implement actions to prevent foreign nationals from directly or indirectly purchasing political ads.
EXECUTIVE BRANCH
Both plans require the president and vice president to disclose their individual tax returns and certain business tax returns. They also both mandate the president and vice president to divest financial interests that pose a conflict of interest or disclose information about their business interests within 30 days of taking office.
EARLY VOTING
Both Manchin and the Senate bill require 15 consecutive days for early voting. Manchin's framework mandates that the early voting period includes two weekends.
OVERLAP:
REGISTRATION
Both plans require automatic voter registration, with Manchin's proposal requiring it to be done through the Department of Motor Vehicles, with the option to opt out.
GERRYMANDERING
The Senate bill requires states to set up an independent commission to handle congressional redistricting. Manchin's proposal bans partisan gerrymandering and calls for the use of computer models.
DIFFERENCES:
ELECTION DAY
Manchin's proposals include making Election Day a federal holiday, which is not included in the Senate version of the bill.
VOTER IDENTIFICATION
The Senate bill bars states from requiring applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and allows voters to show sworn affidavits instead of presenting photo identification. 
Manchin's proposal requires voter identification but allows some alternatives, like the use of a utility bill, to prove a voter's eligibility to cast a ballot.
VOTING BY MAIL
The Senate bill prohibits states from imposing restrictions on an individual's ability to vote by mail. Manchin's proposal would require states to send absentee mail ballots ""due to eligible circumstance."" It does not elaborate on what such circumstances would be.
THINGS IN SENATE BILL THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN MANCHIN'S PROPOSAL:
- Prohibition of states' denying citizens the right to vote because of a criminal conviction and requirement for incarcerated individuals' former residences to be used for redistricting purposes, instead of a prison.
- Requirement of the use of secured ballot drop boxes and the barring of restrictions on curbside voting, both practices that were used in states during the 2020 election as the coronavirus pandemic raged.

- Ban on lawmakers from serving on the boards of for-profit entities.
- Establishment of a system in which small-dollar donations up to $200 for certain candidates are matched by six times the amount of public funds, financed with a surcharge on some criminal fines and penalties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's Justice Department is urging Congress to pass legislation to permanently end the sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder, a policy that has led to the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans across the United States.
In written testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department lambasted the ""unwarranted racial disparities"" that have resulted from the differences in how drug offenses involving crack and powder cocaine are treated under current law, and said the misguided policy was ""based on misinformation about the pharmacology of cocaine and its effects.""
""We believe it is long past time to end the disparity in sentencing policy between federal offenses involving crack cocaine and those involving powder cocaine,"" the department wrote, noting that as of March 2021, U.S. Sentencing Commission data showed that 87.5 percent of the people serving federal prison time for drug trafficking offenses primarily involving crack cocaine were Black.
The testimony was released late Monday, ahead of a Tuesday hearing where lawmakers will hear from experts about proposed legislation known as the EQUAL Act, short for Eliminating a Quantifiably Unjust Application of the Law.
The disparities between crack and powder cocaine date back to war-on-drugs policies in the 1980s. 
In 1986, Congress passed a law to establish mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking offenses, which treated crack and cocaine powder offenses using a 100 to 1 ratio. Under that formula, a person convicted for selling 5 grams of crack cocaine was treated the same as someone who sold 500 grams of powder cocaine.
The 100 to 1 ratio was later reduced in 2010 under the Fair Sentencing Act, down to 18 to 1. 
In 2018 during the Trump administration, Congress passed the First Step Act, which sought to help more lower-level crack cocaine offenders take advantage of the less stringent ratio and apply retroactively for sentence reductions.
But in a blow to criminal justice reform advocates, the Supreme Court last week ruled that low-level crack cocaine offenders could not retroactively apply to have their sentences reduced.
In its testimony, the Justice Department urges Congress to ensure that the EQUAL Act, unlike the previous laws, be applied retroactively.

""We support retroactivity because it is the right thing to do,"" the department said.

The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, says the contract was improperly terminated by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration.
The Trump Organization has managed the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx borough since it opened in 2015.
""De Blasio had a had a pre-existing, politically-based predisposition to terminate Trump-related contracts, and the City used the events of January 6, 2021 as a pretext to do so,"" according to the lawsuit.
New York City did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, interrupting the formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. The rampage came after Trump gave an incendiary speech to his followers, repeating false claims of a stolen election. 
The Trump Organization says the city, in ending the contract, cited the unlikelihood of the company being able to attract a professional tournament to the golf course following the negative publicity surrounding the Capitol riot.

The Trump Organization says the contract did not require it to attract tournaments.
After the attack on the Capitol, the city also ended contracts with the Trump Organization to run two skating rinks and a carousel in Central Park.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The attorneys general of 20 states have asked the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission to reject plans to slow down some first-class deliveries, saying allowing that to happen could harm local governments' ability to fulfill essential functions.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy proposed in March to revise existing one- to three-day service standards for first-class mail letters to one to five days as part of a plan to cut $160 billion in predicted red ink over the next decade.
The USPS said 61% of current first-class mail volume would stay at its current standard.
The state attorneys general, led by New York, and joined by the District of Columbia, the city of New York and San Francisco, called on the commission to urge the USPS to ""abandon this misguided effort and instead focus its attention on improving its performance in delivering First-Class Mail and other market-dominant products.""
In formal comments submitted to the commission, the states said the proposal would harm the ability of states and cities ""to fulfill essential government functions... (USPS) plan sacrifices speed for reliability, slowing down a significant portion of mail.""
USPS has also proposed hiking postage prices for most mail by 7%. Earlier this month, a coalition of retailers, newspapers, printers, greeting card companies and others opposed the plan.
USPS said price hikes are needed because over the past decade, mail volume has declined by 46 billion pieces, or 28%, while single piece first-class mail has declined 47%.
The plan would hike first-class postage by 3 cents to 58 cents. DeJoy also proposed cutting some retail hours and closing some locations.
In May, a bipartisan group of 20 U.S. senators introduced legislation to provide USPS with $46 billion in financial relief over 10 years.

The legislation would eliminate a requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for 75 years and require postal employees to enroll in the Medicare government-retiree health plan.
USPS has struggled with poor delivery performance over the past year, facing a huge boost in packages and staffing issues due to the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will pursue other initiatives to boost voting rights even if a contentious federal bill to counter state voting restrictions passes the Senate, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. 
Democrats in the Senate this week will try to advance legislation setting new national election standards, seeking to counter voting-rights rollbacks at the state level. Republican-controlled legislatures are pursuing these in presidential election swing states liked Pennsylvania, Florida and Arizona.
""Even if the voting rights bill was sailing across the finish line with support of every member of Congress, there would still be more to be done,"" Psaki said. ""So again this is not the end of our effort, this in some ways is the beginning."" 
Senate Democrats spent the weekend trying to finalize a bill that could win the support of all 50 Democrats and independents in the 100-member chamber. Republicans showed no signs of joining an effort that would expand voting by mail and change the way congressional districts are drawn in an effort to prevent them from being defined along partisan lines.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled a procedural vote for Tuesday to let the Senate begin debating an election reform bill.
President Joe Biden is appreciative of the efforts by Senator Joe Manchin to push the voting rights bill forward, Psaki said.
Manchin, a moderate Democratic senator, opposes a broader bill passed by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives in March and offered his own election reform ideas last week.

Psaki said failure to pass the voting rights legislation would prompt new consideration of the legislative ""filibuster"" rule, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.
Democrats could try to scrap or modify the rule, leaving Republicans powerless if the Senate's 48 Democrats and two independents stick together.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Senate this week will try to advance legislation setting new national election standards, seeking to counter voting-rights rollbacks that Republican legislatures are pursuing across the country.
Senate Democrats spent the weekend trying to finalize a bill that could win the support of all 50 Democrats and independents in the 100-member chamber, even as Republicans showed no signs of joining an effort that would expand voting by mail and change the way congressional districts are drawn in an effort to prevent them from being designed along partisan lines.
If the Democrats' effort sputters this week and no further negotiations succeed, it could allow new, restrictive voting rules in some Republican-led states to stand, unless they are struck down in court challenges.
But it also could embolden Democrats to try to scrap or modify the Senate's long-standing ""filibuster"" rule requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation. Such a move could leave Republicans powerless if the Senate's 48 Democrats and two independents stick together, given that Vice President Kamala Harris, also a Democrat, has the power to break 50-50 ties.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled a procedural vote for Tuesday to let the Senate begin debating an election reform bill.
""We are working to come up with an agreement to compromise with Joe Manchin,"" Schumer told reporters on Sunday.
Manchin, a moderate Democratic senator, opposes a broader bill passed by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives in March, and offered his own election reform ideas last week.
But with Senate Republicans poised to withhold their support, Schumer is unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to begin debate on a bill.
The Democratic-led push for federal voting rights legislation comes as Republican legislatures in politically pivotal states such as Georgia, Florida and Iowa passed sweeping voting restrictions following former President Donald Trump's defeat last November and his unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.
Democrats and voting rights advocates have sued state officials over the new laws, saying they will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color, who helped propel Democratic President Joe Biden to victory last November.
'FEDERAL TAKEOVER'
Republican lawmakers on Sunday reiterated their strong opposition to Democrats' federal election proposals. 
Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), interviewed on ""Fox News Sunday,"" called the House bill ""the biggest power grab in the history of the country,"" while Senator Rob Portman denounced what he called ""a federal takeover of our election system"" from the states, in an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
If Schumer can win over all 50 of his senators, including Manchin, he will be able to take his argument to the country that Republicans alone stymied a voting reform debate in the aftermath of efforts by Trump to overturn his election loss.

The 2020 presidential election saw the largest total turnout in U.S. history, as states temporarily opened up voting procedures, such as extended hours for casting ballots in person and expanded opportunities for mail-in voting because of the coronavirus pandemic raging at the time.
Many Republicans are trying to roll back those provisions, citing the need to improve election security. Dozens of judges rejected lawsuits asserting voting irregularities, and election officials across the country have said last year's vote was safe and secure.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fundraising arm of the Republican Party raised less money in May than its Democratic counterpart but spent more, shelling out millions on efforts to win back Congress, as well as $175,900 at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
Disclosures filed on Sunday with the Federal Election Commission showed the Republican National Committee raised $11.1 million last month, just below the $12.1 million raised by the Democratic National Committee.
The RNC spent nearly $23 million during the month, more than twice what it raised, transferring $10 million to party committees that support candidates as the party prepares for next year's congressional elections.
The DNC, by comparison, spent just under $9 million, including $200,000 on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for online fundraising. U.S. politicians use Facebook ads to reach small donors, who are an important source of campaign cash.
Democrats have narrow majorities in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, and losing control of either in the November 2022 contests would be a blow to Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.

A Republican Party spokesperson said the $175,900 spent at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, was to pay for the resort hosting part of an April retreat for Republican donors.
Both parties said their hauls were the highest ever for a May following a presidential election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Saturday announced the passing of their German shepherd Champ, who they called a ""constant, cherished companion"" for 13 years.
""In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion. We love our sweet, good boy and will miss him always,"" the Bidens said in a statement.
Champ was one of two German shepherds living at the White House with the president and first lady. Biden got Champ in 2008, the year he was elected vice president under President Barack Obama. 
Champ lived alongside Major, who the Bidens adopted in November 2018 and became the first rescue dog to live in the White House. Major had to be briefly removed from the premises after two incidents of nipping staff on White House grounds.
Major returned to the White House in April after being sent to an off-site training so he could adjust to life in the White House.
The arrival of Champ and Major marked the return of pets to the White House after a four-year hiatus under former President Donald Trump, who was the first president since Andrew Johnson in the 1860s not to share the presidential digs with a dog or a cat.
Champ lived with the Bidens when the current president served as vice president and spent his days, ""chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory."" 

""Even as Champ's strength waned in his last months, when we came into a room, he would immediately pull himself up, his tail always wagging, and nuzzle us for an ear scratch or a belly rub,"" the statement said. 
The Bidens have also addressed the idea of getting a cat. ""She is waiting in the wings,"" Jill Biden said in April.

(Reuters) -A divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops announced on Friday that they had voted to draft a statement on Holy Communion that may admonish Catholic politicians, including President Joe Biden, who support abortion rights.
The 168-55 decision to draft a teaching document on the Eucharist, a holy sacrament in the Roman Catholic faith, came after two hours of debate at the virtual assembly of the United States Catholic Bishops' Conference on Thursday, in which the bishops weighed the merits of reaffirming church teachings against the possibility of sowing partisan division.
The debate this week laid bare some of the cultural and political rifts that have rocked the church in the last several years. U.S. Catholic Church membership has dropped nearly 20% in the past two decades, according to a Gallup poll in March, as sexual abuse scandals involving predatory priests have come to light and members have become increasingly divided on social issues.
The bishops in favor of drafting the document insisted on Thursday that it would not call out any individual politician by name, but the topic of Biden's social views came up repeatedly in the discussion. Biden, the second Catholic to serve as U.S. president, has alarmed many bishops by supporting same-sex marriage and abortion rights, views they say are antithetical to church doctrine. 
Some bishops want to block politicians with views like Biden's from receiving Communion. But any statement would serve as guidance, and individual bishops would be able to make an independent choice. 
Asked on Friday if he was concerned by the bishops' decision and if he would be blocked from participating in Holy Communion, Biden said, ""That's a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen."" 
Biden attends Catholic mass each weekend. The president has said he personally opposes abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. He did not keep a Hyde Amendment ban on federal funds for abortions in his first budget presented earlier this year.
Some bishops advocating for drafting the document argued they had an obligation to clarify the church's teachings for all Catholics in light of inconsistencies in the faith and actions of public officials like Biden. 
""Almost daily I speak with people, Catholics...who are confused by the fact that we have a president who professes devout Catholicism and yet advances the most radical pro-abortion agenda in our history,"" said Bishop Donald Hying of Madison, Wisconsin, who supported drafting the document. 
Opponents said they feared writing the document could sow further partisan division within the church, and that the bishops should take more time to discuss the issue before moving forward. 
A Vatican official, Cardinal Luis Ladaria, wrote to the conference in May urging caution on the debate over politicians' abortion views and Communion, saying it could become a ""source of discord,"" Catholic News Service reported.
Bishop Robert McElroy of San Diego argued against the drafting of the document, saying the move would run counter to the bishops' goal of uniting Catholics through the sacrament. 
""The Eucharist...will inevitably become a tool in the vicious partisan turmoil that roils our nation,"" he said.
Exit polls from the 2020 presidential election showed the Catholic vote nearly split between Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump.
CATHOLIC DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS
According to a Pew Research poll from 2019, about 56% of Catholics said they thought abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
Sixty Catholic Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives released a statement on Friday urging the church not to deny elected officials Communion over one issue.
""The Sacrament of Holy Communion is central to the life of practicing Catholics, and the weaponization of the Eucharist to Democratic lawmakers for their support of a woman’s safe and legal access to abortion is contradictory,"" they said. 

The conference's Committee on Doctrine is now expected to draft the document ahead of a November meeting when the bishops will review an amendable draft.
In 2004, the conference published a statement that said individual bishops could decide whether to deny Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump on Friday endorsed Republican challenger Kelly Tshibaka against Senator Lisa Murkowski, the three-term Republican incumbent who voted to convict him after his second impeachment trial earlier this year.
Tshibaka, the former state administration commissioner, launched her campaign in March with a vow to defeat Murkowski in the 2022 election and has already enlisted the help of former Trump advisers.
""Lisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Murkowski has got to go! Kelly Tshibaka is the candidate who can beat Murkowski - and she will.""
Trump also said he would campaign for Tshibaka in Alaska.
A Murkowski spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. 
Murkowski, 64, was appointed in 2002 and is seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate. She lost her Republican primary in 2010 to a Tea Party candidate but mounted a successful write-in campaign in that year's general election.
Next year, she and Tshibaka would run against all Senate candidates in an open, all-party primary.
Republicans are hoping to reclaim their Senate majority, which they lost with the defeat of two Georgia incumbents in a pair of January runoff elections. Many Republicans blame the double upset on intraparty divisions sown by Trump's failed drive to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential victory. 

""I am honored and grateful to have the support of the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump,"" Tshibaka tweeted. She also used Trump's endorsement to solicit money for her campaign. 
Murkowski voted to convict Trump of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, in which his supporters attacked Congress in an effort to stop certification of the 2020 election. The Alaska Republican Party later censured Murkowski and pledged to recruit a challenger to oppose her.

Juneteenth, long a regional holiday in the U.S. South, was given a national spotlight following protests in 2020 over police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans. 
WHAT IS JUNETEENTH?
Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865, after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War, when a Union general arrived in Texas to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. 
In 1980, Texas officially declared it a holiday. By June 2021, it was recognized in 48 other states and the District of Columbia. Rules regarding holidays and days of observance vary from state to state, according to the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, which campaigned for years for Juneteenth to reach federal holiday status. 
These states observe it as a paid holiday: Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington state. Ohio announced Thursday that it, too, would give state employees a paid day off on Friday. 
Although in part a celebration, the day is observed solemnly to honor those who suffered during slavery in the United States with the arrival of the first captive Africans over 400 years ago.
WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR?
Juneteenth rose to wider national prominence in 2020 following the protests over racial injustice in the United States and elsewhere.
Biden, who was elected in November thanks in large part to support from Black Americans, has pledged to address racial inequality and gaps in wealth and education.
Critics say much remains to be done to address the legacy of slavery.
""It's important to commemorate emancipation and to encourage everyday Americans to reckon with the history of slavery, ... but there is always a danger with these sort of things so they can be performative,"" Matthew Delmont, a professor of history at Dartmouth College who specializes in African-American history and civil rights, told Reuters.
Designating Juneteenth a federal holiday would be a ""failure"" if it just acknowledges the date without spurring action on issues such as police brutality, voting rights and the racial wealth gap, Delmont said.
Some state Republican lawmakers, following the unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud by former President Donald Trump, are campaigning to enact voting restrictions https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-erect-voting-barriers-across-number-politically-crucial-us-states-2021-06-15, which civil rights groups say would impact the voting rights of Black Americans and other minorities.
Some Republicans are also pushing state bills that discourage teachers from focusing on the history of slavery and racism in the United States.
In some Democratic-led areas, campaigns to offer targeted reparations https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-race-reparations/chicago-suburbs-plan-to-pay-black-residents-reparations-could-be-a-national-model-idUSKBN2BD0B8 are gathering pace.
HOW ARE PEOPLE MARKING THE DAY?
People are marking the 156th anniversary of the holiday across the country with festive meals and gatherings as the coronavirus pandemic recedes in many states and cities relax social distancing restrictions. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches. However, this year many groups have opted again for virtual conferences or smaller events. 
People are celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African-American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.
Millions of federal employees will start taking the holiday off this year, observing it on Friday since Juneteenth falls on Saturday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said on Twitter. 
Major U.S. financial markets plan to remain open, operating with normal hours, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
PRIVATE SECTOR
Last year, some U.S. businesses committed to a change of policies, including recognition of the holiday.
Many private-sector firms are giving employees a floating holiday to commemorate the day, in part due to the short notice of the bill's signing into federal law just a day before the observed holiday. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will give its U.S. employees one floating day off between July 1 and Dec. 31 for the new holiday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) said it would make Juneteenth a holiday for all U.S. employees beginning in 2022.
Airbnb said it would grant employees a paid day off to mark the holiday, starting this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris signed a bill into law on Thursday to make June 19 a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans, as the White House pushes to address the country's historical injustices.
The bill, which was passed overwhelmingly by the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday after clearing the Senate unanimously, marks the day in 1865 when a Union general informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they had been made free two years earlier by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.
""Juneteenth marks both a long hard night of slavery subjugation and a promise of a brighter morning to come,"" Biden said. The day is a reminder of the ""terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take.""
European colonists first forcibly brought enslaved Africans by ship to the British colonies that became the United States in the 1600s; millions of people were legally owned there until the 13th Amendment passed in 1865. 
""Great nations don't ignore their most painful moments...they embrace them,"" Biden told a room filled with about 80 members of Congress, community leaders and activists including 94-year-old Opal Lee, who campaigned for decades to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.
Vice President Harris reminded the White House guests that they were gathered in a ""house built by enslaved people,"" and said the holiday would be an occasion to ""reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to action.""
Juneteenth will be the eleventh federally recognized holiday, and the first in nearly four decades, following one honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Federal employees will start taking the holiday off this year, observing it on Friday since Juneteenth falls on Saturday, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management said on Twitter.
SERIOUS INEQUALITY REMAINS 
Biden and his fellow Democrats are under pressure to respond to a slew of Republican-backed state bills that civil rights activists say aim to suppress voting by minorities, and to meaningfully address the disproportionate killing of Black men by police. 
Some Republicans are also pushing state bills that discourage history teachers from focusing on the U.S.'s history of slavery and racism.
Many Republicans backed the Juneteenth bill in Congress; several of the over a dozen who opposed it said declaring a ""Juneteenth National Independence Day"" would needlessly divide or confuse Americans. 
While celebrities and federal officials cheered the holiday's creation, some questioned whether it would have real impact on the country's deep-seated issues. 
""It's important to commemorate emancipation and to encourage everyday Americans to reckon with the history of slavery ... but there is always a danger with these sort of things so they can be performative,"" said Matthew Delmont, a professor of history at Dartmouth College who specializes in African-American history and civil rights.
Designating Juneteenth a federal holiday will be a ""failure"" if it just acknowledges the date without spurring action on issues such as police brutality, voting rights, and the racial wealth gap, Delmont said.
The law comes a year after the United States was rocked by protests against racism and policing following the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man, by a Minneapolis police officer.

Biden said the administration has launched an ""aggressive effort"" to fight racial discrimination in housing, drive Black home ownership and offer resources to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). 
""The promise for equality is not going to be fulfilled until it becomes real in our schools, on our main streets and in our neighborhoods,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Democrats scrambled to unite around a sweeping election reform bill they hope to begin debating next week, in the face of Republican opposition and moves by several states to pass laws placing new restrictions on voting.
Several Democrats expressed optimism over a compromise plan proposed by moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, details of which were released on Wednesday.
""I am encouraged by these recent developments,"" Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters. Georgia is one of a half-dozen U.S. states that passed tough new controls on voting procedures https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-erect-voting-barriers-across-number-politically-crucial-us-states-2021-06-15 this year.
Warnock said Manchin's ideas were ""very significant"" because they could unite the 48 Senate Democrats and two independents, boosting chances for passing a bill.
It was not yet clear whether any Republicans would climb aboard, however. Under normal Senate rules, 60 votes are needed in the 100-member chamber to pass any measure.
A crucial test vote will be held on Tuesday on whatever bill Democrats agree upon in the next few days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. 
Democrats hope to get at least all of their 50 caucus members to vote yes on opening debate. That, however, would be 10 short of the senators needed to clear a first hurdle.
But 50 would demonstrate Democratic unity on one of their highest legislative priorities and could even encourage more in their party to join a move to scrap or alter the Senate's rule requiring the 60-vote threshold to advance bills. 
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday rejected the idea of compromise, saying ""states, not the federal government, should decide how to run their own elections.""
Democrats argue that they also support state-run elections, but with minimum federal standards. 
Republican-controlled state legislatures say new restrictions on voting are needed to improve election security following former President Donald Trump's repeated claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Although multiple courts, state election officials and Trump's own administration have rejected the claims as untrue and Trump has not produced any evidence, a sizable number of Republican voters believe him anyway, polls show.
Democrat Amy Klobuchar, who chairs a Senate committee overseeing election procedures in the United States, called Manchin's compromise ""a good faith effort.""
She stopped short of embracing it and instead said, ""We'll continue to work through his ideas.""
But she noted that Manchin's plan contains key elements in a bill that has been pushed by Democratic leaders, including making ""dark money"" campaign contributions public and requiring that states give voters at least two weeks to cast their ballots in presidential and congressional elections. 
Republican Senator Mike Lee said he believed the voting rights bill would hurt his party's electoral chances: ""This bill isn't about strengthening democracy. This bill is about strengthening Democrats.""
The issue is urgent for Democrats, who hold razor-thin majorities in both houses of Congress after the 2020 elections. History and a once-a-decade redistricting process, based on the 2020 U.S. Census, favor Republicans' chances of recapturing control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. 
""If we don't get this bill passed, our democratic system is on the line. Voting is fundamental,"" said Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren.
'UNDER ASSAULT'
The flurry of state initiatives restricting voting is playing out in presidential election swing states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Arizona.
""We've been tracking voting legislation for well over a decade and we have not seen a push this aggressive and intense before,"" said Wendy Weiser, an elections expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice. ""Voting rights are under assault.""
Senate Democrats' drive for passage of the For the People bill approved by the House of Representatives in March hit a wall with Manchin's opposition.

That sweeping measure would block many of the restrictions imposed by new state laws and require states to turn over the task of redrawing congressional districts to independent commissions.
Democrats' backup plan could be an expanded version of another bill, named after the late civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis, that would omit some of the larger bill's more sweeping changes, such as having commissions redraw congressional districts.

(Reuters) - Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke will headline a voting rights rally in Texas on Sunday, a day before Democrats in the U.S. Senate take up a sweeping bill aimed at combating new Republican-backed voting restrictions in that state and others across the country.
Democratic lawmakers in Texas staged a dramatic, 11th-hour walkout as the legislative session was ending last month, blocking the Republican majority from passing a wide-ranging bill that would have eliminated drive-through and overnight voting, made it easier for judges to overturn election results and given partisan poll watchers more access to polling sites.
Texas is part of a national push by Republicans to tighten voting laws after former President Donald Trump's false claim that he lost last year's presidential election due to voter fraud. Republican-controlled legislatures have passed new rules in several battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Florida.
The reprieve in Texas is likely temporary. Republican leaders, including Governor Greg Abbott, have said they will hold a special session to take up the legislation again.
But in an interview on Thursday, O'Rourke, a former Democratic congressman who ran for president in 2020 and has not ruled out a gubernatorial campaign challenging Abbott in 2022, said he has already seen signs that the grassroots effort against the bill is working.
A handful of Republican lawmakers have backed away from some provisions in the measure, such as a prohibition on early voting on Sundays before 1 p.m. – a measure widely seen as targeting Black churches' ""souls to the polls"" drives.
""That's a good sign that this public pressure works,"" said O'Rourke, who has visited 18 cities and towns in recent weeks to hold voting rights events. ""This state is the epicenter of the fight for voting rights, and if this state comes together in numbers large enough, I really do think that helps advance the cause.""
Organizers say they expect thousands of attendees at the weekend rally in Austin, the state capital.
The U.S. Senate is expected on Monday to begin bringing a sweeping Democratic-sponsored election reform bill up for a vote. The legislation, known as the For the People Act, would expand ballot access and outlaw partisan redistricting, among other measures.
The bill's prospects in the Senate, however, are dim. Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote with Republicans universally opposed, and moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has already said he does not support the legislation.
On Wednesday, Manchin suggested a series of revisions to the bill, though any compromise would require at least 10 Republican votes under the Senate's filibuster rules.
O'Rourke said Manchin's proposal shows the bill's chances are improving.
""I think this is a very good sign, especially for everyone who was wanting us to believe the sky was falling and that this would never pass,"" he said.
O'Rourke said he has had conversations with members of the Biden administration, which has called on Congress to pass voting protections.
Democratic President Joe Biden has put Vice President Kamala Harris in charge of a national voting rights push; she met on Wednesday with 16 Texas Democratic legislators who participated in last month's walkout.

O'Rourke, who became a Democratic star when he narrowly lost a U.S. Senate race in 2018 to Republican Ted Cruz, said he is focused on voting rights at the moment, not his political future.
""After that work is done, I will think about what it is I can do to further help here in Texas,"" he said, adding that running for office is one possibility.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday backed the repeal of the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force that allowed the war in Iraq, as lawmakers pull back the authority to declare war from the White House.
The House voted 268 to 161 in favor of revoking the authorization it gave former President George W. Bush to invade Iraq 19 years ago. At least 49 Republicans joined Democrats in favor of repeal, a bipartisan vote that underscored prospects for reining in AUMFs that presidents from both parties have used to justify nearly 20 years of military actions around the globe.
The U.S. Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. However, that authority has shifted to the president due to the ""forever war"" AUMFs, which do not expire - including the 2002 Iraq AUMF and one allowing the fight against al Qaeda and affiliates after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
To be enacted, the measure passed on Thursday must also be approved by the Senate - where its prospects are less certain - and signed into law by President Joe Biden, who has said he supports it.
""I look forward to Congress no longer taking a back seat on some of the most consequential decisions our nation can make,"" said Representative Greg Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging support for the repeal.
""There comes a time when certain AUMFs simply become outdated and need to be repealed,"" Meeks said.
'DANGEROUS MESSAGE'
Opponents worry repeal of the 2002 AUMF would dangerously limit the powers of the president and send the message that the United States is pulling back from the Middle East.
Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was committed to updating the ""outdated"" AUMF, but he did not want repeal until an alternative was in place.
""This rushed, standalone repeal... sends a dangerous message of disengagement that could destabilize Iraq, embolden Iran, which it will, and strengthen al Qaeda and ISIS in the region,"" McCaul said.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer threw his weight behind the repeal effort on Wednesday. Schumer said the 2002 AUMF is outdated and repealing it would prevent future presidential ""military adventurism"" such as former President Donald Trump's 2020 airstrike on a Baghdad airport, which raised fears of war days before the Republican was to leave office.
Trump cited the 2002 Iraq authorization as one of his justifications for the strike, which killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. 
Repeal will need 60 votes to get through the evenly divided 100-member Senate, meaning that it would need the support of at least 10 Republicans to go into effect.
Repeal advocates said they had high hopes of garnering the 60 votes, noting past bipartisan support for stalled efforts to rein in the AUMFs.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the repeal plan, saying existing authorizations should stay in place until new ones have been completed. ""The grave threats posed by ISIS, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are as real as they've ever been,"" McConnell said in remarks opening the Senate.
Some members of Congress are also discussing a repeal and replacement of the 2001 AUMF passed for the Afghanistan war.

448,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Republican-controlled state legislatures pass a wave of laws https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-erect-voting-barriers-across-number-politically-crucial-us-states-2021-06-15 that civil rights advocates say will restrict access to voting for Blacks and Hispanics, congressional Democrats have made passing a federal elections reform law a top priority.
But they have a hard road ahead - top Republicans are dead set against the move and not even all Democrats are in agreement. Moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin introduced a proposal this week as an alternative to the sweeping ""For the People Act.""
Details of the two approaches:
SIMILARITIES:
VOTER REGISTRATION
Both plans require states to promote access to voter registration and voting for people with disabilities.
FALSE INFORMATION
Both proposals bar the providing of false information about elections to hinder voting and raise the penalties for voter intimidation.
POLLING PLACES
Both plans require states to notify people no later than seven days before an election if their polling places have changed and allow provisional ballots to count for eligible voters regardless of precinct.
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Both include the Honest Ads Act and DISCLOSE Act, which contain measures such as requiring super PACs - political action committees - and other organizations that spend money in elections and judicial nominations to disclose donors who disclose more than $10,000 and direct online platforms to implement actions to prevent foreign nationals from directly or indirectly purchasing political ads.
EXECUTIVE BRANCH
Both plans require the president and vice president to disclose their individual tax returns and certain business tax returns. They also both mandate the president and vice president to divest financial interests that pose a conflict of interest or disclose information about their business interests within 30 days of taking office.
EARLY VOTING
Both Manchin and the Senate bill require 15 consecutive days for early voting. Manchin's framework mandates that the early voting period includes two weekends.
CYBERSECURITY
Both plans establish standards for election vendors to address cybersecurity concerns.
OVERLAP:
REGISTRATION
Both plans require automatic voter registration, with Manchin's proposal requiring it to be done through the Department of Motor Vehicles, with the option to opt out.
GERRYMANDERING
The Senate bill requires states to set up an independent commission to handle congressional redistricting. Manchin's proposal bans partisan gerrymandering and calls for the use of computer models.
DIFFERENCES:
ELECTION DAY
Manchin's proposals include making Election Day a federal holiday, which is not included in the Senate version of the bill.
VOTER IDENTIFICATION
The Senate bill bars states from requiring applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and allows voters to show sworn affidavits instead of presenting photo identification. 
Manchin's proposal requires voter identification but allows some alternatives, like the use of a utility bill, to prove a voter's eligibility to cast a ballot.

VOTING BY MAIL
The Senate bill prohibits states from imposing restrictions on an individual's ability to vote by mail. Manchin's proposal would require states to send absentee mail ballots ""due to eligible circumstance."" It does not elaborate on what such circumstances would be.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee on Thursday requested documents from the Justice Department related to the Trump administration's seizure of phone records from lawmakers, journalists and the then-White House counsel as part of its investigations into leaks of classified information.
The House Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting a wide range of documents before July 1.
The documents included any communications between the Justice Department and former President Donald Trump or White House staff relating to the opening of the leaks investigations.
The letter represented the first major public step in an investigation that Nadler announced on Monday.
""The Committee is now engaged in an investigation of the Trump Administration’s surveillance of Members of Congress, the news media, and others,"" Nadler said in a statement on Thursday. ""We must determine if the Department sought these sensitive records for improper political purposes.""
The department's internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, last week said his office was also launching a review into whether ""improper considerations"" drove the leaks investigations.
The New York Times reported last week that under Trump the Justice Department subpoenaed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for data on Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both House Democrats from California.
Apple also told Donald McGahn, who served as White House counsel under Trump, that the department had subpoenaed information about him in 2018 and barred the company from telling him, the Times reported.
The Justice Department has also acknowledged seizing phone records for journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.

Garland met on Monday with officials from those three news organizations to discuss the department's policies.
The Justice Department said on June 5 it would no longer secretly obtain reporters' records during leak investigations, a major policy shift that abandoned a practice decried by press freedom groups.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department closed its criminal investigation into whether a book by John Bolton about his time as President Donald Trump's national security adviser illegally disclosed classified information, and dropped a civil lawsuit, Bolton's lawyer said on Wednesday.
The lawsuit had sought to recover money Bolton made from the book, according to a court document filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.
The book, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,"" was highly critical of Trump, who had fired Bolton in September 2019 after roughly 17 months as national security adviser.
""By ending these proceedings without in any way penalizing Ambassador Bolton or limiting his proceeds from the book, the Department of Justice has tacitly acknowledged that President Trump and his White House officials acted illegitimately,” Bolton attorney Charles Cooper said in a statement.
Sarah Tinsley, a spokesperson for Bolton, said in a statement that the reversal was a ""complete vindication"" for the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Published in June 2020 by Simon & Schuster, the book provided an insider account of Trump’s “inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process,” according to the publisher.
Before the memoir hit bookstores, Trump's Justice Department unsuccessfully sought a court order to prevent Bolton from publishing the book.
The Justice Department had argued that the book contained classified information that could threaten national security.
After losing its request for an injunction, the Justice Department pursued a civil lawsuit seeking to recover proceeds from the memoir's sales.

Trump's Justice Department launched a criminal investigation last September into whether Bolton mishandled classified information when he published the book.
Prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas seeking information about the book from Bolton’s literary agent, Javelin, and Simon & Schuster.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed and sent to President Joe Biden a bill making June 19, or ""Juneteenth,"" a federal holiday commemorating the end of legal enslavement of Black Americans.
Biden plans to sign the bill into law at a White House event on Thursday afternoon.
The holiday marks the day in 1865 when a Union general informed a group of enslaved people in Texas that they had been made free two years earlier by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.
During House floor debate, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, appeared beside a well-known black-and-white photograph showing a man's back scarred from whippings during slavery.
She said she had introduced legislation in the House to make Juneteenth https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-juneteenth-factbox/factbox-what-is-juneteenth-idUSKBN23N3A0 a federal holiday ""to commemorate the end of chattel slavery, America's original sin, and to bring about celebration.""
The House approved the bill on a vote of 415-14. The Senate unanimously passed the bill on Tuesday.
Its success comes a year after the United States was rocked by protests against racism and policing following the murder of the African-American man George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
Republican Representative Guy Reschenthaler touted the role his northern home state of Pennsylvania played in the Civil War.
""Designating June 19 as a national holiday would increase awareness of ... Juneteenth,"" he said. It would celebrate Black history and culture. It would recognize the Americans who fought and died to end slavery.""

Texas officially declared Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980 and since then the holiday has been officially recognized in most U.S. states.
Juneteenth would be the eleventh federally recognized holiday, joining a list that includes Christmas and New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Independence Day and honoring presidents and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

452,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - One in three U.S. election officials feels unsafe on the job and one in six reported being threatened because of their work, according to a survey published Wednesday by New York University’s nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.
The results reflect a reckoning in the wake of election in which the loser, former Republican President Donald Trump, spent months falsely alleging the contest was ""rigged"" against him. Those claims sparked threats and actual violence, such as the deadly U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6.
A Reuters investigation published on Friday https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-georgia-threats found that election workers and their families continue to face threats and intimidation months after Trump's loss in November to Democrat Joe Biden. The intimidation has been particularly severe in Georgia, where Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and other Republican election officials refuted Trump's stolen-election claims.
Election officials' fears for their safety portend major staffing problems in future votes, the Brennan Center said.
“Large numbers of election officials have resigned in the past year, raising alarm bells. But the wave of departures could soon turn into a tsunami,” said a report produced jointly by the Brennan Center and the Bipartisan Policy Center, a centrist Washington think tank.
The Brennan Center surveyed 233 local election officials across the country between April 1 and 7. The survey had a 6.4% margin of error, the center said. 
Many election workers who were surveyed blamed social media for spreading falsehoods. About 54% of election officials said social media made their work more dangerous and 78% said it made it more difficult. Those findings reflect a dangerous rise in disinformation, the report from the two research organizations said.
Trump's false claims that voter fraud cost him the election spread quickly among supporters over social media platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter and other online forums. 
""This disinformation has indelibly changed the lives and careers of election officials,"" the report said, calling on technology and media companies to help slow the spread of disinformation.
The two research centers urged the Department of Justice to create ""an election threats task force"" to work with federal, state, and local law enforcement to investigate threats against officials and poll workers. The report urged states to protect election employees' personal information and pay for security measures such as home intrusion detection systems.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged the rising threat to election workers in a speech on Friday. Garland, a Biden appointee, said his Justice Department will aggressively protect voting rights at a time when many Republican-led states are tightening election laws.
""We have not been blind to the dramatic increase in menacing and violent threats against all manner of state and local election workers, ranging from the highest administrators to volunteer poll workers,"" he said. ""Such threats undermine our electoral process and violate a myriad of federal laws.""
U.S. elections are run by two kinds of workers - permanent staffers employed by officials such as secretaries of state, and large numbers of temporary workers brought in to manage polling places on election days. Those temporary workers are vital to the process - guiding voters, answering questions, verifying IDs - and they work long hours for low pay.
Even before November's contested election, counties and local governments struggled to fill these roles. The federal U.S. Election Assistance Commission found that in the 2016 presidential vote, 65% of jurisdictions nationwide reported that it was “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to recruit enough poll workers.

The Brennan Center report said that as of last year, almost 35% of local election officials were eligible to retire by the 2024 presidential election.
“It is not clear who will replace them, nor whether those willing to take the job in the future will share the commitment to free and fair elections that was so critical in 2020,” the report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday promoted the Biden administration's efforts to advance voting rights when she met 16 fellow Democrats from the Texas state legislature who successfully blocked a bill they said would make it harder for Blacks and Hispanics to vote.
President Joe Biden appointed Harris this month https://reut.rs/3cHKiWs to lead the charge against Republican state lawmakers across the country seeking to enact voting restrictions.
White House and civil rights groups say the Republican-led efforts would make it harder for Americans to vote. It follows Republican former President Donald Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election to Biden because of widespread fraud.
So far, 14 other U.S. states have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice.
""What we are seeing are examples of an attempt to interfere with that right, an attempt to marginalize and take from people, a right that has already been given,"" Harris said.
Democrats in the Texas statehouse walked out on a legislative session last month to deprive Republicans of a quorum needed to pass a voting bill. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has vowed to bring the legislature back in a yet-to-be-called special session.
Under the Texas proposal, drive-through voting would no longer be allowed, early voting would be limited, 24-hour polling sites would be scrapped, and absentee ballots would be more difficult to cast. 
Critics say such measures keep many Black and Hispanic voters, traditional supporters of Democrats, from the polls.
Harris plans to bring together elected officials and concerned Americans to build a coalition to work on voting rights and will seek legislation that improves access to the ballot box, senior administration officials said.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said his Justice Department will aggressively enforce voting rights https://reut.rs/3vFl4il, prosecute threats against election officials, double the number of prosecutors devoted to the issue and closely examine how states conduct their elections. 
The United States has been coming to grips with a rise in threats from white supremacists and militia groups, while last year's murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer sparked nationwide protests against racial inequity 

Voting rights is the second high-profile assignment for the vice president. In March, Biden entrusted her with leading U.S. diplomatic efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to lower migration from the region.
Harris recently visited Mexico and Guatemala https://reut.rs/3cGRtOL as part of those efforts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in a number of politically significant states have passed a wave of new voting requirements and limits this year, saying the measures are needed to curb voter fraud, despite scant evidence of it in the United States.
Backers of the measures cite Republican former President Donald Trump’s baseless claim that fraud underlay his decisive presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in November. Democrats and voting rights advocates have sued state officials over the laws, denouncing the efforts as partisan power grabs that will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color.
MICHIGAN
The Republican-controlled Michigan state Senate passed three bills on Wednesday expanding voter identification requirements in the state. The measures will next be considered by the Michigan House of Representatives, where Republicans also have a majority. Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, is unlikely to sign them into law.
The legislation would require in-person voters lacking photo ID to cast a provisional ballot and verify their identities within six days, rather than signing an affidavit attesting to their identities and voting normally, as current law allows. It would also add identification requirements to absentee voting.
PENNSYLVANIA
A Pennsylvania House of Representatives committee on Tuesday approved a Republican-backed package of voting restrictions that would require election officials to verify voters' signatures with ballot-sorting machines, limit ballot drop-box use and eliminate the state's permanent mail-voting list, forcing voters to apply for mail ballots before each election.
Democratic Governor Tom Wolf has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk, but Republican lawmakers are expected to reintroduce the measure as a proposed constitutional amendment that would be subject to a public referendum. A state Senate committee on Tuesday endorsed another proposed constitutional amendment that would expand voter identification requirements.
TEXAS
Democratic Texas lawmakers walked out of a legislative session on May 30, denying Republicans the quorum needed to pass sweeping new voting restrictions that would have limited early voting hours, added new identification requirements for absentee voting and prohibited ballot drop boxes.
Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a strong supporter of the measure, vowed to add the bill to a special legislative session later this year. The Republican-majority legislature is expected to pass the bill when it comes up in the special session, although some Republican lawmakers have said the bill erroneously shortened Sunday early voting hours and needed revision.
ARIZONA
Republican Governor Doug Ducey signed a law on May 11 to stop counties from automatically mailing Arizonans early ballots if they do not use them often enough. The legislation will remove voters from the state’s “Early Voting List” if they fail to submit an early ballot at least once every two election cycles.
Republican lawmakers in most other states have bundled voting restrictions into sweeping bills to pass them in one go, but they are taking a piecemeal approach in Arizona. Other voting hurdles still pending in the state’s legislature include bills that would ban automatic and Election Day voter registration.
FLORIDA
A law signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis on May 6 imposed additional requirements on requesting and submitting absentee ballots. Absentee voters must submit new proof of identity when requesting their ballots and reapply for absentee ballots in each new general election cycle, rather than every two cycles.
The law also limited the use of absentee drop boxes to the early voting period, gave partisan election observers more power to raise objections and required people offering voters assistance to stay at least 150 feet (45 m) away from polling places, an increase from the previous 100-foot (30-m) radius.
GEORGIA
One of the most contentious new voting measures passed in Georgia, where Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a law on March 25 that tightened absentee ballot identification requirements, restricted ballot drop-box use and allowed a Republican-controlled state agency to take over local voting operations.
Critics said the legislation aims to disenfranchise Black voters, who helped propel Biden to the presidency and deliver Democrats two U.S. Senate victories in Georgia in January that gave them control of the chamber. Top U.S. companies also decried Georgia’s law, and Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game out of the state in protest.

IOWA
Republican Governor Kim Reynolds signed a law on March 9 that shortened the state’s early voting period and Election Day polling-place hours, imposed tighter deadlines for absentee ballots to be submitted, and made it a felony for election officials to disobey guidance from Iowa’s secretary of state, who is currently a Republican.

455,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The House is set to vote Wednesday on making June 19, the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., a federal holiday, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, with passage sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature.
The Senate passed its version of the bill by unanimous consent Tuesday afternoon. The companion House legislation, sponsored by Texas Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, has 166 co-sponsors.
Known as Juneteenth, the commemoration marks the day when the last enslaved African Americans were ordered freed after Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, three years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The state was the last in the Confederacy to receive word that the Civil War was over and that slavery had been abolished, and the last where the federal Army established its authority.
Juneteenth would become the 11th annual national holiday on the federal calendar. Federal employees would be given June 19 -- or the Friday or Monday closest to it -- as a paid day off.The last holiday added to the federal calendar was to honor Martin Luther King Jr. on the third Monday of January. That was passed in 1983 after a 15-year effort.Juneteenth is already recognized by almost all states and Washington, D.C., as an official state holiday or observance. Texas was, in 1980, the first state to put it on its calendar. The push to make it a federal holiday gained momentum in the wake of worldwide protests following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by a White Minneapolis police officer in 2020.Some companies including,  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT),  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)., already designate the day a paid holiday and others may follow with the federal designation.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that creating the holiday “is a major step forward in recognizing the wrongs of the past, but we must continue to work to ensure equal justice and fulfill the promise of the Emancipation Proclamation and our Constitution.”The Senate was able to act unanimously after Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson dropped his objection to adding the cost of another paid holiday for federal workers. He had previously proposed dropping Columbus Day in exchange.
“Although I strongly support celebrating Emancipation, I objected to the cost and lack of debate,” Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. “While it still seems strange that having taxpayers provide federal employees paid time off is now required to celebrate the end of slavery, it is clear that there is no appetite in Congress to further discuss the matter.”

456,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 10:26PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump and a senior adviser in his administration, has reached a deal to write a book billed by his publisher as the ""definitive"" recounting of Trump's presidency.
The book will be released early next year, according to publisher Broadside Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers specializing in conservative authors. 
Broadside did not make financial terms of the agreement public.
""Jared Kushner was the most consequential adviser throughout President Trump's presidency, and as a senior adviser, he played a central role in the administration's most significant accomplishments - including the Abraham Accords, Criminal Justice Reform, Operation Warp Speed, and USMCA,"" Broadside said in announcing the deal.

""His book will be the definitive, thorough recounting of the administration and the truth about what happened behind closed doors,"" the publisher said.
Kushner, 40, is married to the former president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday unveiled a plan to address the threat of violence posed by white supremacists and militias, five months after members of those groups joined in a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The White House released a 30-page plan for increased information sharing between federal and local officials and social media companies, additional resources to identify and prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining dangerous groups.
The administration conducted a sweeping assessment earlier this year of domestic terrorism that labeled white supremacists and militia groups as top national security threats. The issue took on new urgency after a Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were trying to overturn Biden's election victory.
The new strategy stopped short of calling for new laws to fight domestic threats, and officials on Tuesday did not offer many details on specific new resources.
""We concluded that we didn't have the evidentiary basis, yet, to decide whether we wanted to proceed in that direction or whether we have sufficient authority as it currently exists at the federal level,"" said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the announcement.
In a speech on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the ""coming days and months"" he would convene an interagency task force dedicated to combating domestic terrorism. Garland said he has already ""begun to reinvigorate"" that task force.
Garland said the Jan. 6 attack by Trump supporters had shown white supremacists and militia groups to be the country's greatest domestic security threat.
""In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white race,"" Garland said.
In his budget proposal released last month, Biden, who succeeded Trump on Jan. 20, sought $100 million in additional funding to train and hire analysts and prosecutors to disrupt and deter terrorist activity. 
""The threat is elevated,"" the administration official said. ""Tackling it means ensuring that we do have the resources and personnel to address that elevated threat.""
The administration is also toughening the federal government's screening methods to better identify employees who may pose insider threats. They are looking to share those techniques with private companies.
That effort includes an ongoing review by the Department of Defense over how and when to remove military members who are found to be engaged in known domestic terrorist groups.

The Defense Department review is looking at, among other things, how to define extremists, the senior administration official said. 
""They are doing this in a way they feel ratchets up the protection but also respects expression and association protections,"" the official said.

458,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 03:16PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday he hoped to have a July vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill, but a second measure would be needed to incorporate climate and human infrastructure measures.
The top Senate Democrat told reporters there are many in his caucus who think the bipartisan proposal is a good start but does not do enough. 
Democrats and Republicans in the 50-50 split Senate have been negotiating behind the scenes on a potential $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, with slightly more than half of that plan consisting of new funding. The rest would come from already approved money for COVID-19 relief and other programs.
But President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats in Congress want a much larger effort that not only invests in traditional infrastructure such as road and bridge-building, but in significantly reducing carbon emissions and helping the elderly and others receive home healthcare.
""In order to move forward on infrastructure, we must include bold action on climate,"" Schumer told reporters.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he was hopeful of passage of a bipartisan bill but reiterated that any such measure must not undo any of the 2017 tax law that gave substantial breaks to corporations and the wealthy.
A second, Democrats'-only bill, if there is one, likely would advance this fall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump pressed the Justice Department during his waning weeks in office to join his failed effort to overturn his election defeat based on his false claims of voting fraud, but its leaders refused, with one decrying the ""pure insanity"" of the claims, documents released on Tuesday showed.
The records, obtained by the House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee, provided new insight into the actions of the Republican former president in trying to enlist the department to act on his claims. The documents showed a series of overtures made by Trump, then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and an outside private attorney, Kurt Olsen. 
The department ultimately did not join the effort and numerous courts rejected lawsuits seeking to overturn election results in various states. 
Congress also is investigating the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters trying to stop the formal certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory.
""These documents show that President Trump tried to corrupt our nation's chief law enforcement agency in a brazen attempt to overturn an election that he lost,"" said Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat.
These actions were separate from the revelations that the Trump-era Justice Department secretly sought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-leaks-justice/us-justice-dept-to-strengthen-policies-on-getting-lawmakers-records-idUSKCN2DQ1I3 the phone records of at least two Democratic lawmakers, a move that led Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday to vow to strengthen policies aiming to protect the department from political influence.
The department under outgoing Attorney General William Barr, who left his post on Dec. 23, and his short-term replacement Jeffrey Rosen decided not to act on the false claims of voting fraud. Biden took office on Jan. 20.
The emails showed that Meadows asked Justice Department officials to investigate an unfounded conspiracy theory called ""Italygate"" alleging that U.S. electoral data was changed in Italian facilities with the knowledge of the CIA.
On Jan. 1, Meadows sent Rosen a link to a YouTube video detailing the theory. Rosen forwarded the email to then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, who replied: ""Pure insanity."" 
The documents also showed that Trump pressured Rosen when he was deputy attorney general to have the department take up the election fraud claims.
'FLATLY REFUSED'
The emails showed Rosen declined to arrange a meeting between Justice Department officials and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about his false claims that the November election was stolen. Meadows had asked Rosen to help arrange the proposed meeting with Giuliani, the emails showed.
""I flatly refused, said I would not be giving any special treatment to Giuliani or any of his 'witnesses,' and re-affirmed yet again that I will not talk to Giuliani about any of this,"" Rosen wrote to a Justice Department colleague on Jan. 1.
Giuliani had played a prominent role in promoting Trump's false election claims.
Trump, through an assistant, sent Rosen a Dec. 14 email with documents purporting to show evidence of election fraud in northern Michigan - a debunked allegation that a federal judge had already rejected.
Two weeks later, on Dec. 29, Trump's White House assistant emailed Rosen, who by then was the acting attorney general, and other Justice Department lawyers a draft legal brief that they were urged to file at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The department never filed the brief. Emails released by the House committee showed that Olsen, a Maryland lawyer involved in writing Trump's draft brief, repeatedly tried to meet with Rosen but was unsuccessful.
The draft brief backed by Trump argued that changes made by the states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania to voting procedures amid the COVID-19 pandemic to expand mail-in voting were unlawful. Biden won all those states.
Similar arguments were made in a lawsuit filed by Ken Paxton, the Republican attorney general of Texas and a Trump ally. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that long-shot lawsuit in December.
Representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The document release came ahead of a House Oversight Committee hearing on the Jan. 6 attack, which will include testimony from FBI director Christopher Wray and General Charles Flynn, a high-ranking Pentagon official involved in a key mid-riot phone call with police leaders.

The general, who commands the U.S. Army Pacific, is the brother of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has also promoted Trump's election conspiracy theories.
Maloney said at the start of the hearing that the Pentagon's response to the riot was ""a shocking failure.""

460,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 02:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- On his first overseas trip as president, Joe Biden’s plans for an international coalition that can stand up to Beijing are starting to come into focus.
The settlement on aircraft subsidies sealed Tuesday ahead of his talks with senior European Union officials in Brussels not only parks $11.5 billion of tariffs for the next five years, it also includes a commitment for the U.S. and the EU to tackle, together, “non-market practices of third parties” which could threaten Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and its European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
That’s code for China. Officials in Washington and Brussels say that Beijing has exploited the gaps in the World Trade Organization’s rulebook to deploy as much as $500 billion of state aid to give its companies an unfair advantage in global trade. And Biden made clear that he aims for this to be just the start.
“It’s a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China’s economic model,” the president said in an emailed statement after the deal.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told reporters that the deal includes a commitment for “concrete joint collaboration to confront squarely the threats that we experience and will experience from China’s ambition to build an aircraft sector on non-market practices.”
The EU signed up to the deal despite its reluctance to match Washington’s assertive line on China. The bloc’s approach to China has been hardening since the spring when a tit-for-tat sanctions fight with Beijing over its alleged human-rights abuses in Xinjiang left their landmark investment deal in limbo. The EU also agreed to a deal with Canada on Wednesday to secure supply chains for critical raw materials that don’t rely on China.
Read More: Canada, EU in Raw Materials Pact to Cut China Reliance
In an interview with Bloomberg Television, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis listed a whole series of flaws in the global trading system that the U.S. and the EU want to attack together, including opaque subsidy regimes, unfair competition from state-owned companies and “forced technology transfers.”
“Many of those elements stem from the structural model of China,” he said. “The EU is definitely very much willing to discuss and cooperate with the U.S. specifically on China -- that’s not an issue here.”
The aircraft truce comes as U.S. and European officials recognize that China’s state-sponsored aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, or Comac, is on track to become a serious rival to Boeing and Airbus by the end of the decade.
It’s been a beneficiary of the Made in China 2025 program, Beijing’s industrial plan to become a global leader in advanced technologies including robotics, aircraft and electric cars. A 2020 U.S. report said Beijing’s industrial plans will “likely result in oversupply, leading to loss of jobs and production,” for Western companies.
“What we are talking about with respect to China are the kinds of support that are available to Chinese industries that the Chinese government has decided are going to be priority sectors that they are going to put all their muscle and all their resources into,” said Tai. “How are we supposed to compete with that? On the spectrum of harm and distortion to competitive terms that is so far away from what either of us have been doing and fighting about.”
Hardball Tactics
The Biden administration’s focus on China has been a clear theme running through days of geopolitical talks starting with the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, England, from Friday and leading up to a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian criticized Biden’s efforts during a news briefing in Beijing before the summit. The U.S.-led coalition “exposes the bad intentions of the U.S. and a few others to create confrontation and estrangement and expand differences and disagreements,” he said.
The U.S. and, to a lesser extent, the EU are aiming to build a broad coalition of Western democracies to challenge China’s hardball tactics in the economic sphere.
They plan to update WTO trade rules to include more effective measures to push back on industrial subsidies and other unfair behavior from state-owned enterprises.
“Washington and Brussels need each other to deal with China, particularly at the WTO, and neither derived any meaningful leverage from wielding retaliatory tariffs,” said Marc Busch, a non-resident senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Atlantic Council.
But the U.S. and EU also have other issues to resolve in their trading relationship.
A key next step will be an agreement to withdraw U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum, which were ostensibly aimed at curbing a surge of cheap, subsidized metals coming from China. Those tariffs remain popular with U.S. industry and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said they are “effective” in countering cheap exports from abroad.
“Have the U.S. and EU achieved peace in our time?” Busch asked. “Don’t bet on it.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Senate Democrats said on Tuesday they would not vote for an infrastructure bill that omits key measures aimed at combatting climate change, putting pressure on the White House to abandon attempts to secure a bipartisan package.
President Joe Biden has been focused on getting a sweeping infrastructure bill passed in Congress that would revamp the nation's roads and bridges while also accelerating a rapid U.S. shift toward clean energy.
Republicans have said measures addressing things like climate change do not count as ""infrastructure,"" leaving negotiations in the divided Senate at an impasse.
“There has to be an absolute unbreakable guarantee that climate has to be at the center of any infrastructure deal that we cut,” Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts said at a news conference with Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Merkley added: ""If there is no climate, there is no deal.""
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats have urged the White House over the last few days not to abandon climate provisions after White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy told Politico that measures like ""a clean electricity standard may not end (up) in the final version"" of the infrastructure deal. 
Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, told Reuters the administration has not stopped pushing for climate priorities in the negotiations. 
“The president has underscored that climate change is one of the defining crises we face as a nation, and in the negotiations he and his team have continuously fought for leading on the clean energy economy and on clean energy jobs,"" he said. 
He did not say whether Biden would pursue an infrastructure package without Republican support through the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority, if the negotiations fail.

Markey and Merkley said on Tuesday that Democrats should go their own way, joining former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who also urged Democrats to abandon bipartisan efforts.
It is not clear whether Democrats would have a majority, since moderate Democratic Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin have said they prefer a bipartisan approach.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Justice Department will make its policies for obtaining records of U.S. lawmakers more rigorous after former President Donald Trump's administration secretly secured data on members of Congress, journalists and a former White House lawyer, the top U.S. law enforcement official said on Monday.
Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-merrick-b-garland also said that ""political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions"" and that anyone within the department who fails to live up to that principle ""will be met with strict accountability.""
Democratic congressional leaders on Sunday vowed to investigate the department's ""rogue"" actions under Trump, including its move to obtain the communications records of House of Representatives Democrats Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell as part of a probe into leaks of classified information. Schiff and Swalwell both were critics of Trump, a Republican.
Garland said he has instructed Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco ""to evaluate and strengthen the department's existing policies and procedures for obtaining records of the Legislative branch."" 
""Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separation-of-powers concerns moving forward,"" Garland added, referring to the constitutional system of checks and balances among the U.S. government's executive, judicial and legislative branches.
The department's internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, on Friday said his office is launching a review of the use of subpoenas during Trump's administration to obtain the records of lawmakers and journalists and whether ""improper considerations"" drove those decisions. 
""There are important questions that must be resolved in connection with an effort by the department to obtain records related to members of Congress and congressional staff,"" Garland added.
Garland said that if action related to Horowitz's investigation is warranted, ""I will not hesitate to move swiftly.""
""POLITICAL ENEMIES""
Garland also met on Monday with officials from the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN to discuss the Trump Justice Department's seizure of phone records for journalists from the three news organizations.
The Justice Department in a statement said Garland had ""a productive conversation"" with the media representatives and they ""agreed on the need for strong, durable rules.""
""In today's meeting, we sought a full accounting of what happened and requested that the Department of Justice codify that it will no longer seize journalists' records during leak investigations,"" said New York Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger in a statement. ""We were encouraged by Attorney General Garland's statements but we will continue to push until our concerns are addressed.""
Washington Post Publisher Fred Ryan said in a statement: “While we welcome the new policy to refrain from using compulsory legal procedures to seize reporter records in leak investigations, we feel steps must be taken to ensure it is durable and binding on future administrations. It is also essential that there be a full and complete public accounting of all the actions taken against our news organizations, including the secret subpoenas and gag orders, and an explanation as to what has been done with the information that was seized.”
The House Judiciary Committee will also open an investigation, said the panel's chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler.
Under former attorneys general William Barr and Jeff Sessions, the department was accused by Democrats of putting Trump's personal and political interests ahead of the law.
The Times on Thursday reported that under Trump the department subpoenaed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for data on Schiff and Swalwell. Apple also told Donald McGahn, who served as White House counsel under Trump, that the department had subpoenaed information about him in 2018 and barred the company from telling him, the Times reported on Sunday.
Schiff said he has spoken with Garland and Monaco about the subpoena that sought his phone records.
""I have every confidence they will also do the kind of top-to-bottom review of the degree to which the department was politicized during the previous administration and take corrective steps,"" Schiff said.
Schiff added that the department ""can never be used to protect a president's friends or accomplices, or as a potential weapon against a president's perceived political enemies.""

Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, decried the investigation announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats. Echoing Trump's language on previous investigations, McConnell called this one ""a witch hunt in the making."" McConnell said on the Senate floor that Horowitz is ""fully equipped"" to investigate the matter without Congress also doing so.
John Demers, who heads the Justice Department's national security division and is a rare holdover from Trump's administration, is expected to leave his post by the end of next week, the Times reported on Monday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden views the Republican Party as vastly diminished in numbers even as it remains in lockstep with the man he defeated, former President Donald Trump.
""The leadership of the Republican Party is fractured and the Trump wing of the party is the bulk of the party, but it makes up a significant minority of the American people,"" Biden told a news conference in Brussels after a NATO summit.
""I think it's appropriate to say that the Republican Party is vastly diminished in numbers,"" Biden, a Democrat, said without offering evidence for the assertion. 
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll https://polling.reuters.com/poll/PARTY_ID_ in April showed 36% of Americans identifying as Republican-leaning, compared with 42% for Democrats, roughly the same as a year ago. Democrats narrowly control both houses of Congress, and 23 U.S. states have Democratic governors, compared with 27 led by Republicans. 
""Joe Biden’s comments about the GOP are lies and his dismissal of the 74 million Americans who voted Republican in November 2020, which flipped 15 seats in the House, underscores his failure to unite and lead our country,"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Emma Vaughn said.
A majority, some 53%, of Republicans believe Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election and blame his loss to Biden on illegal voting, and one quarter of the overall public agreed that Trump won, the poll found.
Biden won the election by more than 7 million votes and a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College. Trump continues to argue that he lost due to rampant electoral fraud, claims that were rejected by multiple courts and state election officials. 
Biden has sought in Europe to counter China and Russia by shoring up traditional international alliances that frayed under Trump. International leaders, he said, understand that ""we're a decent, honorable nation.""
His comments about Republicans aside, Biden hopes to salvage a deal with the opposition party on infrastructure spending. He believes doing so may hold the key to his party retaining its weak grasp on legislative power.

""The agenda, whether it's dealing with the vaccine, the economy, infrastructure. It's important that we demonstrate we can make progress,"" Biden said.
Democrats hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, and 50 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where ties are broken by Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris. Elections for the House and for a number of Senate seats will be held in November 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats overcame Republican opposition on Monday as the U.S. Senate voted to confirm federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, seen as a possible future Supreme Court nominee for President Joe Biden, to an influential appellate court.
The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 53-44 to approve Jackson's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. All those in opposition were Republicans, with three voting with Democrats to approve the nomination. 
Biden nominated Jackson, a Washington-based U.S. district judge, to the D.C. Circuit to replace Attorney General Merrick Garland on the bench. That appellate court has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court in the past, including for current Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.
The Democratic president vowed during his election campaign to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court if he got a chance to fill a vacancy, which would be a historic first. Jackson is among the most prominent Black women in the federal judiciary and, at age 50, is also relatively young.
At Jackson's confirmation hearing in April, several Republicans questioned her on whether race plays a role in her approach to deciding cases. Jackson told them that race would be inappropriate to inject in her evaluation of a legal case.
Jackson was appointed to her district court position by Democratic former President Barack Obama in 2013. 
With conservatives holding a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, liberal activists have been calling for the court's oldest member, 82-year-old liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, to retire this year while Democrats control the Senate. Jackson, a Harvard Law School graduate, served early in her career as one of Breyer's Supreme Court clerks. 

Nominees can win confirmation to lifetime judicial appointments with a simple majority vote in the 100-seat Senate, which is currently split 50-50 between the parties and is controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes.
Jackson and another Black female judge, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, are considered front-runners to be nominated by Biden should Breyer step aside.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Virginia couple on Monday pleaded guilty to demonstrating unlawfully in the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, a misdemeanor with a sentence of up to six months, in a plea deal that could set a benchmark for hundreds of other cases. 
Jessica and Joshua Bustle of Bristow, Virginia were the first to reach such an agreement with prosecutors on a misdemeanor charge. They admitted during a court hearing that they violated a federal law that prohibits ""parading, demonstrating, or picketing"" inside the Capitol without proper authorization, according to a court filing.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan in Washington, who oversaw Monday's plea hearing, will sentence the Bustles at a later date.
The Bustles have agreed to pay $500 apiece in restitution.
Their sentence will likely act as a precedent for hundreds of defendants also facing charges of misdemeanors -- lesser crimes than the felonies that instigators are facing -- in the Jan. 6 riot by former President Donald Trump's supporters.
More than 450 people have been charged with taking part in the attack, which followed speech in which Trump falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of fraud. The violence that followed left five dead.
The Bustles are the third and fourth defendants to plead guilty in the sprawling investigation stemming from the attack on the Capitol.
The first guilty plea came in April, when a founding member of the right-wing Oath Keepers, Jon Schaffer, pleaded guilty to two felony charges of obstructing the certification of the 2020 election and breaching a restricted building.
Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of between 3-1/2 and 4-1/2 years of prison time for Schaffer, but his sentence will ultimately be decided by a District of Columbia judge.

A Florida man on June 2 became the second person to plead guilty to storming the Capitol. Paul Allard Hodgkins pleaded guilty to one felony count of obstructing an official proceeding.
A judge said federal sentencing guidelines call for Hodgkins to receive sentence in the range of 15 to 21 months.

(Reuters) - As U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin over ransomware gangs in his country that twice recently targeted critical American infrastructure, his administration is publicly blaming the Russian government for allowing those criminals to profit without prosecution.
The FBI and private cybersecurity companies have not disclosed any evidence showing Russian government involvement in the ransomware attacks on U.S. fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline Co and meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) of Brazil. Putin has called the idea that Russia was responsible absurd.
But as the cyber operations of Russian intelligence agencies have evolved, it has become harder for the U.S. government to distinguish alleged Russian intelligence operatives from ordinary cyber criminals stealing secrets in ransomware forays and threatening to publish them, according to more than a dozen U.S. intelligence, national security and law enforcement officials and experts outside of government interviewed by Reuters.
""It's a combination of tasking and turning a blind eye, but there's always a plausible deniability,"" said cybercrime expert John Bennett of corporate risk consultancy Kroll.
As the top FBI agent in San Francisco, Bennett oversaw an investigation of a massive breach https://www.reuters.com/article/yahoo-hack-indictments-fsb-idINKBN16N0K4 of 500 million Yahoo email accounts that led to 2017 U.S. charges against two officers of Russia's FSB security agency accused of instructing outside criminal hackers. A Canadian defendant pleaded guilty to nine felony counts in the case, while charges against three Russians remain pending because they are outside of America's grasp.The White House said Biden will bring up ransomware attacks emanating from Russia when he meets Putin in Geneva on Wednesday in the wake of forced shutdowns at Colonial Pipeline and meatpacker JBS, which has extensive U.S. operations.
Putin told Russian state television that Moscow would be willing to hand over cybercriminals to the United States if Washington reciprocates. Biden on Sunday called that statement a sign of progress. White House and State Department officials declined to elaborate or say what Biden would seek from Putin.
Russian officials have denied control of criminal groups while calling hackers whose activities fulfill Kremlin objectives ""patriotic."" In public statements and private forums, major criminal groups warn affiliates not to attack targets in Russia. Many ransomware programs will not execute on devices that have keyboards set for the Russian language. 
In another U.S. criminal probe, Evgeniy Bogachev, a Russian national, was charged https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-leads-multi-national-action-against-gameover-zeus-botnet-and-cryptolocker-ransomware in 2014 with running GameOver Zeus, a variant of sophisticated bank-fraud software, and distributing early ransomware called Cryptolocker.
Though it was not part of the indictment, GameOver Zeus' pattern of data collection - searching infected computers for banking passwords and phrases including ""top secret"" - indicated a relationship with Russian intelligence, according to senior U.S. Justice Department official John Carlin, who oversaw the case during the Obama administration.
Increasingly, ransomware has moved toward bigger targets and toward stealing secrets instead of just encrypting them inside the targets. Both trends could fit with Russian government goals, said analyst Craig Williams (NYSE:WMB) of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)' Talos threat intelligence unit.
Evil Corp, a group that the U.S. Treasury has said is led by a Bogachev associate named Maksim Yakubets, became the first ransomware gang to focus on ""big game"" targets likely to pay more, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of cybersecurity technology company CrowdStrike. 
A 2019 U.S. Treasury Department sanctions order https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845 accused Yakubets both of carrying out large-scale crimes and taking FSB directions, ""acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf."" 
Yakubets was indicted https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens in the United States in 2019 for alleged hacking, wire fraud and bank fraud. The United States has offered millions of dollars in reward money for information leading to the arrests of Bogachev and Yakubets and published photographs of them, but they have not been apprehended by Russian authorities.
Analysts told Reuters Yakubets is married to the daughter of a former senior FSB operative. Reuters was unable to reach either man for comment.

Because the Treasury sanctions forbid U.S. ransomware targets from paying Evil Corp, the group keeps renaming its encryption software. 
One of the new variants is called Hades, according to CrowdStrike https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker.

467,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 04:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Representative Tom Suozzi, one of the leaders in Congress behind the push for an expansion of the state and local tax deduction, is considering proposing a one-time wealth tax on the richest Americans.
The New York Democrat is weighing a proposal for a one-off 2.5% levy on accumulated wealth over $50 million and a 5% tax on assets over $100 million, according to the Suozzi’s office. Rich individuals who would be subjected to the tax could pay the levy over five years. Dylan Smith, a spokesman for Suozzi, said he still in the “exploration phase” of developing the plan.
The tax could raise hundreds of billions of dollars in order to offset the cost of Suozzi’s proposal to lift the $10,000 limitation on state and local tax, or SALT, deductions.
The idea is a version of the wealth tax that Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary as a way to address wealth inequality. President Joe Biden has largely shied away from wealth taxes, preferring to focus on raising capital gains and income rates for top-earners and overhauling the corporate tax system.
Still, Suozzi’s idea could gain traction as Democrats hunt for revenue to fund their ambitious agenda. The tax could raise about $450 billion over a decade, according to estimates from Suozzi’s office.
Progressives’ Take
Suozzi and more than 20 other House Democrats from high-tax states have threatened to reject Biden’s tax plans unless they also addressed the SALT cap, which was imposed by President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul.
The White House has said that lawmakers could add SALT to legislation, but they would need to find other tax revenue to offset the cost. Some progressive Democrats, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, have dismissed lifting the cap, arguing it would mostly benefit the richest Americans.
Suozzi has also suggested raising the top individual tax rate to 39.6% from 37% to fund the SALT expansion, though Biden already has proposed that idea to fund other portions of his $4 trillion economic agenda. Representative Josh Gottheimer, who is co-leading the SALT effort with Suozzi, has said the more generous deduction should be paid for with additional money from increased IRS enforcement efforts.

The departure of John Demers, a holdover from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, had been arranged months ago, the Times reported. He is scheduled to leave on June 25.

The move follows reports of former President Donald Trump's Justice Department seizing records of lawmakers and journalists as part of an aggressive crackdown on leaks.
An internal Justice Department watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, said on Friday he would investigate whether it was proper for the department to use subpoenas to obtain those phone records.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Georgia Governor Brian Kemp this year signed into law sweeping voting restrictions sponsored by Republicans, with potentially big implications for how elections are administered in the battleground state in 2022, and the U.S. presidential contest of 2024.
Proponents say the legislation is needed to safeguard elections and restore voters' faith in the process. Opponents say it was born out of the Republican Party's ""Big Lie,"" the false claim that Democrat Joe Biden's defeat of incumbent President Donald Trump in November was the result of widespread fraud.
Below are some of the law's most consequential changes, according to interviews with a dozen county leaders of the Democratic Party, Republican officials and election experts in Georgia.
DROP BOXES
The law limits each county to one drop box per 100,000 active registered voters or one for each early voting location, whichever number is smaller. The change will lead to a sharp drop from the 330 drop boxes used across the state in November.
The biggest impact will be felt in the most populous counties. For instance, the total number of drop boxes in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett -- the four counties which encompass and surround Atlanta, and which contain more than a third of the state's Black population -- will shrink by three-fourths to 23, based on the latest voter data.
Moreover, the law says drop boxes must be placed inside early voting sites or at elections offices, and that they can only be used during early voting hours. In 2020, by comparison, drop boxes could be placed outdoors and made available to voters 24 hours a day and through the evening of Election Day.
ABSENTEE BALLOTS
Previously, a voter could request an absentee ballot as early as six months prior to an election and up until the Friday before an election. The new law cuts the window by more than half to 67 days.
The law also makes it illegal for election officials to mail absentee ballot applications to all voters, as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, did ahead of the state's June 2020 primary election as the coronavirus pandemic raged. Mail voting proved particularly popular among Democrats in November; nearly two-thirds of the 1.3 million absentee votes cast in Georgia went to Biden.
The law will also require voters for the first time to provide proof of identify when requesting an absentee ballot.
More than 272,000 registered voters don't have a driver's license or state ID on file with election officials; most are Black and live in Democratic-leaning counties, according to an analysis of voter data by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
STATE ELECTION BOARD
The law created a new chair of the State Election Board, filling a post previously held by the Secretary of State with a ""nonpartisan"" executive appointed through the state legislature. Republicans currently control the legislature.

The law also gives the State Election Board the ability to suspend county election officials for poor performance or violations of state election regulations. Democrats worry that provision will allow the Republican-controlled board to install Republican partisans to oversee election counts.
Republicans say guardrails are built into the law to prevent quick or easy removal. Such an action requires a minimum of three violations of election rules or demonstration of ""gross negligence"" or ""malfeasance"" over the span of two consecutive elections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top two Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Sunday vowed to probe the ""rogue"" actions of the Justice Department during former President Donald Trump's term, including its move to seize the communications records of Democratic lawmakers. 
Those reviews will run parallel with an investigation by the department's own internal watchdog https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-denounces-trump-attorney-generals-reported-actions-democrats-phone-2021-06-11 into its moves to subpoena phone records of Representatives Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, as part of a probe into leaks of classified information.
The Justice Department under former attorneys general William Barr and Jeff Sessions was regularly accused of putting Trump's personal and political interests ahead of the law.
""The Justice Department has been rogue under President Trump, understand that, in so many respects. This is just another manifestation of their rogue activity,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Her Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, vowed to subpoena both Barr and Sessions.
""This was nothing less than a gross abuse of power, an assault on the separation of powers,"" Schumer told a news conference in New York. ""They must testify, Sessions and Barr must testify under oath as part of a formal congressional investigation."" 
A White House official on Friday criticized the Trump administration actions as ""appalling.""
During a press conference at the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Britain, President Joe Biden could be seen holding a card with talking points on the issue.
""Trump abused power/Trump DOJ out of control. Now we have to clean it up,"" the card read, according to images captured by a U.S. network pool camera. ""I've made it clear this DOJ will reflect my values and principles and priorities -- not Donald Trump's.""
Biden was not asked about the probes during his news conference. 
Pelosi said the probe by the department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, would be important but was not a substitute for congressional investigation.
Pelosi said it was ""beyond belief"" for Barr or Sessions to say they knew nothing about it. Barr told Politico on Friday that he had no recollection of any congressman's phone records being subpoenaed.
Pelosi sidestepped a question about whether they would be subpoenaed, saying she hoped the pair would appear voluntarily.
Horowitz's office said on Friday it was launching a review of the department's use of subpoenas to obtain the communications records of both lawmakers and journalists, including whether ""improper considerations"" drove those decisions. 
The New York Times on Thursday reported that the Trump-era Justice Department subpoenaed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for data on Schiff and Swalwell.
Apple also told Donald McGahn, a Trump-era White House counsel, that the Justice Department had subpoenaed information about him in early 2018 -- and barred the company from notifying him of the request -- the Times reported on Sunday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm that account.
McGahn left the White House in 2018 after it emerged that he was a star witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
""It certainly appears that they were using the Justice Department to go after the president's political enemies. There's a lot we don't know, obviously,"" Schiff told MSNBC.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith said in a Washington Post opinion piece on Sunday that the Justice Department needs to ""tighten the use of gag orders and probes of Congress and the news media."" 
He added ""Congress should prohibit the executive branch from conducting its investigations wholly in secret absent a strong showing of necessity supported by compelling evidence."" 
ABUSE OF POWER?
Senator Susan Collins, one of that chamber's most moderate Republicans, said on Sunday that she supported the Justice Department's internal probe.
""Has the Justice Department abused its power by going after members of Congress or the press for partisan political purposes?"" she asked in an interview on CBS. She also noted that the question of whether members of Congress had leaked classified information -- which the Trump administration was probing in its subpoenas -- was a ""serious"" matter that also bore investigation.
Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, has come under fire from Democrats in recent weeks for a pair of decisions seen as shielding Trump from scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-defending-presidency-not-trying-save-trump-recent-legal-moves-2021-06-08. Legal experts said those decisions appeared to reflect a department focused on the law and protecting the institution of the presidency, not on political interests. 
Garland also said on Friday that the department would step up its enforcement of election law and warned that a series of unofficial audits of the November presidential election being carried out in a handful of U.S. states may be a violation of federal civil rights laws.

The department under Garland has said it will no longer seek source information from journalists, after CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post said the Trump administration tried secretly to obtain reporters' phone records.
Garland is due to meet with executives from all three outlets to discuss the leak probes on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY), a department spokesperson and representatives of the companies said.

ST BLAZEY, England (Reuters) -Britain's Queen Elizabeth met U.S. President Joe Biden under the canopy of the world's largest indoor rainforest on Friday as she hosted a reception for leaders of the Group of Seven richest nations, who are holding a three-day summit.
The 95-year-old monarch was joined by the other senior members of the British royal family, with son and heir Prince Charles and his wife Camilla and grandson Prince William and his wife Kate also present.
It was their first major public event together since the funeral in April of Prince Philip, the queen's husband of more than seven decades.
The reception hosted by the queen was held at the Eden Project, whose distinctive bubble-like Biomes house thousands of plant varieties. The project is near the Cornish seaside resort of Carbis Bay on the tip of southwest England, where the G7 summit is being held. 
As she sat for a photocall with the world leaders, Elizabeth quipped: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourselves?"", provoking laughter.
""Yes,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied. ""We have been enjoying ourselves in spite of appearances.""
The event was the monarch's first opportunity to meet Biden as U.S. President. He is the 13th U.S. leader she has greeted during her record-breaking 69-year reign.
""Joe and I are both looking forward to meeting the queen,"" Biden's wife Jill, who joined him at the Eden Project event, had said on Thursday. ""That's an exciting part of the visit for us."" 
They are also due to have tea with the monarch at Windsor Castle on Sunday after the summit has concluded.
Prince Charles also addressed https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-prince-charles-meets-ceos-campaign-more-sustainable-economy-2021-06-10 the G7 leaders about his Sustainable Markets Initiative, which aims to involve business and private sector investment in government efforts to combat climate change. 

""The fight against this terrible pandemic provides, if ever one was needed, a crystal-clear example of the scale, and sheer speed, at which the global community can tackle crises when we combine political will with business ingenuity and public mobilization,"" the prince told them.
""Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing it for the pandemic. So if you don't mind me saying so, we must also do it for the planet,"" said Charles, 72, who has spent much of his life campaigning on environmental issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday his Justice Department will aggressively enforce voting rights at a time when many Republican-led states are tightening election laws and supporters of former President Donald Trump continue to baselessly question his 2020 defeat.
Garland said the Justice Department will prosecute threats against election officials, double the number of prosecutors devoted to voting rights and closely examine how states conduct their elections. 
He said the Justice Department will scrutinize areas where Black voters have to wait in line longer than white voters to cast their ballots, a lingering problem in presidential election battleground states such as Georgia.
""There are many things that are open to debate in America but the right of all eligible citizens to vote is not one of them,"" Garland said in a speech at the Justice Department.
Garland's announcement marks a shift in policy for the Justice Department, which under Trump dropped several ambitious voting rights lawsuits and brought only one case under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark civil rights law.
That law required states with a history of discrimination to get permission from the Justice Department before changing the way they ran elections, until the Supreme Court struck down the provision in 2013. That led to a surge of changes in southern, Republican-led states that voting rights advocates say have disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic voters.
Garland urged Congress to restore that power to the Justice Department, which he said was used to block more than 1,000 proposed local election changes between 1965 and 2006. Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress, support the idea but have not yet introduced legislation on it this year.
The attorney general also urged Congress to pass a separate voting rights bill that has bogged down in the Senate, where Democrats lack the votes to advance it.
Following Trump's 2020 defeat, Republicans have passed a wave of new voting requirements and limits this year in battleground states such as Georgia, Florida and Arizona. Texas is expected to pass similar restrictions in coming months, over Democratic lawmakers' objections. 
Trump falsely claimed that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
A total of 14 U.S. states have enacted new laws that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. 
Garland did not make clear whether he would challenge any of those new laws in court. He said a Republican-led audit of the 2020 election in Arizona might amount to voter intimidation, but did not say whether the Justice Department would intervene.

Voting rights advocates praised Garland's announcement as a welcome reversal of course from the Trump administration even though it was short on promises of concrete action. 
""Let's see what the DOJ (Department of Justice) actually files in the coming months - that's the real test,"" University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen wrote on Twitter.

Security footage cited by lawmakers showed Mike Nearman, a Republican, opening a locked side door to the Capitol while the House was in session on Dec. 21 and allowing in a group of protesters, some of whom were armed. The intruders damaged property and clashed with law enforcement while calling for the arrest of Oregon's governor over her imposition of pandemic restrictions.
A video posted online five days before the breach showed Nearman advising protesters to text him when they were outside the Capitol in order to gain access to the building, according to the Oregon House resolution to remove Nearman. The lawmakers said Nearman had engaged in ""disorderly behavior"" by helping the protesters enter the building in defiance of COVID-19 safety protocols.
Nearman made a brief statement during the House debate on Thursday, saying the effort to expel him lacked due process and criticizing the legislature for an attitude he characterized as ""might makes right,"" according to local reports. 
The riot was part of a wave of far-right protests against state COVID-19 restrictions that swept the United States last year, picking up steam after former President Donald Trump baselessly claimed voter fraud underlay his loss to President Joe Biden in November.
Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Democrat who sponsored the resolution to remove Nearman, said in a statement posted on Twitter on Thursday that the House vote to remove one of its own members was ""unprecedented"" but ""the only reasonable path forward.""

Nearman's actions were ""blatant and deliberate, and he has shown no remorse for jeopardizing the safety of every person in the Capitol that day,"" she said in the statement.
The only Oregon lawmaker to vote against Kotek's resolution was Nearman himself, who is also being prosecuted on misdemeanor charges for allowing the rioters into the Capitol in December.

By Linda So
(Reuters) -The United States has a decentralized election system with wide variations in the way voting is run state to state, or even within the same state.
The practical administration of an election – from registering voters to organizing local polling places and counting ballots – is typically handled by counties, cities and towns. This is often done through a body known as a board of elections or commission of elections. In some small jurisdictions, the operation may be run by a single person.
Polling places on Election Day are usually staffed by temporary, paid workers who answer questions, verify IDs and guide voters through the process of casting their vote. In November, for instance, more than 4,000 people worked at polling sites across Georgia’s Fulton County, a region of about one million people. Several hundred were full-time county employees, but the rest were hired temporarily at a flat rate of between $235 to $405, depending on the position, to perform tasks such as check identification, according to the county.
In a 2017 report, the federal U.S. Election Assistance Commission found that 65% of jurisdictions across the country reported that it was “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” in the 2016 election to recruit enough poll workers. The pandemic exacerbated that problem last year. To address it, some states such as Maryland opened fewer polling places.
State governments play other roles, setting election-related rules, such as mail-in ballot requirements, and making sure they’re followed. State election officials run voter registration databases, test and certify voting equipment, and sometimes buy voting machines used across their state.

Twenty-four states – from Georgia to California – have an elected secretary of state as the chief election official, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In some states, the elected lieutenant governor is the chief election official. In others, the chief election official is appointed by the legislature or governor.
The federal government’s role has traditionally been minor but was expanded after the disputed 2000 presidential election to include setting standards for how elections are run. That includes, for instance, setting rules on the use of provisional ballots for people whose eligibility is questioned and advising states how to maintain voter registration databases. Other functions include providing money for voting equipment, helping states recruit poll workers and monitoring foreign interference.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration will return more than $2 billion in funds allotted under his predecessor Donald Trump to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to the military and devote other remaining money to construction site clean up, the White House budget office said on Friday.
The move will return funds to 66 military projects spanning 11 states, three U.S. territories and 16 countries, the White House said in a related fact sheet. The projects include $79 million to renovate a U.S. military school in Germany and $9 million for a firing range in Indiana.
Trump, a Republican, made the wall a signature part of his presidency, saying it was needed to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. During his four years in office, Trump secured about $15 billion for the project, including $10 billion in redirected U.S. military funds.
Biden, a Democrat, issued an executive order on Jan. 20 - his first day in office - that paused wall construction, saying ""a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution.""
The Biden administration said on Friday that it would use its legal authority to stop any new border wall construction while calling on Congress to redirect existing resources to technology-based border security.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, said on Thursday that his state would build its own border wall, but whether he has the resources and legal authority to do that remains unclear. Abbott and other Republicans have criticized Biden in recent months for rolling back Trump restrictions as the number of migrants arriving at the border has reached the highest monthly levels in two decades.
After Congress declined to provide money that Trump had requested for wall construction, his administration redirected funds appropriated by lawmakers for other purposes in order to pay for the project. Democrats accused Trump at the time of exceeding his power as president.

CARBIS BAY, England (Reuters) -Boris Johnson cast the Group of Seven summit as a ""gigantic media circus"" on Thursday after leaders were paraded before journalists and U.S. President Joe Biden walked arm-in-arm up the beach discussing democracy with France's Emmanuel Macron.
G7 summits are notorious for anodyne and slightly ridiculous photo opportunities which leave world leaders struggling to seem natural in bizarre contexts - for example meeting another world leader on a small, overcast English beach.
Under grey clouds, British prime minister Johnson, with ruffled blonde hair, and his new wife Carrie, greeted other G7 leaders and their partners on a specially constructed wooden gangway beside the Atlantic.
After the leaders returned for a socially distanced ""family photograph"", Germany's Angela Merkel urged Johnson ahead, telling him: ""You are the leader.""
French President Macron held back, making a few remarks to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, before Biden draped his arm around Macron who returned the embrace. They walked smiling, arm-in-arm along the walkway, discussing affairs of state. 
The Elysee Palace said Macron and Biden had talked about ""how to make democracies more efficient for the middle class and on China said there should be no confrontation but that we should defend our values and interests"".
As he opened the summit, Johnson said it would be hugely significant after the ""wretched pandemic"" and speculated that perhaps leaders could rebuild in ""a more gender neutral, a more feminine, way"".
Ordering the media to leave the meeting after his initial remarks, Johnson said: ""This is meant to be a fireside chat between the great democracies of the world - it's turned into a gigantic media circus in which we have to greet each other several times."" 
Such was the awkwardness of many of the staged encounters that U.S. first lady Jill Biden quipped: ""I feel like we are at a wedding"". Johnson, whose recent marriage is his third, said it was like ""walking down the aisle"".

President Biden urged journalists to go swimming, feigning an order: ""Everybody in the water."" 
When asked what his message would be to Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin when the two leaders meet in Geneva next week, Biden said: ""I'll tell you after I have delivered it.""

Still, Suga has attended many a G-7 when he was a top aide to previous prime minister Shinzo Abe, while Draghi is a veteran of plenty of high-stake meetings from his time as president of the European Central Bank.
As the leaders moved off again, Macron walked close to Biden and put his arm around the U.S. leader, leaning in for a chat as they strolled along the sandy boardwalk.

Covid-19 is set to dominate at least some of the proceedings with G-7 members keen to rebuff criticism they are guilty of vaccine nationalism with a collective pledge to donate an extra one billion shots for the rest of the world. The U.S. is among those that have faced a backlash for hoarding shots at home even as poorer countries grapple with spiking virus cases.
Also on the agenda is climate change, while the U.S. and U.K. are eager to build a more assertive front in managing China as it grows in economic and strategic clout. And then there’s the question of Vladimir Putin’s recent mischief on Russia’s western flank involving Ukraine and Belarus, plus Russian links to ransom ware attacks on companies in the U.S.
With everyone in one place for the first time in two years, Biden might just seize on the opportunity to solicit advice from his colleagues on how to handle Putin ahead of his big summit on Wednesday with the Russian president.
Biden was asked by reporters what he would tell Putin. “I’ll tell you after I deliver it,” he responded.

479,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - California officials on Thursday said the state has appealed a federal judge's decision to strike down its three-decade-old ban on assault-style weapons, saying the law is needed to prevent gun deaths.
The appeal challenges last week's ruling from U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego that the law illegally infringes upon the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms.
Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta told a news conference outside a San Francisco hospital they were confident the decision was flawed and would eventually be overturned.
""We're better than this,"" said a visibly frustrated Newsom, who also sharply criticized the judge.
The state will ask the appeals court to put the ruling on hold during the appeal; Benitez stayed his order from taking effect for 30 days, leaving the law in place for now.
California became the first state to ban assault weapons in 1989 in the wake of a school shooting that killed five children. Six other states and the District of Columbia have an assault weapons ban in place, according to the gun safety group Giffords.
A federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and Congress has not re-authorized the law in the face of Republican opposition.

Guns are a politically sensitive issue in the United States, which has the highest rate of gun ownership of any country, as well as a higher incidence of gun violence than other wealthy nations.
Two weeks ago, a gunman opened fire at a San Jose rail yard, killing nine people, part of a spate of high-profile mass shootings in Indiana, Colorado and Georgia, among other states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have obtained a conspiracy indictment against six California men associated with the Three Percenters right-wing militia, the latest in a series of such charges arising from the Jan. 6 riot by former President Donald Trump's supporters.
The indictment against the men was returned by a grand jury in the District of Columbia on Wednesday and made public on Thursday. They face charges including conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, which carries a 20-year maximum sentence,
The Justice Department said in a news release that four of the six men ""identify as members of Three Percenter militias,"" but that all of them chatted on the app Telegram to coordinate their actions on Jan. 6.
Two of the six men, Alan Hostetter and Russell Taylor, were seen a day before the riot with Roger Stone, a friend and adviser to Trump, during a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court against the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
About 30 people - including members of two other right-wing groups, The Oath Keepers and The Proud Boys - have been accused of conspiracy, the most serious charges related to the riot. Those pending cases are the largest and most complex of the roughly 500 brought by the Justice Department since the attack.
The other men charged in the indictment were Erik Scott Warner, Felipe Antonio ""Tony"" Martinez, Derek Kinnison and Ronald Mele.
Hostetter did not immediately respond to requests for comment and the names of defense counsel for the other five men were not immediately available. 
Founded in 2008, the Three Percenters is a loosely organized anti-government group that takes its name from the idea that only 3% of American colonists took up arms against the British in the 18th century American Revolution.
According to the indictment, Hostetter founded a group in 2020 called the American Phoenix Project that protested restrictions on public gatherings imposed as a public health measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. That group became a platform to advocate violence against government leaders, according to the indictment.
'BEARS SPRAY, KNIVES'
Beginning in December 2020, the six men hatched a plan using the encrypted messaging app Telegram to bring weapons to Washington and storm the Capitol, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said the men selected Jan. 6 because of a Dec. 19 Trump Twitter post stating: ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!""
Prosecutors said that on Dec. 29, Taylor told his accused co-conspirators on Telegram: ""I personally want to be on the front steps and be one of the first ones to breach the doors!""
The pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory, clashed with an overwhelmed police force, and invaded the House of Representatives and Senate chambers. The violence left five dead, including a police officer.
Trump granted a pardon to Stone in December, wiping away his conviction arising from a federal investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Stone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Four of the six men charged in the indictment — Warner, Martinez, Kinnison and Mele — traveled to Washington in a rented SUV, according to the court document.
Kinnison said in the Telegram group that they were driving rather than flying because they were bringing equipment including ""multiple cans of bear spray"" and ""knives.""

The bill includes more than $19 billion in grants for U.S passenger railroad Amtrak over five years, a dramatic increase over the average $2 billion in government funding the railroad received annually before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The proposal, negotiated by committee Chairwoman Senator Maria Cantwell and the top Republican on the panel, Senator Roger Wicker, would also invest $28 billion in freight and other networks that use more than one mode like rail, highways and seaports.
The Amtrak funding provides ""funding to address the Northeast Corridor project backlog, and encourages expansion of passenger rail corridors with state support,"" according to a fact sheet.
""With the economy rebounding, it’s imperative that our long-delayed transportation needs are addressed,"" Cantwell said.
Last month, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved a companion bipartisan bill to spend $303.5 billion on roads, highways and other surface projects over five years, a 34% increase over the last highway reauthorization bill approved in 2015.
Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize surface transportation funding. President Joe Biden has called for $1.7 trillion in infrastructure spending, including some of the proposals the committees are considering.
A Democratic-led House of Representatives panel approved a separate bill along party lines on Thursday that would authorize $547 billion on surface transportation spending over five years.
The Commerce bill directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue new safety standards to require future vehicles to be equipped with advanced drunk- and impaired-driving prevention technology, but give automakers at least two years before they would need to comply and would require the agency to ensure the technology is effective.
NHTSA estimates about 10,000 people are killed annually in alcohol-related crashes.
The legislation would eventually require automatic emergency braking systems for heavy-duty commercial motor vehicles and for all new motor vehicles to be equipped with crash-avoidance technologies like forward-collision warning and lane departure systems at a later date.

The bill mandates studying driver-monitoring systems to minimize driver distraction and disengagement and research on crashworthiness and evacuation standards for limousines. NHTSA could set new safety rules as a result. 
The bill does not include provisions to speed the advancement of self-driving cars sought by major automakers and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo unit.

482,"<span>Jun 10, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Republican and Democratic senators said Thursday they were open to considering the first change in the national gasoline tax since 1993 to help fund a bipartisan infrastructure spending package they plan to propose to President Joe Biden.
Indexing the gasoline tax -- currently 18.4 cents-per-gallon -- to a measure of inflation has been discussed by a bipartisan group of senators working on a compromise plan, according to Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who’s taken a leading role in those talks.
“It keeps it at the same value that it has today,” Romney said of indexing the tax.
Disagreement over how to pay for the biggest infrastructure bill in decades contributed to the breakdown in Biden’s direct talks with GOP senators led by Shelley Moore Capito earlier this week. The Focus of bipartisan negotiations has now shifted to the group including Romney, though some Democrats are eager to get moving on a go-it-alone strategy.
Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said Thursday he’s in favor of indexing the gas tax. Still, it’s unclear whether the White House would endorse such a move. The administration has opposed user fees as a mechanism for funding, saying it would put undue burdens on lower-income Americans. Biden has pitched tax hikes on companies and the wealthy, which the GOP rules out.
Spending Figure
“I’ll take a look at it,” Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who’s a participant in the talks, said with regard to indexing the tax. “The trust fund is in terrible shape,” he said. Gas tax revenues go to a dedicated so-called trust fund that’s used to pay for roadway and transit costs.
Romney separately said that the bipartisan group has reached an agreement on a top-line figure for the infrastructure package, without specifying to reporters what that number is.
Biden’s most recent figure was $1.7 trillion in the talks with Capito, down from an initial $2.25 trillion for his “American Jobs Plan.” The Capito group had proposed $257 billion in net new spending above amounts that Congress was expected to approve for coming years.
Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, who’s not been engaged in the bipartisan infrastructure talks, said he would look at any gasoline tax indexing proposal before commenting. He noted that Biden has a “reservation about this as a regressive tax” and highlighted the Democratic view that corporations are underpaying taxes now.
‘Better Chance’
“The question is how is the money to be raised and is it going to be done in a fair way,” Wyden said.
The last gasoline levy increase came under Bill Clinton’s administration, in a broad 1993 package of tax hikes aimed at reducing budget deficits at the time. It squeaked through without Republican votes.
Chuck Grassley, a veteran Iowa Republican, said Thursday about indexing the levy, “It’s better than increasing the gas tax and it has a better chance of getting done.” He also that if that had been done in the early 1990s “we wouldn’t be in the situation we are in now.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House lawyer Don McGahn told congressional investigators that he was ""perturbed"" by Donald Trump's efforts to shut down the U.S. Special Counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election, according to a transcript made public on Wednesday.
McGahn testified during a closed-door June 4 interview https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/former-counsel-tells-congress-trump-efforts-undercut-russia-probe-democrats-2021-06-04 that he felt ""trapped"" after a June 2017 phone call in which the then-president asked him to pressure a Justice Department official to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
""After I got off the phone with the President, how did I feel? Oof. Frustrated, perturbed, trapped,"" McGahn told House of Representatives investigators. ""Many emotions."" The transcript was released by the House Judiciary Committee.
McGahn's testimony last week marked the end of a two-year legal standoff between the House https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ex-white-house-lawyer-mcgahn-agrees-us-house-interview-panel-chairman-2021-05-13 and the Justice Department over whether executive branch officials can be forced to testify to Congress.
The testimony provided no new revelations about Trump's efforts to halt the Mueller investigation. An agreement between House lawyers and the Justice Department stipulated that McGahn's deposition would be limited to publicly available information contained in Mueller's report.
McGahn, who left his post in late 2018, was a key witness in Mueller's report on Russian interference in 2016 that saw Republican Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
McGahn told Mueller’s team that Trump repeatedly instructed him to have the special counsel ousted and then told him to deny having been so instructed when word of the action emerged in news reports. McGahn did not carry out either instruction.

After sitting for interviews with Mueller's team, McGahn in May 2019 declined to testify before a congressional panel investigating Trump's conduct.
The Justice Department at the time had advised McGahn to defy the subpoena, one of a number of refusals by Trump's administration as it sought to block congressional inquiries into his conduct.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday defended a decision by the Justice Department to continue to defend Donald Trump against a lawsuit by a writer who accused him of raping her decades ago and defaming her during his presidency.
""The job of the Justice Department in making decisions of law is not to back any administration, previous or present. Our job is to represent the American people,"" Garland said during testimony before a U.S. Senate appropriations panel.
""Sometimes it means that we have to make a decision about the law that we would never have made and that we strongly disagree with as a matter of policy.""
The Justice Department, which Garland leads, has been criticized https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-defending-presidency-not-trying-save-trump-recent-legal-moves-2021-06-08 by some Democrats over decisions to continue to back positions taken by the Republican Trump administration in pending litigation.
Writer E. Jean Carroll in a lawsuit alleges Trump defamed her when he called her a liar over her rape allegations, and said he could not have raped her because she was not his ""type."" 
Under previous Attorney General William Barr, the department defended Trump, arguing it was appropriate to do so because he was a government employee entitled to immunity under federal law from Carroll’s claims and said he spoke about her in his capacity as president. 

Last month, the department also appealed a court ruling that faulted Barr for his handling of the 2019 report by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. 
The department in that case is seeking to keep under wraps portions of a memo which was presented to Barr as he weighed how to handle the question of whether there was evidence to suggest that Trump had obstructed justice during Mueller's probe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog on Wednesday released a report finding that federal police did not clear protesters from a park near the White House last summer so that former president Donald Trump could walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity.
The report, by the U.S. Interior Department’s inspector general, said U.S. Park Police violently dispersed people from Lafayette Park on June 1, 2020 as part of a plan made earlier in the day for a contractor to install fencing.
The report stated that U.S. Park Police had begun implementing the fencing plan ""several hours"" before they knew of Trump's visit to the park, which occurred later that day.
""We found that the USPP had the authority and discretion to clear Lafayette Park and the surrounding areas on June 1,"" the government watchdog said in a summary of its findings. ""The evidence we obtained did not support a finding that the USPP cleared the park to allow the President to survey the damage and walk to St. John’s Church.""
The report recommended U.S. Park Police develop more detailed policies for dispersing crowds, and improve coordination between federal agencies.
The report drew criticism from congressional Democrats, who have faulted federal agents for their use of pepper spray to clear protesters from the square and street.
“I come away from this report skeptical of the version presented here,” said House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva, a California Democrat, in a statement.
“The Lafayette Square crackdown was played on repeat on televisions around the world and raised serious questions about why heavily armed law enforcement attacked peaceful civilians practicing their constitutional rights,"" Grijalva said. ""Not only does this report not answer those questions, it doesn’t even seem to acknowledge them.""

Trump called the report an ""exoneration"" in a statement.
""As we have said all along, and it was backed up in today’s highly detailed and professionally written report, our fine Park Police made the decision to clear the park to allow a contractor to safely install antiscale fencing,"" Trump said.

(Reuters) - A panel of federal appeals court judges blocked a Missouri law on Wednesday that banned abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, saying the provisions of the law violated the constitutional right of women to end their pregnancies. 
The law is among more than a dozen gestational age abortion bans that have been passed in recent years by Republican-led legislatures and challenged for their violation of the United States Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, which said women have a right to abortion before the fetus is viable, between 24 and 28 weeks. 
U.S. District Judge Howard Sachs in Kansas City had temporarily halted the Missouri law just days before it was due to go into effect in August 2019, saying it would negatively impact the rights of Missouri women. The decision on Wednesday by a three-judge panel in the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Sachs' ruling.
""Bans on pre-viability abortions are categorically unconstitutional,"" Judge Jane Kelly wrote in the opinion. 
Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in the United States, with opponents declaring it immoral on religious grounds and abortion rights advocates saying the option is necessary to ensure women's bodily autonomy.
Women's health provider Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties union filed the lawsuit challenging the 2019 ban, which only made exceptions for abortions after eight weeks in cases where there are medical emergencies. The law also banned women from seeking abortions because the fetus had Down's Syndrome. 
""Today's decision is a critical victory for Missourians,"" said Yamelsie Rodríguez, president of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, in a statement.
Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that he was ""disappointed"" in the Eighth Circuit's decision.

""We plan to seek review in the Supreme Court,"" he said. ""I have never and will never stop fighting to ensure that all life is protected.""
Last month, the Supreme Court signaled its willingness to weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade when it agreed to review a Mississippi law that would ban abortions before the fetus is able to live outside the womb. A decision in that case is expected in 2022.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's government on Wednesday praised U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris following talks aimed at curbing undocumented immigration, and said another top Biden administration official would visit next week for more discussions.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called Harris an ""extraordinary woman"" and said bilateral relations had broken new ground after the two leaders met in Mexico City on Tuesday as part of her first trip abroad since taking office.
""It's a completely new phase,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference. ""It was such a good meeting that I called her 'president'.""
Tasked by U.S. President Joe Biden with addressing the migration challenge, Harris has been under pressure from both Republicans and Democrats on the issue.
She agreed with Mexico to deepen economic ties and investment to alleviate poverty in Central America and curb immigration, as well as urging Guatemala to crack down on corruption.
Lopez Obrador's praise for the U.S. vice president contrasted with tensions under former President Donald Trump, who threatened to hurt Mexico economically if it did not reduce illegal immigration.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist, likened the Trump administration to Nazi Germany for its migration policies while he was in opposition, but acceded to the American president's demands to tighten the border after taking charge of Mexico in December 2018.
Illegal immigration to the United States leapt after Biden took power in January, again making Washington reliant on Mexico's help to stem the flow.
In contrast to his predecessor, Biden campaigned on a promise to improve the lot of migrants, and a sizeable portion of his Democratic base opposes efforts to curb the movement of people with measures they see as redolent of the Trump era.
Harris drew criticism from some Democrats for telling migrants ""Do not come"" during a visit to Guatemala earlier in the week before her talks with Lopez Obrador.
Mexico's importance in managing immigration has given the Lopez Obrador administration leverage to pursue more independent policies in other areas, Mexican officials say privately. 
During the U.S. presidential transition, Mexico made it tougher for American law enforcement agents to operate in the country, and Lopez Obrador said approvingly that in his talks with Harris, U.S. security aid for Mexico was not a topic, unlike in past times.
""We don't want military cooperation,"" said Lopez Obrador.
Harris' visit will be followed by a trip to Mexico by U.S. Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas on June 14 to work with Mexico on how to gradually lift pandemic-related curbs on their shared border, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said.
The talks with Mayorkas would be held on June 15, he added.

During her visit, Harris also pointed to Washington's interest in helping Mexico implement a new labor reform to improve workers' rights, which U.S. trade unions hope will help stem the flow of jobs south to lower-cost Mexico.
Lopez Obrador said Mexico needed to keep raising wages to narrow the gap between U.S. workers and their Mexican counterparts, citing the automotive sector as an example.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate voted 68-32 on Tuesday to approve a sweeping package of legislation intended to boost the country's ability to compete with Chinese technology.
An indignant China responded to the vote by saying it objected to being cast as an ""imaginary"" U.S. enemy.
The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, which is narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats.
The measure authorizes about $190 billion for provisions to strengthen U.S. technology and research - and would separately approve spending $54 billion to increase U.S. production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, including $2 billion dedicated to chips used by automakers that have seen massive shortages and made significant production cuts.
China's parliament expressed ""strong indignation and resolute opposition"" to the bill. It said in a statement that the U.S. bill showed ""paranoid delusion of wanting to be the only winner"" and had distorted the original spirit of innovation and competition.
""We firmly object to the United States seeing China as an imaginary enemy,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing.
The bill must pass the House of Representatives to be sent to the White House for Biden to sign into law. It is not clear what legislation in the House will look like or when it might take it up.
The bill has a number of other China-related provisions including prohibiting the social media app TikTok from being downloaded on government devices, and would block the purchase of drones manufactured and sold by companies backed by the Chinese government. It would also allow diplomats and Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the United States on official businesses.
It would also create broad new mandatory sanctions on Chinese entities engaged in U.S. cyberattacks or theft of U.S. intellectual property from U.S. firms, and provides for a review of export controls on items that could be used to support human rights abuses.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a co-sponsor of the measure, warned of the dire consequences of not funding research to keep up with China.
""If we do nothing, our days as the dominant superpower may be ending. We don’t mean to let those days end on our watch. We don’t mean to see America become a middling nation in this century,"" Schumer said.
Biden praised the bill: ""We are in a competition to win the 21st century, and the starting gun has gone off ... We cannot risk falling behind.""
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said the funding could result in seven to 10 new U.S. semiconductor plants.
Many U.S. companies praised the bill. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said the legislation ""represents an important step to address the semiconductor shortage that continues to impact U.S. automotive manufacturing.""
Some critics have likened the Senate funding effort to China's high-tech industrial development push, dubbed ""Made in China 2025,"" which long irked the United States.
The bill also seeks to counter Beijing’s growing global influence through diplomacy, by working with allies and increasing U.S. involvement in international organizations after Republican former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda.

Senator Maria Cantwell noted the bill would authorize NASA spending and its Artemis mission to the Moon. 
""As China has made it clear, they're going to Mars, we are going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars,"" Cantwell said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday broke off talks on an infrastructure bill with a key Republican, instead reaching out to a bipartisan group, after one-on-one talks with Senator Shelley Capito were described as hitting a ""brick wall.""
Biden changed course after Capito, the leader of a group of six Senate Republicans handling the negotiations, offered $330 billion in new spending on infrastructure, far short of Biden's reduced $1.7 trillion offer.
""He informed Senator Capito today that the latest offer from her group did not, in his view, meet the essential needs of our country,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.
""He offered his gratitude ... but expressed his disappointment that, while he was willing to reduce his plan by more than $1 trillion, the Republican group had increased their proposed new investments by only $150 billion,"" Psaki said.
Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the talks ""seem to be running into a brick wall.""
Capito had a five-minute call with the Democratic president on Tuesday, a Capito spokesperson said.
""After negotiating in good faith and making significant progress to move closer to what the president wanted, I am disappointed by his decision,"" Capito said in a statement.
Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, gave new life to the possibility of some sort of a bipartisan bill being cobbled together that could ultimately be paired with a Democratic-only bill to achieve more of the administration's $2 trillion investment goals.
Republicans have been talking about a far more modest package of less than $1 trillion, with much of the money coming from initiatives already enacted into law, such as COVID-19 relief.
A bipartisan group of senators met on Tuesday to discuss the next steps on infrastructure. Republicans including Bill Cassidy, Mitt Romney and Rob Portman, and Democrats, including key swing votes Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, were among those in attendance.
The senators emerged from the meeting encouraged about the discussions, but offered no concrete time line.
Romney said they reached fairly good agreement on specific items but were a “a little less solid” on how to pay for them. He said they could release some details in the coming weeks.
LIBERALS GROW WARY
Some liberal members https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-democrats-restless-over-bidens-infrastructure-talks-with-republicans-2021-06-04 of Biden's party have become worried that the talks are dragging on for too long and may result in a smaller package than the country needs. They are keenly aware of the risk that they could lose their narrow majority in either or both chambers of Congress in next year's congressional elections, making progress on Biden's agenda urgent now.
The two parties remain far apart https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/republicans-vs-biden-whats-their-infrastructure-plans-2021-04-22 on one of Biden's major domestic policy goals, disagreeing on how much to spend, how to pay for it and even what constitutes infrastructure.
The White House has offered to whittle down its package of proposals, which include climate change, home healthcare and education initiatives, to $1.7 trillion. It also includes spending on more traditional infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges.
""I'm working hard to find common ground with Republicans when it comes to the American Jobs Plan, but I refuse to raise taxes on Americans making under $400,000 a year to pay for it,"" Biden wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. ""It's long past time the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share."" 
Biden also reached out to Cassidy on Tuesday to discuss infrastructure, the Republican said.

""POTUS just called to discuss infrastructure,"" Cassidy wrote on Twitter. ""I brought up flood resiliency and energy provisions that would benefit Louisiana as well as the rest of our nation. Strongly support @SenCapito's efforts. Any infrastructure package should and must be bipartisan.""
Administration officials had said Biden would not let the negotiations drag on endlessly. On Wednesday, he leaves on the first foreign trip of his presidency, to attend a G7 Summit in Cornwall, England.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe easily won the Democratic nomination on Tuesday for the state's gubernatorial election, securing his spot in a race that could signal where voters stand after the divisive 2020 presidential contest.
McAuliffe, a 64-year-old moderate who served as governor from 2014 to 2018, was leading four other candidates, with more than 60 percent of the vote with 2,063 precincts of 2,584 reporting. Major news organizations projected him the winner shortly after polls closed at 7 p.m. 
He will face off against the Republican nominee, former private equity executive Glenn Youngkin, 54, in the general election on Nov. 2.
If McAuliffe wins that contest, he would become Virginia's second two-term governor since the U.S. Civil War. The state's constitution prohibits governors from serving consecutive terms.
""Thank you Virginia!!!"" he tweeted on Tuesday night.
A longtime Democratic fundraiser with close ties to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe benefited from his political experience and popularity in the state party.
On the campaign trail, he touted his achievements as governor, which included expanding voting rights for ex-felons and overseeing a drop in unemployment and a rise in personal income. 
McAuliffe was backed by much of the state's Democratic establishment, including some three dozen state legislators and Democratic Governor Ralph Northam. 
The Virginia governor's race is seen as a test for both parties following Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 presidential victory and could be a bellwether of voter sentiment ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats will be looking to maintain control of the U.S. Congress.
""If the Republicans can manage to recapture Virginia, which has clearly moved in a Democratic direction, the prospects for Democrats in the midterm elections in 2022 will be dimmed; there's just no doubt about it,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.
PROGRESSIVES FALL SHORT
Virginia has become more Democratic in recent years. No Republican has won statewide office in the Southern state since 2009, and Democrats have controlled both chambers of the legislature since 2019. Republican former President Donald Trump lost Virginia in 2020 by 10 percentage points, double his margin of defeat in the state in 2016.
If elected governor, McAuliffe's ability to pass his agenda may hinge on whether Democrats can retain their slight majority in the state legislature. But McAuliffe's victory suggests the state's Democrats still favor an establishment politician over a more progressive newcomer.
In second place was former state Representative Jennifer Carroll Foy, with about 20% of the vote, followed by state Senator Jennifer McClellan at about 11%. They had both been seeking to become the first woman and the first Black woman elected Virginia governor. 

McAuliffe's campaign has raised more than $12 million, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, and Youngkin's has raised nearly $16 million. 
Unlike many other Republican candidates seeking Trump's favor, Youngkin has not echoed the former president's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. But Youngkin's vow to make voting security one of his top priorities plays to the concerns of Republicans nationally.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday defended herself from Republican critics who criticized her for making her first international trip to Mexico and Guatemala instead of visiting the U.S. border with Mexico, saying she has visited the border and will do so again.
After meeting with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City, Harris told reporters she had ""been to the border before and will go again."" 
Harris, who was a U.S. Senator from California starting in 2017 and traveled the country running for president in 2020, did not specify when she last visited the border.
President Joe Biden has asked her to work on reducing the number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. She has said her main focus is on root causes, as well as acute causes, of migration. She also visited Guatemala on her first trip abroad since taking office. 
Some Republican lawmakers have called on Harris to instead get a first-hand look at the border, where migration has reached its highest levels in 20 years and where they say help is urgently needed.
Harris, who has not made a trip to the border since becoming vice president, did not say when she might visit.
She defended her choice to make the visits south of the border in response to repeated questions from reporters, underscoring the Biden administration's push to tackle deeper reasons for migration from Central America. 
""You can't say you care about the border without caring about the root causes,"" Harris said. 
However, she also described the situation at the U.S. southern border as a ""legitimate, correct"" concern. 
Harris noted U.S.-Mexico cooperation over border security includes ""the work of processing migration within the country of Mexico and its southern border."" 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki also said she did not have a timeline for a potential trip, but emphasized Harris' job was to focus on the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

""Her assignment was to work with countries and leaders in the Northern Triangle to address root causes, address corruption, and sure, we're working together to address humanitarian concerns,"" Psaki told reporters at the White House.
""We're not taking advice from former President Trump or most of the Republicans who are criticizing us on this,"" Psaki added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven U.S. civil rights leaders met with Senator Joe Manchin to urge the Democrat to drop his opposition to a sweeping election reform bill backed by his party, but the West Virginian emerged from the virtual meeting unmoved.
The bill is a Democratic response to a slew of measures making their way through Republican-controlled state legislatures, which voting-rights activists say would limit the ability of some voters to go to the polls.
The state bills' backers contend they are needed to prevent election fraud, which is rare in the United States but which former President Donald Trump falsely and loudly claims resulted in his November loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
""Democracy is under the kind of attack we have not seen since the Jim Crow days ... this is not just the South. It’s all across the nation,"" said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League civil rights organization, in a telephone interview after the meeting with Manchin. ""This is a systematic effort to shrink the electorate."" 
Morial said he hoped Manchin would agree to further talks. 
Two days before the meeting, Manchin said he would oppose legislation already approved by the House of Representatives that would expand Americans' ability to cast votes by mail, lengthen in-person voting hours and make certain campaign contributions more transparent.
The moderate senator from West Virginia, a state that is overwhelmingly Republican, has been under intense pressure from Democrats to support major legislative initiatives ranging from COVID-19 relief to policing and election reforms.
His support is crucial in the Senate, where Democrats hold the slimmest of majorities. 
Following the more than hour-long meeting conducted remotely, Manchin spoke briefly to reporters and described a conversation that was ""respectful"" and ""excellent,"" noting the talks would continue.
But he added, ""I don't think anybody changed positions.""
The NAACP and the National Action Network were also among the participants in the call. 
The civil rights groups issued a joint statement in which they ""conveyed to Senator Manchin that a minority of senators must not be able to abuse the filibuster to impede much needed progress.""
Under Senate rules, at least 60 votes of support are needed in the 100-member chamber to advance most legislation and end ""filibusters"" that prevent roll-call votes on bills.
Manchin also has said he would oppose changing Senate rules to modify or scrap the filibuster.

Instead, he has voiced support for a narrower bill restoring a requirement that certain states and counties get federal approval before redrawing congressional districts.
But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who last month said ""100% of our focus is on stopping this new administration,"" on Tuesday proclaimed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as ""unnecessary.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Senate committees assessing security at the U.S. Capitol in light of January's deadly attack recommended giving the Capitol Police chief greater authority on Tuesday and developing plans for rapid response by the Pentagon. 
In a statement, U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) welcomed the report and said it had already changed its operations planning to focus on national security, but continued to point to U.S. intelligence failures to warn of the attack.
During the Jan. 6 riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, the Pentagon spent hours assessing pleas for help from Capitol Police, the committees found in a bipartisan report. The violence left five dead. 
When finally deployed by the Pentagon, D.C. National Guard troops did not arrive at the Capitol until about 5:20 p.m., nearly three hours after they were requested, and by which time the House and Senate chambers had already been declared secure.
The Senate Rules and Homeland Security committees in the report recommended empowering the Capitol Police chief to ask directly for D.C. National Guard help in an emergency. The current procedure requires the chief to get a Capitol Police Board emergency declaration first then Pentagon authorization, though board approval did not happen on Jan. 6.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Rules committee, said she and Republican Senator Roy Blunt would introduce legislation to make the change.
A Senate aide said the committees found no evidence of foot-dragging at the White House that delayed the National Guard response.
The 95-page document noted that Trump encouraged his supporters to go to the Capitol. A copy of his speech was appended to the report, but it did not discuss his role.
The committee leaders acknowledged the report confined its focus to intelligence gathering, security preparations and emergency response. It did not explore the motivation for the attack.
The USCP, in its statement, reiterated its stance that it was prepared for a large demonstration but did not know ""thousands of rioters were planning to attack,"" adding improvements were needed in intelligence analysis and distribution, both at the federal level and within its own force.
Gary Peters, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told reporters the report was not intended to be a substitute for a bipartisan commission that could investigate further.

Late last month, Senate Republicans blocked legislation to set up a bipartisan commission that would have the power to force witnesses, possibly including Trump, to testify under oath about what happened that day. Republican opponents said the Senate committees' probe, as well as ongoing prosecutions, were enough investigation.
The Senate committees said they did not get all the information they had sought from several agencies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is conducting a government-wide review to get to the bottom of who or what caused the suspected ""directed"" radio frequency attacks that on U.S. diplomats that resulted in various neurological ailments known as ""Havana syndrome"", U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday.
If Washington would have suspicions that a state actor including Russia or others are involved in this, it would bring it up with them, Blinken said but added that the United States at this point still does not know what or who is causing these incidents.
""We are in the midst, at the President's direction, with the National Security Council in the lead, of coordinating a government-wide review, including the intelligence community, the State Department, the Defense Department, to try to get to the bottom of what caused them, who did it, if anyone did, and of course care for any people who may have been victimized by it,"" Blinken said.
It was not clear when the review would conclude.
Starting in 2016, dozens of staff in Cuba reported symptoms including hearing loss, ringing ears, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with mild traumatic brain injury and initially described as the result of “sonic” or health attacks of some sort. 
Dozens of U.S. government employees were affected by the incidents, with New York Times reporting last month that the mysterious injuries had afflicted more than 130 people, far more than previously known, and to civil servants in locations such as Europe and elsewhere in Asia, with some episodes having taking place as recently as this year.
In April, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said the incidents appeared to be increasing and the committee was investigating.
Asked if President Joe Biden would raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin in their planned meeting in Geneva next week, Blinken repeated that Washington still did not know the root cause or the perpetrator, if any, of these incidents.
""So certainly if we have concerns, suspicions or beliefs that any state actor, Russia or otherwise was involved ... you can be sure that we will take it to them. But right now, we simply do not know,"" he said.

On Monday, Senate unanimously passed additional financial support for care of U.S. diplomats who have suffered from these syndromes.
The State Department said in June 2018 it had brought home diplomats from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering similar symptoms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative media outlet Newsmax, a favorite of former President Donald Trump's, rejected embattled Republican U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz's request for a job, a spokesperson for the website said on Monday.
Gaetz contacted Newsmax early this year, a source at the outlet said. That was around the time that news broke Gaetz was the subject of a federal investigation into possible sex trafficking of a minor.
Investigators are seeking to determine whether Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old, according to news reports and a law enforcement source who spoke with Reuters. He has not been charged with any crimes and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
Spokespeople for Gaetz, a vocal Trump supporter, had no immediate comment about any Newsmax job rejection.
""Newsmax has had no plans to hire Rep. Gaetz,"" said Brian Peterson, a spokesperson for the website. 
A source familiar with Newsmax's policies said: ""Earlier this year, (Gaetz) reached out and said he might leave Congress early and was interested in TV work."" 
The three-term Florida congressman's approach to Newsmax management was ""just a conversation"" and Newsmax ""never told him we were interested"" in hiring him, the source said.
Joel Greenberg, a Gaetz associate and former Florida county official, recently pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking a female minor to other adult men who engaged in sex acts with the minor. Prosecutors named no other men.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vermont's Republican governor on Monday signed a law requiring the state's top election official to send a mail ballot to every eligible voter, becoming one of the few Republican leaders at the state level to buck their party's trend of trying to limit voting access.
The law signed by Governor Phil Scott makes permanent a universal mail-in voting system that Vermont adopted in 2020 to address the challenges to voting in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. It puts Vermont in the company of just six other U.S. states that automatically mail ballots to all eligible voters.
Republicans have passed a wave of new voting requirements and limits this year in battleground states such as Georgia, Florida and Arizona, citing a need to stamp out alleged electoral fraud that former President Donald Trump says, without evidence, cost him the November election. 
Democrats and voting rights advocates have sued state officials over the measures and denounce them as partisan power grabs. State and federal judges have dismissed more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump or his allies alleging fraud and other irregularities in November.
But some Republicans lawmakers and election officials in states that are less competitive in national elections, such as Vermont, Kentucky and Oklahoma, say their party should be making it easier to vote, not harder – and support legislation to do just that. 
Pending bills to expand early voting and voter identification options in Louisiana and Indiana, both states Trump handily carried in November, also have Republican support.
""Republicans in Vermont reject the narrative being pushed out by Trumpers across the nation that making voting more accessible is ruining our democracy,"" said state senator Corey Parent, a Republican, who supported the universal mail-in voting bill that Scott signed into law on Monday. 
""We have to win elections on our ideas, not through these other unfortunate measures,"" Parent told Reuters.
In November, Biden won Vermont with 66% of the vote.
Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature passed a measure in April that expanded early voting and in-person voting options, created an online voter registration portal, and allowed voters to fix absentee ballots if they made errors.
In Oklahoma, the Republican-majority legislature and governor enacted a law in May extending early voting in general elections. 
Voter advocates still criticize some elements of the laws. Eliza Sweren-Becker, a voting rights and elections counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the Kentucky law limited the period in which voters could apply for absentee ballots and created a process for purging voters from the rolls, while the Oklahoma law shortened the time in which voters could return absentee ballots.
Sweren-Becker said the voting expansions in both states and Vermont reflect the fact that none of the states are highly competitive in general elections. 
""When you're not in a state where the margins are expected to be so close, that same voter suppression motivation is not necessarily at play,"" she said.
Kentucky's Republican Secretary of State, Michael Adams, told Reuters voter fraud was not a major threat in Kentucky, though he acknowledged that some Kentuckians are concerned about it ""because they have a lower level of knowledge about how elections work.""
Adams said he worked with the state's Democratic governor to push voting reforms sought by both parties.
""This could have been a bill like what you saw in Texas or elsewhere, because the Republicans have super majorities, but they chose not to do that,"" he said.
In Oklahoma, the majority leader of the state House of Representatives, Republican Jon Echols, said he threw his support behind the expansion to early voting after seeing hours-long lines at polling places in his district in November.

Like Adams, he saw no evidence of voter fraud in his state.
He said the legislature chose to move the deadline for requesting absentee ballots up to 15 days before an election from seven days previously, in accordance with recommendations the U.S. Postal Service sent Oklahoma's election board last year. Echols said his own mail-in ballot was not counted in November because it did not arrive on time.

Speaking at a White House briefing, Jake Sullivan said the eastern Mediterranean, Syria, Iran, as well as the role that Turkey will play in Afghanistan as the United States withdraws from the country will be part of the ""expansive agenda"".
In addition, the meeting, planned to take place on June 14 on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels, will also review their ties and look for ways on how the United States and Turkey deal with some of their ""significant differences on values and human rights and other issues"", Sullivan said.
""President Biden knows Erdogan very well, the two men have spent a good amount of time together and they're both, I think, looking forward to the opportunity, to really have a business like opportunity to review the full breadth of the relationship,"" Sullivan said.

Ankara and Washington have been struggling to repair ties, strained in recent years over several issues, including Turkey's purchase of Russian defence systems which resulted in U.S. sanctions, policy differences in Syria, as well as Washington's alarm over Ankara's human rights track record.
The two NATO allies also have differing views in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as well as Ankara's oil and gas ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean while Turkey's potential role in Afghanistan in the aftermath of planned U.S. pullout could serve as an area of cooperation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Monday proposed cracking down on accessories that can be used to convert pistols into rifles and released model legislation to help states prevent guns from getting into the hands of the mentally ill, as part of a broader push to reduce gun violence.
The two measures are part of a series of steps the Biden administration previously pledged to take, as mass shootings have continued to plague the United States. In 2021 alone, the country has had 254 mass shootings, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive.
“The Justice Department is determined to take concrete steps to reduce the tragic toll of gun violence in our communities,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. 

The proposed rules released on Monday would regulate so-called stabilizing braces, which can be used to convert pistols into rifles, under the federal National Firearms Act. The Justice Department said it is concerned that people have been able to purchase them without going through a background check and without having to abide by any registration requirements.
The Justice Department previously unveiled a separate proposal to regulate so-called ghost guns which can be self-assembled at home and which have also allowed people to skirt federal regulations.

LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will warn British Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to renege on the Northern Ireland Brexit deal when they meet for the first time at the G7 summit this week, The Times reported on Monday, citing unidentified sources.
Preserving the delicate peace in Northern Ireland without allowing the United Kingdom a back door into the European Union's markets through the 310-mile (500 km) Irish land border was one of the most difficult issues of the Brexit divorce.
The British-run region remains deeply split along sectarian lines 23 years after a peace deal brokered by the United States largely ended three decades of bloodshed. Many Catholic nationalists aspire to unification with Ireland while Protestant unionists want to stay part of the United Kingdom.
The EU and Britain tried to solve the border riddle with the Northern Ireland Protocol of the Brexit agreement, which keeps the province in both the United Kingdom's customs territory and the EU's single market.
But unionists say it contravenes the 1998 peace deal and London has said the Protocol is unsustainable in its current form after supplies of everyday goods to Northern Ireland were disrupted. 
Biden, who is proud of his Irish heritage, will use a meeting with Johnson on Thursday to explicitly express U.S. support for the Protocol. He will also warn that the prospects of a U.S. trade deal with the United Kingdom will be damaged if the situation remains unresolved, The Times said.

Biden will also make clear to the European Union that he expects it to stop being ""bureaucratic"" and adopt a more flexible approach to the implementation of the agreement, The paper said.
David Frost, Johnson's Brexit negotiator, is seeking to resolve the issues over the Brexit deal but the situation on the ground in terms of trade is ""very difficult"", Lucy Frazer, a government minister as Solicitor General for England and Wales, told Sky News.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial swing vote in the U.S. Senate, announced on Sunday he intends to oppose a sweeping voting rights bill backed by the majority of his fellow Democrats that would expand access to voting across the United States.
Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Manchin said the bill, known as the For the People Act, ""is the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I'm not supporting that because I think it will divide us further.""
Manchin is key to control of the U.S. Senate, which is divided equally between Democrats and Republicans. He has at times proven to be a thorn in the Biden administration's side by crossing party lines to oppose legislation or block White House appointees. 
He has also continually opposed efforts to eliminate the filibuster, which would make it easier for Democrats to pass legislation.
Manchin's intention to oppose the voting rights bill if it is brought to the Senate floor will complicate matters for Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has vowed to advance the legislation despite having no support from Republicans.
The bill would require states to expand mail-in voting, which was used widely in last year's presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic, and it would also lengthen the hours of in-person balloting.
Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the lead sponsor of the For the People Act, said in a statement he is disappointed by Manchin's position, but he would not give up.
""I am open to any conversation about the provisions of this bill, and will not give up on American democracy,"" he said.
Republican-controlled state legislatures in places such as Texas and Georgia have since sought to greatly scale back mail-in voting, as former President Donald Trump has continued to make false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.
Manchin outlined in greater detail his opposition to the voting rights bill in an op-ed published on Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, saying he is concerned by the total lack of Republican support for the measure.
""Voting and election reform that is done in a partisan manner will all but ensure partisan divisions continue to deepen,"" he wrote. 
Manchin said he would throw his support behind an alternative voting bill that has received broader bipartisan support, called the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
Named for the late Congressman John Lewis, the bill would restore the need for certain states and counties to see approval from the federal government before re-drawing voting districts, a legal requirement that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in its landmark 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision.
""My Republican colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, has joined me in urging Senate leadership to update and pass this bill through regular order,"" he wrote.

He also attacked Democrats for seeking to eliminate the filibuster, saying ""absolute power corrupts absolutely.""
""What I’ve seen during my time in Washington is that every party in power will always want to exercise absolute power, absolutely. Our founders were wise to see the temptation of absolute power and built in specific checks and balances to force compromise that serves to preserve our fragile democracy,"" he wrote.

508,"<span>Jun 06, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. officials on Sunday ratcheted up pressure on companies and foreign adversaries to fight cybercriminals, and said President Joe Biden is considering all options, including a military response, to counter the growing threat.
The Biden administration is looking at ""all of the options,"" to defend the country against ransomware criminals, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview on Sunday, when asked if military action was being considered. 
Raimondo did not detail what those options could look like, but said the topic will be on the agenda when the president meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month. The rising threat of cyberattacks has pushed the Biden administration into a more aggressive stance against Russia, which is thought to be harboring some of the perpetrators. 
""We're not taking anything off the table as we think about possible repercussions, consequences or retaliation,"" Raimondo said.
Last weekend, the world's largest meatpacker was targeted by cybercriminals and in May, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States was attacked, stoking fears over supply disruptions of food and fuel.
U.S. adversaries have the ability to shut down the country's entire power grid, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said separately in an interview with CNN, noting ""thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector"".
The recent high-profile attacks have prompted Biden to put the issue of Russia harboring hackers on the agenda for his meeting with Putin.
The White House plans to use the June 16 summit to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials say. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say.
U.S. officials are asking private companies to be more vigilant and transparent about attacks. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday said the May attack on Colonial Pipeline, which created temporary gasoline shortages, showed the national implications of a hack on a private company.
""Part of our vulnerability on cybersecurity is you're only as strong as your weakest link,"" he said in an interview with CBS.
Companies need to alert the federal government when they are targeted, Granholm said, and stop paying attackers. ""You shouldn't be paying ransomware attacks, because it only encourages the bad guys,"" she said.

While she opposes ransomware payments, she said she is uncertain whether Biden or Congress is prepared to outlaw them.
Companies should be required to report ransomware attacks, Democratic Senator Mark Warner from Virginia said on Sunday, though he stopped short of saying he supported making such payments illegal.

""But I will tell you the House will start their markup on Wednesday,"" she said, referring to preparation of the legislation. 
President Joe Biden will discuss deal possibilities with the main Republican negotiator on infrastructure, Senator Shelley Moore Capito, on Monday for the third time, after rejecting Republicans' latest bill offer on Friday.
The Republican offer included just over $300 billion in new spending to fix U.S. roads, bridges, broadband and other public works, the White House said. Biden is asking for at least $1 trillion in new spending. 
""The president is leading us to continue to stay at the table,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on ABC on Sunday. ""So we won't do this forever, but right now there's good faith efforts on both sides and we're going to continue the work of doing our job and trying to get a bipartisan agreement.""
The Republican offer ""did not meet the president's objectives,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CBS. ""This is not just about getting through this season or some short-term stimulus,"" he said. 

The administration's ""strong preference"" is to keep infrastructure spending bipartisan, Buttigieg added. 
Democrats hold a narrow majority in the House, and theoretical control of the Senate, because it is split 50-50 between both parties, and Vice President Kamala Harris acts as a tie-breaker. Any infrastructure bill sought by Biden must be backed by all Democrats and 10 Republicans, or pass through a process called reconciliation along party lines.

GREENVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump on Saturday sharply attacked U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, demanded reparations from China and denounced an investigation into his finances in a speech in North Carolina.
Speaking in Greenville, North Carolina, at the state's Republican Party convention, Trump joined a chorus of Republican politicians who are criticizing Fauci for asking Americans to wear masks to guard against the virus and who at times has been skeptical of a theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.
Trump called Fauci ""not a great doctor but a great promoter"" for his frequent television appearances. ""But he's been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong on Wuhan and the lab also,"" Trump said.
The origin of the virus remains hotly contested and remains under study by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Trump's own handling of the pandemic, in which nearly 600,000 people in the United States have died and he himself was infected, was a factor in his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election.
Trump called on China to pay $10 trillion in reparations to the United States and the world for its own handling of the virus, and he said nations should cancel their debt to Beijing.
Trump's appearance had all the hallmarks of his signature campaign rallies complete with a musical playlist heavy on Elton John standards.
North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley introduced Trump as ""our president,"" a nod to the former president's baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through voter fraud, which Trump called ""the crime of the century.""
Trump said a criminal investigation launched by the New York attorney general's office is ""the ultimate fishing expedition,"" and said it was the latest attempt by Democrats to bring him down after two impeachment sagas when he was president.
""It's been a five-year witch hunt, hoax after hoax,"" said Trump. ""They'll never stop until November of 2024.""
New York Attorney General Letitia James has been investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely reported property values to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.
Trump vowed to help Republicans in 2022 congressional elections and endorsed U.S. Representative Ted Budd for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina after his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said she would not run.
He appeared to dangle a possible run himself for president in 2024, saying he was looking forward to that year. Advisers say Trump, who faces a potential indictment in New York over his business dealings, has been discussing the possibility of another presidential campaign.
Trump emerged from seclusion for the Saturday event, the first in a planned series of speaking engagements this summer.

“The survival of America depends upon our ability to elect Republicans at every level, starting with the midterms next year,"" Trump said.
Lara Trump announced on stage she had considered running for the North Carolina Senate seat but opted not to do so in 2022 in order to care for her young children. But she did not rule out a run in the future.

MIAMI (Reuters) - For Benji Backer, being conservative means believing in limited government, market-based solutions -- and the scientists who say carbon emissions must be cut to avoid the worst of climate change. 
Backer's nonprofit, the American Conservation Coalition, held what it billed as the country’s first conservative climate rally in Miami, part of an effort by the 23-year-old activist to convince fellow right-leaning Americans they don’t have to be liberals to support action on the issue. 
It included a handful of Republican politicians from south Florida, which faces climate threats including tidal floods from rising seas, stronger hurricanes, and health risks from higher temperatures and humidity.
""The environment does not have a preferred political party,"" Backer said from a podium overlooking a bay near where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proposed a $6 billion sea wall. ""Today conservatives are reclaiming our seat at the environmental table.""
An avid skier and hiker, Backer began organizing ACC while a college freshman and becoming dismayed with then-President Donald Trump, who said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese. The group said it hopes its membership, currently in the thousands, will expand to 10,000 by the end of this year.
Backer's mission reflects a nuance in U.S. climate politics that is often lost in the partisan debate: while the Republican Party is seen as opposed to climate action, many of its members believe in global warming but disagree with liberals over how to fix it.
That poses no small problem, however. 
Environmentalists accuse Backer's group of obstructing the aggressive climate action they say is needed to save the planet by proposing half-measure market-based solutions instead.
While ACC supports parts of Democratic President Joe Biden's climate plan, such as those that focus on innovation, from nuclear energy advances to carbon capture and storage, it also faults his proposals for being bloated and for failing ""to streamline burdensome regulations.""
Biden's administration hopes to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 and the power sector by 2035, mainly by ramping up clean energy use and electrifying vehicles and buildings.
The ACC platform only calls for moving ""toward"" global net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, not hitting the target or surpassing it. Rather than the mandates included in Biden's plan, it favors ""market solutions"" to cutting greenhouse gases, such as constructing more buildings out of wood that stores carbon, creating new global forests in a ""trillion trees"" program, and increasing use of emissions-free hydropower.
""I don't like mandates because sometimes they have a lot of unintended consequences of propping up some people at the expense of others,"" said Emily Nielsen, a 29-year-old software engineer attending the rally, which attracted about 200 people.
""Conservatives are more concerned about encouraging innovation or voluntary actions to address climate change,"" she said.
TAKING ACTION NOW
But critics say the measures supported by conservative groups like ACC could delay progress on the urgent steps needed to curb climate change. 
""We have the technology to fight climate change today. We need to start taking action now,"" said Julie McNamara, an analyst in the climate and energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.
Carla Staver, an ecologist and the associate director of the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, added that planting new forests can be one component of a comprehensive approach on climate change, but that estimates of their climate impact put forward by some conservatives can be ""wildly optimistic."" 
Another big sticking point for climate activists: ACC does not support imposing a carbon fee, a market mechanism that would encourage investors to move to cleaner energy sources.
""An obsessive focus on innovation and policies which impose no costs on anyone are by definition policies that are not up to the task,"" said Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank.
Backer hopes soon there will be hundreds of climate-minded Republicans in Congress, up from dozens now, pointing to recent polls that show that younger members of the party are more open to curbing climate change than older ones.
U.S. Representative Carlos Giménez of Florida, elected in 2020, and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez were among the Republicans who attended the rally.
For now staunch Republican support for the drilling and mining industries still looms over conservative efforts on climate. A few older attendees at the rally held signs saying: ""There is no climate crisis!"" 

Taylor said small steps may be as far as the party can go at the moment given that many Republican lawmakers represent states with major fossil fuel industries.
""It could be that this kind of small ball incrementalism is all that really is possible,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday endorsed Maya Wiley for New York City mayor, boosting Wiley's chances to establish herself as the leading progressive in the crowded race. 
Speaking at an event outside City Hall in Manhattan, progressive firebrand Ocasio-Cortez called on voters to ""come together as a movement"" to avoid the city's being run ""for billionaires and special interests.""
More than a dozen Democratic candidates are vying to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio at the helm of the most populous U.S. city. The packed race has so far been dominated by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who was the main target of criticism at a televised debate earlier this week.
Wiley, a civil rights attorney and former MSNBC analyst, is hoping her proposal on job creation, focus on New Yorkers in need and plan to transform policing will resonate with voters in the June 22 primary election.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, another leading contender and a moderate Democrat, slammed Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of Wiley. 
""They are putting slogans and politics in front of public safety and would endanger the lives of New Yorkers,"" Adams, a former police officer, said in a statement.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge overturned California's 32-year-old ban on assault weapons on Friday, describing it as a ""failed experiment"" and prompting scathing criticism from the state's governor and attorney general.
California has prohibited the sale of assault weapons since 1989. The ban was challenged in a 2019 lawsuit against California's attorney general by plaintiffs including James Miller, a state resident, and the San Diego County Gun Owners, a political action committee.
""This case is about what should be a muscular constitutional right and whether a state can force a gun policy choice that impinges on that right with a 30-year-old failed experiment,"" judge Roger Benitez of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California wrote in the court order filed late on Friday. 
""Government is not free to impose its own new policy choices on American citizens where Constitutional rights are concerned,"" the order added.
""It is declared that these statutes unconstitutionally infringe the Second Amendment rights of California citizens,"" the court filing concluded. The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees citizens the right to bear arms.
The federal judge said that he had granted a 30-day stay of the ruling at the request of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a move that would allow Bonta to appeal it.
""Today's decision is fundamentally flawed, and we will be appealing it,"" Bonta said in a statement.
Seven states, including California, and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning assault weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun-control group.
Gun control is a politically divisive subject in the United States, which has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades.
California Governor Gavin Newsom described Friday's overturning of the ban on assault weapons as a direct threat to public safety and called it a ""disgusting slap"" in the face to those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.

""The fact that this judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that's used on the battlefield – to a Swiss army knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision,"" the governor said in a statement. 
""Like the Swiss army knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment,"" the judge had said in the order filed on Friday.

CNN and the Washington Post have said the Trump administration had secretly tried to obtain the phone records of some of their reporters over work they did in 2017.
The New York Times reported that the Justice Department under presidents Trump and Joe Biden waged ""a secret legal battle to obtain the email logs of four New York Times reporters,"" and imposed a gag order on executives.
Last month, Biden said he would not allow his Justice Department to seize the phone or email records of reporters, saying any such move would be ""simply wrong.""

The legal battle to gain access to the email logs of four of the journalists started in the last weeks of Trump's presidency and sought to reveal reporters' sources, the Times said https://nyti.ms/3uRBH9V. 
""While the Trump administration never informed The Times about the effort, the Biden administration continued waging the fight this year, telling a handful of top Times executives about it but imposing a gag order to shield it from public view,"" the report said, citing Times lawyer David McCraw.
The order prevented executives from disclosing the government's efforts even to the executive editor, Dean Baquet, and other newsroom leaders, it said.
McCraw was quoted as saying the gag order, which he called unprecedented, had been in effect since March 3 but had now been lifted by a federal court.
The battle was over an effort by the Justice Department to seize email logs from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which operates the Times's email system and had resisted the effort to obtain the information, the report said. 
The Times reported https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/trump-administration-phone-records-times-reporters.html on Wednesday that the Trump administration secretly seized phone records of four reporters spanning nearly four months in 2017 as part of a leak investigation.
CNN and the Washington Post previously reported that the Trump administration had secretly tried to obtain the phone records of some of their reporters over work they did in 2017.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.

The Times quoted Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley as saying the department under Biden had moved repeatedly to delay enforcement of the order and it then “voluntarily moved to withdraw the order before any records were produced.”
A Google spokeswoman told Reuters the company was “firmly committed to protecting our customers’ data and we have a long history of pushing to notify our customers about any legal requests.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's ex-White House counsel Don McGahn ""shed new light"" on the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. elections and the pressure the lawyer was under to stymie the federal probe, congressional Democrats said on Friday.
McGahn, who served as Trump's presidential lawyer for nearly two years before resigning in October 2018, testified in a day-long, closed-door session before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
McGahn appeared under a subpoena issued about two years ago to testify as the committee was looking into allegations of wrong-doing by Trump. Late in 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He was acquitted by the Senate, then under Republican control.
A transcript of McGahn's testimony is due to be made public in coming days. Under an agreement with the Department of Justice, Judiciary Committee members declined to provide specifics of what he said before then. 
""Mr. McGahn was clearly distressed by President Trump’s refusal to follow his legal advice, again and again, and he shed new light on several troubling events today,"" committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement.
Republican Representative Matt Gaetz told reporters that McGahn's testimony provided no new information, however.
""The expectation was that Don McGahn would be some sort of essential witness bringing new information worthy of years of litigation and countless taxpayer dollars spent,"" Gaetz said of Democrats.
Representative Madeleine Dean, a senior Judiciary Committee Democrat, told reporters McGahn ""brought to life the pressure he was under, the pressure that other aides were under by the president to direct Rod Rosenstein to oust special counsel (Robert) Mueller.""

At the time, Rosenstein was serving as deputy attorney general and Mueller was probing Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign.
After a lengthy investigation, Mueller found ""numerous links"" between the campaign and the Russians and concluded the campaign ""expected it would benefit"" from Moscow's effort to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. But Mueller said such interactions either did not amount to criminal behavior or would be difficult to prove in court.

LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - Allen West, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas and a conservative firebrand, said on Friday he was resigning after less than a year on the job. 
A former one-term Florida congressman and darling of the Tea Party movement, West will remain in his role until a new leader is chosen next month, the state's Republican party said in a statement. No reason for his resignation was given.
West, a strong supporter of former President Donald Trump, has sharply criticized other Republican leaders in Texas during his tenure as party chairman, including Governor Greg Abbott. 
West has said he is mulling a challenge against Abbott next year, despite Abbott having earlier this week won the endorsement of Trump for his reelection bid. There is speculation that West may also try for a congressional seat or the lieutenant governor spot. 
The Republican Party of Texas said in its statement that West ""will take this opportunity to prayerfully reflect on a new chapter in his already distinguished career"" and hailed him as a ""bulwark against progressive socialism."" 

Last weekend West delivered remarks at the ""For God & Country Patriot Roundup"" in Dallas that featured Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and other proponents of the Q-Anon conspiracy theory. 
West, who has lived in Texas since 2014, spent 22 years in the Army and was a battalion commander during the Iraq war. He was relieved of his command in 2003 and fined $5,000 after firing a gun near an Iraqi man's head during an interrogation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will resume making political donations to U.S. lawmakers but will not give to Republican members of Congress who voted to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory, according to an internal memo on Friday seen by Reuters.
The country's largest lender was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election. 
Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud.
Following a review, JPMorgan will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a ""handful"" of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said.
The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November's midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said.
""This was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,"" the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden's win.
Also on Friday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said it was resuming PAC contributions but did not specify how it would treat the lawmakers who tried to block Biden taking office. 
Citigroup said it would evaluate whether to give to all lawmakers case-by-case based on a new set of criteria which includes ""character and integrity"" and ""a commitment to bipartisanship and democratic institutions.""
JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates.
""Democracy, by its nature, requires active participation, compromise, and engaging with people with opposing views. That is why government and business must work together,"" JPMorgan wrote.
As part of its revamped spending strategy, the bank will also expand donations beyond lawmakers who oversee financial matters to those active on issues the bank considers ""moral and economic imperatives for our country,"" such as addressing the racial wealth gap, education and criminal justice reform.
Since the initial January backlash, corporations have been grappling https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-politics-republican-donations-ins-idUKKBN2B119B with how to resume PAC spending, seen by lobbyists as important for gaining access to policymakers, without alienating other stakeholders, including their employees who fund the PACs. 
Other big financial companies that paused donations have slowly resumed spending.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s PAC resumed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morgan-stanley-pac/morgan-stanleys-pac-resumed-donations-weeks-after-capitol-riot-pause-idUSKBN2BB2B3 donations to some lawmakers in February, while the American Bankers Association PAC, one of the biggest in the country, started giving again in March, federal records show.
While JPMorgan did not name lawmakers in its memo, the bank's new policy risks alienating Republicans with sway over banking policy, some of whom are already angered by its active stance on issues like climate change and racial equity.
Of the 147 lawmakers, JPMorgan gave $10,000 each to House finance committee members Blaine Luetkemeyer and Lee Zeldin, and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, among others, during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Representatives for the lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment.
All told, JPMorgan's PAC gave nearly $1 million to federal candidates and committees backing candidates during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to CRP. 
Of the $600,300 it gave to federal candidates, nearly 60% went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats, according to the CRP data, a mix that is likely to swing further to the left as the bank supports a broader range of social and economic issues.

Commercial banks overall have ramped up political spending in recent years, dishing out $14.6 million to federal candidates in the 2020 cycle, the second highest amount since 1990, the data shows. 
Following the 2008 financial crisis, that mix favored Republicans but in recent years banks have increased spending on Democrats as they look to rebuild bipartisan support in Congress.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The National Rifle Association said on Friday it will defend against New York Attorney General Letitia James' attempt to shut it down in a state court in Manhattan, and has withdrawn its own lawsuit seeking to block her efforts.
The NRA made the move after a federal judge on May 11 threw out the gun rights group's January bankruptcy case, which he called an improper effort to avoid James' regulatory oversight and gain an ""unfair litigation advantage.""
James sued the NRA last August, accusing it of corruption including diversion of millions of dollars to officials like Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre, its leader for three decades. She is also seeking LaPierre's ouster.
""Wayne LaPierre and his lieutenants used the NRA as a breeding ground for personal gain and a lavish lifestyle,"" James said in a statement. ""Our fight for transparency and accountability will continue because no one is above the law.""
Founded in 1871 in New York, the NRA had sued James in the state capital of Albany on the same day the attorney general brought her lawsuit.
It later filed similar counterclaims in the Manhattan case, accusing James of violating its constitutional free speech rights in a politically motivated ""retaliation campaign"" because the Democrat disliked what it stood for.
Dropping the Albany case ""will ensure that the NRA's claims proceed promptly to discovery and a full vindication of its members' rights,"" NRA lawyer William Brewer said in a statement.
The NRA has been instrumental in thwarting Democratic-backed gun control measures in the U.S. Congress, and making gun rights a core Republican Party policy objective.
In dismissing the bankruptcy case after a 12-day trial, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas faulted LaPierre for arranging it without telling his board of directors.

Hale also warned that another bankruptcy filing could result in the appointment of an outside trustee to run the NRA, while adding that trial testimony suggested the group ""now understands the importance of compliance.""
The case is New York v. The National Rifle Association of America Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451625/2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon said on Friday that it would not make an exception to allow U.S. military installations to fly rainbow pride flags in June, keeping a policy set by former President Donald Trump that limited the type of flags that could be flown on bases.
Earlier this week, President Joe Biden said that nearly 1,500 of his federal agency appointees identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, in a proclamation marking the start of Pride Month celebrating the LGBTQ community.
In July 2020, Trump's Pentagon issued a policy authorizing only certain flags on military installations and was seen as a way for then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper to issue a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag without specifically mentioning it. 
""There won't be an exception made this month for the pride flag,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. 
He said that the decision was made because it could open the door for other challenges to the rule set in place in July. 
""This is no way reflects any lack of respect or admiration for people that (are from) the LGBTQ+ community, the personnel in and out of uniform who serve in this department,"" Kirby added. ""We are proud of them.""
A 2015 RAND study found that 5.8 percent of service members identified as either lesbian, gay or bisexual. 

On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to protect LGBTQ people under all federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex. Biden also reversed a ban on transgender people openly enlisting and serving in the military.
The Biden White House also reversed an order issued by Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on flying the Pride flag and some U.S. embassies, including in India and Australia, are highlighting their support for LGBTQ people.

“We must try to find a way to resolve these relations, they’re at rock bottom today,” Putin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday. The main problem is that Moscow’s former Cold War rival “wants to hold back our development and they talk about this publicly,” the Russian leader added.
The two presidents plan to discuss issues ranging from disarmament to global conflicts, terrorism and the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, he said.
The meeting planned for June 16 in the Swiss city marks the first time the Russian and U.S. leaders will see each other face to face since Biden came to office in January. Despite escalating tensions, both sides have shown an interest in reducing the level of confrontation and negotiating a new nuclear arms pact.
Putin’s aggression toward neighboring countries and his treatment of political opponents have led to a series of U.S. sanctions against Russia. Accusations of interference in the 2016 U.S. election have continued to cast a cloud on the relationship.
The Russian president rejected criticism of a crackdown on critics in his country, saying that the demonstrators who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to protest Biden’s election had political demands but are facing criminal charges.
“This is double standards, we have to get rid of that,” he said.
Asked about the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet flying between Athens and Vilnius by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to detain an opposition journalist, Putin denied Moscow’s involvement but defended the operation to apprehend a wanted individual.
Asked if Russia would force a plane flying over Russia to land if it was carrying a person wanted by law enforcement, Putin replied, “I won’t say.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Thursday that bans U.S. entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.
The move, which his administration says expands the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, drew anger from Beijing. 
The Treasury Department will enforce and update on a ""rolling basis"" the new list of about 59 companies, which bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the Department of Defense, senior administration officials told reporters. 
The order prevents U.S. investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.
""In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,"" Biden said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. 
Major Chinese firms included on the previous Defense Department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Huawei Technologies Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).
SMIC is key to China's national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.
""We fully expect that in the months ahead ... we'll be adding additional companies to the new executive order's restrictions,"" one of the senior officials said. 
A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration's initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.
""The U.S. government is stretching the concept of national security, abusing national power and using every possible means to suppress and restrict Chinese enterprises,"" said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry. 
""We are firmly opposed to this,"" Wang told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday, urging the United States to withdraw the list. 
Biden has been reviewing a number of aspects of U.S. policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by former President Donald Trump's order while it crafted its new policy framework. 
The move is part of Biden's broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing U.S. alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world's two biggest economies.
Biden's Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.
Senior officials said the Treasury Department would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating ""repression or serious human rights abuses.""
""We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,"" a second senior administration official said.
Chinese investors shrugged off the list, with most of the stocks named, including newly-added ones, making gains on Friday morning.
Wu Kan, portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co, said listed companies were in vital industries such as defense and semiconductors and would get government support, making them investment opportunities.
""China has given up illusions and is fully prepared for decoupling in those strategic sectors that relate to national security...so the new ban list is not really a surprise,"" he said.
TIME TO 'UNWIND'
Investors would have time to ""unwind"" investments, a third official said. 
The order said the ban would take effect on Aug. 2 for those companies currently listed. U.S. investors would still have 365 days from the date of this or future listings to make transactions for the purpose of divesting, and while it was not required, divesting later than 365 days after listing would be prohibited without authorization.
The new list, while overall adding about 10 publicly listed companies, provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.
Not included, however, were some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading efforts to compete with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus, and two that challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp.
Sinochem, on the earlier list, was also dropped.
In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China's military.

Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security official, said the Treasury's ""settled regulatory and legal regime"" made it a better place than the Defense Department to enforce the ban.
""This follows in a growing tradition of the Biden administration coming along and saying: 'Trump was right in principle and wrong in execution, and we'll fix that,'"" Baker said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former senior U.S. Treasury Department employee who pleaded guilty to conspiring to give a reporter sensitive information about Donald Trump's onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort and others was sentenced on Thursday to six months in prison.
Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, a former senior adviser in Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan.
Edwards was accused of making unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports (SARs) - used by banks to alert law enforcement to potential money laundering and other crimes - to a BuzzFeed News reporter using an encrypted messaging program.
Prosecutors said the more than 2,000 reports leaked over one year concerned Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, who both oversaw Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, as well as the Russian embassy in Washington and other individuals.
The reports were a basis for articles concerning former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Edwards, 43, of Quinton, Virginia, had sought no prison time, after being charged in October 2018 and pleading guilty in January 2020.
Before being sentenced, she called herself a whistleblower who went to the media after uncovering suspicious conduct elsewhere at the Treasury Department.
Citing principles from her American Indian background, she said before being sentenced she could not ""stand by"" in silence, but apologized for her disclosures.
Woods said ""blowing the whistle through proper channels is an incredibly valuable exercise,"" but that Edwards went too far by disclosing about 50,000 records, including the SARs.
""Dr. Sours Edwards decided to abuse her position of trust,"" he said.
Federal prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said Edwards' ""rampant disclosure of private information"" was ""unparalleled"" in FinCEN history, and could have a chilling effect on banks' willingness to file detailed SARs.

""She claimed that she followed procedure. But she made up her own,"" Ravener said.
Edwards was also sentenced to three years supervised release. The BuzzFeed reporter, Jason Leopold, was not accused of wrongdoing. He embraced Edwards after meeting her outside the courthouse following the sentencing.

527,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden has pitched to Republicans the idea of a 15% minimum tax on U.S. corporations, along with strengthened IRS enforcement efforts, as a way to fund a bipartisan infrastructure package, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
The proposal sets aside the Biden administration’s proposal to raise the headline corporate income rate to 28% from 21% -- a non-starter for Republican lawmakers -- though that could be pursued elsewhere, the person said.
Under the pitch to Republicans, companies that have lots of tax credits and deductions would be required to pay at least 15%. The plan would also increase tax revenues by conducting more audits of rich taxpayers.
Those two funding measures were already included in Biden’s tax plans. The thinking is they could raise money without increasing tax rates or rolling back President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, something that Republicans have said is a red line in the negotiations, the person said, who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversation. The Washington Post reported earlier on the offer.
Biden met on Wednesday with Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican leading the infrastructure talks for the GOP, in the latest attempt at a compromise. The discussion did not yield a deal on how much to spend or how to pay for it, but the two are scheduled to speak again on Friday. Kelley Moore, a spokeswoman for Capito, declined to comment.
Partisan Option
The offer does not mean that Biden is abandoning his larger ambitions to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, the person said, characterizing the proposal as simply a bid to find common ground in the Capito talks. Democrats could still pursue those plans in a partisan reconciliation bill later this year.
The 15% minimum tax address situations where major tech companies, like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc., have largely been able to avoid paying federal income taxes in some years despite turning a profit because they used legal maneuvers, including write-offs for business expenses, to whittle down their tax bill.
The measure was included in Biden’s American Jobs plan announced in March. It would impose a minimum 15% levy on corporations’ profits reported in financial statements, also known as book income. The change would upend decades of differences to how companies compute their finances for tax purposes and would limit the amount of legal tax breaks that the companies could use.
The provision has been criticized by Republicans and some economists for being an inefficient way to increase taxes. Critics have said that imposing a minimum tax on profits would mean that companies would be less incentivized to spend money on things that Congress wants to promote, such as R&D or renewable energy, because they wouldn’t be able to claim those tax breaks.
IRS Enforcement
Biden has also proposed an $80 billion investment in the Internal Revenue Service, which the White House says could raise an additional $700 billion over a decade. The plan would ramp up IRS enforcement, which has declined in recent years, as well as give the IRS more visibility into the bank accounts of some taxpayers.
The White House has argued that additional enforcement has bipartisan support. A Data for Progress report released last month showed that 60% of Americans -- including 40% of Republicans -- back increased IRS enforcement.
Republican lawmakers have said they support some additional funding for audits, but some have criticized the Biden plan for going too far.

""The president has launched a rapid strategic review to address the increased threat of ransomware to include four major lines of effort"" including disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.
Putin and Biden will meet in Geneva on June 16, amid sharp disagreements over election interference, human rights and Ukraine. An hack of Brazilian meatpacker JBS's facilities in the United States, reported this week, is the third such ransomware hack in the country since Biden took office in January. 
JBS told the White House this week it originated from a criminal organization likely based in Russia. 

""We do expect this to be one of the issues that the President will discuss with President Putin at the summit,"" said Psaki. 
""President Biden certainly thinks that President Putin and the Russian government has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the administration's efforts on voting rights as Republican state lawmakers across the country attempt to enact voting restrictions.
The efforts by Republican-led state legislatures to pass restrictive laws, which the White House and civil rights groups say make it harder for Americans to vote, follow former President Donald Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election because of widespread election fraud.
President Biden said voting rights in the United States are ""under assault"" with an intensity he has never seen before. ""It's simply un-American,"" he said, while delivering a speech in Oklahoma during the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre. [nL2N2NJ133]
""I'm asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts, to lead them among her many other responsibilities. With her leadership and your support, we're going to overcome again... It's going to take a hell of a lot of work,"" Biden said. 
Leading the charge on voting rights is the second high-profile assignment for the vice president in less than three months. In March, Biden entrusted Harris with leading U.S. efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala aimed at improving conditions and lowering migration from the region using diplomacy. 
""In the last election, more people voted than ever before. Since then, more than 380 bills have been introduced across the country that would make it harder for Americans to vote,"" Harris said in a statement.
""Our administration will not stand by when confronted with any effort that keeps Americans from voting...We must protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans regardless of where they live,"" Harris added.
Separately, Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives boycotted a legislative session late Sunday, blocking a vote on an election reform bill critics say would put up barriers for Blacks and Hispanics voters. A vote on the measure is certain to pass the Republican-dominated house. https://reut.rs/2S1oAWk
So far, 14 other U.S. states have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a recent report from the Brennan Center for Justice. 

In May, dozens of companies - including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - urged legislators to reject any law restricting access to ballots.
Both Biden and Harris have also asked Congress to pass HR 1 - a flagship election reform bill that would update voting procedures - and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would prevent discriminatory changes to voting laws.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on Tuesday celebrated the boycott by Texas state lawmakers that prevented sweeping new Republican-backed voting restrictions from becoming law over the weekend but acknowledged the reprieve would be short-lived.
With the Texas legislature poised to pass the measure during a special session later this year, voting rights advocates said the U.S. Congress needed to act on a Democratic-backed election reform bill to ensure lasting protections.
""The Texas Democratic Party is holding back the levy with a temporary band-aid, but they don’t have the resources to be able to hold it back permanently,"" said Sylvia Albert, voting and elections director for good-government watchdog Common Cause.
Democratic Texas lawmakers walked out of a legislative session on Sunday, denying Republicans the quorum needed to pass a bill that would have limited early voting hours, added new identification requirements for absentee voting and prohibited ballot drop boxes.
Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, quickly vowed to add the measure to a special legislative session expected to be held this fall. 
Republican backers say the voting restrictions are needed to prevent voter fraud, which is vanishingly rare in the United States but which former President Donald Trump blamed for his decisive loss in the November election. Critics say such bills are aimed at eliminating flexible voting methods frequently used by voters of color.
Stalling the Texas measure represented a significant victory for Democrats, who have unsuccessfully fought a slew of similar laws passed since the beginning of the year in battleground states like Texas where Republicans control both the state legislature and the governor's office.
Reyna Walters-Morgan, the Democratic National Committee's director of civic engagement and voter protection, said the Texas outcome was a ""great example"" of Democrats protecting voting rights by any means possible. 
But advocates said the next action must come from Washington, where the Democratic-led House has passed election reforms known as the For the People Act. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday he would bring the bill to a vote in the Senate in late June. 
The federal measure would establish nationwide baselines for voter access that would prevent some of the measures in the Texas bill, such as eliminating ballot drop boxes and requiring mail-in voters to provide a reason for voting by mail.
President Joe Biden on Tuesday said Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the administration's efforts on voting rights and help push for the act's passage.

But in the Senate, which is divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, the act does not have the support necessary to overcome a filibuster, under which the supermajority of 60 votes would be needed to pass the legislation, according to Democratic strategists. 
""For federal election reform, the real question is, what will it take to get all Democrats on board with removing the filibuster?"" said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

The meeting will take place amid growing pressure from Democrats in Congress to move forward on Biden's sweeping $1.7 trillion proposal, which would not only address traditional infrastructure projects but also address climate change and seek to build up social programs such as eldercare. 
A group of Senate Republicans led by Capito have proposed a $928 billion eight-year plan, focused narrowly on physical infrastructure and broadband access, in their latest attempt to broker an agreement with the administration.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden and Senate Republicans have been involved in ""a good-faith, healthy discussion"" on how to move forward on infrastructure and job creation.
""The president is going to have a conversation with Senator Capito tomorrow to continue those discussions,"" Jean-Pierre said aboard Air Force One as Biden traveled to Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Capito said that ""real compromise"" is possible, in an interview over the weekend. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has been involved in talks with Republicans, indicated that the time for a decision on negotiations is fast approaching. 
The White House hopes to wrap up infrastructure negotiations within the next week or so, according to a person familiar with the talks. 

Republicans reject Biden's sweeping approach to infrastructure, as well as his plan to pay for his plan by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. 
Democrats, who view the narrow Republican approach as insufficient, are pressing to move forward without Republican support by using a parliamentary move known as reconciliation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Nevada is poised to challenge Iowa and New Hampshire to become the first state to vote in the 2024 U.S. presidential nominating contests, a move that if successful would shake up a political system that has been in place for decades.
Both chambers of the state's Democratic-controlled state legislature passed a bill over the weekend that would seek to make its primary the nation's first, subject to the signature of Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak and the approval of the national Republican and Democratic parties.
The Democratic National Committee did not immediately endorse the idea, with Chair Jaime Harrison saying in a statement it will decide its primary calendar ""at the appropriate time.""
The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sisolak's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether he would sign the legislation.
It is far from the first time a U.S. state has sought to cut in front of Iowa and New Hampshire, which for decades have held off challenges, sometimes hosting their contests in early January to do so.
Advocates say fast-growing Nevada better reflects the racial and economic diversity of the country than disproportionately white and rural New Hampshire and Iowa.
Iowa's Democratic caucus was also marred by technical woes https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-iowa-problems-explainer/explainer-election-meltdown-what-went-wrong-at-the-iowa-caucuses-idUSKBN1ZY2B9 in 2020 that delayed official results by several weeks. Nevada was the third state to hold a nominating contest last year.
The Nevada bill would change the state's nominating contest from party-run caucuses to a primary election administered by the state, to be held on the first Tuesday in February. Advocates, including several progressive groups, said that would allow more voters to participate.
Nevada's Republican Party has warned that national political parties could ignore the results if they decided that it violated their rules. ""Trying to play chicken with primary dates is not a battle we will win,"" Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald wrote to state lawmakers in April.

Democratic Party officials in Iowa and New Hampshire said they would fight to retain their status, arguing that their states' small populations and inexpensive media markets allow lesser-known candidates to build a following.
""We have successfully defended the primary for decades and believe that we have a strong argument for New Hampshire to retain its place,"" the state's Democratic Party chairman, Ray Buckley, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court heads into the last month of its current term with several major cases yet to be decided including a Republican bid to invalidate the Obamacare healthcare law, a dispute involving LGBT and religious rights and another focused on voting restrictions.
The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, now has 24 cases in total left to decide after issuing two rulings on Tuesday. There also is speculation about the potential retirement of its oldest justice, Stephen Breyer. Some liberal activists have urged Breyer, who is 82 and has served on the court since 1994, to step down so President Joe Biden can appoint a younger liberal jurist to a lifetime post on the court.
In the most notable of Tuesday's decisions, the court unanimously endorsed the authority of Native American tribal police to stop and detain non-Native Americans on tribal land.
The court's nine-month term starts in October and generally concludes by the end of June, though last year it continued into July because of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Speaking during an online event for students on Friday, Breyer hinted at the court's complex deliberations that go into deciding high-stakes cases at this time of year.
""It's complicated by the fact that you are dealing with eight other colleagues. ... You'd better be willing to compromise,"" Breyer said.
Republican-governed states have asked the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, a law signed in 2010 by Democratic former President Barack Obama that has helped expand healthcare access in the United States even as Republicans call it a government overreach.
It appears unlikely based on November's oral arguments that the court would take such a drastic step. But if the Obamacare law were to be struck down, up to 20 million Americans could lose their medical insurance and insurers could once again refuse to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Obamacare expanded public healthcare programs and created marketplaces for private insurance.
Another major case yet to be decided is one that pits religious rights against LGBT rights as the justices weigh Philadelphia's refusal to let a Catholic Church-affiliated group participate in the city's foster care program because it would not accept same-sex couples as prospective foster parents.
The conservative justices appeared during the November arguments in the case to be sympathetic toward the Catholic group's claim that its religious rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment had been violated. The court's conservative majority has taken an expansive view of religious rights and has spearheaded several rulings backing churches in challenges to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions.
With various states enacting new Republican-backed voting restrictions in the aftermath of former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud, the court is preparing to rule in a case concerning Arizona voting limits.
Republican proponents of Arizona's restrictions cite the need to combat voting fraud. A ruling upholding the restrictions could further undermine the Voting Rights Act, a landmark 1965 federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. 

The court also is getting ready to decide a closely watched case involving the free speech rights of public school students. It involves whether a high school that punished a cheerleader for a foul-mouthed social media post made off campus on a weekend violated her free speech rights under the First Amendment.
The court has taken up major cases on gun and abortion rights for its next term, which begins in October.

SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) -Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives boycotted a legislative session late Sunday, blocking a vote on an election reform bill critics say would make it harder for Blacks and Hispanics to vote.
With just over an hour before a midnight deadline to pass the measure, Republican members of the House said that Democrats had walked out to deny the House a quorum for a vote.
The Texas House went into recess until 10 a.m. local time on Monday - beyond the midnight Sunday deadline to pass legislation in this session. 
A vote on the measure is certain to pass the Republican-dominated house. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who strongly supports the bill, said in a late Sunday emailed statement that the bill would be added to a special legislative session planned for this fall. 
Supporters of the legislation said it is needed to bolster election security. The country's second-most-populous state already has some of the most restrictive electoral laws in the United States, even without the pending bill.
The proposed bill states that the changes ""are not intended to impair the right of free suffrage"" but are necessary to ""prevent fraud in the electoral process.""
Republican U.S. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the intent is to ""give the American people more trust in our elections.""
Democrats and civil rights groups argue that such legislation disproportionately burdens or discourages voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled.
There were no substantial allegations of fraud in Texas in last year's election and Republicans maintained their three-decade grip on all statewide offices. 
Republican state lawmakers across the country have pursued more stringent voting restrictions following former President Donald Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election because of widespread election fraud.
So far, 14 other U.S. states have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a report released on Friday by the Brennan Center for Justice.
SCRAPPING INNOVATIONS
The Texas bill would strike down innovations used during last November's election because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Drive-through voting, credited with helping spark record voter turnout in Houston, will no longer be allowed. The bill also limits early hours to vote, makes it more difficult to cast absentee ballots and does away with drop boxes.
The bill would forbid voting on Sundays before 1 p.m. Critics called that a blatant strike on the ""Souls to the Polls"" effort at Black churches, when worshippers have traditionally traveled in caravans to polling sites to cast votes after morning services. 
The legislation would also scrap 24-hour polling sites and ban mobile units or temporary structures from being used as polling places. 
The bill would also make it easier for courts to overturn elections where fraud is alleged. Instead of requiring evidence that fraudulent votes directly resulted in a candidate's win, a court could overturn an election if the number of fraudulent votes is equal to the margin of victory, regardless of who those fraudulent votes were cast for. 
New requirements would take effect as well for Texans who want to vote through the mail and election officials would be barred from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters. The legislation would also make the removal of disruptive, partisan poll watchers more difficult.
Democratic President Joe Biden said in a statement on Saturday that the legislation in Texas ""attacks the sacred right to vote.""
Earlier this month, dozens of companies - including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - urged legislators to reject any law restricting access to ballots.
'IN THEIR PLACE'
Members of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus and the state's NAACP civil rights organization said the bill hearkened back to the Jim Crow-era, when laws were enacted to block Blacks from voting and to maintain racial segregation in the U.S. South from the late 19th century into the 1960s.
""This is a clear case of taking power and putting minorities in their place so they can never share power in Texas,"" Gary Bledsoe, president of the state's NAACP chapter, said ahead of the vote. 
Julian Castro, secretary of housing and urban development under former President Barack Obama and a former mayor of San Antonio, told a Democratic Party news conference that the rapidly shifting demographics of Texas had Republicans ""running scared because they know that this state is changing and they're afraid of the consequences.""

Hispanics are forecast by the official Texas state demographer to surpass non-Hispanic whites as the largest group later this year. 
Former Democratic Representative Beto O'Rourke, speaking during the same news conference, urged the U.S. Congress to pass expanded voting rights to stymie the vote-restriction efforts in Republican-controlled states, so that the United States would not revert to ""Jim Crow 2.0.""

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden marked the sixth anniversary on Sunday of his son Beau's death with a visit to his grave site and a speech about grief to military families and veterans, on the eve of the Memorial Day holiday commemorating the country's military dead.
Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Beau Biden's grave in Delaware and attended church at the cemetery in the president's home state on a cold, overcast day.
The president spoke later to military families and veterans at Veterans Memorial Park about his loss, and theirs. 
""We must remember the price that was paid for our liberties. We must remember the debt we owe those who have paid it, and the families left behind. My heart is torn in half by the grief,"" Biden said.
Beau Biden, a former Delaware attorney general, died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.
""As many of you know, this is a hard day for us. Six years ago today, Hunter lost his dad and I lost my son,"" Biden said, referring to his grandson Hunter, who was also in attendance.
""The moment that we celebrate it is the toughest day of the year. We're honored, but it's a tough day. It brings back everything,"" he said.
Beau Biden had served a year-long tour in Iraq as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard, and the president has speculated that toxins from military ""burn pits"" used to dispose waste there may have caused the cancer.
""Thank you for allowing us to grieve together today,"" Biden told the crowd, which included people who lost an immediate relative in military action, and veterans. 
""I know how much the loss hurts,"" Biden said. ""I know nothing I can say to ease the pain. I just know that each year it gets a little bit - a little bit easier.""

Memorial Day, established after the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, is marked by laying flowers and American flags on the graves of the military dead. 
Biden plans to return to Washington on Monday to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

(Reuters) - After more than 20 people were shot during another bloody weekend in New York, Andrew Yang, a leading candidate to become the city’s next mayor, stood outside a Bronx housing project and called for an immediate increase in the number of police officers who investigate gun crimes and patrol subways.
The city, Yang said on Thursday, ""is failing us. We can do better.""
A year ago, protests over police brutality and racial injustice rocked cities across the country. Cries of “defund the police” and calls for reform echoed throughout the Democratic Party. But New York's mayoral contest suggests a different political reality is taking hold among Democrats as urban areas nationwide dig out from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The pandemic triggered massive job losses, left streets deserted, strained local budgets and contributed to a national rise in violent crime. The murder rate in U.S. cities jumped 25% or more in 2020, FBI statistics show, and is continuing to escalate this year. Last week, the Biden administration launched an initiative to help combat the spike in gun violence and homicides.
The debate over the future of policing is taking place daily in New York, as a bevy of Democrats jockey for the party’s nomination ahead of the June 22 primary that will likely decide who becomes mayor. So far, candidates who have embraced a pro-law enforcement message and pushed back against progressive calls to reduce funding for police departments seem to have the upper hand.
The election's outcome may provide a window into how voters prioritize issues in a post-pandemic society. That has significant implications for Democrats as they head toward the 2022 elections, when their control of Congress will be at stake — and as they continue to grapple with tensions between the moderate and more liberal voices within the party.
“What happens in New York goes elsewhere. This is a harbinger of what’s to come,” said Douglas Schoen, a Democratic pollster and longtime adviser to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
CITY IN CRISIS
For many in COVID-scarred New York, indelible images of a city in crisis came last May, when peaceful protests over racial injustice descended into several nights of looting and mayhem on empty avenues in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
More recently, the city has been rattled by a series of violent incidents. Shootings are up 90% since the same time a year ago. 
A poll conducted this month by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, found that nearly half of Democratic primary voters rank public safety as their top concern and that just 18% said they want fewer police patrolling their neighborhoods. A recent Emerson (NYSE:EMR) College poll also listed public safety as voters' top issue.
“This mayoral race is absolutely a window into what New Yorkers want to see in a city reborn,” said Michael Hendrix, the Manhattan Institute’s director of state and local policy. “They want a return to economic growth and jobs. They want safe streets and a sense of some kind of public order.""
That has given an opening for moderate candidates such as Yang, an entrepreneur and former presidential candidate; Eric Adams, a former police officer and current Brooklyn borough president; and Kathryn Garcia, a longtime civil servant who ran the city’s sanitation department. 
Polls have showed them among the top of the field, with progressives such as civil rights lawyer Maya Wiley lagging behind, although the race remains fluid. 
Adams has made public safety a centerpiece of his campaign, often showing up at crime scenes around the city. He has pledged to revive a controversial anti-crime unit within the New York Police Department and supports a revised version of a police tactic known as “stop and frisk” that has been widely criticized by activists as intrusive and discriminatory.
He has tried to win over skeptics by promising better training for police officers and other reforms. Norman Siegel, a former head of the American Civil Liberties Union's New York chapter who endorsed Adams, said street-level tactics like ""stop and frisk"" are necessary.
“There’s guns on the street. There’s increasing shootings. You can’t be blind to that,” Siegel said. “I’m convinced with Eric as mayor we will get a different NYPD.”
Progressives in the city hope the election’s new ranked-choice voting system will allow a candidate such as Wiley to emerge as other hopefuls are eliminated – and that perhaps the highly popular progressive U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse a like-minded candidate soon.
PAYING ATTENTION
Democrats and Republicans alike will be watching to see the direction the city chooses.
Earlier this month, Democrats conceded in an internal memo examining the 2020 election that Republican attacks last year on their candidates over issues such as defunding the police were effective in some battleground races, perhaps costing them seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and elsewhere.
Support for the Black Lives Matter movement and dramatic police reform had become a litmus test for some Democrats. President Joe Biden largely side-stepped the issue as a candidate. Other moderate Democrats, even if they had never expressed support for slashing police budgets, found themselves on the defensive anyway.
In a speech on Thursday, the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, served notice that his party intends to make crime a major issue in next year's midterm elections by blasting “defund the police” efforts.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the arm of the party that oversees House races, said it plans to blunt those attacks by emphasizing the economic relief Congress has sent to pandemic-battered communities and by pointing to federal police reform legislation that passed in the House but remains stalled in the Senate. 

The pandemic and surge in crime came at a perilous time for progressive candidates and the Black Lives Matter movement, said Christina Greer, political science professor at Fordham University. The debate over policing has become “more nuanced, more complicated.” 
“When crime starts to rise, whether its real or perceived,"" she said, ""voters tend to want a more conservative, law-and-order candidate.""

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States was also suspending a 2019 agreement between Washington and Minsk that allowed carriers from each country to use the other's airspace, and taking other actions against the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.
In a statement, she called on Lukashenko to allow a credible international investigation into the events of May 23, when the Ryanair passenger jet flying from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Minsk. 
Belarusian authorities scrambled a fighter jet and flagged what turned out to be a false bomb alert to force the plane to land, then detained an opposition journalist who was on board, drawing condemnation from Europe and the United States.
Psaki said the United States, with the EU and other allies, was developing a list of targeted sanctions against key members of Lukashenko's government ""associated with ongoing abuses of human rights and corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election, and the events of May 23"". 
The United States last year imposed sanctions on eight Belarus officials over an August 2020 election that the West said was rigged.
President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that sanctions against Belarus were ""in play"", without giving details.

The Treasury Department will develop an executive order for Biden to sign that will provide increased authorities to impose sanctions on elements of Lukashenko's government, and the United States will re-impose ""full blocking sanctions"" on nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises on June 3, prohibiting U.S. persons from dealing with those businesses.
Last month the United States revoked an authorization for certain transactions with the nine sanctioned state-owned enterprises over alleged human rights violations and abuses.

(Reuters) - Texas lawmakers are set to vote on a sweeping election reform bill that limits early hours to cast ballots, bans drive-through polling sites and places new requirements on voters, the latest attempt by Republicans to impose voting restrictions at the state level. 
A committee of state representatives and senators finalized the legislation on Saturday, sending it to both Republican-led chambers for a simple majority vote expected sometime this weekend. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has indicated he will sign the bill into law. 
If approved and signed into law, Texans would no longer be able to take advantage of 24-hour polling sites or cast ballots at drive-through polling places located in parking garages and lots. The bill also bans mobile units or temporary structures from being used as polling places. 
The legislation also bars election officials from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters and places new requirements on Texans who want to vote through the mail. The removal of disruptive poll watchers would also become tougher under the measure. 
President Joe Biden said in a statement on Saturday that the legislation in Texas ""attacks the sacred right to vote.""
""It’s wrong and un-American,"" Biden said. ""In the 21st century, we should be making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote.""
Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the restrictions will further harm voters who are disabled and who live in minority communities that are already plagued by long lines and inadequate election infrastructure.
Texas State Senator Bryan Hughes, the Republican who authored the Texas Election Integrity Bill, said in a statement on Friday that the legislation will provide security and accessibility at the polls. 
The bill makes ""it easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" he said. ""There is nothing more foundational to this democracy and our state than the integrity of our elections."" 
Texas would join 14 other U.S. states that have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a report released on Friday.

Trump and other U.S. officials should be considered immune from civil lawsuits over police actions taken to protect a president and to secure his movements, the Justice Department lawyers said, according to the Post. 
The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups over the treatment of protesters at a demonstration against racism and police brutality on June 1, 2020, in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
President Joe Biden's administration sought its dismissal. Trump left office in January.

Federal agents on horseback used tear gas to clear the protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House. The sweep allowed Trump to stage a photo opportunity at a nearby church in which he held up a copy of the Bible. A fire set during earlier protests had caused minor damage at the church.
The lawsuit sought an order declaring that Trump, Barr and other officials violated the constitutional rights of the demonstrators.

The defense spending request for fiscal 2022, which was sent to Congress on Friday, invests in troop readiness, space, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative aimed at countering China's military build-up in Asia and nuclear weapons technology.
The budget request would buy warships and jets, and pay for maintenance and salaries. An additional $38 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $753 billion, a 1.7% increase over the 2021 figure. 
There is also money to further develop and test hypersonic weapons and other ""next generation"" systems as the military aims to build capabilities to counter Russia and China.
Presidential budget requests, including those for the military, are commonly a starting point for negotiations with Congress, which ultimately decides how funds are spent.
The proposed pay raise for military and civilian Defense Department workers follows a 3% raise for the 2021 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
More than $5 billion will be spent on the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, created to counter China and focusing on competition in the Indo-Pacific with an aim to boost U.S. preparedness in the region through funding radars, satellites and missile systems. Specifically, the Pentagon plans to increase investment in missiles like the Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies-made Tomahawk and Standard Missile 6 to keep China at bay.
Tensions with an increasingly assertive China are on the minds of U.S. military planners. Beijing accused the United States last week of threatening the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait after a U.S. warship again sailed through the sensitive waterway.
To pay for this shift and things like a $112 billion research budget, the Pentagon is seeking to divest some of its older equipment with higher maintenance costs.
Divestment from the Army, Navy and Air Force will total $2.8 billion in fiscal 2022.
The retirements include four Littoral Combat Ships, 42 A-10 aircraft, which provide close air support to ground troops, as well as 14 KC-10 and 18 KC-135 planes in the mid-air refueling fleets.
Fewer M1 Abrams tanks made by General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) will be purchased, dropping to 70 from 102 in fiscal 2021.
Among the Pentagon's competing priorities, the Biden administration requested 85 stealthy F-35 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT). The 2021 and 2020 presidential budgets requested 79 and 78 of the jets respectively, but ultimately Congress authorized additional fighters. Senators and governors have come out to support the jet, which has a huge industrial base.
The request increases funding for the U.S. Space Force by $2 billion to $17.4 billion, but the U.S. Navy's shipbuilding request was eight new warships versus a plan for 12 under former president Donald Trump.

Despite shaving numbers from older systems, the Biden administration will invest $27.7 billion in modernizing the U.S. nuclear triad of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear missile-armed submarines and aircraft with nuclear bombs and missiles.
The budget includes $617 million to prepare for, adapt to and mitigate climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Friday derailed a bipartisan inquiry into the deadly assault on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, despite a torrent of criticism the lawmakers were playing down the violence.
Democrats and some moderate Republicans had called for a commission to probe the events up to and including Jan. 6, when hundreds of supporters of Trump, a Republican, stormed the Capitol, fighting with police, urging violence against lawmakers and delaying the formal certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. The violence left five people dead including a Capitol Police officer.
The measure mustered a 54-35 vote which fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation in the 100-member Senate. The 35 no votes were all Republicans. Six Republicans voted in favor of the commission.
""We all know what's going on here. Senate Republicans chose to defend the Big Lie because they feared that anything that might upset Donald Trump could hurt them politically,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote.
The proposed commission would have had the power to force witnesses, possibly including Trump, to testify under oath about what happened that day. Trump had urged Republican lawmakers to vote against it and warned of ""consequences"" for those who supported it. 
It was the first time this year that Republicans used the 60-vote hurdle, known as a filibuster, to defeat legislation. 
The vote underscores the steep challenges for Democrats in the evenly divided chamber, as they will have to win the support of at least one in five Republicans to pass policing reforms, voting-rights legislation and other priorities.
The White House said Biden remained committed to a full, independent investigation of the attack. 
'LIMITS OF BIPARTISANSHIP'
Senate Democrats have been under pressure from activists on the left to scrap the chamber's longstanding supermajority rule, but have so far declined to do so. In a letter to Democrats after the vote, Schumer said Congress had ""seen the limits of bipartisanship.""
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has argued that a commission would have duplicated work done by other congressional committees, as well as a sweeping federal criminal investigation that has so far resulted in the arrests of more than 440 people.
But Republicans are also concerned that a commission, modeled on one that probed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, would focus attention on the violence and on Trump's persistent false claims about the 2020 election well into next year's midterm congressional election campaigns.
Republicans did not defend these positions on the Senate floor before or after the vote.
The proposal previously passed the House of Representatives with the support of all Democrats and 1 in 6 Republicans after bipartisan negotiations.
""It is unfortunate that we fell a few votes short of what was needed to begin debate on this vital legislation,"" said Senator Susan Collins, one of the Republicans who voted to create a commission.
Collins took the most active stance in her party in pushing against McConnell in support of the bill, securing Schumer's support for an amendment requiring the commission staff be appointed by Democrats and Republicans.
She had a tense exchange with Schumer during Friday's vote and Republican colleague Mitt Romney said she had been disappointed the Democratic leader hadn't voiced support for her amendments during his floor speech. Schumer said he voiced support for many senators including at least one Republican, Rob Portman.

In addition to Collins, Romney and Portman, Senators Lisa Murkowski, Bill Cassidy and Ben Sasse also voted for the commission. Two Democrats and nine Republicans skipped the vote. 
After the Senate vote, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would ""proceed to find the truth"" about what happened on Jan. 6, but said nothing about whether she would set up a special committee to investigate, as some Democrats have suggested.

(Reuters) - Justice Stephen Breyer on Friday spoke of the need for the U.S. Supreme Court to respect its own precedents, talked up democracy and touted bipartisan collaboration in Congress as he addressed school students amid speculation about his possible retirement.
Breyer, at 82 the nine-member court's oldest justice, has faced calls from some liberal activists to step down to enable President Joe Biden to appoint a younger liberal jurist to a lifetime post on the nation's top judicial body.
Asked by an event moderator about the value of the court adhering to its past rulings, Breyer said it should overturn a precedent only in the ""rare case where it's really necessary."" Breyer said law is about stability, which allows people to plan their lives. 
""The law might not be perfect but if you're changing it all the time people won't know what to do, and the more you change it the more people will ask to have it changed, and the more the court hears that, the more they'll change it,"" Breyer added.
The question was posed less than two weeks after the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, agreed to hear a major challenge to abortion rights, one that could gut the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide.
Breyer's colleague, Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, in 2019 urged the court https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-thomas/justice-thomas-urges-u-s-supreme-court-to-feel-free-to-reverse-precedents-idUSKCN1TI2KJ to feel less bound to upholding precedent. Thomas in past rulings has backed abortion restrictions.
The upcoming abortion case, which the justices will hear in their next term that begins in October, involves Mississippi's bid to revive a Republican-backed state law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Breyer spoke to middle and high school students in an online class organized by the Philadelphia-based National Constitution Center, a nonprofit institution. Breyer urged them to put the ""unfortunate things"" unfolding in the United States in historical context.
""It's happened before,"" Breyer said. ""This is not the first time that people have become discouraged with the democratic process. This is not the first time that we've had real racism in this country. It used to be slavery before that.""
His comments came on the same day that U.S. Senate Republicans derailed a proposed bipartisan inquiry into the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters that interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory. Trump has made false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud.
Questioned about U.S. political fractures and deepening polarization, Breyer said he remains ""basically optimistic."" For all of its flaws, Breyer said, American democracy is, on balance, ""better than the alternatives.""
He also spoke of the value of legislative teamwork at a time of deep differences between Democrats and Republicans.
Breyer, who earlier in his career worked as a staff member in the Senate, said, ""You need that Republican's support? Talk to them. ... You say, 'What do you think? My friend, what do you think?' Get 'em talking. Once they start talking eventually they'll say something you agree with.""

Breyer fielded questions ranging from about books he loves to paintings he borrowed to display in his chambers. He said that as part of his daily routine he watches reruns of ""M*A*S*H,"" the popular TV show that ran from 1972 to 1983 about a mobile U.S. Army hospital during the Korean War, rides a stationary bike and has taken to meditation.
Breyer became the court's oldest justice following the September death https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg/trailblazing-u-s-supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-dies-succession-battle-looms-idUSKBN269395 of fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg at age 87.

(Reuters) - Fourteen U.S. states have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a report released on Friday, as Republican lawmakers pursue tougher voting restrictions in the wake of former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.
The pace of legislation is faster than in 2011, when new Republican majorities in numerous states passed 19 restrictive laws by October of that year, the report from the Brennan Center for Justice said.
""Americans' access to the vote is in unprecedented peril,"" the report warned. 
Democrats and civil rights activists have said the laws are a thinly veiled effort to disenfranchise voters, particularly minorities.
But Trump's fellow Republicans argue the measures passed by such states as Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas are necessary to prevent fraud and ensure public confidence in election integrity. 
Many of the laws seek to make it harder to vote by mail, after a surge in mail balloting last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Others restrict early voting, limit drop boxes, eliminate poll locations and give partisan poll watchers more power.
That said, 14 states have also enacted 28 bills that expand voting access, the report found.

Trump, a Republican, has said for months that his loss to President Joe Biden in November's election was due to massive fraud, despite a lack of evidence. Dozens of judges rejected lawsuits asserting voting irregularities, and election officials across the country have said the vote was safe and secure.
There are at least 61 additional restrictive bills that have advanced in some way in 18 state legislatures, the report said. Overall, lawmakers have introduced 389 restrictive bills in 48 states.

The order will establish the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and expand language access and strengthen economic security and opportunity for those communities, it said https:// in a statement. 
People of Asian descent in the United States have been subjected to increasing violence throughout the coronavirus pandemic, after COVID-19 appeared to emerge from China and former President Donald Trump repeatedly linked the deadly disease to China. 
But they have faced bias at other points in U.S. history as well, most notably during World War Two when the government removed Americans with Japanese roots from their homes along the West Coast and forced them to live in camps.

""The COVID-19 pandemic, and the xenophobic rhetoric used by certain political leaders during this crisis, have led to a tragic spike in acts of anti-Asian bias, violence, and xenophobia,"" the White House said in the statement
It added that it would also work to help ease the health inequities facing many native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and other Asian-Americans during the pandemic.

The criminal investigation includes examining whether the Ukrainian officials used Rudolph Giuliani, then personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump, to spread misleading claims about current President Joe Biden, the New York Times reported.
The inquiry, which began during the final months of the Trump administration, is being handled by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, the newspaper reported, and is separate from an ongoing criminal investigation into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine.
Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York are probing whether the Ukrainian officials tried to influence the Nov. 3 election by spreading claims of corruption about Biden through a number of channels, including Giuliani, the newspaper reported. Biden has denied any wrongdoing.
One of the officials being investigated is a Ukrainian member of parliament named Andriy Derkach, the newspaper reported.
The U.S. Treasury Department previously sanctioned Derkach, identifying him as an “active Russian agent for over a decade.""
Giuliani, who the New York Times said has not been accused of wrongdoing in this investigation, has previously denied representing any Ukrainians.
The U.S. Attorney's Office and Arthur Aidala, a lawyer for Giuliani, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Giuliani's business dealings with Ukrainian oligarchs while he was working as Trump's lawyer are the subject of a probe by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Federal agents searched his home and office in April, seizing phones and computers.
Giuliani has denied allegations in that probe and his lawyers have suggested the investigation is politically motivated.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said there is a risk that Donald Trump's supporters could still carry out attacks similar to the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, noting the former president's ""near-daily fulminations"" about his election loss have not subsided.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson made the remark in a written decision on Wednesday explaining why she would continue to jail Cleveland Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Jr. while he awaits trial on charges that he texted about ""putting a bullet"" in U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's head.
""The steady drumbeat that inspired defendant (Meredith) to take up arms has not faded away; six months later, the canard that the election was stolen is being repeated daily on major news outlets and from the corridors of power in state and federal government, not to mention in the near-daily fulminations of the former President,"" Jackson said in her partially redacted ruling.
Jackson noted that the charges against Meredith were particularly serious.
""Not only did defendant threaten to wreak mayhem in general in the nation’s capital, he used graphic and misogynistic language to threaten to kill particular public figures in the District in specific and violent ways,"" Jackson said.
Federal prosecutors charged Meredith with making the threat and illegally possessing a gun and ammunition, according to court documents.

Meredith was not present for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, telling investigators he had to stop for car repairs during the drive from Colorado, according to authorities.
He arrived in Washington late on Jan. 6, and wrote in a text message on Jan. 7 that he wanted to “put a bullet in (Pelosi’s) noggin,” according to prosecutors.

550,"<span>May 26, 2021 01:18PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing an unprecedented challenge to his authority after the controversial strategist who masterminded his rise to power declared he is unfit to hold the job.
During almost seven hours of testimony in Parliament, Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings catalogued the government’s “disastrous” pandemic failures, saying the premier’s poor leadership led to thousands of unnecessary deaths.
Cummings blamed Johnson for being slow to put the country into lockdown last year, not taking the Covid threat seriously enough and being too concerned with media headlines to be an effective leader.
Cummings’s intervention threatens to puncture the mood of optimism around Johnson’s administration flowing from the U.K.’s successful vaccination rollout and the reopening of the economy.
While Cummings is a divisive figure in the eyes of the public -- and many of his accusations relate to events in the past -- much of his criticism was aimed directly at the current operation of 10 Downing Street and the character of Britain’s premier.
‘Very Bad’
“Tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die,” Cummings said in evidence to the House of Commons inquiry on the pandemic. “There is no doubt the prime minister made some very bad misjudgments and got some very serious things wrong.”
Asked directly whether Johnson is a fit and proper person to lead Britain out of the pandemic, Cummings replied: “No.”
It is a judgment that is dangerous for the prime minister because Cummings worked so closely with him at the heart of government and during the 2016 Brexit referendum. It was Cummings who shaped that campaign, and then devised the Conservative Party’s winning general election strategy in 2019.
There is no immediate electoral threat to Johnson, with a general election not due until 2024. Voters only this month endorsed the premier’s leadership, giving him a set of local victories, despite controversies in the weeks leading up to the polls.
Chaos
Yet political fortunes are fickle in the U.K. and Cummings’s detailed account of the chaos around the prime minister and his errors in office has the potential to damage his authority among Tory members of Parliament at Westminster. In the House of Commons on Wednesday, Johnson denied that any mistakes he’d made led to excess deaths from the virus.
Among his many attacks on Johnson and the wider administration, Cummings said:
A significant part of Cummings’s critique focused on current problems with Britain’s pandemic response, arguing that the country’s border policy is woefully inadequate and the British state is not prepared to deal with future crises. He lamented Johnson’s decision to delay a public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, saying that lessons had to be learned now.
Cummings also repeatedly attacked Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying he regularly lobbied Johnson to fire the minister for lying about the state of Britain’s pandemic preparedness and interfering with the establishment of an effective testing regime. The Department of Health rejected Cummings’s claims.
A year ago, Cummings was at the center of his own storm, after driving his family more than 250 miles (400 kilometers) out of London, apparently ignoring his own government’s lockdown orders.
On Wednesday, he explained for the first time that this was not simply for childcare reasons, as he initially claimed, but because his family had faced death threats and they needed to flee for their own safety.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Steve Bannon, the onetime top strategist for former President Donald Trump and recipient of a presidential pardon, on Tuesday won dismissal of an indictment accusing him of defrauding donors to a fund to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said dismissal was ""the proper course"" in light of the pardon, which Bannon received in the final hours of Trump's presidency.
Prosecutors had argued that instead of dismissing the indictment, the judge should merely dismiss Bannon as one of the four defendants. The defendants had been charged in connection with the alleged siphoning of hundreds of thousands of dollars from the $25 million ""We Build the Wall"" crowdfunding campaign.
But the judge said the pardon was valid, and that even if Bannon did not formally admit guilt ""the issuance of a pardon may carry an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of
it.""
Prosecutors had said the pardon ""speaks for itself"" and provided all the ""finality"" Bannon was entitled to.
The office of U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Bannon was ""thrilled"" with the indictment's dismissal, his lawyer Robert Costello said after speaking with him.

""She certainly got the result right,"" Costello said, referring to the judge. ""A pardon doesn't rewrite history....

It was not immediately clear how the dismissal will affect Bannon's co-defendants, or whether they might try to steer blame toward Bannon as they defend themselves.
The defendants include Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran and triple amputee who led the We Build the Wall campaign.

""There is nothing I have to say about the situation,"" Kolfage's lawyer Harvey Steinberg said in an interview. ""It is completely out of our hands, and within the Executive Branch's discretion.""
Bannon, 67, championed the ""America First"" right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that became hallmarks of Trump's presidency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers negotiating a police reform bill say they are optimistic about the prospects for a bipartisan deal, despite missing a deadline set by President Joe Biden of the one anniversary on Tuesday of the killing of George Floyd. 
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have in many ways become even more divided in the year since Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed in Minneapolis by a white officer kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. 
Democrat Biden's plans to spend trillions on public works, funded by taxes on the wealthy and companies, have been dismissed by Republicans, and his COVID-19 relief package did not win a single Republican vote.
Democrats, who have named their bill after Floyd, suggested that won't happen with police reform. 
""We will get this bill on President Biden's desk,"" said Representative Karen Bass of California, a Democrat leading House negotiations, at an event with Floyd's family members in Washington. ""We will work until we get the job done. It will be passed in a bipartisan manner.""
Democrats are seeking to restrict the use of chokeholds by police while making it easier to hold officers liable in court.
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a lead Republican negotiator, said on Tuesday the main point of contention between the parties is qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields individual police officers from lawsuits in certain circumstances.
Still, he said, lawmakers are making progress.
""We have a long way to go still, but it's starting to take form,"" Scott told reporters.
Leaving out the ability to penalize cops in the courts has been strongly encouraged by police unions, but would be a blow to law enforcement reform activists. People briefed on the process said that there was sufficient agreement on so many other reforms that there should be scope for a compromise.
Last week, Biden signed a bill that won rare bipartisan support to fight against hate crimes following a spate of attacks on Asian Americans in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

At the White House on Tuesday, Biden met privately with Floyd's family to discuss the bill named after him.
""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed,"" Floyd's brother, Philonise, told reporters afterward. If the United States can pass federal laws to protect bald eagles, ""you can make federal laws to protect people of color,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats known for independent streaks urged Republicans on Tuesday to support a bipartisan commission into the deadly January attack on the Capitol, after one in six House Republicans broke with party leadership and backed the probe.
Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema called on Republicans to work with them to reach agreement on a bill to investigate the events leading up to and on Jan. 6, when President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building while Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden's November election victory, leaving five dead.
Some 35 House Republicans joined Democrats last week in voting to pass the legislation that would create a bipartisan commission modeled on the one Congress passed following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The bill requires that the commission issue its final report by Dec. 31.
Passage of the bill was an easier achievement in the House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a 219-211 majority. The Senate is divided 50-50 between the parties and requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, meaning that under current rules, 10 Republican votes would be needed to pass the measure.
""A bipartisan commission to investigate the events of that day has passed the House of Representatives with a bipartisan vote,"" Manchin and Sinema said in a joint statement. ""We implore our Senate Republican colleagues to work with us to find a path forward.""
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Senate Republicans have spoken out against the House bill, saying that ongoing probes by two Senate committees are sufficient investigation.
Republicans are concerned that the commission will keep public attention on Trump and his continued false claims that his election defeat was the result of fraud, which could hurt them in the 2022 elections that will determine control of Congress.
Some Republicans have downplayed the violence of Jan. 6, when rioters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence scrambling for safety.
Representative Andrew Clyde, who was photographed on Jan. 6 helping to barricade the House chamber door against attackers, has since compared the mob to ""a normal tourist visit.""
REIGNITE DEBATE ON FILIBUSTER?
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday evening took procedural steps to set up a potential vote on taking up the commission legislation later this week. Republican refusal could reignite Democrats' debate about whether to suspend the 60-vote filibuster rule and pass the measure with just a simple majority vote.
""We hope to move forward with Republicans, but we are not going to let them saying no, stand in our way,"" Schumer said.
But Manchin told reporters he opposed a rule change in order to get the commission passed. ""I can't take the fallout,"" he said.
Just three of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump of inciting insurrection in his January impeachment trial have so far come out in favor of the idea.
Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters on Tuesday: ""I'm going to support it,"" the day after Senator Mitt Romney also voiced support.
Another Republican, Senator Susan Collins, has said she supports establishment of an independent commission but wants to amend the House-passed bill to ensure bipartisan staffing.

Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said he was reserving judgment until he sees the final bill. But he had a reply to McConnell's concern that the commission would be used as a political weapon. 
""If they wish to have a political weapon, it'd be easy for Schumer and (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi to each appoint their own committees and run now as long as they want to,"" Cassidy said. ""So it seems like in that regard, this would be a better approach.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans plan to unveil a counteroffer to President Joe Biden's $1.7 trillion infrastructure proposal on Thursday, though one of their leaders said on Tuesday the two sides remain far apart. 
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, leading a six-member Republican negotiating team, told reporters the group could also seek another meeting with Biden in an 11th-hour bid to reach a bipartisan deal to revitalize America's roads, bridges and other facilities. 
The No. 3 Senate Republican, John Barrasso, sounded a pessimistic note, telling reporters: ""We are now very far apart. We were pretty close when we met with President Biden in the White House."" 
It was not clear what the updated Republican package would contain. The group initially proposed a $568 billion, five-year framework https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/republicans-vs-biden-whats-their-infrastructure-plans-2021-04-22. Capito said the proposal has been recalibrated along the same eight-year horizon as Biden's plan. Such a change could increase its size to around $1 trillion.
Republicans, who met with Biden on May 13, have been disappointed by recent talks with administration officials including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and others. 
""I think that we've got good momentum, but we'll see what their reaction is,"" said Capito, top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
""The president will not be surprised at the more outlined and specific offer that he's going to receive, and it will absolutely be in line with parameters that he suggested in those areas,"" Senator Roger Wicker, top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, told reporters without elaborating. 
The sides are still struggling to agree on a basic definition of infrastructure and have made little progress on how to pay for the package. If talks stall, Biden and his fellow Democrats in Congress could decide to move forward at the end of the month without Republicans. Biden in March signed sweeping COVID-19 relief legislation passed in Congress without Republican support.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the administration is concerned about Republican opposition to altering a 2017 tax law, signed by former President Donald Trump, to increase taxes on the wealthy and companies.
""We are waiting to hear back from Republicans on how they would propose to pay for"" the infrastructure legislation if they oppose raising taxes, Psaki told reporters.
Democrats narrowly control both chambers of Congress. House of Representatives Democrats have identified July 4 as their target date for passing infrastructure legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters his plan is to ""work on an infrastructure bill in July."" 
Biden's proposal includes traditional infrastructure projects on roads and bridges but also seeks to rechart the direction of the U.S. economy with an additional focus on fighting climate change and boosting social programs.

""The panel was convened recently and will sit three days a week for six months,"" the Post said, citing two unnamed people familiar with the development.
""It is likely to hear several matters — not just the Trump case ­— during the duration of its term, which is longer than a traditional New York state grand-jury assignment, these people said."" 
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been investigating Trump’s pre-presidency business dealings for more than two years. 
Vance’s office has said in court filings it was investigating ""possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization, including tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
A spokesman for Vance, Danny Frost, declined to comment on the Post report.
The Post said the move indicates Vance's investigation has reached an advanced stage and that he believes he has ""found evidence of a crime - if not by Trump then by someone potentially close to him or by his company.""
The New York attorney general's office said a week ago that it had opened a criminal investigation into Trump's company, increasing the legal risk for Trump and his family.
Attorney General Letitia James has been investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely reported property values to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.

Trump, who left office in January, has denied any wrongdoing.
Last week he attacked James, saying ""we will overcome"" any attempt at prosecution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a firebrand ally of former President Donald Trump, was broadly denounced by her fellow Republicans on Tuesday for likening COVID-19 masks and vaccinations to the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews. 
But the party leadership made no mention of plans to take disciplinary action against her.
House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and his Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell, both rejected the Georgia Republican's comments after she compared masks to the badges worn by Jews before their mass murder by Nazi Germany before and during World War Two. 
Even after facing criticism, Greene described a supermarket chain's plan to identify vaccinated employees in the same light. 
""Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling. The Holocaust is the greatest atrocity committed in history. The fact that this needs to be stated today is deeply troubling,"" McCarthy said in a statement.
""Let me be clear: the House Republican Conference condemns this language,"" he said.
McConnell told reporters: ""This is one of the frequent outbursts that are absolutely outrageous and reprehensible.""
Condemnation also poured in from rank-and-file Republicans as well as Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who told reporters: ""It's so beyond reprehensible that it, I mean, it has no place in our country.""
Greene's comments came at a time when Republicans are trying to put themselves forward as defenders of the Jewish community and accusing Democrats of making antisemitic remarks. McConnell, who previously described Greene as a ""cancer"" on the Republican Party, has unveiled new legislation to address antisemitism and attacks on American Jews. 
The United States has experienced a spate of physical or verbal attacks against Jews in New York, Los Angeles and South Florida, amid an escalation earlier this month of the conflict between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers. 
The controversy over Greene is also the latest eruption among Republicans in the House, where McCarthy and other party leaders have sought to forge unity after ousting fellow Representative Liz Cheney from her No. 3 leadership role for denouncing Trump's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. 
Statements from McCarthy and McConnell followed a Tuesday rant on Twitter by Greene, who tweeted photos of herself in public settings with signs showing support for Israel and accused Democrats of antisemitism.
""I'm sorry some of my words make people uncomfortable, but this is what the American left is all about,"" she tweeted. 
Lauren Fine, a spokeswoman for No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, said in a statement that the congressman “does not agree with these comments and condemns these comparisons to the Holocaust.""

The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, also blasted Greene's assertions, saying ""these are sickening, reprehensible comments, and she should stop this vile language immediately.""
Earlier this year McCarthy and the House Republican caucus refused to take action against Greene for her prior incendiary remarks. When the party declined to act, the House did, with just 11 Republicans joining Democrats in the February vote stripping her of her committee assignments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. efforts to address competition with China progressed on Tuesday when the chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee introduced sweeping legislation to boost economic competitiveness and push Beijing on human rights.
Representative Gregory Meeks introduced the ""Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act,"" or EAGLE Act, as the U.S. Senate separately heads toward a vote on its own legislative package seeking to counter China.
The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, which is narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats. 
The Biden administration supports efforts to counter China, with officials repeatedly listing competition with Beijing among their greatest strategic challenges.
The 470-page bill introduced by Meeks addresses a range of issues, including increased investment to promote U.S. manufacturing, trade, work with allies and partners, re-engagement in international organizations, and recognition of the treatment of China's Uyghur Muslim minority as genocide.
""The United States must coordinate closely with allies and partners to compete effectively with (China), including to encourage allies and partners to assume, as appropriate, greater roles in balancing and checking aggressive (Chinese) behavior,"" the legislation said.
A committee aide said Meeks intends to work with committee Republicans on the legislation, in the hope of committee passage as soon as next month. The measure would then be combined with legislation being considered by other House committees, and eventually combined with the Senate bill.

The House bill includes provisions to increase U.S. support for Taiwan and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. And it mandates a review to assess Chinese companies listing on U.S. financial markets, including whether they have contributed to human rights violations.
The measure also calls for cooperation with China in areas of common interest, especially climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A divided U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to confirm Kristen Clarke to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, where she will oversee two high-profile investigations into possible patterns of police misconduct in Minneapolis and Louisville.
Clarke, a longtime civil rights attorney and Justice Department veteran, was confirmed in a vote of 51-48 on the one-year anniversary of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Nearly all Republicans opposed her nomination. 
She is the first woman, and the first Black woman, to be confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine was the lone Republican to back her nomination.
“This is not the right nominee for a crucial post at a crucial time,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor earlier this week, and accused her of having a history of making statements that put her on ""the far-left fringe of the political spectrum.""
Clarke was a trial attorney in the Justice Department's voting rights section and worked in several other positions before taking a job with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
She previously served as the civil rights chief for the New York State Attorney General's Office. Since January 2016, she has worked as president and executive director for the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Clarke ""is an accomplished civil rights attorney who has earned the respect of all sides,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday, ahead of the vote. 
Clarke came under fire from Republicans during her April confirmation hearing for everything from articles she wrote and events she attended while she was an undergraduate at Harvard University, to her social media posts and an opinion piece she wrote in June headlined: ""I Prosecuted Police Killings. Defund the Police — But Be Strategic.""

Clarke told lawmakers she does not support defunding the police and said she did not select the headline for the op-ed.
She will start her job at a busy time for the department, which is facing a spike of hate crimes against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wave of Republican state legislatures passing laws that critics say will make it harder to vote, and civil probes into whether police departments in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Louisville, Kentucky, use unreasonable force and discriminate against people of color and/or people with disabilities.

Senate Republicans are due to meet on Tuesday to determine their next steps on bipartisan infrastructure talks, and could deliver their proposal on Thursday, Senator Shelley Capito of West Virginia said.

Republicans have said that they won't back President Joe Biden's plan to pay for infrastructure by altering the 2017 tax bill to increase taxes on the wealthy and companies, and are expected to offer a pared-down proposal.
""We are waiting to hear back from Republicans on how they would propose to pay for it"" if they won't raise taxes, Psaki told reporters.

560,"<span>May 25, 2021 01:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of Senate Republicans plans to present their latest offer to the White House on a major new infrastructure package on Thursday, with one member saying it will weigh in at almost $1 trillion.
“This is going to be a very good offer,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi told reporters Tuesday. The latest counter will be “close” to $1 trillion, spread over eight years, he said.
Democratic lawmakers have warned that time is running short to determine whether a bipartisan deal on infrastructure is possible, with progressives already calling for a go-it-alone approach using fast-track budget procedures. A new offer around $1 trillion would still leave the two sides many hundreds of billions of dollars apart.
If President Joe Biden decides on a response, rather than administration staff, Wicker predicted he would take the deal. His comments underscored GOP sentiment that the White House’s $1.7 trillion counter-offer to Republicans on Friday failed to reflect Biden’s own, previous indications of his position. Biden had hosted the GOP group May 13.
West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the lead Republican negotiator, said the group may request a meeting with Biden again since he seemed more open to a deal, and had indicated he could accept a $1 trillion bill.
Wide Gap
“We were pretty universal on this, I mean there was no dispute with what he said to us in the room that day -- that’s why I think, when we left there, we were pretty optimistic that this is a doable” she said.
Wicker said the new GOP offer will be able to resolve the talks before Memorial Day -- May 31 -- in line with Biden’s goals.
On Friday, Biden reduced his proposal by more than $500 billion from an initial $2.25 trillion by lowering spending on roads, bridges and broadband and saying he is willing to make investments in the manufacturing sector in separate bills -- like the China-focused legislation on the Senate floor this week.
The two sides have been defining the size of the package differently, with Republicans including money already expected to be in the spending pipeline. The GOP senators characterized their initial offer as $568 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gun control advocate and federal law enforcement veteran David Chipman is no stranger on Capitol Hill, where he has previously urged the U.S. Congress to ban assault rifles and fought against efforts to deregulate firearm silencers.
On Wednesday, he will seek its support for his nomination by President Joe Biden to serve as director of the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a job that is so politically fraught that the Senate has confirmed just one nominee in the last 15 years.
Chipman has served in a variety of roles at the ATF he has now been nominated to lead, but currently works as a policy advisor for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Senator Mark Kelly after a gunman shot her in 2011. 
That role in particular has inflamed objections to Chipman by Republicans, whose party staunchly defends gun rights.
""David Chipman has made it no secret that he is an enemy of the 2nd Amendment,"" a group of House of Representatives Republicans wrote in a May 3 letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
""We respectfully ask you to oppose any and all action that would advance his confirmation in the Senate.""
From 1988 through 2012, Chipman served in various roles at the ATF, including as an investigator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. 
He also played a key role during former President Bill Clinton's administration in rolling out an initiative that aimed to improve the tracing of firearms recovered from crime scenes. 
""David Chipman will be one of the most active and capable and savvy and strategic directors that the agency will have ever had if he is named to that job,"" said David Kennedy, the Director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College.
RISING GUN VIOLENCE
If confirmed, Chipman would be leading the agency at a crucial time. As of May 25, the United States has already seen at least 230 mass shootings this year, according to a tally by the Gun Violence Archive, an online archive of gun violence incidents.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department proposed cracking down on self-assembled ""ghost guns,"" which have largely gone unregulated because they are often sold without background checks and lack a serial number that can be used to trace them if they are used to commit violent crimes.
Biden has also pledged to support legislation that would ban assault rifles and high capacity magazines.
With the Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, Chipman will need support from all Senate Democrats if no Republicans will approve his nomination.
Pro-gun groups such as the NRA and the Gun Owners of America have also been staunchly pushing back against his nomination, with the NRA on Twitter calling on Kelly to recuse himself from voting on Chipman's nomination and launching a $2 million attack ad campaign.
A photo of Chipman purportedly standing in the rubble of Waco, Texas after the 1993 standoff with authorities that killed 76 members of the Branch Davidian cult has surfaced on social media but a source close to Chipman said he took no part in the incident.
Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum research and policy organization, said the ATF has been treated differently by Congress than other law enforcement counterparts like the FBI or the DEA, and that it needs permanent leadership. 

In recent years, the agency has largely been led by acting directors, which can make it more challenging to change policy.
""It's a testament to how we see guns in America that this position has become so politicized,"" Wexler said. ""If he is not qualified, who is?""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said in a court filing it would appeal a court decision faulting former U.S. Attorney General William Barr's handling of the 2019 special counsel report on then-President Donald Trump, a move congressional Democrats had opposed.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had given the Justice Department until May 24 to appeal a decision she issued earlier this month that faulted Barr for how he publicly summarized Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 2019 report. 
As part of her ruling, she ordered the release of a related internal memo that Barr said he relied on in deciding how to handle the Mueller report.
The Justice Department said in Monday's court filing that it would only appeal some aspects of Jackson's May 3 ruling. 
The department said it would not object to releasing an introductory section of the internal memo at issue in the case, while adding that the rest of the memo should not be made public as it related to a ""decisional process"".
A group of U.S. Senate Democrats on May 14 urged U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland not to appeal Jackson's decision, saying in a letter that Barr's actions need to be exposed quickly.
""To be clear, these misrepresentations preceded your confirmation as Attorney General, but the Department you now lead bears responsibility for redressing them,"" the letter stated.
The special counsel's April 2019 report outlined 10 episodes in which Trump tried to get the special counsel fired, limit the scope of his investigation, or otherwise interfere with the probe.
Mueller stopped short of concluding that Trump had committed the crime of obstruction of justice, but did not exonerate him of wrongdoing either, leaving Barr or Congress the option to take action against the Republican president.
Before publicly releasing Mueller's report, Barr sent a letter to congressional leaders and held a news conference that summarized Mueller's findings. Many Democrats accused Barr of misrepresenting Mueller's findings in order to change the public narrative at the time.
Jackson validated this view in her stinging May 3 decision. She said Barr misrepresented the Mueller report in his letter to Congress, and ordered the release of a 2019 legal memorandum to a government accountability group.
The judge said the memorandum, prepared for Barr as he considered his decision, did not qualify as a protected attorney-client communication.

In her decision, Jackson characterized the memo as a ""strategic"" document, concluding that Barr had come to a predetermined conclusion not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.
Her ruling came in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group.

The May 17-19 national poll found that 53% of Republicans believe Trump, their party's nominee, is the “true president” now, compared to 3% of Democrats and 25% of all Americans.
About one-quarter of adults believe the Nov. 3 election was tainted by illegal voting, including 56% of Republicans, according to the poll https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-05/Ipsos%20Reuters%20Topline%20Write%20up-%20The%20Big%20Lie%20-%2017%20May%20thru%2019%20May%202021.pdf. The figures were roughly the same in a poll that ran from Nov. 13-17 which found that 28% of all Americans and 59% of Republicans felt that way. 
A Democrat, Biden won by more than seven million votes. Dozens of courts rejected Trump's challenges to the results, but Trump and his supporters have persisted in pushing baseless conspiracy theories on conservative news outlets.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 61% of Republicans believe the election was ""stolen"" from Trump. Only about 29% of Republicans believe he should share some of the blame for his supporters' Jan. 6 deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Still, 67% of overall respondents say they trust election officials in their town to do their job honestly, including 58% of Republicans, according to the poll. 
The November and May polls were both conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The May poll gathered responses from 2,007 adults, including 909 Democrats and 754 Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia, who is leading the Republican infrastructure effort, said her negotiating team would discuss possible next steps but offered no details about options. 
""I'm not ready to call it quits, I can tell you that,"" Capito told reporters.
Senator Roy Blunt, another member of Capito's team, spoke favorably about making a new offer to the Biden administration. ""I think there'd be merit to that,"" Blunt, of Missouri, told reporters. 
The sides appear to be far apart and struggling to agree on a basic definition of infrastructure. If talks stall, Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress could decide to move forward without Republicans. 
Biden's sweeping proposal includes traditional infrastructure projects on roads and bridges but also seeks to rechart the direction of the U.S. economy with an additional focus on fighting climate change and boosting social programs. 
Republicans want an approach limited to roads, bridges, airports, waterways and broadband access. They unveiled an initial proposal costing $568 billion.

""We're not going to rush to sign up without a proper, more detailed deal on where tech companies pay their tax, something that you're confident can be pushed through Congress,"" a Treasury source told the paper.

566,"<span>May 24, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senator Elizabeth Warren is proposing to nearly triple the Internal Revenue Service’s budget to help identify wealthy individuals who are cheating on their taxes.
The Massachusetts Democrat is proposing to give the IRS a mandatory annual budget of $31.5 billion, up from the $11.9 billion the agency received from Congress for fiscal year 2021. Warren’s legislation would remove the agency’s funding from the annual appropriations process, so that it wouldn’t change based on the year-to-year whims of Congress.
“Strengthening the IRS’s ability to go after wealthy tax cheats will not only require more funding, but more stable funding,” Warren said in a summary of the legislation released Monday. “Mandatory funding would provide funding on an ongoing basis, ensuring that the IRS budget is steady, predictable, and sustained -- money that lobbyists can’t easily strip away.”
Warren’s legislation includes many ideas similar to the IRS enforcement provisions President Joe Biden included in his “American Families Plan,” which featured an $80 billion cash infusion over a decade into the IRS. The Treasury Department estimates added enforcement could capture an additional $700 billion in tax dollars.
Improving IRS enforcement has become a top priority for Democrats, who say it is a way to find revenue for infrastructure and other spending priorities without raising tax rates. Outside think tanks and tax experts have questioned the amount Biden says his plan would raise, even as the Treasury contends the estimate is “conservative.”
Warren’s “Restoring the IRS Act” would give the tax collector even more money than Biden’s proposal. The plan would do more to focus on racial and income inequities in the IRS enforcement process and require the agency to gather more information on wealthy taxpayers.
The progressive Democrat did not provide a total revenue estimate for her bill, but cited a study that concluded tax collectors could raise an additional $1.75 trillion over a decade by stopping tax evasion from the top 1%.
She also cited a Treasury study that found the IRS can collect $6 for every $1 invested in audits, though that figure climbs to $24 after factoring in increased compliance because of higher audit risk. The Treasury released separate figures last week that said it could recover at least $4 for every additional audit dollar.
The money would help the agency enforce the tax laws, upgrade IT systems that date back to the 1960s and improve taxpayers services, the bill outline said. The agency has struggled to meet basic taxpayer needs in recent years -- with roughly 2% of calls to the IRS’s tax return help hotline being answered this spring.
The legislation would also require financial institutions to report account flows from wealthy clients that don’t already have their incomes reported to the IRS by third parties, similar to a plan that Biden has proposed. The IRS would be required to shift audits to high-income individuals, analyze racial disparities in their enforcement activities and increase penalties for underpayment for those earning at least $2 million.
The IRS would also be required to report annually on the difference between the taxes owed and the taxes actually paid, a figure known as the tax gap. The IRS currently reports this figure every few years, but the totals can often be outdated by the time they are released. The most recent tax gap estimate is $381 billion for the period of 2011-2013. IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig recently told a congressional panel that figure may have swelled to approximately $1 trillion annually due to tax evasion from offshore activities and cryptocurrency.

JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) -For eight years, Derenda Hancock has ushered women from their cars to the doors of Mississippi's only abortion clinic, donning a rainbow vest as she shields them from protesters waving religious pamphlets and shouting ""turn back!"" through bullhorns.
Hancock, a 62-year-old part-time waitress, grew accustomed to repeated attempts by lawmakers and anti-abortion activists to block access to abortions at the Jackson Women's Health Organization where she leads the clinic's volunteer escorts.
But the future of that access feels threatened like never before after the U.S. Supreme Court thrust the clinic's noisy city block into the center of the country's contentious debate over abortion rights. 
The court on Monday agreed to review Mississippi’s bid to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a Republican-backed measure enacted in direct challenge to the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
The court's new 6-3 conservative majority, which is not expected to rule on the case until next year, could decide to weaken or overturn that ruling, which established a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, usually between 24 and 28 weeks.
The Jackson Women's Health Organization, known locally as the ""Pink House"" because of its bubble gum-colored paint, is named in the case. 
""Our little case here, everything hangs on it,” said Hancock, tears forming under her lavender eye shadow as she talked about patients, some who drive hundreds of miles and scrape together the $150 needed for an initial appointment.
""If they do overturn Roe, we’re done,"" she said. ""I know in my heart this is the big enchilada.""
Mississippi is one of six states with a single abortion clinic. It is also one of about 10 states with “trigger laws” that would effectively ban abortion outright without Roe v. Wade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
Three others border Mississippi - Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee - meaning an overturn of Roe could eliminate legal abortion access for millions of women in the U.S. South. 
Mississippi has enacted other laws that impede the ability to get abortions. Women must wait at least 24 hours between their first consultation and the procedure, there are mandatory sonograms, minors need parental consent, and public funding through Medicaid does not cover most cases. 
The Jackson clinic has been on the brink of a shutdown before as a result of various restrictive laws. After the Supreme Court news broke last week, the clinic received a flurry of calls from panicked patients asking if it would stay open, said its director, Shannon Brewer.
Sitting at her office desk a few days later, Brewer’s eyes darted constantly to a television showing feeds from the clinic’s security cameras. She said she could not break the nervous habit: People have vandalized the property in the past, and Brewer fears for the safety of the staff and doctors.
""The impact it would have affects so many clinics, so many women,"" Brewer said. ""This one has a huge impact across the country.""
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM FOR ABORTION OPPONENTS
The Supreme Court’s review is a victory for anti-abortion lawmakers who have pushed hundreds of abortion restrictions through Republican-led state legislatures in recent years.
Outside the Pink House, most of the anti-abortion protesters said a favorable decision would not be enough.
“Ideally I’d like a constitutional amendment that recognizes the humanity of the unborn,” said Dr. Beverly McMillan, a former Mississippi abortion provider who now opposes the procedure.
She paced along the clinic sidewalk praying her rosary beads, part of a group of protesters that included street preachers blasting gospel music and soft-spoken elderly women handing out prayer cards.
Allan Klein, an engineer also praying rosary beads, said he felt removing the constitutional right to abortion was just an initial step and that religious reasoning was needed to prevent women from ending pregnancies. 
""I’m more interested in getting people to change their minds,"" he said. ""Ultimately, law enforcement isn’t going to completely keep people from doing what they want to do.""
For L.W., a 33-year-old mother of two who asked to go by her initials for privacy, difficult circumstances led her to shift her stance on abortion.
A Jehovah’s Witness, she previously leaned against abortion. But financial hardship and her struggle with alcoholism played a role in her decision to get a medication abortion at eight weeks pregnant, she said.
""I struggled between ‘I don’t want to do it’ and ‘I have to do it,’"" L.W. said, sitting in the clinic's gated courtyard last week after a check-up. 
In Mississippi, where some 20% of residents live in poverty, the majority of abortion patients get financial assistance through national abortion funds to cover the procedure, which can exceed $600. The women often still have to save up for the cost of at least two trips - one for state-mandated counseling and another for the procedure.
About half of women who get abortions in the United States are in poverty, according to Guttmacher’s most recent data from 2014. 

L.W. said her experience made her more passionate about protecting abortion rights.
""No one here knows what I’m going through,” she said, her hands folded in her lap as shouting and music echoed from the street.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gordon Sondland, the former U.S. ambassador who testified against President Donald Trump during his first impeachment, sued former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the federal government on Monday seeking $1.8 million in legal fees.
Sondland, in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, accused Pompeo of not covering his legal expenses as promised after the ambassador told lawmakers about Trump's interactions with Ukraine in 2019, ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Sondland, who had served as the American ambassador to the European Union, in the lawsuit said he was fired on Feb. 7, 2020, after appearing before a House panel on Oct. 17 and Nov. 20, 2019, for ""simply for telling the truth.""
""For all his troubles, Ambassador Sondland learned that testifying truthfully and candidly before Congress as cameras roll was in fact a fireable offense in Pompeo's Department of State,"" the lawsuit said.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeached the Republican former president in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from Trump's request that year that Ukraine investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. The Senate, led by Trump's fellow Republicans, voted to acquit Trump in February 2020. Biden defeated Trump in last year's election.
During the impeachment investigation, Sondland told Congress ""everyone was in the loop"" regarding Trump administration efforts to pressure Ukraine. 
""Was there a quid pro quo? ... Yes,"" Sondland told lawmakers, using a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor. 
Pompeo later said he never saw Sondland's testimony in advance. 
A spokesperson for Pompeo called the lawsuit ""ludicrous.""
""Mr. Pompeo is confident the court will see it the same way,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed comment.
Sondland, a Seattle-based businessman who had donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration committee, was appointed by the former president as the ambassador to the EU. Trump later distanced himself from Sondland.
In the lawsuit, Sondland said he was told in 2019 that government lawyers would not be provided for him but that Pompeo ""assured"" him that ""the State Department would reimburse him for all of his legal costs"" when House lawmakers initially sought his testimony. 

""After Pompeo learned what Ambassador Sondland's testimony was before Congress during the 2019 Impeachment Inquiry - words that were entirely candid and truthful (but uncomfortable to the Trump Administration) - Pompeo reneged on his promise"" in a ""willful breach of the October 2019 agreement"" to pay his costs, the lawsuit added.
The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Congress clashed on Sunday over the need for an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with one lawmaker warning that failure to create the panel could plague the party's election prospects in 2022 and beyond.
A measure to establish the commission passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last week with support from 35 Republicans. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he opposes the bill, which the Senate is expected to debate this week. 
""I believe Republicans in the Senate will decide that it's too early to create that commission,"" Senator Roy Blunt, a member of McConnell's leadership team, told the television program ""Fox News Sunday.""
Like McConnell, Blunt contends that ongoing probes by two Senate committees are sufficient to settle questions about Capitol security. Others say a commission is necessary to examine whether Trump took action to stop the violence as it unfolded. 
""Is the priority to secure the Capitol, to do what we need to do to better train, better prepare Capitol Police, decide what we want to do in the future?"" Blunt asked. ""Or is the priority to take what will be a couple of years, in my view, to decide what happened inside the White House?"" 
His comments added to doubts about whether Senate Democrats can find support from 10 Republicans needed to advance the measure. In the 50-50 Senate, most bills require 60 votes for passage.
But Republican Senator Susan Collins, one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in February, said she believes the commission bill can move forward with changes to ensure bipartisan staffing and a year-end end date. 
""I'm optimistic that we can get past these issues,"" Collins said on ABC's ""This Week"" program. ""I strongly support the creation of an independent commission."" 
Republicans worry the commission would keep public attention on violence at the Capitol and could reveal new details about Trump's handling of the emergency that might sour voters on Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections.
Some claim falsely that the violence was due not to Trump supporters but to Black Lives Matter demonstrators or antifa activists trying to make Trump look bad. 
Representative Adam Kinzinger warned that failure to establish a commission could lead to worse consequences for Republicans.

""What's going to happen if this thing fails is that (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi will run a select committee and this could go all the way to 2024,"" Kinzinger, a Republican who backed the commission and voted to impeach Trump, told ""Fox News Sunday.""
""This is going to the 2022 midterms anyway, particularly if us as Republicans don't take ownership for what happened,"" Kinzinger said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans and the White House could have as little as a week to 10 days to overcome their differences on infrastructure and strike a deal to revitalize America's roads and bridges, a top Republican said on Sunday. 
Senator Roy Blunt, who is among a group of Republicans negotiating with the Biden administration, said the two sides are still far apart on how to define infrastructure, which President Joe Biden views as a wide-ranging topic that includes climate change and social issues such as elder care, as well as roads and bridges. 
""I do think we've got about a week or 10 days to decide if we can work together on this or not,"" Blunt said in an interview on the television program ""Fox News Sunday.""
Blunt gave no reason for his prediction. Some Democrats have suggested Biden could give Republicans until the end of May to agree on legislation. The Senate is also scheduled to depart for its Memorial Day holiday break at the end of this week. 
On Friday, the White House pared down Biden's initial $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal to $1.7 trillion in a bid to move closer to a deal with Republicans. Senate Republicans, including Blunt, dismissed the gesture as insufficient.
Some Republicans believe the success of current infrastructure negotiations could determine how much bipartisan scope there is for other White House priorities. 
""This is the test. This will determine whether or not we can work together in a bipartisan way on an important issue,"" Republican Senator Susan Collins, a leading advocate of bipartisanship, told ABC's program This Week.
Biden's sweeping proposal includes traditional infrastructure projects but also seeks to rechart the direction of the U.S. economy with its focus on climate change and social programs. 
Republicans have rejected Biden's plan and instead called for an approach limited to roads, bridges, airports, waterways and broadband access. They unveiled an initial proposal costing $568 billion.
'STILL PRETTY FAR APART'
Despite Biden's stated interest in bipartisanship, Democrats and White House officials say the president could decide to move forward without Republican support, if Republican lawmakers are unable to agree on a bipartisan plan.
""He will not let inaction be the answer and when it gets to a point where it looks like that is inevitable, you'll see him change course,"" Cedric Richmond, director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, told CNN's State of the Union program on Sunday.
""But for now, we're engaged in what we want to be a bipartisan infrastructure bill that invests in the backbone of this country, the middle class, and our future,"" he added. 
Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told CBS' Face the Nation program: ""If they're not coming forward, we've got to go forward alone.""
Collins said the White House's move to pare back the Biden proposal simply moves some of the original spending into separate legislation now on the Senate floor. 
""So I think we're still pretty far apart,"" said the Maine Republican. 
Collins and other Republicans have pointed to the mammoth size of the Biden plan as a reason for their opposition, saying the spending raises concerns about the deficit and federal debt. Republicans also reject Biden's plan to pay for infrastructure by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. 

Blunt said spending is not the biggest difference facing negotiators now.
""Our biggest gap is defining what infrastructure is,"" he said. ""If we get to a definition of infrastructure that the country would have always accepted, that becomes a much narrower space than it appears to be right now,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For the last two elections, Democrats regarded Brian Fitzpatrick as one of the U.S. Congress's most vulnerable Republicans, but both times they failed to unseat him, even when his suburban Philadelphia district voted for Democratic President Joe Biden.
He is again on their target list for the Nov. 8, 2022, midterm elections - which will determine whether Biden's Democrats keep control of Congress - but Democratic officials say finding a suitable candidate could be a challenge because the borders of the district are in flux and could be for months.
""That's a significant concern,"" said John Cordisco, chairman of the Democratic Party in Bucks County, which lies within the district. ""When you are challenging a multiple-term incumbent, if you don't have immediate name recognition -- it becomes very problematic.""
The reason for the uncertainty is redistricting https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-redistricting/how-the-battle-over-redistricting-in-2021-could-decide-control-of-the-u-s-congress-idUSKBN2AI1CX, the once-a-decade process by which House of Representatives districts are redrawn based on shifts in the U.S. population https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-us-census-data-will-show-which-states-gain-or-lose-house-seats-2021-04-26. The process always unsettles congressional elections, but this year the coronavirus pandemic has added to the turbulence by delaying the delivery of the census data needed to draw the districts until September.
""This is the most challenging redistricting cycle in decades,"" said Michael Li, a lawyer at New York University's nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. 
The redistricting delays compound what is already shaping up to be a difficult election for Democrats. Typically, the party that holds the White House loses seats in Congress in the president's first term. Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to take control. 
In states such as California, which has its map set by an independent commission, the redistricting process could run up against next spring's deadlines for candidates to file.
""For a lot of folks, that can really stall their rollout in terms of running for office,"" said Paul Mitchell, a redistricting consultant in Sacramento. ""It's a bigger problem for challengers.""
California is home to four of 21 Republican-held districts the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, an arm of the party that backs House candidates, has targeted for next year. Fitzpatrick's district is another. The DCCC has also identified 32 other seats held by Democrats that it considers vulnerable.
Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent, has billed himself as an independent voice in Congress. His office did not respond to a request for comment.
Republican control of the vast majority of state legislatures gives the party an advantage: In states where partisan lawmakers will draw the new maps, Republicans will fashion 187 new congressional districts, Li said. Democrats will draw just 75.
STATES OF PLAY
Redistricting is likely to further endanger Democrats' prospects for holding the House. Democrats retain hope that moderate voters will be put off by Republicans' continued embrace of former President Donald Trump, even after the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, while giving them credit for the country's improving fortunes as the pandemic eases.
Republican-controlled legislatures in Florida, Georgia and Texas likely will attempt to create maps that reduce the number of competitive House seats by concentrating Democratic voters in clusters, a process known as gerrymandering.
Those maps are almost certain to draw lawsuits charging they unfairly favor Republicans at the expense of Democrats and historically marginalized voters. But the compressed timeframe means the districts may remain in effect for the 2022 elections even as the cases are fought in court, Li said.
In Georgia, Democratic gains around Atlanta could be diminished if the legislature combines the seats held by Representatives Carolyn Bourdeaux and Lucy McBath into a single district. In Texas, a suburban Dallas district narrowly won both by Biden and Republican Beth Van Duyne that Democrats hope to take next year could be redrawn to bolster Van Duyne's reelection prospects. 
In Florida, some veteran Democrats are heeding the warning signs. Representative Charlie Crist is leaving his seat to run for governor. Representatives Val Demings and Stephanie Murphy are eyeing challenges to Republican Senator Marco Rubio.
Pennsylvania, which stands to lose a seat due to population changes, will offer a different challenge. If its Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic governor cannot agree upon a new map, the state Supreme Court will intervene, as it did ahead of the 2018 elections.
The process could spill deep into next year, perhaps giving Fitzpatrick an insurmountable advantage, said Cordisco, the Democratic county chairman.
A spokesperson for the DCCC would not address whether the uncertainty surrounding redistricting was affecting candidate recruiting but said the party would fight to ensure that maps across the country are drawn fairly. 

Li, the Brennan Center lawyer, said that it may already be too late for such efforts to make a difference.
Republicans, he said, ""have the ability to lock in a good chance of having a majority the rest of the decade. That's what is at stake. The whole of the decade is on the line.""

(Reuters) - Former Republican U.S. senator Rick Santorum has been dropped as a senior political commentator by CNN after remarks he made about Native American culture drew criticism.
Santorum gave a speech in April at an event of a conservative organization named the Young America's Foundation where he said:
""We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes, we have Native Americans, but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture.""
CNN, which came under pressure to drop him as a commentator after the remarks, said on Saturday it had parted ways with Santorum.
""When I signed on with CNN, I understood I would be providing commentary that is not regularly heard by the typical CNN viewer. I appreciate the opportunity CNN provided me over the past 4 years,"" Santorum said later on Twitter.
The Native American Journalists Association had urged indigenous journalists to avoid working with CNN and had called for his dismissal from the television network.
When Santorum appeared on the network in early May, on ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" CNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked him about the subject, and Santorum acknowledged that his comments were inaccurate. He said that he misspoke.

""I was talking about, and I misspoke in this respect, I was talking about the founding, and the principles embodied in the founding.""
""The way we treated Native Americans was horrific. It goes against every bone and everything I've ever fought for, as a leader, in the Congress,"" he told CNN. ""I was simply talking about the founding documents of the United States, not the Colonies.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said he would not allow his Justice Department to seize the phone or email records of reporters, saying any such move would be ""simply wrong.""
Biden's comments came a day after CNN reported that the Justice Department had told its correspondent Barbara Starr that the former Trump administration had secretly obtained two months of her phone and email records in 2017.
The Washington Post earlier this month said the Trump administration had also secretly obtained the phone records of three of its reporters over work they did in 2017.
""Absolutely, positively, it's wrong,"" Biden told reporters after a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. ""It's simply, simply wrong. I will not let that happen.""
CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer welcomed Biden's comments as ""really encouraging news.""
Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters earlier Friday that the Justice Department intends to meet with media representatives following CNN’s revelation.
“This president is committed strongly to the rights of freedom of the press, as you have seen for decades, and for standing up for the rights of journalists,” she said.
She said Biden's Justice Department intended to use the ""Holder model,"" not that of the Trump administration, in regard to its practices, a reference to former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama.
Holder revised Justice Department rules in 2013 to restrict the government's ability to subpoena the records of reporters without express consent from the top of the department, although he later faced criticism for approving the seizing of call records from Associated Press and Fox News reporters.
Former President Donald Trump had a contentious relationship with the press, often publicly lambasting reporters and their outlets as ""fake news.""

The National Press Club earlier this month said the Trump administration's moves to seize reporters' phone records marked ""another deeply disturbing example in a series of violations by the Trump administration of America’s trust in government and an outright assault against the press and the First Amendment.""
""While the government has a right to probe leaks of classified information, it must take great care to avoid a harm that could prove more serious: chilling the flow of information to the free press,"" the club's leaders said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Friday it had pared down its infrastructure bill to $1.7 trillion from $2.25 trillion, with cuts to investments in broadband and roads and bridges, but Republicans dismissed the changes as insufficient for a deal.
The White House effort represented a desire by President Joe Biden to engage with the opposition party on an issue that the Democratic president has made a priority in his early days in office.
But the two sides remain far apart on everything from the size of the package to how to pay for it. 
White House officials held a call with a group of Republican senators on Friday to hash out some of their differences and present the new draft.
""This proposal exhibits a willingness to come down in size, giving on some areas that are important to the president ... while also staying firm in areas that are most vital to rebuilding our infrastructure and industries of the future,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
Some aspects that had been removed from the new proposal, such as investments in research and development, would find their way into other bills, she said.
Republican U.S. Senators Shelley Moore Capito, John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, Mike Crapo, Pat Toomey, and Roger Wicker have put forward their own proposal, which is much smaller than the White House version. 
They said the White House proposal could not pass Congress with bipartisan support.
""Based on today’s meeting, the groups seem further apart after two meetings with White House staff than they were after one meeting with President Biden,"" the senators said in a statement, adding that they would continue to engage with the administration.
A White House memo showed Biden's new proposal would reduce spending on broadband to $65 billion, down from an initially proposed $100 billion.
Spending on roads, bridges and major infrastructure projects would drop to $120 billion, down from Biden's initial proposal of $159 billion but well above Republicans' desired $48 billion.
Psaki said that because the overall cost of the package had come down, the need for ""pay-fors"" would also be reduced. Biden remained committed to not raising taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year, she said.

The White House plan, which Republicans have decried as too expensive, would seek to address climate change and social issues such as elder care, in addition to revitalizing traditional transportation infrastructure. 
It would cover the cost of the investments by raising taxes on U.S. corporations and wealthy Americans. Top Republican lawmakers have said they would not agree to a tax hike.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Georgia judge on Friday ordered Atlanta's Fulton County to unseal more than 145,000 absentee ballots cast during the November 2020 election, allowing self-described election integrity activists to evaluate the legitimacy of the ballots.
Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero, who is overseeing the case, ruled that Fulton County must unseal the ballots so the petitioners could inspect and scan them, not merely look at copies, according to his order filed in the Fulton County Superior Court.
The order paves the way for a second review of ballots in the United States by private groups who claim without evidence that widespread voting fraud in populous cities helped Joe Biden, a Democrat, unfairly defeat then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.
Trump and his allies spent two months denying his election defeat. State and federal officials and multiple courts rejected the Trump campaign's claims that the election was stolen from him. Trump followers attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 while Congress was certifying the results, leading to five deaths.
Since then, Trump supporters have sought revisions of voting outcomes in several states. Arizona's Republican-controlled state Senate ordered an audit of roughly 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County, where nearly two thirds of the state's population resides.
""I wouldn't be surprised if we see something similar in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, because this is a way for these actors to fundraise for elections going into 2022 and 2024,"" said Aunna Dennis, Executive Director of good government group Common Cause Georgia.
The nine petitioners seeking to inspect and scan Fulton County's absentee ballots are led by Garland Favorito, a Fulton County voter who said, in the petition last December that launched the case, that he saw an ""abnormal"" increase in votes for Biden while observing the ballot tabulation in his county.
Favorito is the co-founder of a self-described election watchdog group called Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, according to his Twitter profile.
""This conspiracy theory about counterfeit ballots has been trotted out by proponents of the 'Big Lie' across the country and shot down every time,"" said Fulton County Chairman Robb Pitts in a statement on Friday after Amero ordered the county to unseal the absentee ballots.

Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, had previously asked the court to let the petitioners only view copies of the ballots, not inspect and scan the original ballots, according to an amicus brief he filed in April.
In an apparent about-face on Friday, however, Raffensperger seemed to support Amero's decision, writing in a Twitter post, without detailing evidence, that Fulton County had long mismanaged its elections, and that ""allowing this audit provides another layer of transparency and citizen engagement.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have confiscated roughly $90,000 from a Utah man who sold footage of a woman being fatally shot during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, according to court filings.
Prosecutors also have filed additional criminal charges against the man, John Earle Sullivan, a self-described political activist who is accused of entering the Capitol building and participating in the riot, the filings unsealed on Thursday showed.
Sullivan now faces a total of eight criminal counts, including weapons charges, related to the riot. Sullivan's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors have charged more than 440 people in connection with the attack in which Trump supporters stormed the Capitol after he gave a speech to them repeating his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. The mob smashed windows, fought police and sent lawmakers into hiding. Five people died. 
Many participants, including Sullivan, posted their actions on social media.
According to the court filings, Sullivan portrayed himself as an independent journalist who was reporting on the chaos, but actually encouraged other participants to ""burn"" the building and engage in violence. 
Sullivan recorded video of the confrontation between rioters and police just outside the U.S. House of Representatives chamber that included the shooting of protester Ashli Babbitt and, according to court filings, boasted to an unnamed witness that ""my footage is worth like a million of dollars, millions of dollars.""

Sullivan sold that footage to several news outlets for a total of $90,000, according to a seizure warrant. The news outlets were redacted from the warrant.
According to media reports, Sullivan participated in Black Lives Matter protests last year. Other Black Lives Matter activists in his home state have disavowed him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week after House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy gambled he could unify his caucus by ousting a prominent critic of former President Donald Trump, a new Trump-inspired rift has raised questions about his leadership.
Thirty-five Republican representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives - or one out of every six - joined the 219 majority Democrats in voting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-set-vote-commission-probe-deadly-jan-6-capitol-attack-2021-05-19 to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building, fighting with police and leaving five people dead.
That was more than three times as many Republicans as voted in January to hold Trump's second impeachment trial, on a charge of inciting insurrection.
The vote followed a series of gyrations in which McCarthy gave Representative John Katko the go-ahead to negotiate the bipartisan deal https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-seek-form-bipartisan-panel-jan-6-attack-2021-05-14, then rejected it after it became public and tried to persuade his fellow Republicans to vote against it.
The vote would appear to weaken McCarthy, a California lawmaker who hopes to become speaker of the 435-member House if his party can assemble a majority with just five more seats in the November 2022 congressional election.
Loyal to Trump, McCarthy, 56, with 14 years in Washington, last week led his party in ousting Representative Liz Cheney from a House leadership role for denouncing Trump's false claim his election defeat was the result of fraud.
""Representative McCarthy may have put his own ambition above loyalty to our Constitution,"" said party strategist Kevin Kellems. ""It eventually will harm him and his followers.""
McCarthy himself denied any loss to his leadership. When asked where the Cheney ouster and commission vote left him, he said: ""Just stronger."" 
He told reporters that he had expected a larger number of Republicans to break ranks. 
Several Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity said they had not expected a commission deal that would reach the House floor.
Some lamented that the deal between Katko and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, had not been put to a party conference vote before a final agreement.
""It would have been good for us to have voted on it,"" Representative Thomas Massie, a staunch conservative, said without mentioning McCarthy.
Republican hopes of blocking the bipartisan commission now rest with McCarthy's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell, who has also come out against it. McConnell has the easier job, as that 100-member chamber's rules require 60 votes to advance most legislation, meaning 10 Senate Republicans would have to break with their party to pass it.
Republicans worry the commission would keep public attention on the violence that played out in the Capitol after a fiery speech by Trump filled with falsehoods, and could reveal new details about Trump's handling of the response that might sour voters on Republicans.
EYES ON SPEAKER'S GAVEL
With a Democrat in the White House, history favors Republican chances of breaking Democrats' 219-211 majority in the House in the 2022 midterm election.
McCarthy, who has spent a decade in the upper echelon of House Republican leadership, has been sharply criticized for voting to block Democratic President Joe Biden's election, reversing course after saying Trump bore responsibility for the Capitol attack and visiting the former president at his Florida resort in a move seen as helping to rehabilitate Trump's image in the aftermath of the violence.
He justified the ouster of Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, as an effort to forge party unity. 
Multiple Republicans defended McCarthy's position. 
""Kevin puts the team first. This is a difficult and stressful time. I think he's making the best decisions that anyone could make in a super-charged atmosphere,"" said Representative Tom Cole. 
But Republicans who oppose Trump criticized the action, saying it cemented the former president's hold over the caucus. 
They voiced concern that the vote could undermine hopes of capturing the House majority in 2022, if it leads Trump-inspired primary challengers to unseat incumbents in swing districts where many voters dislike the former president.
Republicans who voted for the commission included lawmakers such as Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who won a contested election by just six votes, and Don Bacon, whose Nebraska district chose Biden over Trump in November by 52% to 46%.
""What it really boils down to is how President Trump is going to react to Republicans supporting this measure,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. ""If they don't show Trump that they're against this, there's potentially going to be issues for many Republicans in their primaries.""

Trump in a Thursday statement lashed out at what he called ""35 wayward Republicans.""
""Sometimes there are consequences to being ineffective and weak,"" Trump said. ""The voters understand!""

Blinken was visiting Greenland after attending a meeting of the Arctic Council in Iceland, which he said was a signal of Washington's desire to enhance ties with ""our Arctic partners, Greenland and Denmark.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge seen as a possible future U.S. Supreme Court pick by President Joe Biden cleared a key hurdle on Thursday in her nomination to an influential appellate court, winning approval in a Senate committee despite Republican opposition.
The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Washington-based U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on a 13-9 vote. All those in opposition were Republicans, with two - Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) and John Cornyn - voting with Democrats to approve the nomination. 
Jackson's nomination now heads for a final confirmation vote in the full Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Democrats.
Biden nominated Jackson to the D.C. Circuit to replace Attorney General Merrick Garland on the bench. That appellate court in the past has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court for some justices.
The Democratic president pledged during his election campaign to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court if he gets a chance to fill a vacancy, which would be a historic first. Jackson is among the most prominent Black women in the federal judiciary and, at age 50, is also relatively young.
At Jackson's confirmation hearing last month, several Republicans questioned her on whether race plays a role in her approach to deciding cases.
In explaining his vote against Jackson's nomination, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said he would not support any nominee who would not commit to a conservative approach to judging known as originalism.
""Unless a circuit nominee can show he or she is affirmatively committed to the Constitution as originally understood, I don't think he or she should be confirmed,"" Grassley said, adding that Jackson had not given that assurance.
Jackson was appointed to her current post by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013. 
With conservatives holding a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, liberal activists have been urging the court's eldest member, 82-year-old liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, to retire this year while Democrats control the Senate. A Harvard Law School graduate, Jackson early in her career served as one of Breyer's law clerks at the Supreme Court. 
Nominees can win confirmation to lifetime judicial appointments with a simple majority vote in the 100-seat Senate, which is currently split 50-50 between the parties and is controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote.

Jackson and another Black female judge, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, are considered frontrunners to be nominated by Biden should Breyer step aside.
The committee also advanced several other nominations including that of Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a Black woman lawyer nominated to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The committee also approved the nomination of Zahid Quraishi, who would be the first Muslim to serve as a U.S. district court judge.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The conservative and Greens candidates to succeed German Chancellor Angela Merkel after September's federal election clashed on Thursday on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, and on whether Germany should host U.S nuclear weapons.
In their first debate, focused on foreign and security policy, Armin Laschet, from Merkel's conservative alliance, welcomed a decision by the U.S. administration this week to waive sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its chief executive.
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and its Western partners are racing to finish the pipeline to send natural gas under the Baltic Sea. The project, now about 95% complete, would bypass Ukraine, depriving it of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle with Russia.
""I stand by the project and consider it important,"" Laschet said in the debate hosted by broadcaster WDR. 
""This decision on how we organize our energy supply we make ourselves, by the way, and so it is a good signal that the policy of President Trump has ended,"" he said, referring to the U.S. waiver on sanctions.
""Germany always has Ukraine's security in mind,"" he added.
But Annalena Baerbock, the environmentalist Greens' candidate, said the pipeline issue was ""about war and peace"", arguing that Nord Stream 2 risks undermining Ukraine's security. In recent months, Russia, in what it called a defensive exercise, massed troops on its western border with Ukraine and in Crimea.
Baerbock made the running for much of the debate, but Laschet and Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrats' (SPD) chancellor candidate, called her out when she said ""this German government is completely against all other Europeans with this (pipeline) project.""
In the most heated exchange in the hour-long debate, Laschet retorted: ""That's not true Ms. Baerbock, and you know it.""

The project pits Germany, the EU's biggest economy, against central and eastern European nations, some of them EU members, who say it would increase the bloc's dependence on Russian gas.
Baerbock's differences with Laschet and Scholz are significant because opinion polls show a coalition is as good as certain to follow after the election, with the Greens likely to join forces with either Laschet's conservative camp or Scholz's SPD.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to create an independent commission to probe the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, as one in six Republicans defied party leaders' attempts to block it.
Over the past two days, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell worked to kill a bipartisan bill to establish the commission to investigate the violence that left five dead including a Capitol Police officer.
But the House voted by 252-175 to approve the commission, which was styled after the panel that probed attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The bill now goes to the Senate where its future was uncertain.
The solid number of Republicans voting for the independent investigation -- 35 out of 211 -- signaled some cracks in the party's defense of Trump on a key vote. Trump opposes the creation of a commission.
All 10 of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January voted for the commission.
The bipartisan outcome could give Senate Republicans second thoughts about working to defeat the initiative.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said McCarthy ""got what he asked for"" in a compromise on the structure of the commission, which would be charged with wrapping up its investigation by Dec. 31. McCarthy is a close ally of Trump.
Earlier in the day, McConnell announced he would not support the House bill, calling it ""the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal"" and saying existing congressional investigations are sufficient.
In the 50-50 Senate - controlled by Democrats only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes - Republicans can block the legislation. At least 60 votes are needed to advance most bills.
""There will continue to be no shortage of robust investigations,"" said McConnell, who in January said that the mob that attacked the Capitol was ""fed lies"" and ""provoked"" by Trump and others.
PELOSI'S BACKUP PLAN
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she could launch regular committee hearings with ""full subpoena power"" to investigate the riot if Senate Republicans block the commission.
""But that's not the path we have chosen to go,"" Pelosi added, explaining that a bipartisan, outside investigation was needed to win the public's trust in any findings. 
The 10-member commission would produce a public report including recommendations for preventing another Capitol attack. It would be charged with examining security and intelligence failures surrounding the riot in which Trump's supporters, after he delivered an incendiary speech, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election.
During debate, Republican Representative John Katko said, ""An independent 9/11-style review is critical for removing the politics around Jan. 6.""
Katko helped craft the legislation with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat.
The House bill, unveiled last week, would give Republicans equal power with Democrats in appointing commissioners and equal say over witnesses.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will schedule a debate on the legislation. Schumer accused Republican leaders of ""caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the Big Lie"" that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Trump through massive voter fraud.
Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, earlier in the day told reporters that while she favors modifications to the House bill, ""I do think a commission is a good idea."" Republican Senator John Cornyn left open the possibility of negotiating changes to the House bill.
House Democrats said congressional investigations are insufficient. Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren, who chairs the House Administration Committee that has held hearings on the attack, told reporters her panel has uncovered ""serious errors"" leading up to the attack.
Describing a ""howling mob"" that called for hanging Vice President Mike Pence, Lofgren said her panel's work does not answer questions about who incited the mob.
""That's why we need a bipartisan, prestigious, top-of-the-line commission to find out what happened and why it happened,"" Lofgren said.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene explained her opposition, saying on the House floor: ""The media is going to use this (commission) to smear Trump supporters and President Trump for the next few years and cover up the real damage that is happening to the people of this country, which is tearing down our economy.""
Trump on Tuesday urged Republicans to vote against the proposal, calling it a ""trap"" inspired by ""the radical left."" Republican lawmakers who vote in favor of the commission risk drawing the wrath of Trump ahead of the 2022 elections in which Democrats are seeking to retain control of Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican lawmakers met on Tuesday with top officials from President Joe Biden's administration to seek common ground on an infrastructure proposal but said they did not present a new plan of their own.
Senators who attended the meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said they discussed how infrastructure investment would be paid for. 
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading the Republican effort, announced a counter-proposal of $568 billion https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-unveil-568-bln-infrastructure-package-counter-bidens-23-trillion-2021-04-22 in April, far short of Biden's $2.3 trillion plan. A bipartisan group of senators has discussed a package of roughly $1 trillion.
""I think they're digesting what we proposed and I think the plan is for them to react to that,"" Capito said. She said no other meeting with administration officials had been scheduled.
The White House said in a statement it was encouraged by the talks and would follow up with the Republican senators later this week. 
Biden's administration has said it is willing to work with Republicans but will forge ahead with only Democratic support if necessary. The White House had set a Tuesday deadline for Republicans to offer a new infrastructure plan.
Biden's mammoth infrastructure proposal includes traditional projects to revitalize roads and bridges but would also seek to address climate change and social issues such as care of the elderly. The president said he would pay for the plan by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. 

Republicans have rejected Biden's proposal as too broad and too expensive and instead have sought to reach a bipartisan deal that focuses on roads, bridges, waterways and broadband access. 
Democrats have floated a two-track approach that would include a smaller bipartisan package, as well as more sweeping legislation that they could enact without Republican support through a process known as reconciliation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is working to reopen some cases of non-Mexican asylum seekers who were forced to wait in Mexico under the administration of former President Donald Trump, a top U.S. border official said on Wednesday.
The move would allow those migrants to enter the United States to pursue their claims for protection and represents the latest step by President Joe Biden to unwind a Trump-era program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
Pro-immigrant advocates have called for the Biden administration to reopen the cases of migrants who were ordered deported after they failed to appear at a scheduled court date while enrolled in the MPP program. Advocates say some migrants could not attend hearings because they were kidnapped or in other danger in Mexico or due to logistical problems https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-courts-insight/hasty-rollout-of-trump-immigration-policy-has-broken-border-courts-idUSKCN1VV115.
Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, moved to wind down https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-immigration-asylum/biden-to-bring-in-asylum-seekers-forced-to-wait-in-mexico-under-trump-program-idUSKBN2AC113 the Trump program in February as part of a broader effort to undo his Republican predecessor's restrictive policies. The United States has already allowed more than 10,000 migrants into the country who had active MPP cases, Troy Miller, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), said during a congressional hearing on Wednesday.
Nearly 28,000 migrants were ordered deported due to a failure to appear in court since the MPP program began in 2019, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
BuzzFeed News reported the decision on Tuesday, citing internal government documents.
Some Republicans have blamed an increase in migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months in part on Biden's decision to end the MPP program.
Pro-immigrant advocates and Democrats praised the move, saying the Trump program denied migrants the ability to seek asylum in the United States.

U.S. border authorities are also preparing for the eventual end of a different Trump-era health policy that allows migrants to be rapidly expelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, Miller said.
Shortly after taking office, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the policy, known as Title 42, but has continued to apply it to single adults and some families.

Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Pocan and Rashida Tlaib were lead sponsors of the measure, which has at least six other co-sponsors including some of the most left-leaning Democrats in the House.
They have been among lawmakers calling for a more concerted U.S. effort to stop the violence, including Israeli airstrikes that have killed dozens of civilians, most of them Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration approved the potential sale of $735 million in weapons to Israel earlier this year, and sent it to Congress for formal review on May 5, giving lawmakers 15 days to object under laws governing foreign weapons sales.
""At a time when so many, including President Biden, support a ceasefire, we should not be sending 'direct attack' weaponry to Prime Minister Netanyahu to prolong this violence,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.
The resolution is unlikely to progress further in the House, where the office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi controls which legislation comes up for a vote. The chamber's leaders have expressed support for the sale, with No. 2 Democrat Steny Hoyer telling reporters yesterday he backed it. 

The sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, was considered routine at the time, before the start earlier this month of the fiercest hostilities in the region in years.
Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress generally express strong support for Israel. The country has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War Two, with Washington currently providing Israel some $3.8 billion a year in military aid.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's commission to study potential changes to the U.S. Supreme Court held its first meeting on Wednesday and will have six months to issue a report on reforms including possibly expanding the number of justices, an idea touted by some liberal activists and Democratic lawmakers. 
""We definitely have our work cut out for us,"" commission co-chair Cristina Rodriguez said at the end of the virtual meeting that lasted less than half an hour. 
Rodriguez, a Yale Law School professor who served in the U.S. Justice Department under Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the 36-member bipartisan commission will not provide recommendations but rather evaluate the ""merits and legality"" of specific reform proposals. 
The other co-chair is Bob Bauer of New York University School of Law, who served as White House counsel under Obama.
Biden, a Democrat, signed https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/biden-creates-commission-study-potential-supreme-court-expansion-2021-04-09 an executive order https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/09/executive-order-on-the-establishment-of-the-presidential-commission-on-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states on April 9 creating the commission to examine possible changes to the nation's top judicial body including expanding beyond the current nine justices or applying term limits instead of lifetime appointments.
It also will study the scope of the court's power, its authority to strike down congressional legislation and how the justices select and decide cases. The commission will examine the court's increasing use of the so-called shadow docket https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-usa-court-shadow-video/the-shadow-docket-how-the-u-s-supreme-court-quietly-dispatches-key-rulings-idUSKBN2BF16Q, an accelerated form of decision-making that can effectively resolve major disputes without oral arguments or signed rulings. 
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority after Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump made three appointments during four years in office.
Republicans have opposed the idea of expanding the number of justices, sometimes called ""court packing."" The last time court expansion was seriously pursued was in the 1930s by Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt after a conservative court impeded his policies aimed at lifting America out of the Great Depression. 
A group of liberal Democratic lawmakers last month introduced legislation that would expand the number of justices by four. The White House and some senior Democratic lawmakers balked at that legislation, preferring to let the commission to do its work.
The number of justices has remained at nine since 1869, but Congress has the power to change that and has done so several times. Term limits would likely require a constitutional amendment, though some scholars have proposed ways to do it by statute.
Liberal activists remain enraged that Trump was able to appoint three justices, including filling one vacancy after Senate Republicans blocked consideration of an Obama nominee in 2016, arguing that confirmation would be improper during a presidential election year. Last year, days before another presidential election, Senate Republicans speedily confirmed Trump's final appointee, Amy Coney Barrett. 
The commission began its work two days after the court charged back into the battle over abortion, agreeing on Monday to hear Mississippi's bid to revive a Republican-backed state law that would ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The eventual ruling could undercut the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.

That case will be heard in the court's next nine-month term that begins in October, as will another dispute touching upon the nation's culture wars - a challenge to New York's restrictions on people carrying concealed handguns in public.
Rulings in those cases are expected next year. If the conservative majority limits abortion rights and expands gun rights, support could build among Democratic lawmakers for major structural changes to the court, according to experts. Democrats narrowly control both chambers of Congress.

Capito, speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” Wednesday, said the next two weeks will be critical in determining whether there’ll be a deal with the White House. She doubted, however, that a bill can make it through the House and Senate by a July 4 deadline proposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Next two weeks will probably be the critical time spot,” Capito said. But “right now it is hard for me to see July 4 as an end date,” she said.
Capito and other Republicans met Tuesday with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, National Economic Adviser Brian Deese and other administration officials to discuss a revised Republican counteroffer to Biden’s $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal, which married physical transportation improvements with social spending and corporate tax increases.
‘Moving Up’
The GOP is “moving up” from its initial $568 billion counteroffer, which included previously scheduled maintenance, Capito said, but she declined to give the new price tag. Republicans are increasingly open to spending on electric vehicle charging stations, Capito said.
“Our anticipation is that this would be a part of it,” she said of electric vehicle spending.
The group also discussed setting up an infrastructure bank or revolving fund to catalyze private investment and ways to boost public-private partnerships in order to fully pay for the spending in the plan, said Capito.
One of the ideas is to look at the 21 states that have cut supplemental unemployment benefits in recent weeks in response to labor shortages and whether those funds can be re-purposed.
She said that nothing is off the table at this point with regard to funding mechanisms, in the talks with the White House.
Capito also said she expects the White House to respond to the GOP ideas, hopefully Thursday or Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A St. Louis man who drew international attention for brandishing a gun at racial justice protesters last year has announced he will run for a Missouri U.S. Senate seat as a Republican.
Mark McCloskey, who was indicted in October for illegal use of a weapon after the June 2020 incident, filed paperwork with federal officials on Tuesday declaring his candidacy.
McCloskey, a personal injury attorney, joins a growing Republican field seeking the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Roy Blunt. Former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, a Republican, announced his candidacy in March. 
McCloskey rose to national fame among conservatives and gun rights activists for pointing a semi-automatic rifle at protesters marching past his home, and he and his wife spoke at the Republican National Convention in August when then-President Donald Trump was nominated for a second term as president. 
He has said that he and his wife Patricia, who pointed a handgun at protesters and faces similar charges, feared for their lives. 
Videos have shown the McCloskeys, who are white, shouting at Black and white protesters, who appeared to be unarmed, to keep off their property. 
The protests were part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations over police violence against Black people prompted by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer.
McCloskey said many Americans are tired of hearing about the country's racism issues.

""God came knocking on my door last summer disguised as an angry mob,"" he told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a broadcast interview on Tuesday. ""People are sick and tired of 'cancel culture.'""
He and his wife pleaded not guilty in October to two felony charges: unlawful use of a weapon and tampering with evidence. Trump said last year charging the couple was an abuse of power. Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in a November election.

Biden, a Democrat, is seeking $2.3 trillion in infrastructure and jobs funding. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize surface transportation funding. 
The House Republican plan would boost spending by 32% over a 2015 law and is up over the $330 billion they proposed last year. House Democrats last year proposed $494 billion over the same period, and there are significant differences over funding priorities.
The Republicans' $400 billion proposal does not include other infrastructure priorities like passenger rail, water, aviation, or broadband internet access, which will be addressed in other proposals.
""The path to improving America’s infrastructure is through partnership – not partisanship,"" said Representative Sam Graves, the top Republican on the transportation committee. ""Republicans want to work together on bipartisan infrastructure solutions, but in order to reach that goal, key principles must be addressed in this process."" 
The Republican bill would also streamline the federal permitting and environmental review process.

(Reuters) -A senior Southern Baptist Convention official who had criticized former President Donald Trump is leaving his post with the influential evangelical U.S. Christian denomination.
Russell Moore said in a statement that he will leave the Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission after eight years as its president. 
Moore will work for the evangelical magazine Christianity Today as a theologian and also lead a new Public Theology Project. The project will also be the main outlet for Moore's regular writing and his podcast, according to a news release from Christianity Today.
Many evangelical Christians have been strong supporters of right-wing American politics. In November's U.S. presidential election, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls. 
But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Moore emerged as a vocal critic of Trump, saying the then-candidate's personal behavior meant he was unworthy of the office.
He criticized evangelicals who unreservedly backed the Republican nominee.
""What a scandal to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the integrity of our witness,"" Moore wrote in 2016 after vulgar sexual comments made by Trump about women surfaced online https://reut.rs/2T5DVpb.
In January, Moore called on Trump to resign as president after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory.
""Mr. President, people are dead"", Moore wrote in a tweet on Jan. 8, two days after the attack. ""Could you please step down and let our country heal?""
Moore is expected to leave his post June 1, and the commission's board said it would soon begin searching for a successor, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The Christianity Today magazine, where Moore will now work as a public theologian, was founded in 1956 and is a publication focused on the American evangelical Christian movement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called for a U.S. diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, criticizing China for human rights abuses and saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Pelosi's remarks were ""full of lies"" and that human rights were developing vigorously in China.
U.S. lawmakers have been increasingly vocal about an Olympic boycott or venue change, and have lashed out at American corporations, arguing their silence about what the State Department has deemed a genocide of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China was abetting the Chinese government.
Pelosi, a Democrat, told a bipartisan congressional hearing on the issue that heads of state around the world should shun the Games, scheduled for February. 
""What I propose - and join those who are proposing - is a diplomatic boycott,"" Pelosi said, in which ""lead countries of the world withhold their attendance at the Olympics.""
""Let's not honor the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China,"" she added.
""For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?"" she said.
An independent United Nations panel said in 2018 it had received credible reports that at least 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims had been held in camps in China's Xinjiang region. Beijing describes them as vocational training centers to stamp out extremism, and strongly rejects accusations of abuse and genocide.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing that Pelosi's remarks were ""full of lies and false information,"" and the United States was afraid visiting countries would see China's ""vigorous development of human rights"".
In Washington, Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu earlier told Reuters that U.S. attempts to interfere in China's domestic affairs over the Olympics were doomed to fail.
""I wonder what makes some U.S. politicians think they actually have the so-called moral authority? On human rights issues, they are in no position, either historically or currently, to make wanton groundless criticism against China,"" Liu said. 
'HELD TO ACCOUNT'
Republican Congressman Chris Smith, who led the hearing, said corporate sponsors should be called to testify before Congress and be ""held to account"".
""Big business wants to make lots of money, and it doesn't seem to matter what cruelty - even genocide - that the host nation commits,"" Smith said. 
Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern added the Games should be postponed to give the International Olympic Committee (IOC) time to ""relocate to a country whose government is not committing atrocities.""
""If we can postpone an Olympics by a year for a pandemic, we can surely postpone the Olympics for a year for a genocide,"" McGovern said, referring to the decision by Japan and the IOC to delay the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo due to COVID-19. 
Demands for some form of boycott of the Beijing Games are growing. 
Last month, Republican Senator Mitt Romney introduced an amendment to broader legislation to counter China that would implement a U.S. diplomatic boycott.
And a coalition of human rights activists on Tuesday called for athletes to boycott the Games and put pressure on the IOC.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said it hopes to develop a joint approach with allies to participation in Beijing's Olympics, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken has repeatedly said the issue has not yet been broached in discussions.
Asked about Pelosi's comments, a senior U.S. administration official told Reuters the administration's position on the 2022 Olympics had not changed.
Biden, a Democrat, has said China is America's strategic competitor, and has vowed to not let the country surpass the United States as a world leader on his watch.
Proponents of Americans competing in Beijing's Olympics say it would be unfair to punish athletes, and the Games would provide a platform for the United States, which has one of the highest Winter Olympic medal counts, to show its vitality on the global stage. 

Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive officer of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a written statement the committee was concerned about the ""oppression of the Uyghur population,"" but barring U.S. athletes from the Games was ""certainly not the answer."" 
""Past Olympic boycotts have failed to achieve political ends,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A proposal to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters advanced in Congress on Tuesday even as one key Republican announced opposition and another suggested the former president could become a witness.
The Democratic-backed proposal won approval in the House of Representatives Rules Committee, setting up a planned vote in the full House on Wednesday. The party-line vote in the committee, with Democrats in favor and Republicans against, came hours after Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican and a Trump ally, announced his opposition.
In the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, pledged to bring the legislation up for a vote. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that he was ""pushing the pause button"" on the idea of creating a commission.
Indicating that his rank-and-file Republicans had not yet coalesced around a position, McConnell said they would be willing to listen to Democrats' arguments.
Trump's actions likely would be closely scrutinized in any commission investigation. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, asked during a CNN interview whether Trump should talk to the panel if it is created, said: ""If you put together a commission that is focused on the events of Jan. 6, then I think he's obviously a very key individual.""
Trump, in a statement, urged Republicans not to approve the commission, calling it ""just more partisan unfairness.""
The Rules Committee advanced a separate bill that would provide $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Capitol security, also opposed by Republicans.
Repudiating a deal on the commission announced last week by the top Democratic and Republican members of the House Homeland Security Committee, McCarthy said in a statement: ""I cannot support this legislation.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told reporters she was disappointed but not surprised over the ""cowardice"" shown by some Republicans ""not to want to find the truth.""
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, interrupting the formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory, fighting with police and leaving five dead including a police officer. Trump and some other Republicans have sought to downplay the violence.
McCarthy complained that Democrats refused to broaden the scope of the planned commission to include 2020 protests in many U.S. cities against racism and police brutality and a 2017 shooting that seriously wounded congressman Steve Scalise, now the No. 2 House Republican, during a practice at a baseball field.
Neither of those incidents was related to the Jan. 6 violence. Representative Tom Cole, the Rules Committee's top Republican, said it would make sense to include investigations into other acts of ""political violence."" Trump also said in his statement that violence associated with protests in other cities should be part of the investigation.
The bill would establish a 10-member bipartisan commission to investigate the causes of the attack, security shortcomings and intelligence information. The panel would be directed to release a final report by Dec. 31. It would be similar to one that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants and made sweeping recommendations. 
The Capitol rampage came after Trump gave an incendiary speech to his followers, repeating his false claims of a stolen election. Trump, who was impeached afterward by the Democratic-led House on a charge of inciting insurrection, continues to falsely claim that last year's presidential election was marred by widespread fraud. 
House Republicans last week ousted Representative Liz Cheney from their leadership for rejecting Trump's falsehoods.
Republicans also opposed the $1.9 billion bill that would help pay for costs related to the attack and improve security at the Capitol complex. Among their concerns were the price tag and a proposed new rapid-response force within the National Guard.
A seeming breakthrough came last week when legislation was announced giving Democrats and Republicans equal opportunity in choosing commission members and requiring that Democrats and Republicans on the panel approve witness subpoenas. Both were key demands being made by Republican leaders.

Some lawmakers revisited their memories of the attack during the debate over the commission.
""That day I crawled on my hands and knees in a gas mask"" to seek safety, said Democratic Representative Norma Torres, who added that Capitol Hill workers ""will carry the scars of that day for the rest of their lives.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer unveiled revised bipartisan legislation late Tuesday to approve $52 billion to significantly boost U.S. semiconductor chip production and research over five years.
The emergency funding proposal will be included in a more than 1,400-page revised bill the Senate is taking up this week, as first reported by Reuters on Friday, to spend $120 billion on basic U.S. and advanced technology research to better compete with China.
""American manufacturing has suffered rather dramatically from a chip shortage,"" Schumer said. ""We simply cannot rely on foreign processors for chips. This amendment will make sure that we don't have to.""
The proposal includes $49.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to fund the chip provisions that were included in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, but which require a separate process to garner funding.
President Joe Biden has also called for $50 billion to boost semiconductor production and research.
Supporters of funding note the U.S. had a 37% share of semiconductors and microelectronics production in 1990; today just 12% of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States.
""There is an urgent need for our economic and national security to provide funding to swiftly implement these critical programs. The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively investing over $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing so they can control this key technology,"" a bill summary released Tuesday said.
The measure would ""support the rapid implementation of the semiconductor provisions"" in the defense bill.
As reported by Reuters, the bill includes $39 billion in production and R&D incentives and $10.5 billion to implement programs including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Manufacturing Program and other R&D programs.
Last month, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) warned the chip shortage might slash its second-quarter production by half, costing it about $2.5 billion and about 1.1 million units of lost production in 2021, while General Motors (NYSE:GM) has extended production halts at several North American factories because of the shortage.
The bill also includes $1.5 billion in emergency funding to help boost Western-based alternatives to Chinese equipment providers Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), aiming to accelerate development of an open-architecture model (known as OpenRAN) backed by U.S. carriers. 

Another provision prohibits the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok from being downloaded to government devices ""to better safeguard the privacy and security of Americans.""
Schumer said the U.S. must address the rising threat from China on many fronts, notably the technology race. ""If we don’t step up in a big and bold way, we risk missing out on a generation of good-paying jobs, millions and millions of them,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered all public school districts in his state to lift mask-wearing requirements next month, contradicting the latest student-safety COVID-19 guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Abbott's executive order also bars other local government entities in the state from continuing to require face coverings beginning on Friday, echoing a similar move earlier this month by fellow Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Abbott said Texas was making strides against the COVID-19 pandemic through vaccinations, antibody therapeutics and voluntary health-safety practices, leaving government mask requirements no longer necessary.
""We can continue to mitigate COVID-19 while defending Texans' liberty to choose whether or not they mask up,"" he said in a statement announcing the executive order. 
Abbott and many other Republican politicians have cast mask mandates as an imposition on personal freedoms, though they grudgingly required face coverings at the height of the pandemic as hospitalizations and deaths surged out of control.
Texas lifted its state-imposed mask mandate 10 weeks ago when the crisis began to ebb. The state then sued officials in Austin, the Texas capital, for refusing to go along with the lifting of those restrictions.
Tuesday's order marked an escalation in Abbott's determination to force other local governments to align with his no-mask policy at the state level. 
It also puts Texas at odds with the latest CDC guidance recommending students in schools across the United States wear masks for the 2020-2021 academic year because not all will have been inoculated against the coronavirus when in-classroom instruction resumes.
The action in Texas comes as states across the country have moved to end or relax compulsory mask-wearing in most other public places, in accordance with CDC guidelines in recent weeks. Those recommendations reflect a steady decline in coronavirus infections, hospital admissions and mortality as the U.S. vaccination campaign gains momentum.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday his state will drop face mask requirements in most public spaces for vaccinated individuals, while fellow Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California said he would keep his mask order in place for another month.
But most governors who have discarded mask mandates at the state level have allowed local governments, school districts and businesses to exercise discretion in choosing when and how to ease their own requirements.
Texas, the second-most populous state in the nation, now becomes the most aggressive in steering away from masks altogether.
Beginning Friday, local governments or officials attempting to impose a mask mandate or other restriction in defiance of Abbott's latest executive order would be subject to fines of up to $1,000.
Public school districts have been given more time to comply, but after June 4, ""no student, teacher, parent or other staff member of visitor can be required to wear a mask while on campus,"" his announcement said.

Regardless of what government mandates are in place, a new Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters over the weekend shows more than half of Americans expressing a reluctance to quickly return to normal pre-pandemic behavior.
Of those surveyed, just 17% said they intended to swiftly get back to their previous routines. Another 28% said they already were doing so, a figure that included 42% of Republicans polled.

The move comes as congressional Democrats are seeking to advance President Joe Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan to build out clean energy and combat climate change. The plan has faced resistance from Republicans over the price tag, scope and funding.
Heinrich's non-binding Electrifying America's Future resolution includes calls for electrifying polluting sectors like construction and transportation, expanding interregional transmission capacity, boosting financing for electric technologies and modernizing building codes to encourage adoption of electric appliances.
""This must be informing our decisions about infrastructure,"" Heinrich said at a press conference to unveil the resolution.
Electrifying infrastructure would deploy existing, proven technologies and create millions of good-paying union jobs, he said.
Proponents of switching high-emitting industries to run on electricity want buildings, vehicles and machinery to be powered by an emissions-free grid rather than oil or natural gas. The fossil fuel industry says many emerging electric technologies are simply unaffordable.

The aim of policies focused on electrification, Heinrich said, is to make sure that appliances like heat pump water heaters, which run on electricity, are widely available to businesses and consumers.
""If you don't have the heat pump water heater on the back of the truck it's not going in the house,"" he said. ""We need to figure out all of these friction points and use the jobs and infrastructure package to solve these friction points.""

Touting his father's success in reducing crime in New York City before leaving office in 2001, the younger Giuliani said he would make New York state a better place, particularly for businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
""The man was able to accomplish what I hope to accomplish in New York state, which is turning around what many people think may be an ungovernable place,"" Giuliani said at a news conference in lower Manhattan, with New York Harbor as a backdrop.
""There is no more effective playbook than the Giuliani playbook,"" said Giuliani, 35, a graduate of Duke University who has never served in elected office.
Giuliani's candidacy may set up a contest between two prominent New York political families. The current governor, Andrew Cuomo, is the son of Mario Cuomo, who served three terms as the state's highest elective official. 
Andrew Cuomo has come under sharp political fire in recent months. He is facing investigations for his accounting of COVID-19 deaths in state nursing homes, as well as for allegations of sexual harassment by former staffers and others. 
Andrew Giuliani touted his close ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump, having worked in the White House's Office of Public Liaison at a time when his father was a personal attorney to the president.
He noted some businesses have left New York after finding better economic opportunities in Florida.
""We need somebody in New York who is going to get those unemployment numbers back down and not help the unemployment numbers in Florida,"" Giuliani said.
Asked how he would convince businesses to return to New York, he replied: ""Right now I'm not certain there is a very good answer to that. Businesses have been disincentivized."" 
But he added: ""I know that, with our policy agenda, within the first three to four years, New York will go from being the highest-taxed state, one of the least business-friendly states in the country, to one of the most business-friendly states in the country.""
Giuliani spoke glowingly about low unemployment during the Trump Administration. ""I think his policies were some of the best policies in the last 50 years in this country.""
Rudy Giuliani's business dealings with Ukrainian oligarchs while he was working as Trump's lawyer are the subject of a probe by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Federal agents searched his home and office in April, seizing phones and computers.

Giuliani defended his father on Tuesday, calling the investigation of his Ukraine dealings the result of a politicized U.S. Justice Department.
The elder Giuliani also faces a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit by a voting machine company over his false claims about the November 2020 presidential election being rigged.

Republicans accused the administration of handing Russian President Vladimir Putin a strategic advantage in Europe after Axios reported Washington will waive sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company overseeing construction of the pipeline. It also said sanctions would be waived on Matthias Warnig, a Putin ally and the company's CEO. 
The pipeline would bypass Ukraine, depriving it of lucrative transit fees and undermining its struggle against Russian aggression. 
The waivers will be in a report that the State Department will soon send to Congress, and will come despite sanctionable activity being committed by Nord Stream 2 AG and Warnig, said the Axios story, which Reuters was unable to verify. 
The administration will sanction some boats helping to build the project, it said. The pipeline would take double Moscow's ability to ship gas from the Russian Arctic to Germany under the Baltic Sea. 
""Two months ago, President Biden called Putin a 'killer,' but today he's planning to give Putin, his regime, and his cronies massive strategic leverage in Europe,"" Senator Ben Sasse said in a release. 
Representative Michael McCaul said any waivers would indicate the administration was never planning to stop the pipeline despite Secretary of State Antony Blinken telling Congress the administration opposes it. 
""If the Putin regime is allowed to finish this pipeline, it will be because the Biden Administration chose to let it happen,” McCaul said in a release. 
A State Department spokesperson said: ""The Biden Administration has been clear that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a Russian geopolitical project that threatens European energy security and that of Ukraine and eastern flank NATO Allies and partners.""

Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), the Russian state energy company financing the project, and its western partners are racing to complete the project, now about 95% complete. 
Blinken spoke with Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken ""underscored the U.S. commitment to work with allies and partners to counter Russian efforts to undermine our collective security, and in that vein, emphasized U.S. opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court has placed itself back on the frontlines of the U.S. culture wars by taking up major cases on abortion and guns, with rights cherished by millions of Americans - and potentially the future of the nation's top judicial body itself - on the line.
And to add to the drama, rulings in the two cases are expected to come next year in the run-up to mid-term elections in a politically polarized United States that will decide if President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats maintain control over both chambers of Congress.
The conservative-majority court on Monday agreed to hear Mississippi's bid to revive a Republican-backed state law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a case that could undercut the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide.
The justices on April 26 agreed to take up a challenge backed by the National Rifle Association to New York state's restrictions on people carrying concealed handguns in public, a case that could further damage firearms control efforts nationally.
The two cases will be argued and decided during the court's next term, which runs from October to June 2022. 
The term could be a blockbuster, with other possible cases challenging voting restrictions enacted by Republican-led states following former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election and affirmative action policies used by universities to increase admissions of Black and Hispanic students.
Wins for conservatives in the gun and abortion cases may actually help Democrats in the 2022 elections by angering and motivating liberal voters, according to some experts. 
""I think the most likely outcome is that the Supreme Court will make conservative decisions in these cases, favored by the political right, and that will create activism and enthusiasm on the left, which could affect turnout,"" said Emory University political science professor Tom Clark, a specialist in Supreme Court decision-making. 
A ruling overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade likely would be viewed as political by many Americans, helping Democratic candidates draw votes from political moderates and suburban women, Clark added. 
""Taking something away from people is more angering than giving them something they've been asking for,"" Clark said.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll of U.S. voters last year found that 76% of Democrats and 61% of independents, compared to 40% of Republicans, agreed that ""abortion should be legal in most cases.""
John Malcolm, a legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank, said rulings in the cases are bound to prod not just liberals but conservatives as well. 
""Pro-life conservatives - and there are a lot of them out there - are going to be galvanized to say, 'Hooray, Roe v. Wade is being chipped away at, and we need to elect pro-life legislators,"" Malcolm added.
PRESSURE ON BIDEN
The gun and abortion rulings could have consequences for the court itself. Biden on April 9 formed a bipartisan commission to make recommendations on potential changes to the court including expanding the number of justices beyond the current nine, a goal of some liberals eager to end its conservative majority, or ending lifetime appointments for justices. The commission is due to meet for the first time on Wednesday.
Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal group, said liberal activists are trying to intimidate the court by pushing for new seats to be added. 
""The court cares more about the Constitution than toeing the liberal line,"" Severino added. 
Liberal activists remain enraged that Trump was able to make three appointments to the high court, including filling one vacancy after Senate Republicans blocked consideration of a nominee put forward by Democratic former President Barack Obama in 2016. The court now has a 6-3 conservative majority.
The court's decisions to hear the abortion and gun cases - disputes that could yield far-reaching rulings - illustrate the waning clout of Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative known for an incremental approach to changing the law, according to Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro. When the court had a 5-4 conservative majority, Roberts was the man in the middle, often casting the decisive vote in close cases.
The September death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg enabled Trump to appoint conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, changing the court's dynamics.
""The most significant thing is that the chief can't stop his (conservative) colleagues, who are all further to the right than him, from making significant and explicit changes in the law,"" Shapiro said.

Brian Fallon, executive director of the liberal legal advocacy group Demand Justice, said taking up the abortion and gun cases shows the conservative justices are unconcerned about the political repercussions of their actions.
""The Republican-appointed justices appear to be moving even quicker than analysts predicted to make good on their super-majority status,"" Fallon said.

A little further down the museum's halls, President Barack Obama's statue still stands, smiling serenely, but that of Donald Trump has been dismantled and put into storage.
The Grevin Wax Museum, opened in 1882, has featured U.S. presidents since James Garfield, but when their term ends, their statue is taken down and the heads and bodies are kept in separate crates in the museum's cellars.
""We have kept Obama, as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize; the others are in storage,"" Grevin museum spokeswoman Veronique Berecz said.
The museum still has the heads of U.S. presidents including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush senior, Ronald Regan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, but those of most older presidents have been discarded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans are expected to unveil a new infrastructure proposal as early as Tuesday as optimism grows about a possible bipartisan deal that would cover a fraction of President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan.
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who is leading the Republican infrastructure drive, told reporters on Monday that she expected Republicans to unveil a new counter-proposal to Biden's sweeping plan sometime early this week. Her comments followed a day of discussions between Senate Republicans and White House staff, on the eve of a meeting with top administration officials slated for Tuesday afternoon.
Capito and other Republicans including Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker announced an initial $568 billion infrastructure plan, which Democrats criticized as inadequate. Capito and Wicker were among a group of Senate Republicans who met with Biden last Thursday. 
Asked whether Senate Republicans would unveil a new infrastructure proposal on Tuesday, Capito replied: ""We hope so. Well, it'll be early this week.""
She offered no details. But Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have signaled a willingness to consider a proposal closer to $600 billion, while a bipartisan group of senators has discussed a package of roughly $1 trillion. 
Capito, Wicker and fellow Senate Republicans John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, Mike Crapo and Pat Toomey were due to meet with senior administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, in the Capitol on Tuesday.
""I think all four of the committees involved are making a good-faith effort to try to get to a good offer. We all would like to see a big infrastructure package,"" Blunt told reporters on Monday. 
Biden's mammoth infrastructure proposal includes traditional projects to revitalize roads and bridges, but would also seek to address climate change and social issues such as elder care. The president said he would pay for the plan by raising taxes on U.S. corporations. 

Republican have rejected Biden's proposal as too broad and too expensive, and instead have sought to reach a bipartisan deal that focuses on roads, bridges, waterways and broadband access. 
Democrats have floated a two-track approach that would include a smaller bipartisan package, as well as more sweeping legislation that they could enact without Republican support through a process known as reconciliation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. senators, a Republican and a Democrat, asked Congress on Monday to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, as Republican-controlled state legislatures pass measures imposing new curbs on voting.
Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Lisa Murkowski noted in a letter that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices, was last reauthorized in 2006 with a bipartisan Senate vote of 98-0.
The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, saying that Section 4, the formula used to determine which states and localities were subject to additional federal scrutiny, was outdated.
""Protecting Americans' access to democracy has not been a partisan issue for the past 56 years, and we must not allow it to become one now,"" Manchin and Murkowski wrote.
Democrats, who hold narrow majorities in both houses of Congress, have passed a sweeping electoral reform bill in the House of Representatives. Manchin rejected that bill as too broad, although even with his support, the measure would likely fall short of the 60 votes it would need to pass the 100-seat Senate.
Murkowski said she had not received much reaction from other Republicans about the statement. 
Republican Senator Roy Blunt, who is retiring at the end of his term in 2022, told reporters he thought some Republicans could support voting-rights legislation, although it would be important to look at the formula determining how jurisdictions qualified for additional scrutiny. He said he would be willing to participate in those talks.
Four Republican-led states, including Georgia and Florida, passed measures this year https://cn.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-voting-factbox/factbox-republicans-erect-voting-barriers-across-u-s-battleground-states-idUSKBN2CT2JO that voting rights activists say disproportionately burden or discourage voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled. Similar measures are pending in several other states.
The lawmakers driving those measures often cite as a justification former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread voter fraud.
That claim was widely rejected by numerous courts, state election officials and officials in Trump's own administration. 
Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization that fights voter suppression, said of the Manchin-Murkowski letter: ""Generally speaking, this is a positive step."" 

Democrats later this year are expected to reintroduce the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which reinstates Section 4 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and updates the formula for which jurisdictions are covered.
""Getting agreement, getting more Republican support and getting something by the court that would pass muster, I think those are all very high hurdles,"" said John Fortier, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden reported a drop in income as they filed their tax returns for 2020 on Monday, marking a return to the normal practice of releasing such information by modern U.S. presidents. 
The Bidens reported income of $607,336 in 2020, down from $985,223 in 2019 due to the lack of book sales and paid speeches during the election campaign, according to their tax returns released by the White House. 
During the 2020 presidential race, Biden's campaign said he and his wife made $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018.
The Bidens paid $157,414 in federal income tax and their 2020 effective federal income tax rate is 25.9%. The most recent IRS data indicates that the average federal income tax rate is just over 14%.
The Bidens also reported holding cash and investments between $1.2 million and $2.88 million in a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics.
Former President Donald Trump, who had long sought to keep his personal financial records secret, repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, claiming multiple times that he was not able to as he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, even as the agency claimed he was free to do so. 
The New York Times reported in 2020 that Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 - and none in 10 of the previous 15 years - following years of reporting steep losses from business enterprises.
The release of Biden's tax returns also comes at a time when he has pushed for raising the taxes on the wealthy to fund his infrastructure plan. Biden has proposed an increase in capital gains tax to 39.6% from 20% for those making more than $1 million a year.
""With this release, the President has shared a total of 23 years of tax returns with the American public,"" the White House said.

The White House also released 2020 tax returns for Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. They reported a combined income of $1,695,225, most of which came from Emhoff's work at a law firm. They paid $621,893 in federal income tax at a rate of 36.7%.
Harris and Emhoff's earnings were also substantially lower from 2019, when they had $3,018,127 in income and paid $1,185,628 in taxes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration approved the potential sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel, and congressional sources said on Monday that U.S. lawmakers were not expected to object to the deal despite violence between Israel and Palestinian militants.
Three congressional aides said Congress was officially notified of the intended commercial sale on May 5, as part of the regular review process before major foreign weapons sales agreements can go ahead. 
The sale was first reported by the Washington Post.
Congress was informed of the planned sale in April, as part of the normal informal review process before of the formal notification on May 5. Under U.S. law, the formal notification opens up a 15-day window for Congress to object to the sale, which is not expected despite the ongoing violence.
The sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, was considered routine at the time, before the start last week of the fiercest hostilities in the region in years.
There were no objections at the time by the Democratic and Republican leaders of the congressional foreign affairs committees that review such sales, aides said.
Asked for comment, a State Department spokesperson noted that the department is restricted under federal law and regulations from publicly commenting on or confirming details of licensing activity related to direct commercial sales like the JDAMs agreement.
""We remain deeply concerned about the current violence and are working towards achieving a sustainable calm,"" the spokesperson said.

Strong support for Israel is a core value for both Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. Congress, despite calls from a few of the most progressive Democrats to take a tougher stance against the government of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu.
U.S. law allows Congress to object to weapons sales, but it is unlikely to do so in this case. Because Israel is among a handful of countries whose military deals are approved under an expedited process, the typical window for objecting will close before lawmakers can pass a resolution of disapproval, even if they were inclined to.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - A former Florida official central to the federal probe on whether U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz trafficked a minor for sex pleaded guilty on Monday and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, which may spell trouble for the Republican congressman.
Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Florida's Seminole County, pleaded guilty to six charges, including sex-trafficking of a minor, at a court hearing in federal court in Orlando, Florida.
Appearing in court wearing a blue prison jumpsuit with the words ""Orange County Corrections,"" Greenberg was shackled and returned to jail following the hearing.
Greenberg's lawyer, Fritz Scheller, suggested after a court hearing last month that his client would implicate Gaetz, telling reporters: ""I am sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today.”
Scheller was more measured on Monday when asked if Gaetz should be worried about Greenberg cooperating with investigators.
""Last time we talked I had a certain agenda, which I accomplished,"" Scheller said. ""This time I will leave that up to Matt Gaetz's attorneys to answer.""
Scheller added that his client would ""honor"" his plea agreement, which promised full cooperation with investigators. 
Scheller said a sentencing hearing probably will be set for sometime this summer and said of Greenberg: ""He's feeling a sense of remorse"" over his actions.
In a document filed in court on Friday, Greenberg admitted to introducing the minor he trafficked to other adult men who engaged in sex acts with the minor in Greenberg's presence, court papers showed. The papers did not identify the other adult men.
The plea deal marked a turning point in the sprawling federal investigation that has roiled Florida politics and ensnared Gaetz, 39, one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress.
Investigators want to determine whether Gaetz had sex with the same 17-year-old Greenberg was accused of trafficking, according to news reports and a law enforcement source who spoke with Reuters.
Gaetz has not been charged with any crimes and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
At a gathering of Republican Party activists last weekend in Ohio, Gaetz addressed the crowd and, according to an NBC News report, said, ""I'm being falsely accused of exchanging money for naughty favors."" 
Gaetz, according to NBC, then criticized Congress for reinstituting the use of special-interest spending known as earmarks, saying it is ""a process that legalizes the corrupt act of exchanging money for favors... and everybody knows that's a corruption."" 
When news of Greenberg's impending guilty plea broke on Thursday, Gaetz spokesman Harlan Hill questioned Greenberg's credibility.

""The first indictment of Joel Greenberg alleges that he falsely accused another man of sex with a minor for his own gain. That man was apparently innocent. So is congressman Gaetz,"" said Hill.
Greenberg also pleaded guilty to having letters sent to a school where a political rival worked that falsely accused the man of sexual misconduct with a student, according to federal prosecutors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Rudy Giuliani attacked federal prosecutors for their recent raids of his home and office, as they probe the former New York City mayor's business dealings in Ukraine at a time he was serving as then-U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer.
In a letter made public on Monday, Giuliani's lawyers objected to the ""sweeping nature"" of the April 28 searches and the legitimacy of a November 2019 search of his iCloud account, and want to see prosecutors' basis for obtaining warrants underlying those searches.
They also said prosecutors claimed to secretly obtain the iCloud warrant on concern Giuliani might destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses, an accusation that ""strains credulity"" and was ""extremely damaging"" to Giuliani's reputation.
Prosecutors ""simply chose to treat a distinguished lawyer as if he was the head of a drug cartel or a terrorist, in order to create maximum prejudicial coverage of both Giuliani, and his most well-known client–-the former President of the United States,"" the lawyers said.
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Giuliani asked U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan to let him review materials underlying the warrants, and block prosecutors from reviewing his seized phones and computers.
He wants the judge to rule before considering prosecutors' request to appoint a ""special master"" to review those devices.
Such a review would weed out potentially privileged materials related to Giuliani's clients including Trump, a fellow Republican.
The raids marked an aggressive new phase of a probe being conducted by the same U.S. Attorney's office that Giuliani led in the 1980s, where he took on defendants like Mafia leaders and junk bond executive Michael Milken.
Giuliani has not been charged, and said after the raids that his conduct had been ""absolutely legal and ethical.""
Robert Costello, one of Giuliani's lawyers, has said he was ""stunned"" to first learn about the iCloud warrant on the day after Giuliani's home and office were searched.
""All of his communications with the President of the United States Donald Trump were in there,"" Costello said in a recent interview. ""Every communication, text message, email message.""
'DO-OVER'
In Monday's filing, Giuliani's lawyers also accused the Manhattan prosecutors of taking advantage of Democrat Joe Biden becoming president to go after their client.
They said the prosecutors had twice been denied permission by their Department of Justice superiors under Trump to seek the April warrants, and waited for Biden to install his own appointees before attempting a successful ""do-over.""
In a separate letter, a lawyer for Giuliani associate Victoria Toensing asked the government to return materials seized from her so she can review them for privilege issues.
Toensing and her husband Joseph diGenova, who are both lawyers, have represented Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch who has been indicted in the United States on bribery and racketeering charges. He has fought extradition from Vienna.
Giuliani began representing Trump in April 2018 in connection with then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
He also sought prior to the 2020 U.S. election to dig up concerning Ukraine and Biden, and after Trump lost to Biden promoted baseless claims of election fraud.  
Investigators want to review communications involving former Ukrainian officials and two Florida businessmen who helped Giuliani seek details about Biden.
They also are searching for communications concerning Marie Yovanovitch, who the Trump administration ousted as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in 2019.

Investigators are looking for evidence that Giuliani acted as an unregistered foreign agent, violating lobbying laws.  
Giuliani served eight years as New York City's mayor, and Time magazine named him its 2001 ""Person of the Year"" for helping the city recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

612,"<span>May 17, 2021 12:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senator Marco Rubio has proposed an amendment to a broad package of legislation to counter China that aims to shield research and development boosted by a massive infusion of cash from threats of espionage or theft.
The change being sought by the Florida Republican to a package of bills based on a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young offers a preview of the sort of skirmishing that is likely to erupt as Schumer pushes for floor passage of the legislation by the end of the month.
Rubio’s amendment would expand oversight of research funds to include the U.S. intelligence community, requiring the Director of National Intelligence and other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation to certify that anyone receiving money authorized by the legislation is not susceptible to foreign threats. It also would prohibit people who have received financial or other support from the Chinese government from receiving funds authorized by the legislation, among other provisions.
Rubio wants to add his proposals to the Endless Frontier Act, the legislation from Schumer and Young that is forming the backbone of a broader package that will receive floor consideration this week. An initial procedural vote is scheduled Monday afternoon.
The main part of the bill would authorize more than $100 billion over five years to boost research and development of innovative technology and manufacturing at colleges, universities and other institutions and create a new entity within the National Science Foundation to focus on technology.
It’s also expected to include a $50 billion emergency appropriation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as funding for a communications security initiative designed to counter China’s dominance of 5G networks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The package is being pushed toward passage on an aggressive timetable by Schumer. The fervor among Democrats and Republicans to counter about China’s challenge to U.S. economic primacy has made the legislation, known as the Endless Frontiers Act, one of the few bills to draw broad support at time when partisan divisions are running deep. Its fate also may serve as an indicator for other proposals, such as infrastructure, that have nominal bipartisan support.
“Federal underinvestment in sciences has seen our country slip, exposing critical weak spots in our economy,” Schumer said last week, setting up the first vote on the legislation. “If we don’t fix them, we will no longer be the number one economic leader in the world.”
Related to that goal is a separate proposal expected to be included that would provide $50 billion for a program aimed at increasing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. that was passed as part of the 2021 defense bill but never funded. The proposal has gained urgency as a global shortage of semiconductors causes economic pain in the U.S., shutting down auto plants because of a lack of chips for cars and trucks.
Semiconductor Supplies
Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas has been working on the proposal with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona along with others and said he expects it will supported by the White House as well as Senate Republicans. President Joe Biden in his broader infrastructure proposal has called for as much as $50 billion to expand U.S. chipmaking.
“If China decided to cut off our supply of semiconductors it would be like the Strait of Hormuz is to oil,” Cornyn said. “It would be a disaster economically.”
Despite generally broad support, the Endless Frontier Act was the subject of a sometimes contentious markup session in the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday.
Scores of amendments were proposed and some were adopted, sometimes over the protest of co-sponsor Young. In particular, he called an amendment proposed by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, a “poison pill” because it would divert some of the funding to the Department of Energy for its network of national laboratories. Among those is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in New Mexico.
Funding Shift
“I am disappointed that an amendment was adopted to divert significant funding away from the NSF Tech Directorate in favor of a program outside of the Committee’s jurisdiction,” Young said in a statement after the bill was approved by the committee.
The legislation has been carved up into separate tranches, with about half of the money going to the core functions of the National Science Foundation and another almost $30 billion going to help stand up a new tech directorate within the agency.
Lujan’s amendment sends about $17 billion to the national labs. His co-sponsors included GOP Senators Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, all of whom represent states where the national labs have a presence. Lujan’s amendment passed 23 to 5 and the overall bill passed the Commerce Committee by 24-4.
Rubio had also called on the Senate floor for the legislation to be directed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- or DARPA -- instead of the National Science Foundation, calling the NSF “the same agency that time and again has had the research we fund stolen by professors and graduate students who are on the payroll for China.”
Other Republicans, including those on the House Republican Study Committee, Congress’ largest ideological caucus, said the legislation did not have sufficient protections built into it and called for boosting defense spending rather than spend money on research and development.
Such political horse-trading -- along with a bipartisan desire to confront China -- may be key to passage in the Senate.
The Endless Frontier Act, which is supported by numerous industry and trade groups, will be combined with a bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year and with proposals from other Senate committees, including Banking and Health Education and Labor. Senators will also be able to offer amendments on the floor. The process for passing the overall package is estimated to take two weeks.

(Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American to hold the No. 2 position in the White House, will headline a virtual summit hosted this week by the leading Asian American Democratic political action committee, organizers told Reuters.
Harris' attendance at the AAPI Victory Fund's first-ever ""Unity Summit,"" which will be announced on Monday, bolsters the group's effort to harness an unprecedented surge of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in the 2020 presidential election.
In addition to the vice president, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will speak at Wednesday's event, which is co-hosted by the AAPI Victory Alliance, a nonprofit arm of the fund. Several Democratic U.S. senators of color, including Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, are also expected to appear.
The event is part of a broader effort to ensure that AAPI voters, long overlooked, are recognized as an increasingly crucial political force. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States and served as a key piece of President Joe Biden's winning coalition in November's election.
""The AAPI community does now have the loudest voice we've ever had,"" said Varun Nikore, the executive director of the AAPI Victory Fund. ""One of the reasons the voice is so loud is because we're asking – and in certain cases demanding – much more from our government.""
Amid a wave of anti-Asian hate crimes, AAPI voter turnout surged more than 45% from 2016's presidential election to 2020, according to the voting analytics firm TargetSmart – nearly four times the increase among all other voters. Almost two-thirds of the voters supported Democrat Joe Biden, according to the Reuters/Ipsos election day poll.

The group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian incidents, released a national report last week that found 6,603 instances between March 2020 and March 2021.
Two other ethnic political groups – Collective PAC, which supports Black candidates, and the Latino Victory Fund – will also participate in the summit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former Florida official central to the federal investigation into whether U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz committed sex trafficking of a minor will cooperate with investigators as part of a plea agreement, a court document submitted by prosecutors showed.
The former official, Joel Greenberg https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/friend-us-congressman-gaetz-expected-plead-guilty-sex-trafficking-case-court-2021-05-13, is set to plead guilty to crimes including sex-trafficking a minor - a relationship he described online as being a ""sugar daddy"" - and to introducing the minor to other adult men who engaged in sex acts with the minor in Greenberg's presence, court papers show. The papers do not identify the other adult men.
According to the plea agreement, Greenberg will admit to spending more than $70,000 in 150 transactions to pay for sex with the minor and others, who were 18 or older, as well as to giving the minor and others the illegal drug Ecstasy.
A plea hearing for Greenberg, a former tax collector in Florida's Seminole County, is scheduled for Monday in federal court in Orlando, Florida.
The plea deal marks a turning point in the sprawling federal investigation, which has roiled Florida politics and ensnared Gaetz, 39, one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress.
Investigators are seeking to determine whether Gaetz had sex with the same 17-year-old Greenberg was accused of trafficking, according to news reports and a law enforcement source who spoke with Reuters.
Gaetz has not been charged with any crimes and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
""Congressman Gaetz doesn’t seem to be named nor referenced in Mr. Greenberg's plea,"" said Harlan Hill, a Gaetz spokesman. ""Congressman Gaetz has never had sex with a minor and has never paid for sex.""
Greenberg's lawyer, Fritz Scheller, suggested to reporters last month that Greenberg cooperating with federal investigators could have implications for Gaetz.
""I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today,"" Scheller said in April, after a court hearing where prosecutors signaled a plea deal was imminent.
In a column published last month on the Washington Examiner website, Gaetz declared he had no plans to resign from Congress.

""There are exactly zero credible (or even non-credible) accusers willing to come forward by name and state on the public record that I behaved improperly toward them,"" Gaetz wrote.
Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, said last month that the party would take action against Gaetz if the Justice Department formally charges him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday revoked a 2019 proclamation by former President Donald Trump that sought to bar the entry of immigrants who could not prove they had health insurance or could cover healthcare costs.
In an announcement by the White House, the Democratic president said the suspension imposed by his Republican predecessor ""does not advance the interests of the United States.""
Trump issued a proclamation in October 2019 requiring all prospective immigrants to show proof of U.S. health insurance within 30 days of their arrival in the United States or enough money to pay for ""reasonably foreseeable medical costs.""
A federal judge blocked the healthcare requirement before its effective date a month later. But in a December 2020 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Trump proclamation, saying it fell within the president’s executive power.
Biden took office weeks later, and advocates said the measure never went into effect. The White House and other U.S. agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Biden has vowed to reverse many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies, rolling back a travel ban on 13 mostly Muslim-majority and African countries and halting construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.
Trump’s initial announcement of the health insurance requirement sent prospective immigrants scrambling https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-insurance/trump-rule-on-health-insurance-leaves-immigrants-companies-scrambling-for-answers-idUSKBN1XA1G6 to figure out how to get the necessary coverage and navigate U.S. bureaucracy.
Immigrant advocates said the proclamation would have barred entry to as many as two-thirds of legal immigrants had it been allowed to take effect.

Biden's proclamation came as part of a package of actions late on Friday reversing some largely symbolic policy statements by Trump. Those included the former president's executive orders deriding online censorship, street protests attacking monuments and excessive government regulation.
Another order reversed by Biden proposed building a sculpture garden of American ""heroes.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A key Democrat and Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives reached a deal to form a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters, the lawmakers said on Friday.
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and Republican ranking member John Katko said they would introduce legislation as soon as next week to set up the investigative panel modeled after the one used to probe the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
""There has been a growing consensus that the January 6th attack is of a complexity and national significance that ... we need an independent commission to investigate,"" Thompson said in a statement. ""Inaction – or just moving on – is simply not an option.""
Katko said the Capitol remained a target for extremists. ""This is about facts, not partisan politics,"" he said.
Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, said he had not signed off on the lawmakers' deal and said the commission should look at events that came before and after Jan. 6, including an unrelated incident in April when a motorist rammed a car into a pair of Capitol Police officers, killing one.
For months, negotiations over the size and scope of the commission stalled amid disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over the number of commissioners each party would name and whether minority Republicans would have subpoena power. 
Republicans also had been arguing for the commission to investigate last summer's protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis.
The Jan. 6 riot followed a fiery speech in which then-President Trump falsely alleged that his election defeat was the result of widespread voter fraud, a claim that has been dismissed by multiple courts, state election officials and his own administration's review.
Following the riot, multiple Republicans condemned Trump's words. But out of office, he has doubled down on his false claims of fraud, which multiple Republican-controlled state legislatures have cited as a justification for passing new voting restrictions.
The House Republican caucus this week stripped Representative Liz Cheney of her party leadership role because she loudly rejected Trump's ""big lie."" 
Some congressional Republicans have downplayed the violence that led to Trump's second impeachment trial on a charge of inciting insurrection. 
Andrew Clyde, a lawmaker from Georgia, said on Wednesday that calling the incident an insurrection was a ""bold-faced lie."" 
More than 400 people have been arrested for taking part in the riot.
Like the Sept. 11 panel, the proposed 10-member panel would have five commissioners appointed by each party as well as subpoena authority. Its report and recommendations to prevent future attacks would be due by Dec. 31.
Both the House and the Senate would have to approve the bill that sets up the commission, which would then go to Biden to sign into law.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Patrick Leahy said he was committed to moving a bill that addressed Capitol security vulnerabilities and other needs.

Separately, House Democrats introduced a bill that would allocate $1.9 billion to respond to the insurrection. 
The funding would reimburse law enforcement agencies for their response and presence at the U.S. Capitol, provide support for Capitol Police and improve security there, among other measures, according to a statement by Democrats Rosa DeLauro and Tim Ryan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives elected Donald Trump's candidate Elise Stefanik to their leadership, succeeding Liz Cheney, who they ousted earlier this week for criticizing the former president's continued false claims of election fraud.
Stefanik, a 36-year-old congresswoman from New York state, rose to prominence https://www.reuters.com/world/us/loyalty-trump-catapults-elise-stefanik-into-republican-stardom-2021-05-11 with her fierce defense of Trump during his first impeachment trial, while Cheney https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liz-cheney-vote-us-house-republicans-reach-watershed-over-trump-2021-05-12 angered her Republican colleagues by rejecting what she called Trump's ""big lie"" about his November loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
The secret-ballot vote boosted Trump's dominance over the party even after it lost its majorities in the House and Senate, as well as the White House, during his single term in office. Trump is positioning himself to play a major role in next year's congressional elections and is also flirting with a 2024 White House run.
""He is a critical part of our Republican team,"" Stefanik said. ""I believe that voters choose the leader of the Republican Party and President Trump is the leader that they look to.""
Stefanik defeated Representative Chip Roy, who entered the race to serve as chair of the House Republican Conference on Thursday night.
House conservatives including Roy had complained that Stefanik's voting record was not conservative enough, including a vote against Trump's 2017 tax cuts, his main legislative accomplishment. But the party in the end lined up behind Trump, who blasted Roy's entry into the contest in a statement, hinting at backing a primary challenger to him next year.
A woman has held the No. 3 House Republican leadership job since 2013, as the party has tried to broaden its appeal to independent voters, including suburban women. 
The secret ballot tally, according to a source in the room, was 134-46, with nine voting ""present"" and three votes cast for other candidates.
Conceding defeat, Roy, a Texas congressman, said he succeeded in delivering a message to leadership that it should have created a more open process for electing Cheney's replacement.
""Elise is our chair,"" Roy said after the vote. ""Now we're going to get busy, pointing out how the Democratic Party is destroying America.""
CHENEY TO FIGHT ON
Cheney has vowed to continue to fight to prevent Trump from winning the White House again in 2024.
Stefanik was a fierce defender of Trump during his two House impeachment trials. Despite her somewhat moderate voting record, she defeated the rock-solid conservative Roy.
Following the closed-door vote, Trump issued a statement saying, ""Congratulations to Elise Stefanik for her Big and Overwhelming victory!""
In celebrating Stefanik's victory, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to put the bruising leadership battle behind Republicans.
During remarks to reporters with Stefanik at his side, McCarthy instead launched an attack on Biden, blaming him for an immigration ""crisis"" at the southern border, gasoline shortages on the East Coast due a cyber-attack on a major pipeline, and unrest in Israel.
Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the House and a 50-50 split with Republicans in the Senate. Given those numbers, and a history of political parties doing well in mid-term congressional elections when the opposition holds the White House, Republicans are optimistic of taking over the House in the November 2022 elections.
Now free of her job as head of the Republican conference, Cheney, a lawmaker with impeccable conservative credentials and the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, vows to steer the party away from a man she says is ""pushing the lie"" that his defeat in the 2020 election was the result of massive voter fraud.
Trump's claim was rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and his own administration. Cheney calls him ""an ongoing threat"" to U.S. democracy.
House Republican leaders, along with many in their rank and file, pushed Cheney out on Wednesday because they had concluded her battle with Trump was distracting from attacks on Democratic President Joe Biden and threatening their prospects in the 2022 congressional elections.
By dumping Cheney and electing Stefanik, Republicans demonstrated that adherence to strict conservative ideology is no longer of prime importance in the Trump-era.
The conservative Club for Growth, which rates members of Congress, gives Stefanik a lifetime score of just 35% for voting in line with its priorities, one of the worst among House Republicans, and well below Cheney's 65%.
Even more striking, Roy enjoys a 100% lifetime rating.
While House Republicans, cheered on by Trump and McCarthy, were eager to shun Cheney this week, they have not acted against Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene or Matt Gaetz.

The House's Democratic leadership stripped Greene of her committee assignments for past incendiary remarks that included support for violence against Democrats, while Gaetz is the subject of a federal child sex-trafficking probe.
Both are close allies of Trump.

(Reuters) -After years of delays during the Trump administration, the EPA released its new climate indicators, which show Americans are already feeling effects on their health and safety. 
Heat waves across the country are more frequent, more intense, and last longer. Wildfires are burning more land. The East and Gulf Coasts are flooding more often, while ice sheets are disappearing and sea levels are rising. 
The figures are collected on the Environmental Protection Agency's climate indicators website https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires, which pulls data from more than 50 different organizations but had gone stale after Trump officials stopped updating it. In addition to releasing fresh numbers on Wednesday, the organization added new measurements including heat wave data, permafrost temperatures and residential energy use. 
EPA Administrator Michael Regan called the relaunch ""long overdue,"" and said in a statement, ""We now have additional data and a new set of indicators that show climate change has become even more evident, stronger, and extreme – as has the imperative that we take meaningful action.""
The message from the EPA is in stark contrast to its actions during the previous administration, when President Donald Trump downplayed the effects of climate change, muzzled and sidelined scientists, and scrapped initiatives to curb emissions. 
Since taking office, President Joe Biden has pushed climate action toward the top of his agenda and worked to reverse many of his predecessor's actions.
""I am really excited for the return of this information and the improvement of it,"" said Gretchen Gehrke, a co-founder of the nonprofit Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. ""People really lost out on being able to learn from the last four years. Not only the extreme events, but also the more subtle things.""
The most recent decade was the warmest on record since observations began in 1880, with last year the second warmest year. Alaska, the North, and the West showed the biggest changes in the United States. 
Marine animals, too, are feeling the heat. The data show a steady climb in ocean temperatures, with some calculations putting 2020 at the top the charts. As oceans warm, fish and other underwater life off the U.S. coasts are shifting their range north and diving deeper to find cooler waters. 

In response to the EPA's release, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, called for stronger climate action in the infrastructure bill currently being negotiated. 
""The data doesn't lie: the EPA's new report shows society pushing nature to its limit. Either we act now, or we risk failing the critical test of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming and lock in ever-worsening threats,"" Whitehouse said in a statement, referring to the temperature threshold where scientists predict catastrophic damage. ""Nature's not waiting, why are we?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden expressed optimism on Thursday that a deal could be reached on infrastructure spending after he held a meeting with a handful of Republican senators in a quest for a bipartisan compromise on his more than $2 trillion plan. 
Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who led a group that floated a smaller $568 billion infrastructure bill, as well as Senators John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, Mike Crapo, Pat Toomey and Roger Wicker met with the Democratic president in the Oval Office.
""We had a very, very good meeting,"" Biden told reporters at the White House after the talks concluded. 
""I am very optimistic that we can reach a ... reasonable agreement. But even if we don't,"" he said, a ""good-faith"" effort had been started. 
Capito told reporters after the meeting that the group discussed specifics ""and the president has asked us to come back and rework our offer so that he can then react to that and then re-offer to us. So we're very encouraged.""
Biden said the group would meet again next week.
The president has said he wants to work in a bipartisan way. He sat down with Republicans when crafting his $1.9 trillion pandemic spending bill earlier this year but did not reach a deal with them. The legislation passed using the Democrats' slim majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
Democrats may be the only ones to get behind Biden's broad infrastructure bill as well, but the White House is giving time for negotiations to play out.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters the Memorial Day holiday at the end of May would be ""a moment to assess"" whether progress is being made.

Divisions are centered on the size of any bill, whether to count things like childcare as infrastructure, and how to pay for the legislation.
Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday that Biden's idea to pay for any bill by raising taxes on companies and the wealthy was a non-starter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top U.S. homeland security official said on Thursday the Biden administration still faced challenges on the U.S.-Mexico border but that it had made extraordinary efforts to move unaccompanied migrant children out of crowded border stations. 
Federal authorities have reduced the number of unaccompanied children in border stations from a peak of 5,700 in late March to under 500 this week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in opening remarks at a congressional hearing.
""The challenge is not behind us, but the results are dramatic,"" Mayorkas said.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, moved to swiftly reverse some of the restrictive immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. 
But Biden's administration has struggled with a sharp rise in migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, a situation Republicans blamed on his more liberal policies and which he blames on Trump dismantling vital infrastructure to process border crossers.
About 173,000 migrants were apprehended at the southwestern border in April, the highest monthly level in 20 years.
The increased arrivals overwhelmed border stations and processing centers in March and April, with hundreds of children kept at times beyond the legal limit of 72 hours. 
Mayorkas faced pointed criticism at the hearing on Thursday from Republicans, who have sought to make border security a central political issue as they aim to take control of Congress in the 2022 elections.
Republicans repeatedly blamed Biden's more liberal border policies for encouraging illegal immigration. 
Mayorkas, for his part, said the Trump administration had dismantled systems to deal with incoming migrants at the border, an argument Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, said was ""galling.""

Mayorkas later called out the Trump administration for separating migrant families under a much-criticized 2018 border strategy.
""They ripped sons and daughters out of the hands of fathers and mothers,"" Mayorkas said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene committed ""verbal assault and abuse"" against a Democratic lawmaker that may have violated ethics rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.
The Washington Post reported that two of its reporters witnessed Greene https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-georgia-insight/pilloried-in-washington-marjorie-taylor-greene-is-loved-back-home-idUSKBN2AC28W confronting Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez following a House vote on Wednesday.
Greene already has been sanctioned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-republicans/u-s-house-punishes-republican-congresswoman-over-incendiary-remarks-idUSKBN2A42IF by the House for making incendiary remarks including violence against Democrats.
The newspaper reported that Greene followed Ocasio-Cortez, shouting at her and falsely accusing her of supporting ""terrorists.""
""I think what was reported to our office about what happened as members were leaving the floor yesterday, the verbal assault and abuse of our colleague, Congresswoman AOC,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press conference.
With tensions already high in the U.S. Capitol following the deadly Jan. 6 attack by supporters of former President Donald Trump, Pelosi said Greene's behavior was ""beneath the dignity of a person serving in the Congress of the United States and is a cause for trauma and fear among members.""
Asked to comment on the incident, a Greene spokesman referred Reuters to a Greene tweet in which she wrote that the House Ethics Committee should investigate Ocasio-Cortez for placing Trump administration officials ""on lists to destroy their lives and prevent future employment.""
In early February, the House voted to remove Greene from two high-profile committees because of remarks she had made that included support for violence against Democrats.
During her 2020 run for Congress, Greene's campaign issued a photo showing her with an assault rifle next to three liberal Democratic congresswomen - Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.
Greene has voiced support for unfounded conspiracy theories including the ""QAnon"" one that holds that elite Democrats are part of a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles and cannibals.

She has since distanced herself from some of her remarks.
Wednesday's incident came on the same day that House Republicans booted Representative Liz Cheney from her leadership position for criticizing Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A private gathering at a hotel in Austin, Texas, last week was billed as a thank you for Republican donors for a state registration drive, but it gave a clutch of 2024 presidential candidates a chance to test drive their pitch - if former President Donald Trump does not run. 
Trump was not invited, nor was he the central focus of the event. Speakers did not dwell on his false claims that the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him, attendees and people briefed on the event told Reuters.
Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a sometimes Trump ally who is exploring a 2024 run, helped set the tone by telling the crowd of about 200 that ""The election is over, Biden won. We just need to beat him in 2024,"" the sources said.
Christie and other 2024 hopefuls were interviewed on stage by members of the Texas congressional delegation.
The list included Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Vice President Mike Pence, and U.S. senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.
Pence received a standing ovation when he took the stage and talked about the Trump-Pence administration's accomplishments, offering what one attendee called ""a lot of platitudes."" 
DeSantis, described by another attendee approvingly as ""Trump without the sharp edges,"" talked about his military background and his response to the coronavirus pandemic in Florida. About 36,000 people in the state died of the disease; nearly 45% are vaccinated https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/index.html. 
Pompeo gave an extended review of global affairs, with a focus on China and Iran; Cotton spoke about foreign policy as well. Rubio said the party needed to update its agenda; and Tim Scott, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, was described as a crowd favorite.
Many in the group are already traveling the country individually and speaking to Republican groups to suss out support for their race. This was the first gathering of several at the same event.
""People wanted to see what the future looks like,"" said an attendee. 
Whether the Republican Party's national future includes one of these candidates remains to be seen. Trump, 74, remains incredibly popular among Republican voters right now, beating out Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in a recent poll asking who should be the role model for the next generation of party leaders. 
About 60% of Republicans believe his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. 

Trump won a straw poll at the CPAC conservatives' convention earlier this year in which 55% of attendees said they would vote for him in the 2024 nominating race. DeSantis was second at 21%. 
Trump's advisers say he is aware that a variety of Republicans are considering 2024 runs, but believes he would easily win nomination. They are divided as to whether he really will run, as are a host of influential Republicans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday moved to scrap a Trump-era rule that it said jeopardized public health and hindered clean air rules.
The Trump administration's ""Benefit-Cost Rule"", finalized in December 2020 during the last month of Donald Trump's presidency, had instructed the EPA to disregard ""co-benefits"" of any proposed regulation. A co-benefit from a proposed rule limiting emissions of one toxic substance, for example, could include cuts in other pollutants not directly targeted by the proposal.
“Revoking this unnecessary and misguided rule is proof positive of this administration's commitment to science,” said EPA Administrator Michael Regan.
He said the Trump rule had hamstrung the agency's ability to use the best available science to develop Clean Air Act regulations and was ""inconsistent with economic best practices.""
Trump had imposed the Benefit-Cost rule mainly in reaction to the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule that had been adopted by his predecessor President Barack Obama's administration. In its justification for MATS, the Obama administration accounted for indirect benefits of installing mercury pollution-control equipment at coal plants that included things like reduction of deadly emissions of particulate matter.
Trump's EPA said the costs of compliance with that rule far outweighed the direct public health benefits of slashing mercury emissions alone.
The American Lung Association on Thursday welcomed the change by the EPA and said the previous rule overlooked the health problems caused by air pollution.
""The steps the nation takes to clean up toxic air pollutants, including mercury and acid gases, have saved thousands of lives thanks to reductions of particle pollution in our air at the same time,"" said ALA President Harold Wimmer.

Industry groups ranging from the American Chemistry Council to the National Mining Association had praised the Trump-era rule saying previous benefit-cost analyses resulted in tougher restrictions on their industries.
The new rule will take effect in 30 days.

""We don't want people to think there's money in it to threaten the security of a critical infrastructure in our country,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press conference.
Bloomberg News reported that Colonial Pipeline paid nearly $5 million to Eastern European hackers following the cyberattack that shut operations of the largest fuel pipeline network in the United States.

Pelosi noted a ""governance issue"" in hardening U.S. facilities against attacks. ""This cannot be open-season for hackers who can make money off of a threat even if they don't go as far as crippling the entity as with Colonial,"" she said.

The deal follows a two-year fight for the lawyer's testimony as House Democrats sought to enforce a subpoena for McGahn's testimony as part of its investigation into Trump's efforts to impede former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
McGahn, who left his post in late 2018 halfway through Trump's four-year term, had declined to testify in May 2019. The Justice Department at the time had advised him to defy the subpoena, one of a number of refusals by the Trump administration as it sought to block congressional inquiries into the former Republican president. 
""When the former President vowed to fight 'all of the subpoenas' aimed at his Administration, he began a dangerous campaign of unprecedented obstruction,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement late Wednesday, adding the deal begins ""to bring that era of obstruction to an end.""
Nadler's panel and the U.S. Justice Department have asked to postpone oral arguments in the ongoing lawsuit after reaching the settlement with McGahn, the committee said. More details about the planned transcribed interview would be released later, it added.
Representatives for McGahn could not be immediately reached, and a representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

McGahn emerged as a key figure in Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election that saw Trump defeat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives following the 2018 midterm election, handing them investigative powers. Trump lost the November 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden and left office in January.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate and now New York City mayoral hopeful, bounded into a liquor store this week and listened as its owner shared how the business had suffered during the coronavirus pandemic.
John Lau told Yang many of his customers in the borough of Queens - mostly Chinese Americans - remained afraid to venture out thanks to the disease as well as a rise in violence and anti-Asian hate crimes.
Yang has vowed to tackle those problems during his upbeat campaign for mayor, promising to revive a weary city battered by the pandemic and facing deep economic, racial and public safety challenges. But more than half a dozen rivals have argued he lacks the experience to run the city of about 8.2 million, the most populous in the United States.
""I want people to look around our city and say that things are cleaner, things are safer, things are more vibrant, the opportunities are back - there's a sense of optimism back in New York City,"" Yang said at a campaign appearance on Monday.
New York is facing one of the most consequential elections in its history as it looks to recover from COVID-19. The city lost more than half a million jobs in 2020, disproportionately concentrated among people of color, and the country's largest public school system still has not fully reopened.
Wealth inequality, a lack of affordable housing and a struggling tourism industry also are among the problems awaiting its next leader. 
Yang has led in most opinion polls since entering the race in January, a bona fide political celebrity on the strength of his surprisingly durable White House bid last year.
But with the June 22 Democratic primary that likely will determine the next mayor just six weeks away, as many as eight candidates remain viable in the race to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio. The first of several televised debates is on Thursday, setting off a more intense phase of the contest as voters pay greater attention and campaigns pour millions of dollars into TV ads.
Several New York political veterans are jockeying for position, including Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and former police officer; Scott Stringer, the city comptroller who has steadily risen through the political ranks; and Kathryn Garcia, the city's former sanitation chief who built a reputation as a problem solver at City Hall.
Other candidates include Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer and former MSNBC analyst; Ray McGuire, a former bank executive; Shaun Donovan, a former Obama administration official; and Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive.
The primary election will be the first time the city uses ranked-choice voting, in which voters can list multiple candidates in order of preference. That format has added to the unsettled nature of the race.
'THE ENTERTAINMENT CANDIDATE' 
Yang's rivals have sought to portray the tech entrepreneur - who has never voted in a city election and drew criticism for spending most of the pandemic at his upstate home - as all flash and no substance.
Similar to his presidential campaign, Yang has proposed a number of innovations, including a basic income of $2,000 a year to 500,000 poor residents.
His opponents have dismissed his ideas as implausible and questioned his ability to manage what has been described as the second-most difficult job in politics after the U.S. presidency. New York City's mayor oversees a $100 billion budget and more than 300,000 employees.
""He's not a New York fixture,"" said Christina Greer, a political science professor at New York's Fordham University. ""He's the entertainment candidate. As we get closer to June 22 and the reality sets in about what leadership looks like, I'm not sure his lead will hold.""
Opinion polls have shown Adams rising - he led Yang in one survey last week - as crime has become a main issue, especially after a shooting in Times Square last weekend in which three people were injured.
A former police officer who has spoken of getting beaten by police as a Black youth, Adams has put public safety at the center of his campaign, arguing it is a prerequisite for any economic recovery.
""To move forward, we cannot continue being derailed by the dangerous and violent behavior in our city,"" Adams told reporters on Monday in Manhattan. 
Shootings are up nearly 90% over last year in the city, from 275 at this point in 2020 to 505 as of May 9, according to police statistics.
""People aren't going to come back to work on mass transit if they're going to get mugged,"" said Kathryn Wylde, who heads the Partnership for New York City, a prominent business organization.
Stringer, the leading liberal candidate, has seen his campaign falter after a former volunteer accused him of groping her two decades ago. He has denied the allegations, but some progressive groups have turned to Wiley and Morales as alternatives.
Garcia, who has trailed in fundraising and polling, scored the coveted endorsement of the New York Times editorial board this week, which could boost her campaign to become New York's first female mayor.

With the city in a ""transformational moment,"" as she put it at a campaign event on Tuesday, Garcia has argued that her career as a public servant makes her the best choice. She has overseen 10,000 sanitation workers, fought lead poisoning in public housing and served as the city's ""food czar"" during the pandemic for struggling families.
""I have the experience to actually get it done,"" she told the radio station WNYC on Wednesday. ""That's the absolute differential.""

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump wanted National Guard troops in Washington to protect his supporters at a Jan. 6 rally that ended with them attacking the U.S. Capitol, leaving five dead, Trump's former Pentagon chief testified on Wednesday.
Former Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller told a House of Representatives panel that he spoke with Trump on Jan. 3, three days before the now-former president's fiery speech that preceded the violence and led to his second impeachment.
According to Miller's testimony, Trump asked during that meeting whether the District of Columbia's mayor had requested National Guard troops for Jan. 6, the day Congress was to ratify Joe Biden's presidential election victory.
Trump told Miller to ""fill"" the request, the former defense secretary testified. Miller said Trump told him: ""Do whatever is necessary to protect demonstrators that were executing their constitutionally protected rights.""
Miller made the remarks during a contentious hearing held by the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating security failures in the days leading to and during the riot.
Representative Carolyn Maloney, the Democrat who chairs the committee, demanded answers from Miller on why National Guard troops did not arrive until hours after the building was overrun.

Miller testified that the U.S. military was deliberately restrained that day when Trump's rally turned into an assault by hundreds of his followers that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer.
Miller testified that he was concerned in the days before Jan. 6 that sending National Guard troops to Washington would fan fears of a military coup or that Trump advisers were advocating martial law.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he sees room for a compromise on his proposal for trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending after meeting with Republican leaders but will move forward without the opposition party if necessary. 
In their first White House meeting since Biden, a Democrat, took office in January, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy signaled a willingness to work with the president on infrastructure but drew the line at tax increases.
Biden told reporters after the nearly two-hour meeting that he saw some reason to be optimistic.
""I'm generically encouraged that there's room to have a compromise on a bipartisan bill that's solid and significant,"" he told reporters.
In an interview with MSNBC he indicated an interest in passing part of his package with bipartisan support and part of it without.
""Let's see if we can get that agreement to kick-start this and then fight over what's left,"" Biden said in the interview. ""We'll see if I can get it done without Republicans if need be."" 
Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill and a $1.8 trillion education and childcare plan have faced sharp resistance from Republicans in Congress, with disagreements over the price tag, scope and funding proposals. 
""You won't find any Republicans who are gonna go raise taxes. I think that's the worst thing you can do in this economy,"" McCarthy said after the talks in the Oval Office. He cited rising gasoline prices as a reason not to back tax increases. 
McConnell said Republicans were ""not interested"" in reopening a 2017 legislative effort that cut taxes for companies and the wealthy under former Republican President Donald Trump.
""We both made that clear to the president. That's our red line,"" McConnell said. 
Before a pipeline outage caused fuel prices to spike, Republicans and businesses suggested ""user fees"" such as raising gasoline taxes instead, a more traditional form of infrastructure funding. 
Biden has expressed concern that such a model would hurt lower-income Americans. His investment plans, and intention to tax wealthy Americans and companies to cover the cost, are popular with voters from both parties.
But recent history does not augur well for a deal. 
No Republicans voted for Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan that passed in March. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said on Tuesday the Biden administration was ""not going to wait a long time if we don't see that agreement is possible.""
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden did not want to raise taxes on working Americans.
""His bottom line is that inaction is unacceptable, and that he is not going to raise taxes on the American people who are making less than $400,000 a year, but he's open to a range of proposals,"" she told a briefing.
Biden has said he wants to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate to between 25% and 28%, from 21%, to pay for badly needed infrastructure.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she felt more optimistic about prospects for a bipartisan infrastructure bill after the meeting, which she attended.
""We have a different set of values. But what we did agree in the meeting is: Let's agree on what we're trying to achieve. And then we can talk about how we pay for it. Let's not lead with a disagreement. We'll find a way because the public knows that this is necessary,"" Pelosi told reporters. 
CHENEY EXPULSION
McCarthy came to the White House talks shortly after leading his House Republican colleagues in expelling Liz Cheney from their leadership team for rejecting Trump's false claims that Biden stole last year's election.
McCarthy, who has sought to placate Trump, cast Cheney's dismissal from the No. 3 Republican leadership post in the House as necessary to unify Republicans and reclaim control of the House in 2022.
Psaki said the Republicans' support for Trump's false claims would not get in the way of Biden attempting to work with them.
""The president is no stranger to working with people who he disagrees with ... or who he has massive fundamental disagreement with,"" she said.

Congressional Democrats are giving Biden plenty of room to try to broker a deal, but they are preparing for the possibility of moving a massive spending bill along strictly party lines if Republicans do not join in negotiations, according to congressional and White House sources.
Democrats in Congress may struggle, however, to retain the necessary support of enough of their own members to pass Biden's spending proposals through both chambers, where they have slim majorities. They are betting the sheer volume of the spending measures will include enough attractive items to overcome any internal opposition, the sources told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -House of Representatives Republicans on Wednesday ejected Liz Cheney from their leadership ranks as punishment for repudiating former U.S. President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election, but she remained defiant and made plans to seek re-election to Congress.
Her ouster from her party's No. 3 post in the Democratic-led House unfolded in mere minutes in a closed-door meeting. The action signaled that Trump, despite losing to Democrat Joe Biden in November, has solidified his hold over House Republicans as he jockeys to play a major role in the 2022 congressional elections and flirts with running for president again in 2024.
Cheney's decision, disclosed by a spokesperson, to seek re-election next year for a fourth two-year term as the lone House member representing Wyoming https://www.reuters.com/world/us/shes-hero-liz-cheney-down-not-out-wyoming-after-crossing-trump-2021-05-12 appears to set the stage for a clash between competing factions in a Republican Party facing a moment of reckoning over its future - either following Trump's lead or finding a new path. Six Republicans already have lined up to challenge her in a heavily Republican state that Trump won with about 70 percent of the vote last year.
After her removal, Cheney came out swinging, telling reporters moments later that she would lead the fight to bring her party back to ""fundamental principles of conservatism."" 
""We must go forward based on truth. We cannot both embrace the big lie and embrace the Constitution,"" Cheney said.
Cheney has repeatedly rejected Trump's false claims of widespread voting fraud in the November election and depicted him as a threat to American democracy. She also vowed to prevent Trump from regaining the presidency.
""I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office,"" Cheney told reporters.
During Trump's time as president, Republicans lost their majorities in the House and Senate and he lost the White House.
Cheney, whose father Dick Cheney served as U.S. vice president from 2001 to 2009 after a previous stint in the House, is a lawmaker with impeccable conservative credentials. She was one of 10 House Republicans who voted with the Democrats in January when the House impeached Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection. Senate Republicans provided the votes to prevent Trump from being barred from holding future public office.
Trump's January impeachment - his second - focused on an incendiary Jan. 6 speech in which he urged his followers to ""fight"" his election defeat on the day Congress met to formally certify Biden's victory. A pro-Trump mob then stormed the U.S. Capitol building, an attack that left five dead. 
Cheney's critics said her criticism of Trump's false claims distracted from party messaging opposing Democrats and Biden's agenda. Cheney rejected House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's contention that Republicans must refrain from criticizing Trump to win back control of Congress in 2022.
""We have seen the danger that he continues to provoke with his language,"" Cheney said of Trump.
McCarthy and Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, orchestrated Cheney's ouster. Asked if he was concerned about his own leadership position in the party after protecting Cheney up to now, McCarthy replied: ""Not at all. No, I'm looking forward to being speaker in the next Congress.""
'HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING'
In a statement issued after the vote, Trump launched personal attacks on her, saying, ""Liz Cheney is a bitter, horrible human being."" He added, ""She has no personality or anything good having to do with politics or our country.""
Asked during an NBC interview if there is a battle now for the soul of her party, Cheney said, ""This is I think the opening salvo in that battle, and it's a battle we have to win. Because it's not just about the Republican Party, it's about the country."" 
Asked about Trump's political team looking to coalesce behind a primary challenger to her, Cheney said, ""You know, bring it on."" 
Trump and McCarthy have endorsed Representative Elise Stefanik https://www.reuters.com/world/us/loyalty-trump-catapults-elise-stefanik-into-republican-stardom-2021-05-11 to succeed Cheney as party conference chair, a role that helps develop Republican positions on legislation and assists rank-and-file members on an array of issues.
Stefanik, who gained prominence as a Trump defender, has drawn criticism from some Republicans for a voting record that they portray as being out of step with conservatives. Republican House members will vote on her nomination on Friday, Representative Louie Gohmert told reporters.

After Cheney's removal, Stefanik released a letter to colleagues promising a ""disciplined, unified message"" against Democrats and said she would highlight individual Republicans' conservative policies.
The Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican House members on the party's right flank, is close to Trump, and some of its members criticized McCarthy for anointing Stefanik as Cheney's replacement.

LARAMIE, Wyo. (Reuters) -When lifelong Wyoming Republican Tage Benson and Democrat Chamois Andersen met for the first time at the Owl in the Attic antiques store in Laramie this past weekend, they quickly put their political differences aside.
Their home state's embattled Republican congresswoman, Liz Cheney, needed to be supported, they agreed, for standing up to former President Donald Trump and contesting his false stolen-election claims.
    “This is where Democrats and Republicans can come together,” said Anderson, 51, a wildlife advocate who often disagrees with Cheney on policy.
    ""She is a hero,"" said Benson, 67, who was working the store's register. He told Andersen his Democratic friends were talking about registering as Republicans to vote for Cheney in the party's primary election next year. ""I'm going to talk everyone into that,"" he said.
Such a rare bipartisan show of support constitutes a potential lifeline as the third-term congresswoman and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney fights for political survival.
Cheney was removed on Wednesday from her position as the third-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives by her colleagues in a closed-door vote.
Kevin McCarthy, the chamber's top Republican who has sought to placate Trump, has cast her ouster from the party leadership as necessary to unify Republicans and reclaim control of the House in 2022.
Cheney is also in trouble in her home state of Wyoming, where Trump and Cheney both won with 70% of the vote in November. 
The majority is furious with her vote to impeach Trump for allegedly inciting the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and her repeated criticism of his claims the election was rigged, according to 40 voters Reuters interviewed in conservative towns of Gillette and Douglas, more moderate Laramie and the state capitol of Cheyenne over five days this month.
    Mike Gapter, owner of a bedding and hot tub store in Laramie, said the 2020 ballot was his final vote for Cheney. ""She's proved herself unworthy,"" he said.
But an unlikely coalition of traditional Republicans, independents and Democrats -- about one third of the voters interviewed -- said they would likely vote for her, a floor of support that could keep her hopes alive for re-election. 
It is too early for opinion polls about the primary. Wyoming law allows residents of any affiliation to vote in the Republican primary if they switch their registration on election day, potentially helping Cheney.
Cheney, 54, will run for re-election in 2022 and ""intends to win"", a spokesperson for her office told Reuters. And she could prove to be a formidable target. Cheney raised $1.54 million in the first quarter, her best fundraising quarter since she was elected in 2016.
    In pushing to oust her, House Republicans made clear they see their fortunes tied to Trump and his fervent supporters. But his influence could alienate the independent, suburban and women voters need to take back control of the House, said Alex Conant, a former campaign aide to Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
""House Republicans want to be associated with Trump, and they're taking a risk that it might turn off some independent voters,"" Conant said.
'PROBLEM FOR EVERYBODY'
Trump remains by far the most popular figure in the Republican Party; but polls show voters are split over what to do with critics like Cheney, while a sizeable minority of Republicans appear ready to move on from him.
In a May 7-10 Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, six out of 10 Republicans said their party would be stronger ""when it embraces supporters and critics of Donald Trump,"" while four in 10 think it better that the party ""purges leaders who are critical"" of him. https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qd4XcV
The poll also found that three in 10 Republicans are interested in ""joining a conservative political party that is run by former Republican leaders who have been critical of Donald Trump.”
Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman who lost her suburban Virginia seat in 2018 amid a surge of anti-Trump sentiment, said that ousting Cheney could prove dangerous for Republican incumbents from deeply conservative districts too, who could see their fealty to Trump challenged by an energized crop of Trump-inspired primary candidates.
“What they’re going to open the door to is a situation where nobody’s Trumpy enough,” she said. “It’s a problem for everybody.”
Asked about the intraparty fight over Cheney and its impact on House races, Tom Emmer, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he is ""solely focused on retaking the majority."" ""House Republicans are united in that effort,"" he said.
'VERY LOYAL PEOPLE'
    Sparsely populated Wyoming is one of the most conservative states in the country, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 3 to 1.
In her first run for Congress in 2016, Cheney beat a crowded Republican primary field with about 40% of the vote – although fewer than 90,000 people voted in total. She received more than 70% of the vote in successive primaries and has won general elections just as easily.
Six Republicans have already announced they will run against her next year. 
Anger toward Cheney was evident at a coffee shop called ""The Local"" in Gillette, a town of 32,000 people and at the center of the Powder River Basin, whose mines produce about 40 percent of the coal output in the United States.
All five men at a table in the back of The Local said they could not support Cheney after she went against Trump.
    ""We are very loyal people here,"" said Paul Roberts, 47. ""We didn't elect her to vote her conscience.""
If she decides to run, Cheney could potentially outperform a fragmented field of challengers - although Trump had recently said he would endorse a candidate soon. There is also a history of Democrats in the state of switching sides in primaries to help defeat more conservative candidates, political observers say, including in 2018 to bolster Republican Governor Mark Gordon.
    Jenasie Kendall, a 23-year-old independent who works at a wine shop in Cheyenne, said she would consider registering as a Republican to help Cheney win.
    ""I respect what she is trying to do, 100 percent,"" said Kendall. 

    Brendan Buck, once a top aide to former House Speaker Paul Ryan, was less sanguine about her future.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Domestic violent extremist groups, particularly white supremacists, pose a growing threat to the United States, Attorney General Merrick Garland told a Senate panel on Wednesday.
""The threat of lethality is higher than it ever was ... I have not seen a more dangerous threat to democracy than the invasion of the U.S. Capitol"" by rioters on Jan. 6, said Garland, who as a prosecutor led the investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people.
Garland noted the FBI recently said that the top domestic violent extremist threat facing the United States is from ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.""
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told the committee that racially or ethnically motivated extremists are ""most likely to conduct mass-casualty attacks against civilians,"" while people tied to right-wing militia groups are the most likely to target police and government employees and buildings.
The threat of attacks inside the United States by foreign militants such as Islamic State also persists, Mayorkas said. ""It is not as if they have disappeared... We don't take our eye off one to focus on the other,"" he said. 
Garland and Mayorkas said they were concerned about how disinformation and misinformation spread on social media, and Mayorkas said such ""false narratives"" can instigate violence. 

Garland said the Director of National Intelligence's office was monitoring ""sharing of information"" between U.S. and European extremists.
Mayorkas said that Homeland Security, whose leadership in the Trump Administration was accused by a whistleblower https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-whistleblower/u-s-intelligence-official-told-to-halt-russian-2020-election-meddling-threat-assessments-whistleblower-idUSKBN26032Q of playing down right-wing extremist threats, is devoting more intelligence resources to domestic extremism and allocating ""at least $77 million"" to help local governments prepare for ""acts of domestic violent extremism.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House labor task force, headed by Vice President Kamala Harris, is set to meet for the first time on Thursday, to promote labor organizing at a time when just over 6% of U.S. private-sector workers belong to unions, according to White House officials and the Department of Labor. 
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will serve as vice chair of the group and will attend the meeting in person, a Labor Department spokesperson said. 
President Joe Biden last month signed an executive order to create the task force, whose goals include facilitating worker organizing around the United States, increasing union membership and addressing challenges to labor organizing in underserved communities. 
Biden's executive order directed the task force to devise a set of recommendations within 180 days to address two key issues: How existing policies can promote labor organizing in the federal government, and looking at necessary new policies and the associated regulatory challenges.
Biden is widely considered to be the most pro-union president in decades and has earned praise from the country's labor leaders. He has moved quickly to oust government officials whom unions deemed hostile to labor and reversed Trump-era rules that weakened worker protections.
The task force, which includes more than 20 heads of agencies and Cabinet officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, is an extraordinary effort by the president to help reverse the decades-long decline in union membership and power, labor experts said.
Over 65 percent of Americans approve of unions, the most since 2003, according to a 2020 Gallup poll, despite the much lower membership rate.

The labor movement faced one of its biggest setbacks in recent history after an organizing drive at an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) facility failed earlier this month. 
Unions have lobbied for the passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which prohibits employers from holding anti-union meetings and imposes penalties for violating workers' rights. The House passed the measure in March and Biden supports the legislation, but it faces long odds in the Senate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in election battleground states have passed a wave of new voting requirements and limits this year, saying the measures are needed to curb voter fraud despite scant evidence of it in the United States.
Backers of the measures cite former President Donald Trump's baseless claim that fraud underlay his decisive presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in November. Democrats and voting rights advocates have sued state officials over the new laws, denouncing the efforts as partisan power grabs that will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color.
ARIZONA
Republican Governor Doug Ducey signed a law on Tuesday to stop counties from automatically mailing Arizonans early ballots if they do not use them often enough. The legislation, also passed on Tuesday, will remove voters from the state's ""Early Voting List"" if they fail to submit an early ballot at least once every two election cycles.
Republican lawmakers in most other states have bundled voting restrictions into sweeping bills to pass them in one go, but they are taking a piecemeal approach in Arizona. The state's legislature is expected to consider other voting hurdles in coming weeks, including a bill requiring absentee voters to provide more proof of identity.
TEXAS
The Texas House of Representatives passed new Republican-backed voting restrictions on May 7, barring officials from mass-mailing absentee ballot applications and giving partisan poll watchers more access to voting sites. The state Senate previously approved its own bill, which would eliminate extended voting hours and prohibit drive-through voting.
A bicameral committee is next expected to combine both bills into a final version, in a largely closed-door process controlled by Republicans. The final measure would then get one last vote from each chamber before heading to Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law.
FLORIDA
A law signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis on May 6 imposed additional requirements on requesting and submitting absentee ballots. Absentee voters must submit new proof of identity when requesting their ballots and reapply for absentee ballots in each new general election cycle, rather than every two cycles. 
The law also limited the use of absentee drop boxes to the early voting period, gave partisan election observers more power to raise objections and required people offering voters assistance to stay at least 150 feet (45 meters) away from polling places, an increase from the previous 100-foot (30-meter) radius.
GEORGIA
One of the most controversial new voting measures passed in Georgia, where Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a law on March 25 that tightened absentee ballot identification requirements, restricted ballot drop-box use and allowed a Republican-controlled state agency to take over local voting operations.
Critics said the legislation aims to disenfranchise Black voters, who helped propel Biden to the presidency and deliver Democrats two U.S. Senate victories in Georgia in January that gave them control of the chamber. Top U.S. companies also decried Georgia's law, and Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game out of the state in protest.

IOWA
Republican Governor Kim Reynolds signed a law on March 9 that shortened the state's early voting period and Election Day polling place hours, imposed tighter deadlines for absentee ballots to be submitted, and made it a felony for election officials to disobey guidance from Iowa's secretary of state, who is currently a Republican.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The man who led the Pentagon during former President Donald Trump's supporters' deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol is expected to defend his decisions at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, saying that sending in troops would have created the appearance of a ""military coup.""
Former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller plans to say that the military was deliberately restrained on the day of Trump's Jan. 6 rally, that turned into an assault by hundreds of his followers that left five dead including a police officer, according to a copy of his prepared remarks seen by Reuters.
""I am keenly aware of the criticism regarding the Department of Defense's response,"" Miller is expected to testify. ""My concerns regarding the appropriate and limited use of the military in domestic matters were heightened by commentary in the media about the possibility of a military coup or that advisors to the President were advocating the declaration of martial law.""
Miller will testify on Wednesday at a hearing held by the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on unanswered questions from the attack.
National Guard troops did not arrive at the Capitol until around 5:20 p.m. on Jan. 6, more than four hours after the grounds were first breached by the pro-Trump mob.
U.S. lawmakers have held a series of hearings on the federal government's preparations for and response to the attack, leading to finger-pointing between city officials, federal law enforcement agencies, and military leaders.
Major General William Walker, the District of Columbia’s National Guard commander, testified before a Senate panel in March that Pentagon officials took more than three hours to approve a request for National Guard troops to back up police.
Miller is expected to testify that the Pentagon's response was ""rapid"" in comparison to other military deployments in urban areas.
""This isn’t a video game where you can move forces with a flick of the thumb,"" Miller is expected to testify.
Miller is expected to fault Trump for encouraging the violent attack.
""I stand by my prior observation that I personally believe his comments encouraged the protesters that day,"" Miller said in his written testimony.

Also testifying at the hearing will be Jeffrey Rosen, the Acting U.S. Attorney General on Jan. 6.
He is expected to testify that the Justice Department ""reasonably prepared for contingencies ahead of January 6, understanding that there was considerable uncertainty as to how many people would arrive, who those people would be, and precisely what purposes they would pursue,"" according to remarks seen by Reuters.

The House Republican caucus voted to remove Cheney from their No. 3 leadership spot after she persistently criticized former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through election fraud.
""We must go forward based on truth. We cannot both embrace the big lie and embrace the Constitution,"" Cheney said after the House Republicans' vote.

Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was one of 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump in January after he delivered a fiery Jan. 6 speech to supporters, many of whom then stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to block certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
""Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar. I will not participate in that,"" Cheney said Tuesday night.
""I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president's crusade to undermine our democracy,"" she said.
Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is expected to lose a vote on her leadership post called by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy for Wednesday.
""Millions of Americans have been misled by the former president. They have heard only his words, but not the truth as he continues to undermine our democratic process, sowing seeds of doubt about whether democracy really works at all,"" Cheney said.
Most Republican lawmakers, including McCarthy, have sought to placate Trump, who continues to insist falsely that he lost November's election because of widespread fraud, a claim that has been shot down in multiple courts as well as by state and federal election officials.

""It's clear that we need to make a change,"" McCarthy told his fellow Republicans in a letter announcing Wednesday's vote. ""These internal conflicts need to be resolved, so as to not detract from the efforts of our collective team."" 
Representative Elise Stefanik, who rose to prominence within the party by defending Trump at hearings ahead of his first impeachment trial in 2019, is seen as Cheney's likely replacement and has the backing of McCarthy, House No. 2 Republican Steve Scalise and Trump himself.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrats in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday pushed forward sweeping legislation on political campaigns and elections they argued would expand access to voting, even as Republican-controlled states rushed to impose new restrictions.
After a long day of sometimes rancorous debate between Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, the deep divisions were evident by the panel's 9-9 vote on approval. No Republican voted yes.
Because of the tie vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to take procedural steps to bring it to the full Senate for debate and a vote, according to committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Democrat.
Under current Senate procedures, Republicans in the 100-member Senate can block passage of a bill unless at least 10 of them vote with Democrats in support of it, an unlikely outcome.
Among the bill's provisions are requirements that states expand mail-in voting, which was used widely in last year's presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic. It also would lengthen the hours of in-person balloting.
With scores of amendments offered, the nine Democrats and nine Republicans deadlocked on most, leading to their defeat.
The panel did, however, approve a Republican amendment prohibiting voting rights for anyone convicted of crimes against children.
The unusual appearance of the Senate's top Democratic and Republican leaders at the committee's work session underscored the stakes, with the legislation being advanced as the November 2022 congressional elections come into focus.
""The bill before this committee has a very simple premise: make it easier, not harder, to vote,"" Schumer said.
He devoted most of his remarks, however, to the slew of election-law changes being enacted in Republican-controlled states this year, characterizing them as anti-democratic. ""They carry the stench of oppression,"" Schumer said.
The Senate bill and a similar one passed by the House of Representatives in March with no Republican support go beyond election reforms. They also attempt to end the partisan way in which congressional districts are drawn and curb ""dark money"" campaign contributions that obscure the identity of donors.
The Democrats are pushing the changes as former President Donald Trump continues to falsely claim that his election defeat in November was the result of widespread fraud.
Election fraud is extremely rare in the United States, according to researchers. Multiple courts and state and federal election officials rejected Trump's claim last year.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the Democrats' bill represented nothing more than a power grab.
""This legislation would let Washington Democrats dictate the terms of their own re-election races by rewriting all 50 states’ election laws,"" McConnell said.
He zeroed in on provisions he said would foster fraudulent elections by loosening voter identification laws and allowing people to collect and turn in other voters' ballots, such as for those in remote locations or in nursing homes.
Last week, Florida enacted new limits on voting by mail and using ballot drop boxes. Texas also is in the process of approving new controls.

That follows Georgia's enactment in March of a far-reaching Republican bill that includes a prohibition on offering food or water to voters waiting in long lines.
A Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll found in March that 81% of adults said it was ""very"" or ""somewhat"" important that the government make it easier for people to vote. But the poll also showed that 74% found it equally important that new limits on voting be imposed to protect elections from fraud.

(Reuters) -A federal judge in Dallas ruled on Tuesday that the National Rifle Association cannot use bankruptcy to reorganize in gun-friendly Texas, a serious blow to the gun rights group's effort to avoid a lawsuit in New York seeking its dissolution.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale said the NRA did not file for Chapter 11 in good faith, but instead filed to avoid oversight by New York Attorney General Letitia James and gain an ""unfair litigation advantage"" over her. 
James sued to shut down the NRA in August, accusing it of diverting millions of dollars to fund luxuries for officials including longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre, no-show contracts for associates and other questionable expenses.
Closely aligned with Republicans including former President Donald Trump, the NRA has long been instrumental in thwarting Democratic-backed gun control measures in the U.S. Congress.
Ruling after a 12-day trial that ended on May 3, Hale said some details that came out about the NRA were ""cringeworthy.""
He singled out LaPierre for criticism, including the ""surreptitious manner"" he used to obtain sole authority to put the NRA into bankruptcy in January.
""Excluding so many people from the process of deciding to file for bankruptcy, including the vast majority of the board of directors, the chief financial officer and the general counsel, is nothing less than shocking,"" Hale wrote.
""The question the court is faced with is whether the existential threat facing the NRA is the type of threat that the Bankruptcy Code is meant to protect against,"" Hale added. ""The court believes it is not.""
In a statement, LaPierre acknowledged defeat and appeared resigned to defending against James' lawsuit.
""We remain an independent organization that can chart its own course, even as we remain in New York to confront our adversaries,"" he said. ""The NRA will keep fighting, as we've done for 150 years.""
LaPierre and the NRA have denied wrongdoing.
James welcomed Hale's decision. ""The rot runs deep, which is why we will now refocus on and continue our case in New York court,"" she said. ""No one is above the law, not even one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the country.""
Hale's dismissal is without prejudice, meaning the NRA can file for bankruptcy again, but the judge said management issues could require appointing a trustee to oversee its affairs if it sought Chapter 11 again.
'DIRTY LAUNDRY'
The NRA hoped to use Chapter 11 to reincorporate in Republican-dominated Texas and escape what it called a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York, where it was founded in 1871.
LaPierre testified that he feared James would try to put the NRA into receivership.
He said that made bankruptcy preferable, though the group could fully pay its debts if the Chapter 11 case were dismissed. 
Internal upheaval has also plagued the NRA in recent years, including an effort to oust LaPierre over alleged mismanagement.
""The NRA was forced to hang its dirty laundry out for the world to see,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, which supports stricter gun control laws. ""Their loss is a huge gain for the gun safety movement.""
President Joe Biden's administration opposed the bankruptcy, with the Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, the U.S. Trustee, urging its dismissal.
Biden has called gun violence ""a national embarrassment"" following a spate of mass shootings, and called for Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.

The NRA is separately backing a challenge to a New York law restricting the carrying of concealed handguns outside the home.
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review that law, potentially leading to its first major decision in more than a decade on the right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over 100 former Republican officials will sign a letter on Thursday declaring that if the Republican Party does not break with former President Donald Trump and change course, they will back the creation of a third party.
The letter, headlined: ""A Call For American Renewal,"" is an exploratory move toward forming a breakaway party, two of its organizers said. The group is dismayed by what it says is a modern Republican Party driven by its allegiance to Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen from him.
""The Republican Party is broken. It's time for a resistance of the 'rationals' against the 'radicals,'"" said Miles Taylor, one of the organizers. Taylor, while serving in the Trump White House, wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times in 2018 headlined: ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.""
The group first raised the threat in February https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-party-exclusive/exclusive-dozens-of-former-republican-officials-in-talks-to-form-anti-trump-third-party-idUSKBN2AB07P, following the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters to try to disrupt congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory.
The letter highlights the wide intraparty rift over Trump.
Most Republicans remain fiercely loyal to the former president.
House Republicans are expected on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-house-republican-says-he-will-back-stefanik-not-trump-critic-cheney-2021-05-09 to oust Representative Liz Cheney from her No. 3 party leadership position within the chamber, because of her refusal to embrace Trump's election claims and her move to back Trump's second impeachment after the Capitol riot.
The letter signatories, who include former ambassadors, governors, congressional members and Cabinet secretaries, want the Republican Party to return to ""principled"" leadership and reject division and conspiracy theories, or face a new party dedicated to fighting for Republicans such as Cheney and against fearmongering and lies.
Backers of the reform group include former Republican Governors Tom Ridge, Christine Todd Whitman, George W. Bush-era Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and former House members Charlie Dent, Barbara Comstock, Reid Ribble and Mickey Edwards.
They may face an uphill battle in getting any current Republican officeholders to sign on - including Cheney herself, who in February rejected the idea of a third party, saying it would empower Democrats.

A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.""
Evan McMullin, a former chief policy director for the House Republican Conference and an independent presidential candidate in 2016, said if the Republican Party does not reject lies and extremism, part of it ""will have no choice but to part ways with it and build something new. We're excited about that prospect.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik's first turn in the national limelight came when she mounted an impassioned defense of Donald Trump at his first impeachment trial in 2019, leading the then-president to declare that ""a star is born.""
Stefanik's star could rise higher as Trump now pushes for her to be elected the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, where her colleagues are set to vote on Wednesday to remove Representative Liz Cheney https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-us-house-republican-sets-wednesday-vote-cheney-ouster-2021-05-10 from that role for rejecting his continued false claims that the 2020 presidential election was marred by widespread fraud.
It is a profound change for Stefanik, a New York state Republican first elected in 2014 on a moderate platform, who avoided saying Trump's name publicly during the 2016 campaign season and did not vote for him in that year's Republican presidential primary.
The change won over party leaders in the House, Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise - who along with Trump endorsed Stefanik to replace Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney - as well as many people in her rural district, which encompasses much of the Adirondack Mountains.
""Here in Fulton County, we're proud and very happy with the path she's on,"" said Sue McNeil, chair of the county's Republican committee since 2008. ""We're Trump country up here.""
Staff for Stefanik did not make her available for an interview. She is one of 147 Republicans in Congress who voted in January to try to block the certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's election win, hours after a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.
Stefanik, now 36, was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she first won her district, which had voted twice for Democratic President Barack Obama and had been represented by Democrats in Congress since 1993.
She had worked for establishment Republicans including former President George W. Bush and the party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, former House Speaker Paul Ryan.
Michael Steel, who worked with Stefanik on Ryan's campaign, said Stefanik had grown more conservative along with her district. But he also saw no big clash between her previous reputation as a moderate Republican and her embrace of Trump. 
""President Trump is not particularly conservative in many policy areas,"" said Steel, who was a spokesman for Ryan's campaign and for former House Speaker John Boehner. 
'NOT ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH'
The conservative Club for Growth, which rates members of Congress, gives her a lifetime score of just 35% for voting in line with its priorities, one of the worst among House Republicans, and well below Cheney's 65%. That has led some conservative House members to push back against elevating Stefanik.
""Her voting record is atrocious,"" Representative Chip Roy said last week on radio's ""Erick Erickson Show.""
On Tuesday Roy asked fellow Republicans to consider a more conservative contender for the job or to leave the position open, according to a letter to the caucus seen by Reuters.
Stefanik has worked hard, with some success, to help elect other Republican women to Congress. Last year, she raised and donated over $2 million for Republican candidates. Three fourths of that went to Republican women, who more than doubled their numbers in the House, although they still lag behind the Democrats.
But Olivia Troye, who was an aide to former Vice President Mike Pence before leaving in August, said it had been ""disappointing"" to see Stefanik potentially elevated into leadership for being a Trump acolyte who advances his voting fraud claims.

""She's not getting it on the merits of being bipartisan, she's not getting it on the merits of her policymaking, her governing,"" said Troye, part of the Republican Accountability Project. ""She's getting it on the merits of lying. It's not about telling the truth. She's rising in power for her lies.""
""The more they attack Elise Stefanik, the stronger she becomes,"" said her senior adviser, Alex DeGrasse.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House on Tuesday announced a series of steps aimed at boosting U.S. COVID-19 vaccination rates, including a partnership with ride-hailing services Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), as it seeks to achieve President Joe Biden's July 4 reopening deadline.
The latest actions also include vaccination sites at community colleges, among other efforts, the White House said in a statement.
The new initiatives come at a time when U.S. demand for vaccines has declined significantly, forcing the administration to figure out new ways to motivate people to get vaccinated. 
President Biden will discuss the steps in a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors on Tuesday. 
""Today, the president will highlight an ... effort by the ride-sharing companies Lyft and Uber to provide free rides to anyone going to a vaccination site to get vaccinated,"" the statement said.
Biden has set a target of getting 70% of U.S. adults inoculated by July 4 so the country can be safely reopened for celebrations and small Independence Day holiday gatherings. As of Monday, 46% of Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Tuesday's partnership comes after Uber sent a letter to the Biden team in December, offering help with vaccinations. It also urged the administration to maintain Uber drivers' status as independent contractors, while offering the ability to provide some benefits. 
Biden campaigned on providing more benefits to gig workers by reclassifying them employees - a move opposed by companies involved. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters two weeks ago, ""in a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees."" 
The rides build on existing vaccination programs Uber and Lyft launched at the end of last year, which combine public service with self interest, as the companies seek to have drivers and riders return to the road.
Uber has offered 10 million self-funded free or discounted rides to vaccination sites, while Lyft said it would provide an uncapped amount of free vaccination rides paid for in partnership with other corporate sponsors.
Those programs targeted vulnerable communities lacking healthcare and transportation, while rides under the White House partnership are open to everyone.
Uber and Lyft said they will pay for the additional rides.

""Ride codes will cover $15 each way, which based on previous rides given to vaccination sites, we expect to cover most, if not all, of riders' fares,"" Lyft said.
Biden also will announce funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for states for on-the-ground efforts to promote vaccinations, such as phone banking and door-to-door canvassing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday will consider a pair of bills to reform the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service, a document seen by Reuters shows.
Representative Carolyn Maloney, the Democrat who chairs the panel, circulated draft legislation earlier this year to address some key USPS financial issues.
It would eliminate a requirement for USPS to pre-fund retiree health benefits and would require postal employees to enroll in the Medicare government-retiree health plan. The measures would save USPS $40 billion to $50 billion over 10 years. 
Maloney said in February that Congress needed to pass reforms ""to put the Postal Service on more sustainable financial footing for years to come.""
The committee did not immediately release the text of the planned reform bills on Monday.
USPS did not immediately comment on Monday.
The Postal Service has struggled with poor delivery performance over the past year, facing a huge boost in packages and COVID-19 staffing issues.
In March, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy proposed a 10-year strategic plan that would eliminate $160 billion in forecasted red ink by slowing some mail deliveries, cutting some retail hours and closing some locations.
DeJoy told Reuters in March that action was urgently needed: ""We’re losing $10 billion a year - gotta fix it.""
Separately, Maloney and other Democrats have drafted a letter seen by Reuters in support of potentially $8 billion in an infrastructure bill ""to enable the Postal Service to purchase an all-electric delivery fleet and the needed infrastructure to support that fleet.""
The letter also calls for requiring that ""at least 75% of the Postal Service’s new fleet must be electric or zero-emission"" and for USPS to ""acquire only electric or zero-emission vehicles after 2040.""

USPS wants President Joe Biden’s administration to calculate pension obligations using “modern actuarial principles” that would save a further $12 billion.
USPS has reported net losses of $86.7 billion since 2007. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating that it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities, a requirement that labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

The vote, announced by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy in a letter to colleagues on Monday, is likely to result in the ouster of Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump in January and has repeatedly criticized the former president's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. 
""Having heard from so many of you in recent days, it's clear that we need to make a change. As such, you should anticipate a vote on recalling the Conference Chair this Wednesday,"" McCarthy said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. 
McCarthy cast Cheney's expected removal as chair of the House Republican Conference - the party's No. 3 post in the chamber - as necessary to unify Republicans in the run-up to the 2022 congressional elections when they hope to reclaim control of the House. 
""Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future,"" he said.
Most Republican lawmakers, including McCarthy, have sought to placate Trump, who continues to insist falsely that he lost November's election because of widespread fraud, a claim that has been shot down in multiple courts as well as by state and federal election officials.
But other Republicans view the move to eject Cheney from her post as the latest sign of Trump's control of the party and warn it could ultimately sink Republican hopes in 2022 by alienating swing voters including independents, women and suburbanites. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

""Expelling Liz Cheney from leadership won't gain the GOP one additional voter, but it will cost us quite a few,"" Republican Senator Mitt Romney said on Twitter on Monday, after coming under fire himself for voting to convict Trump of inciting insurrection earlier this year. 
Trump was impeached in the House, and tried and acquitted in the Senate, after delivering a fiery Jan. 6 speech to supporters, many of whom then stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to block certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Five people including a police officer died in the melee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Gay and transgender people will be protected against sex discrimination in healthcare, the U.S. health secretary said on Monday, as President Joe Biden's administration reversed a policy put in place under his predecessor Donald Trump.
Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the action restores protections under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, against sexual discrimination in healthcare. It was the latest in a series of steps the Democratic president has taken to bolster LGBT rights.
""It simply says what everyone already should know: You should not discriminate against people,"" Becerra told CNN. ""That includes those based on sexual orientation or gender identity and when it comes to healthcare - we want to make sure that's the case.""
The new policy represents a reversal of a reversal. HHS under Trump in June 2020 issued a rule that lifted some anti-discrimination protections under the Affordable Care Act, a law signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010.
In 2016, Obama's administration introduced rules that made clear that LGBT people would be protected under the federal healthcare discrimination provision. The Trump-era rule reversed those provisions of the law that extended civil rights protections in healthcare to cover areas including gender identity and abortion.
""So now it's clear, there's no ambiguity: You cannot discriminate against people based on sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Becerra added.
HHS said in a statement that its Office for Civil Rights made the decision in light of a June 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling and subsequent court decisions. The Supreme Court last year delivered a watershed victory for LGBT rights and a defeat for Trump's administration, ruling that a longstanding federal law barring workplace discrimination protects gay and transgender employees.
""The Supreme Court has made clear that people have a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of sex and receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation,"" Becerra said in the statement.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, praised the administration's step and called Trump's LGBT action in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic ""an act of senseless and staggering cruelty.""
The issue of transgender rights has become a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars, with Republicans at the state level pursuing measures targeting transgender people. Such bills have been introduced in about 28 states so far this year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center advocacy group.
""With healthcare for transgender youth under attack by state legislatures, this move to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in healthcare is critical,"" the American Civil Liberties Union said. 
""It's unfortunate that such an obvious step had to be taken; the AMA welcomes this common-sense understanding of the law,"" added American Medical Association President Susan Bailey.

Biden, who took office in January, has sought to overturn other Trump policies limiting the rights of LGBT Americans.
Biden has reversed his Republican predecessor's ban on transgender people serving in the U.S. military, issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people and issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of LGBT people worldwide.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats who narrowly control the U.S. Congress will confront twin threats to advancing President Joe Biden's agenda as they return to Washington from a break this week: United opposition from Republicans and bickering in their own ranks.
They need near-total unity on goals and tactics to advance Biden's proposed $4 trillion in spending packages, after passing a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief measure in March with a maneuver that skirted Senate rules requiring a supermajority for most legislation.
An expanded child tax credit, which passed as part of that package, is one issue that could fracture their tight 218-212 majority in the House of Representatives and shakier 50-50 split in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris holds the tie-breaking vote.
Progressives are staging a power-play to make the one-year expansion permanent, but some moderate Senate Democrats have raised concerns. 
""It's about seizing the moment. The moment is now,"" said Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and one of a sizeable band of liberals who have rejected Biden's compromise offer of extending the expanded child tax credit only through 2025.
History explains DeLauro's sense of urgency: The next congressional election is less than 18 months away and typically a president's party loses seats in the midterm vote after taking office. If Republicans recapture a majority in either chamber of Congress, they could block Biden's agenda.
Indeed, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell last week told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that is his goal.
""One hundred percent of our focus is on stopping this new administration,"" McConnell said.
House Republicans, meanwhile, have their own fight ahead this week as they vote on whether to remove Representative Liz Cheney from leadership for her rejection of former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.
'DEFICITS AND COSTS'
Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the one-year expansion of the credit will cost $110 billion.
Progressives argue a permanent extension will ease the cost to taxpayers by helping move poor families, especially minorities, off of some government supports. They also indicated a willingness to consider other offsets of costs.
Still smarting from Senator Bernie Sanders' failed effort to include a hike in the federal minimum hourly wage to $15 in the March bill, progressives see many of the same moderate senators as a likely roadblock on the tax credit.
Democratic Senator Tom Carper said he needed to study the proposal but expressed money worries, saying, ""I always think about deficits and costs...it's part of my DNA."" 
Likewise, Senator Jeanne Shaheen said, ""We need to take a look at how the child tax credit does this year and make sure we've got some data to support the fact that it's going to benefit the kids.""
The extension will be just one of many policy fights Democrats will have to work out in coming months as they agree on which measures to tuck into Biden's sweeping spending bills.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he knows Republicans might decide to again sit on the sidelines and watch Democrats struggle to pass Biden's agenda on their own.
That would necessitate using ""budget reconciliation,"" which temporarily suspends the 60-vote super-majority required to advance most legislation in the 100-member Senate. The tactic was used to propel Biden's first COVID-19-relief package to victory. For it to work, every one of the 50 Senate seats controlled by Democrats must vote together.

That is what progressives such as Senator Sherrod Brown urged. 
""Few times in history do we have an opportunity like this and we need to seize it,"" Brown told reporters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. Republicans on Sunday sought to portray their expected ouster of Representative Liz Cheney as an act of unity, despite warnings that the move could deepen divisions over former President Donald Trump and sink party hopes in the 2022 elections.
In the strongest sign yet that Cheney faces defeat in a party vote expected on Wednesday, the top Republican in the House of Representatives said he would back congresswoman Elise Stefanik to replace the Wyoming Republican as chair of the 212-member House Republican Conference.
Republicans hope to reclaim majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives in next year's congressional elections. Most lawmakers have sought to placate Trump and the Republican voters who enthusiastically support him, despite the loss of both chambers and the White House during his presidency. 
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and Representative Jim Banks, who heads the Republican Study Committee, a leading conservative caucus, said Cheney is under fire as a party leader because of her repeated criticism of Trump's falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen has distracted from party messaging against Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
""We need to be united and that starts with leadership,"" McCarthy told the Fox News program, ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""We want to be united moving forward, and I think that's what will take place."" 
Asked if he supports Stefanik for Cheney's position, McCarthy replied: ""Yes, I do.""
Stefanik, a 36-year-old from New York state whose status in the party rose after she aggressively defended Trump during congressional hearings ahead of his 2019 impeachment, is also supported by No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise and by Trump himself.
Cheney was among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection after hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a riot that left five people dead including a police officer. 
The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney has continued to criticize Trump for repeating falsehoods about his election loss to Biden and has called on Republicans to become the ""party of truth"" by rejecting his claims.
""Any leader who is not focused on pushing back against the radical and dangerous Biden agenda needs to be replaced,"" Banks, whose caucus represents about 70% of the House Republican conference, told the Fox News Sunday program.
But while McCarthy and Banks cast Cheney's likely ejection from the party leadership as a step toward unity, others said Wednesday's vote would only deepen divisions that could sink the party. 
""Right now, it's basically the Titanic. We're in the middle of this slow sink. We have a band playing on the deck telling everybody it's fine,"" Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger, who also voted to impeach Trump, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" program. 
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who is seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024, likened the Cheney vote to ""a circular firing squad"" in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. 
""We had the worst four years we've had - ever - in the Republican Party, losing the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate. And successful politics is about addition and multiplication, not subtraction and division,"" Hogan said.

Cheney held off an initial challenge to her House leadership position earlier this year. 
She also faces an uphill 2022 re-election battle in her home state of Wyoming, where Trump is working to defeat her as the state's sole House member. She and the former president each received nearly 70% of Wyoming's vote in November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he expected to be able to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon and the White House said ongoing differences between the United States and Russia would not need to be resolved in advance of a summit.
Biden told reporters at the White House he wanted to meet Putin despite Russia's build-up of military forces near Ukraine.
""It does not impact my desire to have a one-on-one meeting and you'll notice he had more troops before. He's withdrawn troops,"" he said.
Asked about meeting Putin in June, he said: ""I'm confident we'll be able to do it. We don't have any specific time or place. That's being worked on.""
The United States has said it supports Ukraine amid what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week called Moscow's ""reckless"" troop build-up.
Biden and his advisers would like to add a summit with Putin in a third country while the U.S. president is in Europe in mid-June for a Group of Seven meeting in Britain and talks with NATO allies in Brussels.
But negotiations with the Russians on staging the summit are continuing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
""We're working through the question of some logistics - place, location, time, agenda, all the specifics - that was always going to happen at a staff level. It's really up to them what they want to achieve,"" she said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cited by Russian news agency TASS as saying Russia was studying the possibility of a Putin-Biden meeting.
""We continue to analyze the situation,"" TASS quoted Peskov as saying when asked whether the Russian side has officially agreed to the proposed summit.

The United States has a number of grievances with Russia, including its treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. But Psaki said these grievances do not need to be resolved in advance of a Biden-Putin summit.
""Obviously, human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, values are all issues the president, Secretary (of State Antony) Blinken, National Security Adviser (Jake) Sullivan raised with their counterparts. But the invitation to have a discussion and have a meeting was not offered with the prerequisite that every issue is resolved in advance. We expect we will still continue to have disagreements,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Four former Minneapolis police officers face federal civil rights charges for their role in the arrest and murder of George Floyd, according to court documents unsealed on Friday, showing the Justice Department's tougher stance in such cases.
A federal grand jury in Minneapolis on Thursday issued a three-count indictment charging Derek Chauvin - the white former officer convicted in Minnesota state court of murdering Floyd - and three fellow former officers of violating his constitutional rights, including his right to have his medical needs attended to.
""The defendants saw George Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care, and willfully failed to aid Floyd,"" the indictment says.
Also charged were Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane.
Attorneys for the four men did not respond to messages seeking comment on the charges.
Thao, Kueng and Lane appeared with their lawyers in federal court in Minneapolis on Friday by video. All three were released on $25,000 bond. Chauvin, who is awaiting a June 25 sentencing hearing on his state convictions, remains in custody.
In a separate federal indictment unsealed on Friday, Chauvin was also charged with violating the rights of a 14-year-old boy during an arrest in September 2017. Chauvin is accused of holding the teen by the neck and hitting him with a flashlight.
The charges were the latest sign the Department of Justice under new Democratic President Joe Biden is taking a harder line against police abuses, a role that civil rights advocates say the department neglected during Republican Donald Trump's administration.
In a confrontation captured on video, Chauvin pushed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, as he and the three other officers arrested the 46-year-old Black man. Floyd, who was in handcuffs, had been accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a grocery store. 
His death prompted protests against racism and police brutality last year in many cities across the United States and around the world, and reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement.
Chauvin was convicted of state murder charges last month. His lawyers on Tuesday requested a new trial, saying there was prosecutorial and jury misconduct and errors of law at trial and that the verdict was contrary to the law.
The federal indictment against the four former officers charged them with depriving Floyd of his liberty and showing ""deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.""
Thao, Kueng and Lane - all of whom were fired and arrested days after Floyd's death - also face state charges at a trial set for Aug. 23 that they aided and abetted the second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has prioritized cracking down on police misconduct since being confirmed as the nation's top law enforcement official in March. He has launched investigations into policing practices in Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot to death by police in her home during a botched raid in March 2020.
""The indictments, while certainly not convictions, send an important message to the public that the legal system does provide avenues of recourse for the actions the former officers took that led to the death of Floyd,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
The former officers were charged under a federal statute that provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but are likely to face less severe sentences if convicted.
The attorneys representing Floyd's family said in a statement that they are ""encouraged by these charges and eager to see continued justice in this historic case that will impact Black citizens and all Americans for generations to come.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said the indictments highlight the need for Congress to pass legislation banning certain police tactics, such as chokeholds.
""It is a reminder, as was the verdict in the Chauvin case just a few weeks ago, that there is still more that needs to be done,"" Psaki said at a news briefing. ""It is a reminder of the need to put police reform in place.""

653,"<span>May 07, 2021 04:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - What did the disappointing U.S. jobs report on Friday say about the state of the world's biggest economy? 
As is true for many things in Washington, the answer differs radically depending on which political party you ask. 
The Labor Department reported 266,000 new jobs were created in April, a fraction of the nearly 1 million jobs that were expected by a Reuters poll of economists. A drop in temporary help positions put a fresh focus on the generous unemployment benefits that the White House has championed as necessary to keep Americans financially whole as the country recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Many Republicans say the disappointing employment report signals that governments at the federal and state levels are being too generous with unemployment benefits, discouraging people from working. Democrats say companies aren't offering high-enough wages, or programs like subsidized childcare to encourage people to go back to work.
""The government pays people big bucks NOT to work so they don’t!,"" U.S. Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama, wrote on Twitter. ""DUH! Socialism seems nice but in fact is destructive. America: learn or lose!"" 
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, an ally of former President Donald Trump who is jockeying to replace fellow Republican Liz Cheney in the party's leadership in the House of Representatives, blamed the jobs figure on ""socialist unemployment benefits,"" saying many small businesses in her New York state district had told her they could not find enough workers. 
In a move that could be replicated in other Republican-led states, Montana and South Carolina are ending federal pandemic unemployment benefits pushed by Democratic President Joe Biden for residents next month, saying they are stopping people from working. 
Representative Ro Khanna of California and other Democrats blamed companies for not offering to pay workers more.
""Wages have not risen yet and part of the reason people aren't getting back in is that wages haven't adjusted,"" Khanna told MSNBC, calling on Congress to pass legislation that would more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. 
Khanna also said more support for child care was needed to get women back into the workforce. 

""The disappointing April jobs report highlights the urgent need to pass President Biden’s American Jobs and Families Plans,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said in a statement, referring to the White House's proposals for about $4 trillion in additional spending on infrastructure, education and other priorities.
The Biden administration's new spending proposals include adding more government-funded childcare, and free universal pre-Kindergarten nationwide.

654,"<span>May 07, 2021 04:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Anthony Gonzalez on Friday joined a growing list of lawmakers being censured by state Republican Party officials for voting to impeach former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Gonzalez, a two-term lawmaker from Ohio and former professional football player, was also called upon by the Ohio Republican Party to resign his seat in Congress, as Trump reasserts his grip on the party.
Ohio Republican Party Chairman Bob Paduchik said in a statement that the action against Gonzalez ""addresses an unconstitutional, politically motivated process that served no purpose,"" apparently referring to the House impeachment of Trump.
Last January, Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans voting to impeach Trump for his role in inciting a riot on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer. Trump supporters were attempting to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory as president.
Weeks later, the Senate acquitted Trump on a vote of 57-43, short of the two-thirds majority needed for a conviction. Seven Republican senators joined all 50 Democrats in voting to convict the former president.
Aides to Gonzalez were not immediately available for comment.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are also scheduled to vote on whether to strip Representative Liz Cheney of her Republican leadership position for challenging Trump's false assertions that last November's presidential election was stolen from him.
Other Republicans censured include Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who was one of the seven voting to convict Trump.

(Reuters) -Texas joined other Republican-controlled states on Friday in advancing a slew of new voting restrictions, defying opposition from many of the state's businesses and adding to a fierce national debate over voting rights.
The state House of Representatives in Austin gave the legislation preliminary approval at 3 a.m. CDT (0800 GMT) on Friday after hours of debate before delivering final approval around 2:45 p.m. (1945 GMT), largely along party lines.
Members of the House and the state Senate, which passed its own bill imposing voting limits last month, will now work to reconcile the two bills before sending a finalized version to Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it.
Other states, including Georgia and Florida, have also enacted Republican-backed voting curbs after Republican former President Donald Trump falsely claimed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in last year's presidential election was the result of massive voter fraud. Republican legislators in numerous other states are pursuing similar changes.
The Texas House bill gives more access to partisan poll watchers and bars election officials from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters, among other restrictions. The Senate bill includes limits on early voting and would prohibit 24-hour polling sites and drive-through voting, both changes that Harris County made last year during the coronavirus pandemic.
Sponsors of the bills said they are intended to prevent voter fraud while bolstering election integrity and public confidence in balloting.
""This bill is about protecting voters,"" Republican Representative Briscoe Cain said during the House floor debate. 
Democrats and civil rights groups counter that there is no evidence of widespread ballot tampering, and argue that such legislation disproportionately burdens or discourages voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled. Voting rights advocates say Texas already has in place some of the highest barriers to voting of any state.
""In short, this bill is nothing but voter suppression,"" Jasmine Crockett, a lawyer and first-term Democrat, said on the House floor.
On Tuesday, dozens of companies - including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - urged legislators to reject any law restricting access to ballots.
Voting by mail, and early voting in general, surged during the 2020 election as voters sought to avoid ballot-box queues in the midst of the pandemic.
The Texas vote came a day after Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a new law making it more difficult for voters to cast ballots by mail or to use ballot drop boxes.

In March, Georgia adopted a Republican-backed law that included sweeping new restrictions, sparking backlash from major U.S. corporations and prompting Major League Baseball to move its All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest.
More than three months after Biden was sworn in, Trump has continued to assert that the election was stolen. Courts have rejected those claims in more than 60 lawsuits challenging the results.

(Reuters) -Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed a bill imposing new limits on voting by mail and using ballot drop boxes, the latest Republican-backed voting restrictions to become law in a U.S. election battleground state.
The new law restricts the use of absentee ballot drop boxes to the early voting period, adds new identification requirements for requesting such ballots, and requires voters to reapply for absentee ballots in each new general election cycle. Previously, Florida voters only had to apply once every two election cycles.
The law also gives partisan election observers more power to raise objections and requires people offering voters assistance to stay at least 150 feet (45 meters) away from polling places, an increase from the previous 100-foot (30-meter) radius.
Republican legislators in dozens of states have pursued measures to restrict voting rights in the aftermath of former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. Lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives were poised on Thursday to advance sweeping new voting limits despite opposition from numerous businesses.
Minutes after DeSantis signed the law, the League of Women Voters of Florida and two other civil rights groups sued Florida's 67 counties to try to block the new restrictions. They are represented by Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who also sued Georgia over voting limits the state passed in March.
The Florida branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Disability Rights Florida and the good government group Common Cause also sued the state on Thursday, arguing the limits would disproportionately hurt Black, Latino and disabled voters.
Republican lawmakers have cited the unfounded claims made by Trump, a Florida absentee voter himself, after his decisive loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Judges rejected such claims in more than 60 lawsuits that failed to overturn the election result. Lawmakers in Republican-controlled states, including Georgia, Texas and Arizona, nevertheless proposed legislation they said was necessary to curb voter fraud, which is extremely rare in the United States. 
DeSantis acknowledged in February that Florida had ""held the smoothest, most successful election of any state in the country,"" but said new limits on absentee ballots were needed to safeguard election integrity.
DeSantis, who signed the law in an appearance on the Fox News Channel show ""Fox & Friends,"" said, ""Me signing this bill here says, 'Florida, your vote counts, your vote is going to be cast with integrity and transparency.'""
Mail-in ballots or absentee ballots were used by Democratic voters in greater numbers than Republicans in the 2020 election, as many people avoided in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic.
Florida Republicans used mail-in voting slightly more than Democrats in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 general elections. But in November, Democrats submitted 2.2 million mail-in ballots compared with 1.5 million from Republicans, state records show, after Trump falsely asserted for months that mail voting was rife with fraud.

In March, Georgia's Republican governor signed a law that tightened absentee ballot identification requirements, restricted ballot drop-box use and allowed a Republican-controlled state agency to take over local voting operations. 
Democrats and voting rights advocates sued Georgia over the measure, saying it was aimed at disenfranchising Black voters, who helped propel Biden to the presidency and deliver Democrats two U.S. Senate victories in Georgia in January that gave them control of the chamber. Top U.S. companies also decried Georgia's law, and Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game out of the state in protest.

China's spectacular economic and military rise over the past 40 years is among the most significant geopolitical events of recent history, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.
The West has struggled to come up with an agreed policy on China and has flipflopped over the years from seeing China as a lucrative source of investment - for example in U.S. government bonds - to seeing China as a threat to global stability and avoiding its 5G technology.
Asked by the BBC if the West should pull back from Chinese investment, Blinken said the United States was not trying to hold China back or contain it but that the West wanted to uphold the rules-based international order formed after World War Two.
""I think we have to be very careful about exactly what the nature is of that investment,"" Blinken told the BBC in an interview when asked about huge amounts of Chinese investment in the West. 
""If it is investing in strategic industries, strategic assets that's something that countries need to look at very carefully.""
He added though: ""Another thing is to say: 'We're not doing any business'. That's not what we're saying.""

While China's re-emergence has concerned the West, China was for centuries one of the most influential economies on earth.
Chinese per capita income was higher than that of Europe from the 10th century to early 15th century and it was the world’s biggest economy for several centuries thereafter, according to the OECD.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Liz Cheney warned on Wednesday that her Republican Party is ""at a turning point"" as it prepares to try to remove her from leadership for rejecting former President Donald Trump's false claims the election was stolen from him.
The No. 3 House Republican's warning came in an opinion column published in the Washington Post as top members of her party, including Trump and No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, publicly endorsed Representative Elise Stefanik for Cheney's job as chair of the party's conference. A vote could come as early as next Wednesday.
""Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work - confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,"" Cheney said in the column.
""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution,"" Cheney said.
Trump flexed his muscles anew this week, releasing seven public statements in three days reiterating his false claims that President Joe Biden's 7 million vote margin of victory was the result of fraud, and attacking Republicans including Cheney and Senator Mitt Romney who rejected him.
Multiple courts, as well as state and federal election officials, rejected Trump's false claims of widespread fraud. But Republican-controlled state legislatures are using Trump's claims to justify legislation imposing new restrictions on voting.
Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger earlier on Wednesday praised Cheney for standing by her criticism of Trump for his fiery Jan. 6 speech, in which he urged his followers to ""fight"" his election defeat immediately before hundreds of them launched a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.
""They are trying to remove Liz for telling you the truth, consistently,"" said Kinzinger, who like Cheney voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Capitol riot.
The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page also urged Republicans not to oust her.
""Purging Liz Cheney for honesty would diminish the party,"" it said in a Wednesday opinion piece.
Democratic President Joe Biden said a ""mini-revolution"" over identity appeared to be underway in the Republican Party.
""Republicans are further away from trying to figure out who they are and what they stand for than I thought they would be at this point,"" he told reporters at the White House.

Stefanik, a 36-year-old New York state Republican whose status in the party rose after she aggressively defended Trump during congressional hearings ahead of his 2019 impeachment, also has Trump's support.
Trump spoke with Stefanik by phone on Wednesday, said a source familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""House Republicans need to be solely focused on taking back the House in 2022 and fighting against Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi and President Biden's radical socialist agenda, and Elise Stefanik is strongly committed to doing that, which is why Whip Scalise has pledged to support her for Conference Chair,"" Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine said in a statement. 
Cheney's office did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. 
During Trump's presidency, Republicans lost control of both chambers of Congress. They are now looking to oust narrow Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate in 2022's midterm elections.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday told an interviewer that Cheney's repeated criticism of Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election were distracting Republican messaging against Biden, who won the November election and became president on Jan. 20.
Cheney, 54, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, held off an initial challenge to her leadership position earlier this year after joining Kinzinger and eight other House Republicans in impeaching Trump.
Stefanik lobbied other members by phone about Cheney's job on Tuesday, according to the person familiar with the situation. The source said Stefanik told colleagues she would run for election to the position if Cheney stepped down, adding that lawmakers on both sides of the caucus have been receptive.
""Elise Stefanik is a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair,"" Trump, who is weighing another run for president in 2024, said in a statement on Wednesday.
House Republican aides have said they believe Cheney is unlikely to resign.

 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s oversight board on Wednesday decided to uphold the company's suspension of Trump, a move that followed the Capitol riot by his supporters that left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. 
Cheney, Wyoming's only House member, won re-election with 69% of the vote in November. But multiple Republican hopefuls, including two state legislators, have said they plan to launch primary challenges against her next year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. legislative proposal to allocate about $110 billion for basic and advanced technology research and science in the face of rising competitive pressure from China will be debated by the Senate Commerce Committee on May 12, sources said on Wednesday.
The bipartisan ""Endless Frontier"" bill would authorize most of the money, $100 billion, over five years to invest in basic and advanced research, commercialization, and education and training programs in key technology areas, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, advanced communications, biotechnology and advanced energy. 
The bill had been expected to be considered on April 28, but was delayed after more than 230 amendments were filed for consideration. Senate Democrats and Republicans are moving closer to reaching agreement. A congressional aide said ""there has been very encouraging progress toward a deal.""
The measure, sponsored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, Republican Senator Todd Young and others, would also authorize another $10 billion to designate at least 10 regional technology hubs and create a supply chain crisis-response program to address issues like the shortfall in semiconductor chips harming auto production.
Many lawmakers want to use the legislation to advance other priorities and attach additional proposals, and some sought to use the bill to speed the deployment of thousands of self-driving cars.

Republican Representative Mike Gallagher, another sponsor, warned earlier that U.S. superiority in science and technology is at risk. ""The Chinese Communist Party has used decades of intellectual property theft and industrial espionage to close this technological gap in a way that threatens not only our economic security, but also our way of life,"" he said.
Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, said lawmakers are also likely this month to vote on approving at least $37 billion to fund programs to boost U.S. semiconductor production that was authorized under a law enacted in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A police officer who was injured when hundreds of supporters of former President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol pleaded with U.S. lawmakers not to ""downplay"" the day's violence that killed five, including a fellow officer.
""I struggle daily with the emotional anxiety of having survived such a traumatic event but I also struggle with the anxiety of hearing those who continue to downplay the events of that day,"" Washington Metropolitan police officer Mike Fanone said in an open letter on Wednesday.
""The indifference ... is disgraceful,"" said Fanone, who was beaten by a pro-Trump mob and tasered several times in the back of his neck.
Fanone did not mention any legislators by name. Trump and other prominent Republicans, including Senator Ron Johnson and Representative Matt Gaetz, have falsely claimed the events of Jan. 6 were largely non-violent or perpetuated by antifa activists trying to make Trump look bad.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that about half of Republicans believe those false claims.
Hundreds of Trump’s supporters, mobilized by his false claims the 2020 election was stolen, climbed walls of the Capitol and smashed windows to gain entry while lawmakers were inside voting to certify President Joe Biden’s victory.
The rioters - many of them sporting Trump campaign gear and waving flags - included known white supremacist groups such as the Proud Boys.
Since the attack, Trump, many of his allies within the Republican Party and right-wing media personalities have publicly painted a picture of the day’s events jarringly at odds with reality.
In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said the rioters posed “zero threat.”

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s oversight board said on Wednesday that the company did not answer questions about whether its algorithms amplified inflammatory posts by then-U.S. President Donald Trump and contributed to the deadly siege on the Capitol in January.
The board recommended that Facebook review how it might have potentially contributed to the violence and the false narrative of election fraud.
Many Democrats and other critics have said Trump’s posts helped fuel the attack, which led to five deaths. Facebook indefinitely banned Trump from posting in the wake of the violence and asked for further guidance from the oversight board, a 20-person panel funded by the company to review content moderation decisions.
The board found Facebook’s indefinite suspension of Trump’s account was arbitrary because it did not follow a clear published procedure. It called on the company to develop new rules within six months that would lead to either Trump’s reinstatement or some other penalty. Kicking the decision on what to do with Trump back to Facebook drew condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum. 
The company’s role in promoting posts by Trump is important to understand, the board said, because measures short of banning his account could have been enough to limit the risk of violence. Facebook for years has been criticized for designing its News Feed algorithms in ways that promote divisive and inflammatory content. 
But the question about whether any internal analysis had been conducted since January was among seven out of 46 questions that Facebook declined to answer.
""This makes it difficult for the Board to assess whether less severe measures, taken earlier, may have been sufficient to protect the rights of others,"" the decision stated. 
The board did not describe possible alternatives to suspending Trump, but Facebook and other social media companies have previously blocked users from re-sharing some problematic posts on their services or shown warnings to viewers before or next to such content.
Yael Eisenstat, a researcher on technology and democracy who was previously global head of elections integrity operations for political ads at Facebook, said it was clear the social network's features played a role in sparking the attack.
""We're diverting time and attention away from holding Facebook accountable for its designs and policies,"" Eisenstat told reporters on Wednesday of the focus on Trump's ban.

Suspending heads of state or high-ranking government officials that have repeatedly posted problematic messages is fine because they “have a greater power to cause harm than other people,” according to the board. But the suspension should be “for a determinate period sufficient to protect against imminent harm,” which could include a permanent ban, the board concluded. 
BuzzFeed reported last month that Facebook recently created a report on how it failed to curb ""Stop the Steal"" groups on Facebook that falsely claimed widespread election fraud. Facebook told BuzzFeed it was not a definitive report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are expected to try to remove Liz Cheney from their party leadership for denouncing former President Donald Trump's false claim the election was stolen from him, said two Republican congressional sources.
One of the sources said they could vote as early as May 12, their next scheduled meeting after a two-week break.
The No. 3 House Republican and the 54-year-old daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, she survived a similar rebellion early in the year. 
Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting a deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The then-Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said her criticism of Trump's false election claim had become a distraction from party messaging against Democratic President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in November and took office in January.
""There's no concern about how she voted on impeachment,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""It's more concern about the job ability ... and what's our best step forward that we can all work together instead of attacking one another.""
Prior to the interview, McCarthy was caught on microphone saying he had ""lost confidence"" in Cheney, Axios reported. It released audio of the recording.
A Cheney spokesman replied to McCarthy's interview with his own statement: ""This is about whether the Republican Party is going to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and attempt to whitewash what happened on Jan 6. Liz will not do that. That is the issue.""
Neither McCarthy's nor Cheney's offices responded to queries about the expected vote to remove her from leadership.
Several Republicans have been floated as a possible replacement for Cheney, should she lose her position, among them New York Republican Elise Stefanik, who gained prominence for her defense of Trump at impeachment hearings ahead of his first impeachment in 2019. 
Trump this week lashed out at Cheney in a statement after she said, without naming him, that anyone who claimed the 2020 election had been stolen was ""poisoning our democratic system.""
The expected House Republican Conference vote is only the latest skirmish in a Republican civil war between Trump supporters and those who worry that his repeated false election claims could undermine their ability to reclaim control of the House and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.

Cheney, of Wyoming, survived a February party conference ballot with 145 caucus members voting to keep her in her role and 61 calling for her removal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday asked a judge to create a process for reviewing evidence seized from the home and office of Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former lawyer, as part of a probe into his business dealings in Ukraine.
In a court filing, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan to appoint a ""special master"" to review communications taken from Giuliani's devices and ensure that ""potentially privileged materials"" are not viewed by investigators.
A special master is typically a respected lawyer, like a retired judge, given the responsibility of reviewing evidence and making recommendations about how it should be handled. The process is intended to protect the confidentiality of discussions between lawyers and their clients for the legitimate purpose of seeking legal advice.
Such an appointment would ""promote the perception of fairness,"" the prosecutors told Oetken, noting that a special master was appointed to do a similar review of materials seized from another Trump lawyer, Michael Cohen, in 2018. 
Giuliani's lawyer, Bob Costello, declined to comment. He told Reuters last week that he and prosecutors had discussed appointing a special master. 
Giuliani is expected to file a formal response to the Justice Department's request, according to the court filing.
FBI agents seized more than 10 cellphones and computers from Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office in raids on Wednesday, according to Costello, who read the search warrant to a Reuters reporter.
U.S. investigators are seeking to review Giuliani's phones and computers for communications with more than a dozen people, including former Ukrainian officials and two Florida-based businessmen who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on now-President Joe Biden, according to a warrant reviewed by Reuters.
According to the warrant, investigators are looking for evidence that Giuliani acted as an unregistered foreign agent, a violation of lobbying laws.

Giuliani said in a statement following the raids that his ""conduct as a lawyer and a citizen was absolutely legal and ethical.""
Giuliani has not formally been accused of any wrongdoing, but federal prosecutors have been investigating the former New York mayor and federal prosecutor for nearly 1-1/2 years over his Ukrainian business dealings while Trump's attorney. In 2019, a grand jury subpoena was issued for his financial records.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Florida congressman's decision to run for governor Tuesday put another Democratic U.S. House of Representatives seat at risk, as the party braces for possibly losing the majority next year and with it the ability to pass President Joe Biden's agenda.
Representative Charlie Crist, elected in 2016 to what previously had been a Republican-held seat, on Tuesday launched a challenge to Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, seen as a contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2024.
Crist joined an exodus of prominent House Democrats from competitive districts as the party fights to keep its narrow six-seat majority in next year's midterm congressional elections.
Republicans are trying to build on their 2020 gains to win back a majority in the House and possibly in the 50-50 Senate next year. Winning a majority in either chamber could allow Republicans to block Biden's legislative agenda.
The Republican Party on Tuesday added 10 House Democrats to their target list of 57 seats they plan to focus on in next year's House elections.
That's almost triple the 21 Republican-held seats that the Democrats' congressional campaign arm is taking aim at.
Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in midterm congressional elections.
""Republicans are on offense all across the country,"" Representative Tom Emmer, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party's House campaign arm, said in a statement announcing the 10 additional targets.
All 10 are in states such as New York and California that are expected to lose House seats when the once-a-decade process of redrawing electoral maps based on new population data takes place next year.
Population gains for states such as Texas, North Carolina and Florida, where Republicans control the legislatures, could boost their chances of recapturing the House via redistricting.
Redistricting helped Crist win his seat in 2016, but now the Republican-run Florida legislature will redraw the map.
""It may be changed in such a way to make it less Democratic. I’d imagine redistricting factors in Crist’s decision to run for governor,"" said Kyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia. 
Last week, Representative Cheri Bustos, former chief of the House Democrats' campaign arm, said she would be retiring from the House at the end of her term. She represents a northwestern Illinois district that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.
Bustos had advised Democrats on how to win over Trump voters, and moderate Democrats from Trump districts helped the party to victory in the House elections of 2018. But several of the same moderates lost re-election last year, when Democrats lost 13 House seats, and Bustos' own margin of victory narrowed to just four percentage points.

Two other Democrats from battleground districts, Representatives Filemon Vela of Texas and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, are also retiring, and Representative Tim Ryan is running for the Senate seat from Ohio now held by retiring Republican Senator Rob Portman. Three Republicans from solidly Republican districts are also retiring.
Democrats missed a chance over the weekend to grow their House majority when they were shut out of the runoff in a special election for the House seat formerly held by Representative Ron Wright of Texas, who died of COVID-19.

NORFOLK, Va. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Monday called on wealthy Americans and corporations to pay their ""fair share"" to fund free community college and other benefits for workers as he promoted his sweeping jobs and safety-net plans in Virginia. 
Speaking at Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) Community College in the port city of Norfolk, Biden said his proposed expansion of the U.S. public education system would rebalance the economy and benefit lower-income Americans.
The United States could provide two free years of post-secondary education by raising the top income tax rate to the level it was in 2001, Biden said. He has proposed increasing the top marginal rate for the wealthiest Americans to 39.6% from 37%.
""The choice is about who the economy serves. And so I plan on giving tax breaks to the working-class folks and making everybody pay their fair share,"" he said.
The Democratic president faces significant opposition from Republicans to his tax and spending plans, even with his promise that individuals making less than $400,000 annually will not be affected. Democrats hold slim majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. 
Biden has vowed to work with lawmakers from both parties, but no Republicans voted for his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, the biggest legislative achievement of Biden's presidency so far.
He may have less than two years to fulfill his big campaign promises if Republicans win control of one or both chambers of Congress in the November 2022 election.
The president and top administration officials are traveling the country to stir up enthusiasm for his proposals in the hopes that public support will translate to Republican votes in Congress.
On Monday, Biden, joined by his wife, community college professor Jill Biden, reviewed science projects with a class of fifth-grade students at an elementary school in nearby Yorktown before visiting the community college. The students had clear shields in front of their desks as a guard against the coronavirus.
EXPANDING FREE SCHOOLING
The school visits are part of a tour to sell Biden's $2.3 trillion plan to rebuild roads, broadband and other infrastructure, and a social-spending package that includes $1 trillion on education and childcare over 10 years and $800 billion in tax credits aimed at middle- and low-income families.
The second plan would expand America's 13 years of free public schooling at both ends, adding two years of preschool for 3-and 4-year olds and two years of community college for those who have completed high school.
Funded by higher taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans, the two proposals taken together would amount to the biggest domestic spending initiative since the 1960s.
""It is paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1% pay their fair share,"" Biden said.
Biden and other advocates promote community college as an affordable, accessible gateway to a wide range of careers, from nursing to advanced manufacturing. 
During the United States' industrial heyday in the 20th century, workers could easily find factory jobs that paid a middle-class wage with only a high school degree or less.
But globalization and automation have spurred employers to demand a higher level of skills, including deeper technical knowledge and broader critical-thinking abilities, according to Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. 
Now, two out of three U.S. jobs require some sort of education or training beyond high school. 

Community colleges typically provide two years of education, leading to either an associate's degree or a start on a four-year college degree. 
Roughly 11.8 million students were enrolled in 1,044 U.S. community colleges in 2019, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. Tuition averaged $3,770 a year, about one-third of the cost of a four-year public college.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he has resurrected a plan to raise refugee admissions this year to 62,500 after drawing a wave of criticism from supporters for initially keeping the refugee cap at a historically low level.
A Democrat, Biden formally reversed himself just two weeks after his administration announced it would keep the cap at the 15,000 level set by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, an immigration hawk. 
In a statement, Biden said his action ""erases the historically low number set by the previous administration of 15,000, which did not reflect America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees.""
""It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin,"" he said.
Soon after taking office in January, Biden pledged to ramp up the program but then surprised allies when he opted to stick with the lower cap out of concern over bad optics, given the rising number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border with Mexico, U.S. officials have said.
Biden's flip-flopping drew the ire of refugee advocates and some Democratic lawmakers. 
Trump steadily slashed the size of the refugee program during his term in office, and Biden officials say the cuts have made quickly raising admissions more difficult. 
But the refugee program is distinct from the asylum system for migrants. Refugees come from all over the world, many fleeing conflict. They undergo extensive vetting while still overseas to be cleared for entry to the United States, unlike migrants who arrive at a U.S. border and then request asylum.
The allocations for the increased cap matched an earlier plan Biden sent to Congress, according to a memo signed by Biden. The memo said there would be 22,000 spots for refugees from Africa, 6,000 from East Asia, 4,000 from Europe and Central Asia, 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 13,000 from South Asia. Another 12,500 unallocated spots will also be available. 
Biden said it was doubtful the United States would be able to welcome a total of 62,500 refugees by the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, or reach a goal of 125,000 admissions next year. 
""The sad truth is that we will not achieve 62,500 admissions this year. We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It will take some time, but that work is already under way,"" he said.
A White House official said Biden now wanted to raise the cap regardless of capacity limitations to ""send a very clear message that refugee processing is a critical part of America's place in the world,"" acknowledging the initial lower announcement ""did not send the right message.""
Delays in Biden's decisionmaking on the issue led to hundreds of canceled flights for refugees already cleared to travel to the United States, often after years of waiting, refugee groups said.

Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of the resettlement organization Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement that advocacy groups were breathing a ""sigh of relief"" following the announcement on Monday, even though meeting the high target would be ""daunting.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to make her mark by naming a new supervisor for a major U.S. banking regulator that Democrats say was too friendly to large banks under the Trump administration, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Yellen is expected to name Michael Hsu as the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates the country's large banks. Hsu is currently associate director of the Fed's bank supervision and regulation division, which shares responsibility for monitoring the nation's largest banks. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the move.
The move will allow the Biden administration to overhaul the leadership of the agency, which Democrats say has not done enough to protect consumers.
Hsu will replace Blake Paulson, the current acting head and a long-time OCC official who rose to the acting role under the Trump administration. 
The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
While top posts at places like the Securities and Exchange Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have permanent leadership or nominees in waiting from President Joe Biden, the OCC has gone without leadership picked by the new administration.
Democrats have fought over the best leader for the agency, which they believe could play a key role in addressing wealth inequality and racial injustice problems.
Michael Barr, a University of Michigan Law School professor and former Treasury official under President Barack Obama was under consideration for the post, as was Mehrsa Baradaran, law professor at the University of California's Irvine School of Law.

Democrats and the Biden administration have yet to coalesce around a single candidate, though, and a slim majority in the U.S. Senate means every Democrat would likely need to back a particular nominee for them to be confirmed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday said former President Donald Trump was ""poisoning our democratic system"" with his persistent false claims that his November election defeat was the result of fraud.
U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a Trump critic, assailed him in a tweet, risking further raising the ire of the former president's allies in their Republican Party. 
""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system,"" Cheney tweeted without mentioning Trump by name. 
But earlier on Monday, Trump in a statement appeared to be trying to redefine the term ""the big lie,"" adopted by his critics, in the way he commandeered the phrase ""fake news"" during his presidency.
""The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!"" Trump said. 
President Joe Biden defeated Trump by more than 7 million votes, and Trump's claims of fraud at the time were repeatedly rejected by courts and state and federal election authorities.
Opinion polls show large numbers of Republican voters accept Trump's claims of fraud, which helped spark the deadly Jan. 6 riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol, an unsuccessful attempt to stop the certification of Biden's victory.
Six in 10 Republicans also believe Trump's false claim the election was stolen and the same proportion of Republicans think he should run again in 2024, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in March.
Cheney survived an effort by Trump allies to oust her as House Republican Conference chairwoman this year after joining nine other House Republicans to vote for his impeachment on Jan. 13.
""PREDICTION: she'll be out of her GOP leadership role by month’s end!"" Texas Republican Lance Gooden tweeted over the weekend. Other Republicans have risen to Cheney's defense, including Senator Susan Collins.

Americans may be hearing much more from Trump this week, if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday decides to lift a suspension of his account put in place after the Capitol riot.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fate of the United States is ""inextricably linked with the rest of the world's,"" new U.S. aid chief Samantha Power said on Monday, in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump's focus on ""America First"" policies and slashing foreign aid.
Addressing staff on her first day as head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Power sought to tie foreign aid to global and domestic policy challenges such as immigration, climate change and the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.
""With the world battling a different plague, Americans see what you all have long understood: that this country's fate is inextricably linked with the rest of the world's,"" said Power, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017 under former President Barack Obama.
Power described climate change, authoritarian governments, and poverty and violence fueling migration at the southern U.S. border as some of the ""the world's most pressing challenges.""
""The truth is: none of these challenges is distinct. They all feed into and feed off of one another,"" she said. 
President Joe Biden's administration has sought to signal a sharp break with Trump's go-it-alone approach by re-engaging with allies and pushing multilateral diplomacy.

During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, Power also described foreign aid as an essential tool in counteracting the growing global influence of China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday proposed a rule to slash the use of a potent climate-warming gas commonly used in refrigerators and air conditioners by 85% over the next 15 years, a move it said will play a big part in U.S. plans to halve its greenhouse gas emissions this decade.
The proposal to curb the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) would keep the equivalent of 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere over that period, it said, a climate impact similar to preventing the combustion of a trillion tons of coal.
“By phasing down HFCs, which can be hundreds to thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the planet, EPA is taking a major action to help keep global temperature rise in check,"" said EPA Administrator Michael Regan. 
The proposal would sets annual “allocations” for each U.S. HFC producer and importer that gradually decline over time. It arises from a law passed by Congress in December 2020 that directed the EPA to issue regulations phasing down HFC production and imports.
The EPA said the move will contribute significantly to U.S. President Joe Biden's broader climate goals, which include reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 - a target he announced last month at a U.S.-hosted international climate summit.
Biden campaigned on a promise to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 to help the planet avert the worst impacts of global warming.
The proposal to cut HFC use won the support of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute trade group for providing the industry with clear targets. 
Some companies had already moved to alternative refrigerants with lower global-warming potential, along with so-called ""natural refrigerants"" such as ammonia and propane. 
""EPA’s action will help create the certainty necessary for U.S. companies to maintain their natural technological advantage in the global HFC marketplace,"" said AHRI President and CEO Stephen Yurek. 
Karen Meyers, vice president of the Rheem Manufacturing Company, a member of another trade group called Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, said the company will work with the EPA as the industry moves ""to next generation compounds and user technologies and improving refrigerant management.""

Previously popular refrigerants like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) were banned decades ago under a global treaty called the Montreal Protocol after scientists learned they were depleting the ozone layer.
Biden issued an executive order earlier this year seeking to ask Congress to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the 1987 protocol which calls for a phase down of HFCs. The EPA proposal would put the United States on track to achieve the goals of that amendment if Congress decides to ratify it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee chair is pressing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to explain how it failed to anticipate the violence of Jan. 6, despite having contact with several members of the far right Proud Boys in the months before the insurrection.
On Monday, the committee chair, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, wrote to FBI director Christopher Wray asking whether the agency had adequately pushed its sources in the extremist group to understand their plans before the Capitol attack that sought to block the certification of Joe Biden’s election as president.
Durbin’s letter came after Reuters reported last week that the FBI had received information from at least four sources in the Proud Boys over the years since 2019. The Judiciary Committee has oversight of the FBI.
“Given the FBI’s apparent relationship with Proud Boys sources,” the Illinois senator asked Wray, “why did the FBI fail to detect the threat that the Proud Boys and other similar militia violent extremists posed to the Capitol on January 6?”
The FBI did not immediately respond Monday to questions about the letter.
In court filings, prosecutors have described the Proud Boys as among the instigators of the fatal riot on Jan. 6, in which extremists sought to keep Donald Trump in office despite his electoral defeat. At least 18 Proud Boys have been arrested on charges ranging from conspiracy to assaulting police officers. At least six others associated with or accompanying the group have been charged.
As Reuters reported last week, Proud Boys leader Joseph Biggs declined to discuss his plans for Jan. 6 when the news agency interviewed him two days before the Capitol riot. But he said he would have told an FBI agent he knew, if he’d been asked.
Citing that report, Durbin asked Wray: “Did the FBI ask its Proud Boys sources for their plans for January 6? If not, why not?”
Biggs has said in court filings that he frequently reported information to the FBI about “Antifa,” a left-wing movement criticized by Trump and his followers. Biggs is now charged with conspiracy in the riot. He is appealing a judge’s ruling that he be detained until trial.
Proud Boys leaders maintain they never spoke with the FBI about the group itself. Instead, they say, they often shared information about Antifa members or, in other cases, told the federal agency about routes for planned marches.

Even before Jan. 6, the Proud Boys had become a well-known right-wing group that calls itself “Western chauvinist” and often engages in street fighting and violence.

(Reuters) - Prominent Asian-American business leaders launched a $250 million initiative on Monday to support an array of Asian American and Pacific Islander causes, vowing to create a national infrastructure for a community that has faced an increasing number of racial attacks.
The Asian American Foundation will invest its initial funding - described by organizers as the largest-ever philanthropic effort to support the AAPI community - in three key areas: anti-hate programs, education, and data and research.
The foundation's board, which has committed $125 million over five years, is chaired by Li Lu, founder of hedge fund Himalaya Capital, and includes billionaires Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo, and Joseph Tsai, co-founder of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, among other executives.
Companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and the National Basketball Association have contributed another $125 million, according to the foundation.
An online launch event on Tuesday will feature former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
The organization means to fill in gaps that have long constrained AAPI community organizations, which receive less than 0.5% of charitable foundation-giving even though Asian Americans represent about 6% of the U.S. population.
The effort bolsters the emergence of Asian Americans as a political and cultural force, particularly in the wake of a spate of anti-Asian hate crimes in the last year. 
The 23-million-strong community is the country's fastest-growing demographic group and saw a massive surge in voter turnout in last year's presidential election.
An Atlanta-area mass shooting in March, which included six women of Asian descent among the eight dead, further galvanized national advocates.
The organization's board includes Joseph Bae, co-president of private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR); Peng Zhao, CEO of market maker Citadel Securities; Sheila Lirio Marcelo, founder of Care.com; and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. 
Sonal Shah, a former Obama administration official, will serve as the foundation's president and hold a board seat.
The group will support organizations that combat hate; help create school curricula that reflect the AAPI community's historical contribution to the United States; finance efforts in the arts, film and media to ensure the Asian-American experience is included; and invest in data-driven research to produce better policymaking and advocacy.
The foundation has already issued several grants, including $1 million to support the work of Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that began compiling a database of attacks last year. Experts say federal efforts to report hate crimes suffer from undercounting and inconsistent standards.
In an interview, Shah said the foundation will counteract the ""model minority myth"" that Asian Americans are successful and do not need assistance. Only 1.5% of U.S. corporate officers are of Asian descent, she noted, and many Asian Americans face discrimination, poverty and marginalization.
""We want our communities to be seen,"" Shah said. ""We want to make sure they have a voice.""

The foundation has lined up an advisory board of prominent AAPI figures who will help promote its work, including former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, actor Daniel Dae Kim and CNN hosts Lisa Ling and Fareed Zakaria.

(Reuters) -U.S. investigators are seeking to review Rudy Giuliani's phones and computers for communications with more than a dozen people, including a high-ranking prosecutor in Ukraine, according to a warrant executed at his apartment this week. 
They also are searching for communications with any U.S. government official or employee relating to Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted by the Trump administration in 2019, the warrant says. 
Agents seized more than 10 cell phones and computers from Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office in raids on Wednesday, according to his lawyer, Bob Costello, who read the search warrant to a Reuters reporter.
According to the warrant, investigators are looking for evidence that Giuliani acted as an unregistered foreign agent, a violation of lobbying laws.
Giuliani said in a statement following the raids that his ""conduct as a lawyer and a citizen was absolutely legal and ethical."" A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment.
The list of the people identified in the warrant includes:
LEV PARNAS AND IGOR FRUMAN 
Ukrainian-born Parnas and Belarus-born Fruman are two Florida-based businessmen who helped Giuliani dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter before the 2020 presidential election and push to remove Yovanovitch.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused Parnas and Fruman of using a shell company to make an illegal $325,000 donation to a committee supporting Trump's re-election. The men have pleaded not guilty to violating campaign finance laws and other charges. A trial is scheduled for October.
A lawyer for Fruman declined to comment. A lawyer for Parnas did not respond to a request for comment.
PETRO POROSHENKO 
A confectionary magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, Poroshenko took power in 2014 and served as the country's president until 2019. At Giuliani's direction, Parnas and Fruman met Poroshenko in February 2019, while he was still in office, and pressed him to announce investigations into Hunter Biden and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election in exchange for a state visit, the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post reported. 
Poroshenko's office told Reuters on Friday that he held two meetings with Giuliani in his capacity as President Donald Trump's ""special envoy"" during which they discussed Russian aggression, fighting disinformation and how to strengthen the alliance between Kyiv and Washington. 
GYUNDUZ MAMEDOV 
Mamedov, who currently serves as a high-ranking prosecutor in Ukraine, was a key intermediary in Giuliani's efforts to press Ukraine to open investigations that would tarnish Biden, according to NBC News.
He played a role in setting up a meeting between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials, NBC reported. A spokesperson for Mamedov had no immediate comment on investigators looking at communications with Giuliani. 
VIKTOR SHOKIN
Shokin became Ukraine's general prosecutor in February 2015 and led an investigation into the energy company Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Biden's son Hunter was a board member from 2014 to 2019.
Shokin was removed from his job in 2016 following accusations of corruption by Western diplomats.
Giuliani told Reuters he met with Shokin over Skype in late 2018. 
Shokin could not be reached for comment on Friday, according to his lawyer. 
YURIY LUTSENKO
Lutsenko succeeded Shokin as general prosecutor. In 2019, Lutsenko told John Solomon, a U.S. columnist, that he had evidence related to the Bidens and Burisma. Later that year Lutsenko told Reuters he found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden’s son in his relationship with the energy firm.
Giuliani told Reuters in 2019 that he met with Lutsenko twice early that year. 
""I didn't correspond with Giuliani. I didn't even have his phone (number),"" Lutsenko told Reuters on Friday. ""We didn't communicate in any regular way.""
KOSTIANTYN KULYK
Kulyk, a former Ukrainian prosecutor, also worked on the country's investigations into Burisma. Giuliani told Reuters he met with Kulyk in Paris in 2019. Kulyk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. 
GLIB ZAGORIY
A Ukrainian businessman and former lawmaker, Zagoriy attended a meeting between Giuliani and Lutsenko in January 2019, according to documents released by the U.S. State Department. Zagoriy could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. 
DAVID CORREIA
Correia, another Florida businessman, pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and duping investors in Fraud Guarantee, a company he founded with Parnas that paid Giuliani $500,000. A lawyer for Correia did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
VICTORIA TOENSING AND JOE DIGENOVA
Toensing and diGenova are married Washington lawyers who helped Giuliani represent Trump in his post-election lawsuits. They represented Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, who is fighting extradition from Vienna on U.S. bribery and racketeering charges. FBI agents raided the couple's home earlier this week and seized a cellphone used by Toensing.
Toensing and diGenova did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. 
JOHN SOLOMON

Solomon worked for The Hill, a Washington newspaper and website covering Congress, when he wrote a series of pieces that Yovanovitch testified to Congress were part of a smear campaign against her that Giuliani appeared to be behind. The Hill later said Solomon failed to identify important details about key Ukrainian sources, including the fact that they had been indicted or were under investigation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The United States this week will reunite four migrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Trump administration, U.S. officials said, a small step toward fulfilling a campaign promise by President Joe Biden.
The families will be allowed to enter the United States through an emergency process known as ""humanitarian parole,"" Michelle Brane, who heads a Biden-created task force that aims to reunite separated families, told a call with reporters on Sunday.
""In these cases that we're talking about this week, the children are in the United States and the parents are coming to join them,"" Brane said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is considering whether they could be granted longer-term immigration status, she said.
Lee Gelernt, lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued former President Donald Trump's administration over the separations policy, said his organization did not know how many children remain separated from parents but that the number was likely more than 1,000.
The Biden administration has been grappling in recent months with a sharp rise in migrant crossings at the border, including unaccompanied minors and families with young children, mostly from Central America.
The Trump administration, known for its hardline stance on immigration, adopted a blanket ""zero-tolerance"" policy of prosecuting all unauthorized border crossers in spring 2018, resulting in the mass separation of parents from their children.
Trump reversed the policy that summer amid an international outcry, but advocates and government watchdogs found separations began before the policy and continued after it. In some cases, parents were deported and children remained in the United States with other relatives or sponsors.
Biden has called family separations under Trump a ""human tragedy.""
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who also participated in the call with reporters, declined to provide details about the families, citing privacy concerns, but noted that one is Honduran and another Mexican.

Both have been separated since 2017, he said, adding that the reunifications this week would be ""the first of many.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Texas Republican backed by former President Donald Trump has advanced to a runoff election to fill a U.S. House of Representatives vacancy left by the death of her husband, while Democrats were shut out of the contest.
Susan Wright, whose husband Ron Wright in February became the first sitting member of Congress to die of COVID-19, was the top vote-getter on Saturday in a crowded field of 23 candidates vying to represent the state's 6th Congressional District.
Wright was headed to a runoff against another Republican in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs, a longtime Republican-held district. 
Democrats had hoped to pick up the seat to expand their slim House majority. But they conceded Sunday they had missed the chance.
Wright received 19.2% of the vote, followed by former military fighter pilot Jake Ellzey, another Republican, who drew 13.8%, according to the Texas secretary of state's office. Just 354 votes and less than half a percentage point separated Ellzey from Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez, who was in third place with 13.4%. 
""Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas, but we still have a long way to go,"" Sanchez, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, said in a statement. ""Two Republicans will be competing to represent this congressional district.""
Trump, in a statement, congratulated Wright. ""Susan surged after I gave her an endorsement last week,"" he said. 
A runoff between the top two vote-getters is required since no candidate received a majority in the first round. A runoff date has not yet been set.
    In a bizarre twist on election eve, Wright's campaign asked federal law enforcement authorities to look into reports of robocalls falsely alleging she had murdered her husband.
The election was the first test of the Texas electorate since President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Trump defeated Biden in Texas, a state where Democrats hope to make inroads.
    The outcome may deprive Democrats of their best shot at winning a Republican-held House seat in several special elections scheduled for this year to replace House members who have either died, retired or taken posts in Biden's administration.
    The national Democratic Party did not back any candidate in the contest, although Democrats have made gains in the north Texas district in recent years. Trump won the district by 3 percentage points last year.
    ""Democrats didn't get their people out there, and then to the extent to which they did ... they split up a lot of the Democratic votes,"" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.

Jones said Trump's endorsement, coming just a few days before the election, appeared to have helped Wright. 
There were 10 Democrats in the race, as well as 11 Republicans, an independent and a Libertarian. Every seat in the House counts, as Democrats currently have a narrow six-seat majority and will be battling to keep control of both chambers of Congress in the 2022 mid-term elections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Susan Collins, a leading moderate Republican in the U.S. Congress, warned on Sunday against intolerance of differences within her party and pushed back at intraparty attacks from the right against Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney.
Collins, who won re-election in Maine last year despite a strong Democratic bid to oust her, said she was dismayed that Romney had been booed by fellow Republicans in his home state of Utah, and defended Cheney, who like Romney has been attacked from within the party for criticizing former President Donald Trump.
""We need to have room for a variety of views,"" Collins told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""We are not a party that is led by just one person.""
""I was appalled,"" Collins added, that Romney was booed on Saturday at the Utah Republicans' state organizing convention.
""Mitt Romney is an outstanding senator who served his state and our country well,"" Collins said.
Republicans at the convention narrowly rejected a motion to censure Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, for voting to convict Trump at the former president's two impeachment trials, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 
The newspaper reported that Romney told the crowd, ""I'm a man who says what he means, and you know I was not a fan of our last president's character issues.""
Collins also praised Cheney, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump this year on a charge of incitement of insurrection for a speech he gave before a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 
""Liz Cheney is a woman of strength and conscience, and she did what she thought was right, and I salute her for that,"" Collins said. 
Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican and a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, survived a February attempt to oust her from the House leadership.
In recent days, she has faced renewed pressure from conservatives in her party after she gave Democratic President Joe Biden a fist bump in the House chamber, where he gave a speech to Congress.
Representative Lance Gooden, a conservative Texas Republican, predicted on Saturday that Cheney would be out of her House leadership role by the end of May.
The Senate's third-ranking Republican, John Barrasso, also from Cheney's home state of Wyoming, told ABC's ""This Week"" program that Republicans ""need to get beyond all this and focus on the 2022 elections,"" when asked about pressure to oust Cheney.

Collins and Romney were among seven Senate Republicans who voted in February to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial. A year earlier, Romney was the only Republican to vote to convict Trump on a charge of abuse of power related to the former president's request that Ukraine investigate Biden. The Senate acquitted Trump in both trials.

The campaign of Susan Wright, the widow of the late Representative Ron Wright, said it contacted authorities about the calls. The special election to replace the congressman is on Saturday.
""When we heard reports of this criminal smear of a robocall attacking Susan, we immediately referred the matter to law enforcement and started cooperating with authorities,"" Matt Langston, a consultant to the candidate, said in the statement.
Wright is among 23 candidates running in a Republican-leaning district of north Texas, where Democrats have made gains in recent years.
A conservative party activist with a string of endorsements from Texas Republicans, she was thought by analysts to have the edge in the crowded field even before former President Donald Trump endorsed her this week.
""This is illegal, immoral, and wrong,"" Wright said in a statement. ""There’s not a sewer too deep that some politicians won’t plumb. Imagine it: someone is attacking my late husband, the love of my life, a man who gave me such joy in life.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of Senate Republicans called on the Biden administration on Friday to withdraw what they say is a ""divisive"" education proposal that would place greater emphasis on slavery and the contributions of Black Americans in history and civics lessons taught in U.S. schools.
In the latest salvo of a burgeoning culture war over race in America, 39 Republican lawmakers led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the proposed Education Department policy would divert established school curricula toward a ""politicized and divisive agenda"" fixated on the country's flaws.
""Young Americans deserve a rigorous understanding of civics and American history. They need to understand both our successes and our failures,"" the Republican senators wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona dated April 29. The letter was released on Friday.
""Americans do not need or want their tax dollars diverted from promoting the principles that unite our nation toward promoting radical ideologies meant to divide us.""
A spokesman for the U.S. Education Department said that institutions are acknowledging America's ""legacy of systemic inequities"" and noted that the department welcomes comments on the proposal until May 19.
The lawmakers zeroed in on the proposal's mention of the New York Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project. The initiative, which traces U.S. history from the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in colonial Virginia, was a frequent target for former President Donald Trump, who sought instead to promote ""patriotic"" education.
Tom Cotton, the Republican senator from Arkansas, introduced legislation last June to prohibit the use of federal funds to teach a curriculum linked to the 1619 Project in schools. Since then, Republican state lawmakers in Iowa, Mississippi and several other states have introduced similar bills proposing schools lose state funding for teaching the curriculum.
""No one is pushing laws mandating the teaching of the #1619Project, but Republicans across the U.S. are pushing laws to mandate 'patriotic' education & to prohibit the teaching of the #1619Project"" and about the United State's ""racist past,"" Niklole Hannah-Jones, the journalist who created the project, said on Twitter on Friday.
The letter released on Friday came two days after Senator Tim Scott, the Senate's sole Black Republican, declared that ""America is not a racist country"" in the Republican response to President Joe Biden's address to Congress. Scott also defended a new Republican voting law in Georgia that Democrats have denounced as a return to Jim Crow segregation.
The proposed policy would support teaching that ""reflects the breadth and depth of our nation's diverse history and the vital role of diversity in our nation's democracy,"" according to a notice posted on a government regulation website.
It would encourage schools to adopt projects that incorporate ""the systemic marginalization, biases, inequities and discriminatory policy and practice in American history.""

The Republican Party, which remains fractured after Trump's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, has sought to brand Biden as a divisive leader controlled by leftists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Cheri Bustos, a moderate Midwesterner who led the House of Representatives Democrats' campaign arm in a disappointing 2020 election, will not run for re-election next year, she said on Friday.
The Cook Political Report called Bustos' retirement a ""blow"" to House Democrats' 2022 election prospects and noted that she is ""one of just seven House Democrats representing a seat Donald Trump carried last fall.""
Republicans are trying to build on their 2020 gains to win back control of the House.
Bustos joins two other Democrats and three Republicans so far in announcing they would leave Congress after next year. In addition, Democratic Representative Tim Ryan is running for the Senate seat now held by retiring Republican Senator Rob Portman.
Bustos, 59, a former journalist who has represented a northwestern Illinois district in Congress for a decade, said in a statement that it was time to ""reflect and evaluate what my next chapter might bring.""
The statement said nearly two-thirds of all the legislation she had introduced in the House had been bipartisan.
As a Democrat from Trump country, Bustos worked with Democratic candidates from similar areas in 2018 to get more moderates elected - helping to give Democrats control of the House of Representatives that year.
When Democrats elected Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House in 2019, a handful of moderate Democrats voted for Bustos instead.
But in 2020, as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Bustos and other party leaders steered the Democrats to an unexpectedly poor result in the House, even as Democrat Joe Biden won the White House. 
Instead of gaining ground, Democrats saw their House majority pared and it currently is just six seats. Bustos resigned as DCCC chair after the election. 

Bustos herself won re-election by just four points compared to a 24-point margin in 2018. 
Illinois will lose a seat in the 435-member House based on the results of the 2020 census.

Trump declared a national emergency in 2019 in an effort to redirect funding to build a wall along the U.S. southern border.
President Joe Biden issued a proclamation on Jan. 20, his first day in office, ordering a freeze on border wall projects and directing a review of the legality of its funding and contracting methods. 
""The Department of Defense is proceeding with canceling all border barrier construction projects paid for with funds originally intended for other military missions and functions such as schools for military children, overseas military construction projects in partner nations, and the National Guard and Reserve equipment account,"" Pentagon spokesman Jamal Brown said in a statement. 
Brown said the returned funds would be used for deferred military construction projects. 
It was not immediately clear how much would be returned to the military, but it was likely to be several billion dollars. 
Trump's diversion of funds from the Pentagon had been heavily criticized by lawmakers, who said it put national security at risk and circumvented congress.
In 2019 alone, the military said more than 120 U.S. military construction projects would be adversely affected by Trump's move.

The Department of Homeland Security also announced on Friday that it would take steps to address ""physical dangers resulting from the previous administration’s approach to border wall construction."" 
It said it would repair the Rio Grande Valley's flood barrier system, which it said the wall construction under the Trump administration had blown large holes into, as well as remediate soil erosion in San Diego along a wall segment.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - President Joe Biden visited an Amtrak train station on Friday to promote his $1.9 trillion infrastructure proposal, saying the United States is ""way behind"" in improving its transportation grid and needs to do so to keep up with China.
Biden spent time on an Amtrak car at Philadelphia's 30th Street train station before climbing down to give remarks. It was a moment of nostalgia for Biden, who as a U.S. senator commuted by train for years between his home town of Wilmington, Delaware, and Washington.
He was introduced in Philadelphia by Amtrak CEO William J. Flynn as ""perhaps one of Amtrak's most loyal customers.""
The visit was part of Biden's ""Getting America Back on Track Tour,"" a tour he began in Georgia on Thursday, with more travel expected next week. The stops are intended to build popular momentum for his $1.9 trillion infrastructure proposal and a separate $1.8 trillion ""American Families Plan.""
Biden said America's transportation system needs a makeover including more high-speed rail lines like China has developed.
""We’re way behind the rest of the world right now. We need to remember we’re in competition with the rest of the world,"" he said.
The Democrat is asking Congress for $80 billion in spending to improve train service, one of a wide set of initiatives included in multitrillion-dollar infrastructure, climate, childcare and other proposals Biden is trying to maneuver through a sharply divided Congress.
The spending would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations.
Republicans and even some Democratic lawmakers have balked at the price tag.
Former President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in the November election but who remains influential among Republicans, predicted in a phone interview with Fox Business Network on Thursday that higher taxes would prompt some companies to relocate abroad.
Biden has long been associated with Amtrak because of his decades commuting daily on the 90-minute train ride between Washington and his home in Wilmington, Delaware, when he was a U.S. senator. 

The government-funded rail service is asking Congress for $31 billion in funding over the next five years to expand it's Northeast Corridor that runs between Boston to Washington, D.C.

In a statement, Senators Mark Warner, the committee's Democratic chairman, and Marco Rubio, its Republican vice chairman, said they have been aware for nearly five years of the mysterious attacks on U.S. government personnel in Havana, Cuba and elsewhere around the world.
""This pattern of attacking our fellow citizens serving our government appears to be increasing. The Senate Intelligence Committee intends to get to the bottom of this,"" they said.
CNN on Thursday reported that U.S. agencies were investigating two possible incidents that appeared similar to illnesses that affected diplomats and are known as ""Havana syndrome.""
One last year was near the White House, CNN said, and another, previously reported by GQ magazine, sickened a White House official in a nearby Virginia suburb in 2019.
A U.S. government report in December said ""directed"" radio frequency was the most plausible explanation for the symptoms. In February, the State Department said an investigation was still ongoing. 

On Thursday a White House spokeswoman said various departments of President Joe Biden's administration were working on the issue and still evaluating the situation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House Council on Environmental Quality expects to submit a plan for helping clean up the nation's most polluted communities to President Joe Biden within weeks, according to the council's new chair, Brenda Mallory.
The widely anticipated blueprint is intended to help Biden execute a campaign promise to ensure 40% of federal clean energy investment benefits flow to disadvantaged communities, and should be ready by the end of May, she said. 
The council also expects to launch a data mapping tool around that time to help identify those communities, Mallory said. (Click here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-environment-data/how-computer-mapping-could-help-biden-find-and-fix-polluted-neighborhoods-idUSKBN2C014F for more)
""It's a work in progress,"" Mallory told Reuters in an interview this week about the effort.
A Biden executive order on Jan. 27 had set a 120-day deadline for the plan.
She said the discussion around the “Justice 40” initiative includes drawing clean energy investments to areas long burdened by industrial pollution, along with adding protections like improved air quality monitoring, cleanups, and asthma mitigation programs.
Biden has promised to direct trillions of dollars toward a sweeping goal of decarbonizing the nation's economy by 2050, a strategy aimed at fighting global climate change while also reducing pollution from big emitters like oil refineries and fossil fuel-fired power plants. He says the switch to clean energy can create jobs and improve the economy, countering concerns among Republicans that it will slow growth.
The CEO has already taken steps to undo and revise Trump-era policies that aimed to fast-track big energy and manufacturing projects by shortening permit timelines, narrowing the window for community input and reducing the emphasis on weighing a project's climate impacts.
Mallory said Biden has ""significantly elevated"" the CEQ's focus on environmental justice and that companies planning large projects should expect more scrutiny during permitting under the new administration.
""First of all you want to be doing the assessment of what are the impacts that you're causing and what can you do about it before you are even having a conversation with the government,"" she said. 
Mallory also said the CEQ is working to detail how the federal government will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of its own operations, like buildings and vehicle fleets.

In 2019, the federal government emitted nearly 75 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, just over 1% of the national total.

(Reuters) - Body-worn cameras are increasingly being used by U.S. law enforcement agencies and often play a central role in high-profile police killings. But wide disparities remain in how they are employed and when the footage is made public.
HOW MANY POLICE AGENCIES USE BODY-WORN CAMERAS?
Conflicting witness accounts of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown, a Black man, in Ferguson, Missouri, led former President Barack Obama's administration to fund body-worn camera programs across 32 states.
As of 2016, about 47% of the country's 15,328 general-purpose law enforcement agencies had bought the cameras, according to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the most recent study measuring nationwide usage. 
Larger agencies were more likely to adopt the devices. One notable exception is the police department in Portland, Oregon, which ceased its initial body-worn camera pilot program in 2020, citing ""major budget constraints.""
Seven states -- Colorado, Connecticut, New Mexico, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina -- have mandated statewide body-worn camera adoption, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
WHAT RULES DICTATE THE RELEASE OF RECORDINGS? 
States have varying laws governing how recordings from body-worn cameras can be released. At least 12 states, including Massachusetts and West Virginia, did not have laws regulating public access to body-worn camera recordings as of October 2018, leaving it up to agencies to decide how to release the footage, according to the Urban Institute think tank.
Among states that do regulate access, North Carolina has one of the most restrictive laws, requiring anyone seeking a copy of a body-worn camera recording to get court approval. By contrast, a new Colorado law will require recordings to be released to the public within 21 days after the agency receives a complaint of misconduct, with exceptions for privacy concerns or cases where the release would interfere with an investigation.
ARE THE CAMERAS ALWAYS RUNNING?
More than half of the United States had no rule dictating where, when and how body-worn cameras had to be used as of October 2018, the Urban Institute said. Several states have enacted new regulations since then. 
Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York, for example, passed laws in 2020 requiring officers to wear cameras on the job, though the New York law only applies to state police. With some exceptions, such as cases where civilians request that cameras be turned off, the laws require police to record every encounter they have with members of the public.
Average activations of body-worn cameras for police officers in Anaheim, California, ranged from 0% to 72%, according to a 2015 study co-authored by Daniel Lawrence, a policing expert at the Urban Institute. 
HOW IS BODY-WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE USED? 
Audio and video recordings from body-worn cameras are often sought after police killings, including the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin. Prosecutors used Chauvin's body-camera footage to help convince a jury to convict the former officer on April 20.
Almost two-thirds of state prosecutors' offices use body-worn camera video as evidence, according to a 2016 survey by George Mason University's Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy. The study found that 8.3% of offices in jurisdictions with body-worn cameras had used the footage to prosecute police officers, while 92.6% had used it to prosecute private citizens. 
HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE DO THE CAMERAS MAKE?
Officers who wear body cameras consistently appear to have fewer complaints filed against them than officers without cameras, according to a 2020 report by the National Police Foundation that synthesized 10 years of research on the subject.
But a 2017 study in Washington, D.C. found no statistically-significant effects on use of force or complaints.

Civil rights advocates say the timely release of body-worn camera footage, balanced with privacy considerations, is key to holding law enforcement officers accountable. Many police welcome the transparency because the recordings can be used to clear officers accused of racist or violent acts, while others say the videos only offer a partial view of incidents and can skew public reactions.

DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday said he planned to continue talks with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito about infrastructure and jobs, but would not accept a proposal that funded only a fraction of his $2.3 trillion package.
Biden told reporters during a visit to Georgia that he had a good call with Capito, the top Republican on the Senate Public Works Committee, who helped design a $568 billion, five-year Republican infrastructure package as a counteroffer.
He said he had offered to invite her to the White House in coming weeks with other lawmakers she wanted to include.
""She seemed positive about wanting to do something about it and serious about it,"" Biden said, although he said the two sides were still not in agreement on what exactly constituted infrastructure.
""Let's decide on ... what they are prepared to consider as far as what constitutes (infrastructure) ... and then we can figure out how to pay for it,"" Biden told reporters at Dobbins Air Force Base, after a rally in Duluth, Georgia.
Republicans reject Biden's plans to fund child care, home care and other components of what he calls ""human infrastructure"" as unnecessarily expanding government.
Biden said he said it would be a ""no-go"" if Republicans came in with a proposal that covered just a small part of his plans.
""If like last time they come in with one-fourth or one-fifth of what I'm asking and say that's our final offer ... then no, no go,"" he said.
Biden marked his 100th day in office on Thursday with a speech at a drive-in rally in Duluth, Georgia, urging Americans to support his plans to invest a combined $4 trillion to rebuild the U.S. economy to benefit the middle class.
He said the plans would add millions of well-paying jobs and trillions of dollars to economic output in coming years, while helping to reverse decades of systemic racism.
Republicans have also taken aim at tax increases on corporations that Biden has proposed to help fund his plans.
Capito and other Senate Republicans last week unveiled their much smaller proposal for infrastructure spending, which is narrowly focused on more traditional infrastructure projects and broadband access.

The Republican plan would not result in higher taxes but be fully paid for with user fees on electric vehicles and other items, unspent federal funds and possible contributions from state and local governments.

690,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 11:02PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani denied on Thursday he had ever represented a Ukrainian national, a day after federal agents searched his Manhattan apartment and office as part of a probe into his business dealings in Ukraine.
Giuliani said the agents seized seven or eight electronic devices and the search warrant included an allegation that he had failed to register as a foreign agent, a violation of lobbying laws.
""I've never represented a Ukrainian national or official before the United States government,"" Giuliani said in an interview on Fox News.
Federal prosecutors have been investigating Giuliani for nearly 1-1/2 years over his Ukrainian business dealings while serving as Trump's attorney. He has not formally been accused of any wrongdoing. 
Trump criticized the federal investigation into Giuliani on Thursday.
""It’s very, very unfair,"" Trump told Fox Business Network in a telephone interview. ""Rudy is a patriot who loves this country and I don’t know what they’re looking for, what they’re doing. They said it had to do with filing of various papers.""
A spokesman for the Republican former president said in February that Giuliani was not representing Trump in any current legal matters.
Giuliani played a central role in Trump's failed effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat based on false claims of massive voter fraud.
Wednesday's search marked a significant step in the investigators' probe. A 2019 grand jury subpoena for Giuliani's financial records seen by Reuters showed that agents were examining possible money laundering, wire fraud, campaign finance violations, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and violations of the federal Foreign Agents Registration Act.
It marks the latest turn for Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who rose to national prominence following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and who once led the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan that is now probing him.
Giuliani began representing Trump in 2018 amid a federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.
Ahead of the 2020 election, Giuliani led an effort to dig up dirt on Democratic contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Biden defeated Trump and took office earlier this year. Both Biden and his son have denied wrongdoing.
The FBI warned Giuliani in late 2019 that he was the target of a Russian influence operation aimed at circulating falsehoods intended to damage Biden politically, the Washington Post reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Giuliani lawyer Robert Costello did not immediately return a request for comment on the Post story.
Costello said on Wednesday that authorities had seized cellphones and computers and, along with Giuliani's son, Andrew, suggested that the investigation of his client was politically motivated - a charge the White House denied.
Biden said on Thursday he had no notice of the Department of Justice's actions and was making good on his campaign pledge to maintain its independence.

""I made a pledge,"" he told NBC News in an interview. ""I would not interfere in any way. ... I learned about that last night when the rest of the world learned about it.""
Giuliani faces separate legal actions regarding his actions surrounding the November election and the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters - one from a Democratic congressman and another from voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Vice President Mike Pence emerged from seclusion on Thursday for his first public appearance since leaving office and offered a road map for Republicans to win back the White House in 2024 without saying whether he would be a candidate.
Pence spoke for a half hour in Columbia, South Carolina, to the Palmetto Family Council, a religious conservative group. It was his first speech since he and then-President Donald Trump handed over power to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Jan. 20.
Pence appeared in good health at the event, just a few weeks after he underwent a surgical procedure to implant a pacemaker in his chest.
Pence outlined how Republicans took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 after two years of Democrat Barack Obama's presidency.
""We're going to do it again in the next four years,"" said Pence. ""We have the winning agenda and now it's incumbent upon us to take that winning agenda to the American people.""
While he said nothing about whether he would seek high office again, the speech appeared to signal Pence's intention to remain in the Republican conversation as the party tries to rebound from losing the White House and the U.S. Senate in 2020 elections.
Pence and Trump had a bitter ending at the White House after Pence refused Trump's entreaties to try to block the certification in Congress of Biden’s Electoral College win on Jan. 6. That same day pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol and delayed the certification.
Pence attended Biden's inauguration while Trump refused to do so.
Trump advisers say Trump remains disappointed in Pence over the vote certification issue.
Earlier on Thursday, Trump told Fox Business Network that he would consider Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as a potential 2024 running mate should he make another run for president.
For his part, Pence declared to the South Carolina group that he was proud to have served at Trump's side over the past four years, a nod to the powerful role Trump retains in the Republican Party.
""Thank you for the privilege of serving as your vice president and the privilege of serving alongside President Donald Trump. It's the greatest honor of my life,"" he said.

Pence offered heavy criticism of Biden's agenda and spoke fondly of the Trump-Pence administration's record on national security and on the U.S. economy before the coronavirus pandemic threw the United States into recession.

DULUTH, Ga. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden marked his 100th day in office on Thursday thanking Georgia voters for putting Democrats in control of Congress and by promoting his plans to spend trillions of dollars to rebuild the U.S. economy.
At a drive-in rally in Duluth, about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Atlanta, Biden recognized the importance of Democratic victories in Georgia to his agenda. 
""We owe special thanks to the people of Georgia,"" Biden told a crowd watching from cars outside a sports arena due to COVID-19. ""You're helping us to prove that democracy can still deliver for the people."" 
Biden carried the Republican-leaning Southern state in November's presidential election, the first Democrat to do so in 28 years, and the election victories in January of Georgia's two Democratic U.S. senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, secured Democrats control of the Senate.
The president reminded the audience that the votes of Warnock and Ossoff were pivotal to the passage of his $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in March. 
Near the beginning of his remarks, Biden was briefly interrupted by protesters opposed to privately run immigration detention centers. 
Visiting Georgia a day after his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden urged Americans to support his plan to invest a combined $4 trillion in families and infrastructure to rebuild the middle class.
Biden told Congress his plans would add millions of well-paying jobs and trillions of dollars to economic output in coming years, while helping to reverse decades of systemic racism.
Republicans have sharply criticized the tax increases on corporations that Biden has proposed to help fund his plans. 
""In the 21st century, infrastructure isn't just steel and concrete, it's people,"" Biden told the Duluth event, staged by the Democratic National Committee to celebrate his first 100 days in office. 
""Folks, it's only been 100 days,"" Biden said. ""We're working again, we're dreaming again."" 
Georgia has also emerged as a hot spot in a nationwide battle over voting rights. Over 100 U.S. corporations as well as civil rights activists and sports leagues have spoken out against voting rights curbs passed by Georgia's Republican state legislature.
Biden has forcefully opposed the restrictions, calling them ""sick"" and ""un-American."" 
Similar measures are under consideration in other Republican-controlled states, where backers have used former President Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election to push for changes they say are needed to improve election integrity.

Earlier, Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, at their home in the small town of Plains, about 150 miles (240 km) south of Atlanta. 
After limited time on the road due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden is stepping up his travel schedule and plans to visit Pennsylvania and Virginia in coming days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday started talks on a police reform bill, the day after Democratic President Joe Biden urged senators and representatives to act before the May 25 anniversary of George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis policeman.
Republican Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), Democratic Senators Dick Durbin and Cory Booker and Democratic Representative Karen Bass were among those tasked with reaching a consensus, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and two Democratic legislative aides said.
Lawmakers who attended the meeting said they were hopeful.
""Nothing happened in the meeting that deters me from being optimistic that we can get there,"" Scott told reporters, though he rebuffed questions about whether lawmakers could meet Biden's deadline.
Durbin said the meeting was ""very constructive.""
""There's trust in that room, and it's important to see it through,"" Durbin said.
A group of relatives of victims of police violence, including Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, met with lawmakers, including Schumer, and with White House officials on Thursday.
""They listened intently. It was emotional and it was very engaging,"" said Ben Crump, the lawyer for Floyd's family and other victims of police violence, outside the White House. ""They committed to these families that they were committed to getting some meaningful legislation presented.""
The House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, named for the African-American man killed when Derek Chauvin, then a policeman, kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd's death sparked a summer of nationwide protests over policing and systemic racism. 
The bill has not yet been taken up by the Senate, where it faces steep odds of getting the bipartisan support it would need to pass the upper chamber. Democrats effectively control 50 of the chamber's 100 seats, but most legislation requires 60 votes to pass.
Police unions have opposed changes made in the House's bill to qualified immunity, which they say will further open the door to lawsuits alleging excessive force.
Scott also introduced a policing bill last year, but it was blocked by Democrats who said his approach relied too much on incentives and too little on mandating changes.
Scott has proposed making it easier for victims of police violence to sue law enforcement agencies, rather than the officers themselves. Bass has said it is important for victims to be able to sue individual officers as well as police, sheriff's and other departments.
Asked about qualified immunity, Scott said they now have more information that allows them to work towards a result, which he said is positive. 

Bass said the issue of qualified immunity was among the unresolved issues.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York City aims to ""fully reopen"" on July 1 after more than a year of closures and capacity restrictions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday, citing satisfactory progress in vaccinating its more than 8 million residents.
""We are ready to bring New York City back fully on July 1,"" de Blasio told a news briefing. ""Now we can see that light at the end of the tunnel.""
De Blasio said he had not discussed the city's reopening date with Governor Andrew Cuomo but his announcement comes a day after Cuomo lifted restrictions that would clear the way for a revival of the city's signature nightlife. The state has the power to impose or lift coronavirus-related restrictions.
""I think the best way to proceed here is to set out the city's vision,"" de Blasio said.
Asked about New York City's reopening plan at a press conference later, Cuomo said he was ""reluctant"" to set a date but was hopeful it could happen even before July 1. 
""I don't want to wait that long,"" said Cuomo. ""I think if we do what we have to do, we can be reopened earlier."" 
Even though the July 1 date is still aspirational and other jurisdictions such as Texas have already declared complete reopening, de Blasio's announcement is significant. New York is the country's most populous city and was the early epicenter of the pandemic in the United States.
The news was welcomed by many New Yorkers. ""It means that we're getting back on track, that everything's going back to normal,"" said Francisco Krauz, a construction worker who was taking a break on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Rob Dicks, head of IT consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN)'s capital markets talent and organization practice, said he was eagerly awaiting the full reopening, his appetite whetted by a recent business meeting he held in Manhattan after a year of Zoom meetings.
""It was surreal to be back in Midtown for the first time in a year, having a face-to-face client meeting outside at a restaurant,"" he said. ""Video is an evolution ... and is effective, but there are some topics that just need to be covered face-to-face."" 
The mayor said his optimism on the city's return to normal reflected the progress of a massive vaccination drive. He said 6.4 million doses of vaccine have been administered in the city of more than 8 million residents. 
More than 42% of residents have received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine, according to city data. 
""People are showing up,"" he said. ""We need to keep the momentum going,"" he added. ""This is exactly how we get to the full reopening we're all looking forward to.""
DOWNWARD TREND
Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths have trended lower in New York City since the beginning of the year. On a seven-day rolling average, the city reported over 7,000 new cases a day at the outbreak's peak in January. By March new infections ebbed to 4,000 a day and now average about 2,000 a day.
New York City last week had about 12,000 new cases or 141 per 100,000 people. If it were a state, it would rank 17th nationwide for most new infections. New York State overall was reporting 158 cases per 100,000 while California and Hawaii had fewer than 40 new cases per 100,000 last week.
De Blasio did not provide clear guidelines on whether those attending shows, dining indoors or frequenting gyms and salons would have to adhere to any specific requirements, such as presenting proof of vaccination.
""There certainly will be particular institutions that may choose to have rules around a vaccination or testing,"" he told reporters, adding that the city will keep monitoring COVID-19 data and adjust its approach accordingly. 
Currently, the New York Yankees and Mets require those attending baseball games to take a rapid COVID-19 test or show proof of vaccination before gaining admission to their ballparks in keeping with New York state guidelines. Attendance is limited to 20% of capacity.

On Wednesday, Cuomo set a date for the end of a curfew that had forced city restaurants to end their bar and food service by midnight. The curfew would end on May 17 for outdoor dining areas and on May 31 for indoors, he said. The governor also allowed seating at bars across the state to reopen for the first time on May 3. 
In addition, Cuomo said capacity limits would increase starting May 15 for several businesses outside of New York City, including gyms and casinos. Offices across the state, including in the city, will be able to increase capacity from 50% to 75%, the governor said.

(Reuters) - Federal agents searched Rudolph Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office, advancing a criminal investigation into the Ukrainian dealings of Donald Trump's former lawyer.
Here is a summary of what is publicly known about the investigation and what trouble it could spell for Giuliani and the former president:
Why did agents search Giuliani's home and law office?
Giuliani led an effort to dig up dirt on now-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine before the 2020 election and pushed Trump to remove then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.
Prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani illegally lobbied the Trump administration on behalf of Ukrainian officials and oligarchs, while also serving as Trump's personal lawyer. 
A law passed in 1938, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), makes it a federal crime to try to influence or lobby the U.S. government on behalf of a foreign official without disclosing it to the Justice Department.
To obtain a warrant, prosecutors first had to persuade a judge that there was ""probable cause"" to believe that a crime was committed and that the search would turn up evidence of the crime. Agents seized cell phones and computers in Wednesday's search, Giuliani's lawyer said. 
The warrants would have required sign-off at the highest levels of the Justice Department, said Lisa Kern Griffin, a law professor at Duke University and former federal prosecutor.
""This development suggests that the investigation into Giuliani’s activities is both ongoing and intensifying,"" she said.
It is unusual for prosecutors to execute a search warrant on a lawyer's office or home, but federal prosecutors in Manhattan have done so before, most notably in 2018 against Michael Cohen, another former Trump lawyer, who later was sentenced to three years in prison.
Prosecutors clearly think there is real evidence Giuliani broke the law, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
""They had to get approvals from a judge and high levels of the Justice Department,"" Sandick said. ""That is a lot of work to do for a fishing expedition, so I don't think this is one."" 
What has Giuliani said about the probe?
Giuliani's lawyer Bob Costello suggested the investigation was politically motivated and denied that Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent. 
""Giuliani respects the law, and he can demonstrate that his conduct as a lawyer and a citizen was absolutely legal and ethical,"" Costello said in a statement.
Costello said the electronics seized were ""replete"" with information protected by attorney-client privilege, a legal doctrine that generally keeps correspondence between a lawyer and client confidential.
If Giuliani were to be charged, prosecutors would likely argue that attorney-client privilege does not apply, either because Giuliani was not acting as a lawyer, or because his legal advice furthered criminal acts, Sandick said.
""Rudy played a lot of different roles for Trump,"" Sandick said.
In Cohen's criminal case, a judge said a review of documents seized from Cohen's office turned up only a handful of communications between him and his clients pertaining to actual legal advice.
Could this probe implicate Trump?
Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine were clearly intended to benefit Trump, and former Trump administration officials have said in media interviews and congressional testimony that Giuliani was acting at Trump's direction.
But if the investigation is focused on FARA then Trump is unlikely to be charged as Giuliani's co-conspirator, Sandick said.
If Giuliani failed to comply with FARA's disclosure requirements, it is his own doing, not Trump's, Sandick said.
But it is possible the investigation into Giuliani could expand, particularly if he were to cooperate with prosecutors as Cohen did and implicate Trump in criminal activity, Sandick said.
""This is all very reminiscent of Cohen,"" Sandick said. ""Cohen certainly tried to cooperate, so it's hard for me to say it is impossible.""
""The investigation may not have a direct legal impact on Trump, but the fact that the president's lawyer and close adviser could be prosecuted for acting as an agent of a foreign principal is pretty shocking,"" he said.
Trump on Thursday criticized the investigation and said he had no idea what FBI agents were looking for when they searched his former lawyer’s apartment and office.

""It’s very, very unfair,"" Trump, told Fox Business Network in an telephone interview. ""Rudy is a patriot who loves this country and I don’t know what they’re looking for, what they’re doing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. President Joe Biden's first 100 days come to a close this week, a number of key policy positions and contentious issues remain ""under review,"" to use the White House's terminology. 
They stretch from deep-seated economic issues a generation in the making to controversial policies introduced by Republican President Donald Trump's government, which preceded the Democratic Biden administration.
Many relate to China, the United States' strategic competitor, a rivalry that Biden has starkly defined, most recently in a speech to Congress on Wednesday, as a struggle between democracy and autocracy for control of the global economy in the 21st century.
The Biden administration has begun to flesh out an overarching strategy to compete with China that relies on renewing relations with partners like India and allies like Japan and South Korea, and heavy domestic investment. 
But critics say slow reviews of specific policies could cost U.S. companies and the economy. 
After Biden's speech, Republican Senator Mitt Romney told reporters, ""I don't believe we yet have as a nation a comprehensive strategy to deal with a China intent on dominating the world, eventually.""
""We don't have the luxury of time to sit around and marvel at the problem,"" said one Republican aide in the House of Representatives, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We need action and specific policies in place.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Republican criticism of their policy reviews. Democrats argue privately, however, that the administration is still racing to get crucial jobs filled.
Biden has yet to name an ambassador to China and many other countries, or to fill a key post at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees exports of critical U.S. technology to China.
Administration officials have said they will look to add ""new targeted restrictions"" on some sensitive technology exports to China in cooperation with allies, but have not offered further details.
TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS 
The Biden administration has said it will conduct a thorough review of U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on nearly $400 billion worth of Chinese goods, but it has not given a deadline. 
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a recent interview that the United States was not ready to lift the duties, in part because of the leverage it gives American negotiators.
The tariffs cost U.S manufacturers $80 billion, the Tax Foundation think tank reported last September. China has fallen short of pledges to buy U.S. goods made in a January 2020 trade deal. 
SUPPLY CHAIN REVIEW
Biden launched a 100-day review of risks to critical supply chains in February, citing the United States' need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, and rare earth minerals. 
The Defense, Commerce, Energy, Agriculture, Transportation, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services departments are expected to submit reports addressing supply chain resiliency due one year after the February order. 
INVESTMENT BAN
The Biden administration also has not addressed how it will use a tough sanctioning tool introduced by Trump that would prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese companies that the previous administration said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
NORTH KOREA 
The Biden administration has signaled for weeks it is finalizing a broad review of North Korea (Successive U.S. administrations have sought to persuade the Stalinist country to part with its nuclear weapons.) A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the administration was ""closer to the end of that review than we are to the beginning,"" but offered no details.
The White House has shared little about the review and whether it will offer concessions to get Pyongyang to return to talks. It has simultaneously signaled a hard line on human rights, denuclearization and sanctions, while making diplomatic overtures that officials say have been rebuffed by Pyongyang, which has long demanded economic sanctions relief.
CUBA, VENEZUELA 
Biden promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to reverse parts of Trump's harsh measures against Cuba, and aides have said they are looking especially at Trump's last-minute decision to designate Havana as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
But the new administration appears to be in no rush. And any significant move of this type would risk a political backlash in the crucial swing state of Florida ahead of the 2022 congressional midterm elections. Trump's hard-line approach was popular among the Miami area's large Cuban-American population, helping him win the state in November though he lost the presidential election.

Among the other issues still being decided are how to craft a new policy on Venezuela, where Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign of sanctions failed to dislodge socialist President Nicolas Maduro, and how to close the internationally condemned U.S. military prison for foreign suspects at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democrat U.S. senators are questioning whether political interference during the Trump Administration hampered a Department of Justice investigation of heavy-equipment manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT)., according to an announcement this week by the Senate Finance Committee’s chairman. Former Attorney General William Barr, Caterpillar’s former lawyer, ran the department while the investigation was underway.
The chair, Senator Ron Wyden, D-Or, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, wrote to the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service, citing a November Reuters report that the probe of Caterpillar had “stalled” while Barr was AG. The Senate letter seeks information about Caterpillar and another unrelated case.
Reuters had disclosed that six days after Trump nominated Barr as head of the Justice Department in 2018, the investigative team in the active criminal probe of Caterpillar was told to take “no further action” in the case, according to an email written by one of the agents. Barr had said that as AG, he would recuse himself from any Caterpillar matters.

Barr had been retained by Caterpillar in 2017 as a private lawyer to help resolve the ongoing federal investigation into allegations that the company illegally routed some profits through a Swiss subsidiary. The company said it acted properly.
Reached Thursday, Barr declined to comment.
Caterpillar’s press spokesperson did not immediately respond to a phone call and an emailed request for comment Thursday.

(Reuters) - A majority of Americans support measures favored by President Joe Biden to substantially redistribute U.S. wealth, according to an Ipsos poll for Reuters released on Thursday, including tax hikes on the wealthy and a higher minimum wage.
The national opinion poll also found that Republican voters were divided over the ""trickle-down economics"" championed by their party's leaders since President Ronald Reagan some 40 years ago.
In his speech to Congress on Wednesday night, Biden attacked trickle-down economics as an idea that has never worked. The poll was conducted after the speech.
The theory, which asserts that tax breaks and other benefits for corporations and the wealthy will benefit everyone else, has been fiercely debated since Reagan made it a centerpiece of his economic strategy in the 1980s. 
A 2020 study by the London School of Economics of 50 years of data from 18 countries showed that the only significant effect of significant tax cuts to the rich was to increase income inequality with little benefit to unemployment or economic growth.
According to the Ipsos poll, 51% of adults agreed with the statement that ""trickle-down economics have never worked in America,"" while 26% disagreed. 
Among Republicans, four in 10 agreed that it was a failed theory, while three in 10 disagreed. Among Democrats, seven in 10 agreed that trickle-down economics never worked, while two in 10 disagreed. 
Overall, 73% said they approved of Biden's economic message to Congress on Wednesday, according to the poll.
Specifically:
*69% of Americans supported requiring employers to give 12 weeks paid family and medical leave;
*65% supported making the first two years of community college free for everyone;
*65% supported tax hikes for the wealthy;
*64% supported increasing IRS audits and enforcement of wealthy tax dodgers;
*63% supported increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour.
The responses were split along party lines, however. At least eight out of 10 Democrats supported each measure, compared with less than half of Republicans.
About 60% of Americans also said they found the scale and scope of Biden's legislative proposals ""historic."" 
And 74% said the same about seeing the first female vice president, Kamala Harris, and the first female speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, standing behind Biden at Wednesday's speech. 

The Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,000 adults, including 290 Republicans and 360 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 5 percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department is looking into ways to tighten federal criminal law to make it easier to prosecute alleged domestic terrorists, a top Justice Department official told Congress on Thursday.
Brad Wiegmann, deputy chief of the Justice Department's national security division, noted that U.S. federal prosecutors can charge suspected foreign militants with ""material support for terrorism,"" but that there is no parallel law prosecutors can use against suspected domestic terrorists.
Legal experts have suggested that disparity should be addressed following the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump.
""That is something that we are thinking about,"" Wiegmann told a House appropriations subcommittee hearing. But he added: ""We haven't reached any conclusions on that yet.""
The power to change the law rests with Congress, not President Joe Biden's administration. But Biden, whose Democrats narrowly control both houses of Congress, has made tackling domestic terrorism a priority.
""We won't ignore what our intelligence agencies determine to be the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland today, white supremacy is terrorism,” Biden said in his first speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.

John Godfrey, a senior State Department counterterrorism official, told a separate House Homeland security subcommittee hearing on Thursday that U.S. diplomatic posts had reported rising concerns about links between racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism in the United States and Europe. He added that groups had encouraged individuals to join the military or law enforcement agencies to gain training that could be to be used to target perceived enemies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators said on Thursday they expect to pass a law mandating a major shift in how the military handles cases of sexual assault, after years of thwarted efforts to take prosecution of such cases out of the hands of commanders.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has championed the policy shift for much of the past decade, led a group of Democrats and Republicans introducing legislation to make prosecution of such crimes the responsibility of independent military prosecutors.
""This legislation is not partisan and it is not political,"" said Gillibrand. She first introduced the ""Military Justice Improvement Act"" in 2013.
The senators noted that the Department of Defense said almost 21,000 service members were sexually assaulted in 2018, despite efforts to end sexual harassment and assault among the troops.
Gillibrand introduced the bill with a group of Democratic and Republican co-sponsors, who said they expected it would become law. ""I'm going to predict that by the end of this Congress, we're going to pass this bill, and it's about damn time,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz said.
Republican Senator Joni Ernst, a military veteran, became a co-sponsor recently, saying Congress had waited long enough for the Pentagon to change on its own. She said the bill would send an essential message that sexual assault would be punished, even if a local commander is inclined to overlook the issue.
""Once that sexual assault has occurred, you can't go back. You can't change what has happened and you will relive that moment of your life over and over again,"" said Ernst, an assault survivor.

An independent commission on sexual assault set up by the Pentagon recommended last week that the military take the decision to prosecute cases out of the chain of command. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has not made a decision, as he consults leaders of the military branches.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday bolstered the efforts of some long-term immigrants to avoid deportation in a ruling that faulted the federal government for improperly notifying a man who came to the United States illegally from Guatemala to appear for a removal hearing. 
The justices, in a 6-3 ruling that divided the court's conservative bloc, overturned a lower court's decision that had prevented Agusto Niz-Chavez from pursuing his request to cancel the attempted expulsion based on having lived in the United States for many years. Niz-Chavez lives in Michigan with his family after entering the United States illegally in 2005.
At issue in the case was whether federal immigration law requires authorities to include all relevant details for a notice to appear for a hearing in one document or can send the information across multiple documents.
""In this case, the law's terms ensure that, when the federal government seeks a procedural advantage against an individual, it will at least supply him with a single and reasonably comprehensive statement of the nature of the proceedings against him,"" conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the ruling. 
Gorsuch was joined by the court's three liberal justices as well as conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett. 

In a dissent, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, said the ruling was ""perplexing as a matter of statutory interpretation and common sense.""

(Reuters) - Last April, Kate Needham’s one-year-old son Robbie pushed through a screen and plunged from a second story window in the family’s rental home near Naval Base San Diego.
Robbie landed head first on the ground, suffering a life-threatening head injury that required a $30,000 hospital stay. On a warm day, Needham and her Navy-enlisted husband had cracked open a window in the home that they, as do thousands of American military families, rent from a privatized U.S. military housing operator. With one light press on the screen, she said, the toddler fell through.
Soon after, Needham said, employees of military housing landlord Lincoln Military Housing visited to take photos and asked her to reenact the circumstances of the fall. During a phone call Lincoln employees recorded with her, Needham said, she felt pressure to take the blame for Robbie’s injury, and she promised not to sue the company.
“They completely took advantage of my vulnerable state to cover themselves,” Needham said.
Lincoln Military Housing, one of the U.S. military’s top housing providers, said it couldn’t discuss specific incidents, citing privacy concerns. Its standard practice is to “visit and inspect a home after any incident that involves a window fall,” to ensure it can immediately address any issues. The company’s chief executive told Reuters it is enhancing window safety across its military homes.
Robbie’s fall was not an isolated incident. It was one in a series of life-threatening window falls that have raised alarm in the Navy and have begun spurring hard questions from members of Congress.
Children’s window falls are also a common concern in civilian communities, accounting for about a dozen deaths and thousands of injuries annually in the United States, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. But such accidents have drawn special alarm in the military community.
Since 2017, at least 18 children have been injured from window falls in Navy and Marine Corps privatized housing, including at least seven last year, according to Navy data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act.
Lincoln isn’t the only military landlord to have window fall incidents. Two children were injured in Army housing with other landlords in 2019, and one at an Air Force base in 2018, military records show. Some of the Navy falls involved other landlords, as well.
Last June, two months after Robbie fell, the Navy issued a letter to its private housing partners urging them to undertake immediate window safety upgrades. The letter, obtained by Reuters, expressed “grave concerns about the increased number of child fall incidents from second story windows.”
The falls have continued in spite of a 2018 law meant to prevent the problem, which Congress enacted in response to earlier accidents. Evan’s Law was named for four-year-old Evan English, son of a Navy commander, who died in 2011 from a window fall on a base in Hawaii. Among other safeguards, the law is meant to require U.S. military landlords to install child guards or locks on upstairs windows within 42 inches of the floor.
The measure aimed to ensure window safety in military housing met or exceeded civilian housing standards, say members of Congress who helped pass it, by requiring safety devices on all upstairs windows that posed risks.
In many cases, interviews and records show, the installations haven’t happened. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense hasn’t completed a required children’s window safety assessment in military housing, and hasn’t tapped funds to help its private housing partners deal with the problem.
‘GRAVE CONCERNS’ IN THE NAVY
Around Naval Base San Diego, four children, including Robbie, were injured last year. The Needhams’ neighborhood, Howard Gilmore Terrace, features two-story townhouses where another child had been injured in a 2018 fall, records show.
Eight weeks after Robbie Needham’s fall, Navy records and other documents show, another child in the same neighborhood, a two-year-old, fell through a screen from an upstairs window and suffered a fractured skull.
A 10-minute drive north, 22-month-old Lovelyn Griser fell out of an upstairs window in Lincoln Military Housing’s Eucalyptus Ridge neighborhood in 2017. Lovelyn had brain swelling and was hospitalized for 46 days, her mother Amanda said, recounting how doctors kept her in an induced coma for a week. The fall permanently impaired the girl’s peripheral vision, her mother said. The Grisers sued Lincoln over Lovelyn’s injury and settled the case on undisclosed terms.
Lincoln declined to discuss the case or the lawsuit.
Despite the history of incidents, Lincoln hadn’t offered the Needhams window guards before their child fell, Kate said. It put a safeguard device in quickly after Robbie’s fall. Lincoln declined to comment on the incident, but said it’s committed to ensuring all its windows are child-safe.
CEO Philip Rizzo told Reuters “window safety has and will always be a top priority.” He said Lincoln is retrofitting more than 50,000 windows across its portfolio and has installed at least 31,700 window opening control devices. The Department of Defense has assured Lincoln it is in “full compliance” with window safety regulations, Rizzo said.
Since the early 2000s, family housing on U.S. military bases has been mostly taken over by private companies in partnerships with military branches. The overhaul was meant to improve housing, save billions of dollars and shift property management to the private sector.
The program has been troubled. In a 2018-2019 series, Reuters documented dangerous housing conditions for thousands of service families. In response to the coverage, Congress and the Pentagon committed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve housing. Yet window safety has remained an issue on multiple bases.
Getting window safety devices into homes quickly was critical, the Navy said in its June 2020 letter to housing providers. Families, the letter said, must be given the option to have devices installed when signing a lease. “We ask that you not delay installation,” the letter said.
Childproofing windows can be relatively inexpensive. The Navy letter mentioned two window-guard devices that cost between $20 and $100 per window at retail.
""The health, safety and security of our Sailors and their families are top priorities,"" a spokesman for Naval Base San Diego said, saying the Navy was ""aggressively working with Lincoln Military Housing"" to get the devices installed.
Among dozens of U.S. military bases where housing has been privatized, however, thousands of existing units where upstairs windows pose a potential hazard haven’t received the safeguards.
In response to a congressional inquiry this year, the Department of Defense said landlords have been installing the devices “during major renovation or new construction,” plans for which often span over decades in their long-term contracts.
In the interim, in many cases the landlords send families written material telling them to keep windows shut, or place warning stickers on windows that depict a child falling out.
“That sticker sends a message,” said one military spouse, who shared a picture of one in her home on a Hawaii base. “If a child falls, it’s your fault and you’ve been warned.”
The Defense Department has not completed a child window safety assessment that Evan’s Law required by the end of 2019. The department said it faced challenges determining “what constitutes a child safety assessment” and identifying a qualified party to conduct the work. It said it hopes to complete the assessment this year.
Congress has authorized the military to seek government funds to comply with Evan’s Law. But a military grant authority meant to help private housing landlords buy and install protective devices has gone unused. “Using the grant authority has not been necessary,” the Pentagon told Reuters, because “privatized housing partners are proactively installing the devices.”
In March, some members of the U.S. Senate and House Armed Services Committees received a closed-door briefing about the issue and other housing lapses still affecting military families.

Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, who helped pass Evan’s Law and chairs a subcommittee overseeing Navy funding, said she is pressing for action. “I have pushed DOD to make sure the law is implemented,” Hirono told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Chinese-American mental health counselor Monica Band started getting a flood of calls and emails soon after former U.S. President Donald Trump began blaming China for the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.
News followed of the killings of six Asian-born spa workers in Atlanta and brutal attacks on people of Asian descent nationwide. Band's mostly Asian-American clients in the Washington, D.C., area have been spat on, called racist names and in one case physically assaulted on a commuter rail line by an assailant yelling, ""Go back to China!""
To help, Band is drawing on a still-developing treatment field pioneered by African-American clinicians who have been working for years to help ease the debilitating pain of racist attacks and systemic racism that can be passed down generations. 
Black Americans are suffering amid heightened visibility of racism since the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year and numerous other high-profile killings.
Talk therapy and other treatments have been developed for survivors of such catastrophes as war and customized to meet the needs of people from different cultures and backgrounds.
To help people cope with stress, the Association of Black Psychologists organized online group therapy ""healing circles"" during the trial of the former policeman who killed Floyd, New York area psychologist Jennifer Jones-Damis said. That trial ended with guilty verdicts earlier this month. 
Therapists say individuals traumatized by racism can experience flashbacks, crying spells and unrelenting worry. Repeated exposure to graphic images and rising attacks make some fear leaving home and feel vulnerable. 
RISING HATE 
The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism tracked a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans of 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared to 2019 in the wake of rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic that started in that country.
The number of people seeking help also rose - and counselors to treat them are in short supply, according to therapists interviewed by Reuters. Band in February started a support group for people who suffered anti-Asian hate incidents or were upset by attacks on others. She also works one-on-one with clients but has a months-long waiting list.
Of about 3,700 Americans of Asian-American and Pacific Islander descent surveyed by DePaul University psychologist Anne Saw, 75% said they believe the United States has become more dangerous for them, preliminary data shared exclusively with Reuters showed.
Of 421 people who agreed to be interviewed about racist incidents they had experienced and reported to the group Stop AAPI Hate, 95% said the United States had become more dangerous, said Saw, who conducted a portion of her research in collaboration with the group.
About 40% of the 421 Stop AAPI Hate respondents said they had experienced at least one symptom of racism-based traumatic stress, including depression, hypervigilance, anger, intrusive thoughts and lowered self-esteem.
""We’re seeing numbers of folks experience anxiety depression, racial trauma symptoms that are like nothing we’ve ever seen before,"" Saw said.
But trauma caused by racist attacks or racism does not have a formal mental health diagnosis.
""If a phenomenon is not named, it is generally not recognized, and when it's not recognized, it's not treated,"" said New York therapist and author Kenneth Hardy, a pioneer in the field of racism trauma. 
Over the past year, more than 400 clinicians have sought training in one of the few formal protocols for treating racial stress and trauma. Psychologist Steven Kniffley's 12-week program at Spalding University in Louisville, Kentucky first helps clients to learn, for example, whether they have internalized racist views of themselves. Next, words or other means are used to retell and process experiences. Finally, tools for dealing with future incidents, such as seeking support from observers, are discussed.
Connecticut therapist Danielle Spearman-Camblard said she would like a diagnosis of racial trauma added to psychiatry's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. A designation would make it easier to bill insurance companies for treatment, and show that the psychological effects of racism are real, she said.
Robert Carter, a Columbia University psychologist who led efforts to educate mental health professionals about the impacts of racism, said racism-caused injuries should be treated. But he said people who have been impacted by racism are not mentally ill, and should not be subjected to the stigma that can accompany a diagnosis.
Carter opposes the use of treatments developed for post-traumatic stress disorder for patients who, for example, develop anxiety and hopelessness after being denied an apartment or a job because of race. He believes the stress caused by racism is different psychologically from trauma.
Dr. Paul Applebaum, who chairs the American Psychiatric Association's DSM steering committee, said an upcoming new edition of the manual will not list racial trauma as a condition, but will explicitly reference racism as a possible underlying cause of several diagnoses including depression. 
Tracy Park, 37, didn't seek therapy, citing a dearth of Asian-American counselors, after she and her family were targeted by racists.
In February 2020, as COVID-19 began to spread in the United States, the animator took her toddler and newborn baby to a Los Angeles park.
As she pushed her stroller toward the exit on her way to the library, a white man shouted at her: ""Get your coronavirus babies the f--k out of here!"" 
Her 65-year-old mother was threatened by another white man later. 
Park, anxious and at times depressed, developed trouble sleeping and was constantly on guard. 
She found solace among a group of mothers who had also experienced anti-Asian hate and held online ""unpacking sessions."" And she wrote a ""zine"" expressing her anger and other feelings. 

But ""I'm still scanning the horizon looking for anyone charging toward us,"" Park said. ""And that's no way to live.""

Biden, a Democrat, told a joint session of Congress the reform was broadly supported by the American people, and that he knew Republicans were ""engaged in productive discussions"" with Democrats.
""We need to work together to find a consensus,"" Biden said. ""Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death.""
The Democratic president drew a bipartisan standing ovation when he praised the police, saying ""most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably.""
But he said Congress needs to restore trust in law enforcement, end racism in the criminal justice system, and give meaning to the words of Floyd's daughter, who Biden said told him ""Daddy changed the world.""
""After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act,"" he said.  ""Now is our opportunity to make real progress.""
Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was convicted last week of murder and manslaughter.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives this year passed the ""George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,"" which aims to put a stop to aggressive law enforcement tactics, but the measure had not yet been considered by the Senate.
Republican Senator Tim Scott, in the Republican response to Biden's address, said he was hoping to find support for his alternative policing reform bill.

A policing bill Scott introduced last summer failed in the Senate, after Democrats said it relied too much on incentives rather than mandating changes.

ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (Reuters) - A North Carolina judge on Wednesday rejected requests to release videos showing law enforcement's fatal shooting of Andrew Brown, Jr., during an attempted arrest, siding with arguments their immediate disclosure could jeopardize active investigations.
Pasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten and roughly 20 media organizations had filed petitions to release body camera video from sheriff's deputies involved in the shooting death of Brown on April 21, arguing disclosure was in the public interest.
The shooting of Brown, a 42-year-old Black man, has led to a week of boisterous but peaceful demonstrations in Elizabeth City, a riverfront community near the Virginia border whose population of roughly 18,000 is half African-American. 
Protesters, including a crowd of about 200 who marched through town on Wednesday ahead of a dusk-to-dawn curfew, have been clamoring for all the body camera videos to be shared with the public.
Superior Court Judge Jeff Foster said he was delaying the release sought by Wooten for 30 to 45 days ""to allow completion of any investigation being undertaken"" by the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and the local prosecutor.
Foster also ruled against the separate petition filed by media organizations, saying they did not have legal standing to call for the release of the videos under state law.
Ben Crump and other attorneys representing the Brown family said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the ruling, noting that it was video footage that first raised public awareness about the killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in Minneapolis last May sparked global protests against racism and police violence. 
Former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd in a landmark trial, the verdict coming on April 20, the day before Brown was shot by sheriff's deputies trying to serve him with an arrest warrant.
Crump and his team have cited a private autopsy conclusion that Brown died from a gunshot wound to the back of his head in what they have characterized as the ""execution"" of a man who posed no threat.
'VIDEO EVIDENCE IS KEY'
""In this modern civil rights crisis where we see Black people killed by the police everywhere we look, video evidence is the key to discerning the truth and getting well-deserved justice for victims of senseless murders,"" the attorneys said in a statement.
Foster ordered the state to notify the court when its probe is completed and said he would reconsider Wooten's request to release the videos ""based on the factors as they exist at that time."" The FBI is investigating the shooting for possible civil rights violations.
Foster did rule, however, that four body camera videos of the incident could be disclosed within 10 days to Brown's son, Khalil Ferebee. He said the faces and other identifying features of the officers at the scene must be obscured.
It was not immediately clear how the videos would be shared with Ferebee and whether he could take possession of them.
District Attorney Andrew Womble had argued against immediate release during a hearing before Foster's ruling, saying it could have a negative impact on the SBI's investigation and prejudice the jury should there be a trial.
""What I do know is that you cannot swing a skunk in front of a group of people and then ask them not to smell it,"" he said.
Womble also disputed what he called the ""patently false"" description of the shooting by Brown family attorney Chantel Cherry-Lassiter, who said a short clip of body-camera footage she was allowed to view showed officers fired at Brown as he tried driving away from them.
With officers surrounding Brown's car during the attempted arrest, Womble said the video shows the vehicle backing up twice after a deputy tried to open the door and others shouted commands, before coming to a stop. 
""The next movement of the car is forward, is in the direction of law enforcement, and makes contact with law enforcement,"" Womble said. ""It is then and only then that you hear shots.""
In a presentation of private autopsy findings to reporters on Tuesday, Brown family lawyers said he was initially struck in his right arm with four shots fired by deputies through his front windshield before he threw the vehicle into reverse, spun around and tried to drive away as a fifth and fatal gunshot struck him in the back of the head.
Wooten has said deputies were attempting to serve search and arrest warrants to Brown related to felony drug charges and that Brown had a history of resisting arrest.

The shooting has revived a push by civil liberties advocates and Democratic lawmakers in North Carolina for legislation requiring release of police bodycam and dashboard-cam video within 48 hours if someone requests it, unless investigators obtain a court order to restrict access.

The issue at hand relates to Oh's work defending  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) against a lawsuit in her previous role as partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to share the information.
The SEC is probing Exxon Mobil over asset valuation issues, according to a January report by the Wall Street Journal, and the matter could create a potential conflict of interest if Oh were to remain in the role, agency sources said. This issue came to the attention of SEC officials this week, the person said.
Oh previously served as co-leader of Paul, Weiss' anti-corruption team. During her 17 years at the firm she worked for a slew of corporations and Fortune 100 companies.
Oh decided to resign after U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in a Monday order raised questions over her conduct during a deposition in the Exxon case, according to the order and the person with knowledge of the matter. 
Brad Karp, chairman of Paul, Weiss, he could not comment on ongoing litigation, but added: ""Alex is a person of the utmost integrity and a consummate professional."" A representative for Exxon did not immediately provide comment. 
While other SEC officials, including former chair Jay Clayton have had long careers in private practice, progressives have put pressure on Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to eschew industry hires due to concerns about potential conflicts of interest.
After her April 22 appointment, a group of advocacy groups wrote to Gensler saying they were ""deeply surprised and concerned"" by his choice.
""The SEC has failed the American people by repeatedly selecting Wall Street defense lawyers as Directors of Enforcement,"" said Dennis Kelleher, Chief Executive Officer of Better Markets, a Washington group advocating for Wall Street reform. 

""They come to the SEC with needless and unhelpful baggage, including crippling conflicts of interest regarding current and past clients as well as a mindset...ill-suited to being an aggressive enforcer,"" he added.
The agency named Melissa Hodgman as acting director of the division, a role she previously held between January and April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge seen as a possible future U.S. Supreme Court nominee said on Wednesday her identity as a Black woman does not affect how she approaches legal issues relating to race as she testified at a Senate confirmation hearing for her selection by President Joe Biden to serve on an influential appeals court.
U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee after being nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace Attorney General Merrick Garland on the bench. That appellate court in the past has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court for some justices.
Biden, a Democrat, pledged during his election campaign to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court if he gets a chance to fill a vacancy, which would be a historic first. Jackson is among the most prominent Black women in the federal judiciary and, at age 50, is also relatively young.
Senator John Cornyn was one of several committee Republicans who questioned Jackson, a Washington-based judge, on whether race plays a role in her approach in deciding cases.
""I'm methodically and intentionally setting aside personal views and any other inappropriate considerations. And I would think that race would be the kind of thing that would be inappropriate to inject in my evaluation of a case,"" Jackson said.
Jackson added that her background, both professional and personal, would nevertheless ""bring value"" to the appeals court if she is confirmed.
""I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am,"" Jackson said.
Questioned by Republican Senator Mike Lee, Jackson declined to weigh in on whether racial disparities in the criminal justice system are as a result of unconscious racial bias.
""I'm not a social scientist,"" Jackson said.
She also said her personal views would not affect how she would approach rulings on contentious issues including gun rights.
Jackson was appointed to her current post by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013. 
With conservatives holding a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, liberal activists has been urging the court's eldest member, 82-year-old liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, to retire this year while Democrats control the Senate. A Harvard Law School graduate, Jackson early in her career served as one of Breyer's law clerks at the Supreme Court. 
Jackson's judicial record includes some high-profile rulings. Jackson, for example, in 2019 decided to let the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee subpoena former Republican President Donald Trump's then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn. Her ruling was appealed and the case is ongoing.
Obama considered Jackson to fill a 2016 vacancy on the Supreme Court before picking Garland as his nominee. But Senate Republicans blocked Garland's confirmation and kept the vacancy open for more than a year, enabling Trump rather than Obama to make the appointment.
Nominees can win confirmation to lifetime judicial appointments with a simple majority vote in the 100-seat Senate, which is currently split 50-50 between the parties and is controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote.
Biden nominated Jackson to replace Garland on the D.C. Circuit. Jackson and another Black female judge, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, are considered frontrunners to be nominated by Biden should Breyer step aside.

Another Biden selection appearing at Wednesday's hearing was Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, a Black woman lawyer nominated to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Also testifying was Zahid Quraishi, who would be the first Muslim to serve as a U.S. district court judge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has repealed a policy put in place during Donald Trump's presidency that cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
In an internal memo seen by Reuters, acting head of the Office of Justice Programs Maureen Henneberg said that prior grant recipients, including cities, counties and states that were recipients of the department's popular $250 million annual grant program for local law enforcement, will no longer be required to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a condition of their funding.
She also ordered staff to take down any pending Justice Department grant applications with similar strings attached and start the process over again.
In the memo, Henneberg, who leads the department's largest grant-making arm, said she had instructed staff to ""pull down and revise all solicitations that describe requirements or priority consideration elements or criteria pertaining to immigration.""
""These solicitations will be reposted and grantees will be required to reapply,"" she added.
It is one of a series of decisions by Attorney General Merrick Garland, an appointee of President Joe Biden, to break with policies put in place during the Trump administration. In another high-profile move, the Justice Department has stepped up investigations of U.S. police departments that face charges of brutality or discriminatory tactics.
Shortly after being sworn in, Biden overturned a Trump executive order that had allowed the Justice Department to pressure cities that refused to notify federal immigration authorities when people living in the U.S. illegally have been detained for criminal violations, including minor ones.
Garland on April 14 ordered the department to begin to implement the change.
LEGAL BATTLES PAUSED
The policy reversal marks a major victory for states and cities that have been unable to access awards they received through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants program, known as ""Byrne JAG.""
Named for a New York City police officer killed in the line of duty, the Byrne JAG grant program is the Justice Department's leading source of reimbursement to state and local law enforcement to pay for a variety of initiatives, from prosecutions and corrections programs, to drug and mental health treatment centers.
In fiscal year 2020, the program doled out more than $253 million in grants.
Trump made cracking down on immigration, legal and illegal, a centerpiece of his administration.
Some cities and states resisted his efforts by adopting ""sanctuary"" policies, arguing that close cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities can deter immigrants from coming forward to report crimes.
The fight to withhold Byrne JAG grant money prompted numerous lawsuits, as jurisdictions, including Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco sued the Justice Department on the grounds that withholding the money was unlawful.
In one of those lawsuits brought by New York state, New York City and six other states, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in February 2020 sided with the Trump administration and ruled it was entitled to withhold millions in grant money.
The plaintiff states appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was later withdrawn after Biden won the 2020 election.
The Justice Department and the plaintiffs jointly asked a federal judge in March to put the matter on hold, while the department finished reviewing the grant conditions at the heart of the case.
The New York Attorney General's office said that during the last four years, the state hasn't been able to tap more than $30 million in grant money from the Justice Department as a result of the pending litigation.

The Justice Department's decision to cease using immigration-related criteria will apply to all of the department's grants, according to the memo, as well as notices posted by several other Justice Department offices that award grants.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 46 years, the Manhattan district attorney’s office has changed leaders only twice, in low-key elections focused heavily on fighting crime.
Not this year.
Whoever wins this election could transform law enforcement in America’s biggest city with policies aiming to imprison fewer people. The winner will also inherit one of the nation’s most politically fraught cases: a criminal investigation into former president Donald Trump’s business dealings.
The nine candidates - the largest and most diverse field in the office’s 220-year history - offered competing visions in interviews for how to police Manhattan’s 1.6 million people. 
Nearly all said they would jail fewer people for minor crimes and address systemic racial bias. Most would eliminate or curtail cash bail, which they argue disproportionately impacts poor defendants. And while all declined to comment on how they’d handle the Trump probe, without knowing all the evidence, several touted their credentials for taking on powerful people like the former president.
“Nobody is above the law, no matter who you are or what office you went on to occupy,” said Tali Farhadian Weinstein, 45, a former federal prosecutor and general counsel to Brooklyn’s district attorney.
Another candidate is a former reality TV show contestant. One is an Iraq war veteran. A third said police pointed a gun at his head when he was a teen. Six are women vying to make history as the first female Manhattan D.A.
Their campaigns reflect a national reckoning over tensions between law enforcement and racial minorities, along with a push for more diverse leadership in institutions traditionally run by white men. The next D.A. could influence crime policy nationally because of New York’s trend-setting impact on other big cities.
New York tested some policy changes similar to those proposed by the candidates during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as early release from jail or prison to reduce overcrowding. Many want to go further by ending prosecution of low-level crimes such as trespassing, driving with a suspended license or disorderly conduct.
“These cases don't make us safer,” said candidate Alvin Bragg, 47, a former federal prosecutor and deputy New York attorney general. He said he would “drastically” reduce misdemeanor prosecutions, most of which involve minorities. “We've got to deal with these racial disparities,” he said.
Bragg, a Harvard Law graduate and the only Black candidate, grew up in Harlem and describes a 1989 incident where police mistook him for a drug dealer and put a gun to his head. He said the encounter inspired him to become a lawyer.
Five candidates identified low-level crimes they wouldn’t pursue. Eliza Orlins vowed to decline prosecution of “the vast majority of misdemeanors.” Orlins, 38, is a public defender and a former participant on the CBS reality shows “Survivor” and “The Amazing Race.”
The push to end prosecution of certain crimes could have sweeping implications for public safety, said Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor who is not involved in the election. ""The question is,” she said, “how much can we do reform and also keep our priorities of crime control in mind?""
Four of the eight Democratic candidates would eliminate cash bail. Another one would end it for misdemeanors.
Bail is money paid for jail release to guarantee a defendant’s court appearance. It's a system used only in the United States and the Philippines. Critics argue it often becomes a debt trap for poor defendants, who typically pay 10% of the bail to a bail bondsman, who puts up the full amount but gets it back when the defendant appears.
In January 2020, New York State enacted sweeping changes to curtail cash bail for many nonviolent offenders. But the law was repealed months later after critics said it led to a spike in crime.
Candidate Dan Quart, 48, a seven-term state lawmaker, introduced legislation to end cash bail in 2018 and would seek to end the practice as D.A. “It’s punitive and unnecessary,” he said. 
Also running on an anti-bail plank is Lucy Lang, 40, a former Manhattan prosecutor. She supports alternatives such as text-messaging defendants to remind them of court dates.
‘BAD OLD DAYS’
Two candidates - Liz Crotty, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor; and Iraq war veteran Thomas Kenniff, the lone Republican - said a bail system is needed for repeat offenders posing a safety risk. “Bail reform has to speak to the recidivist offender,” said Crotty, 50.
The race is heating up ahead of a June 22 nominating contest to select the Democratic candidate who will face Republican Kenniff, a 45-year-old lawyer, in the November 2 general election. Kenniff says limiting enforcement for low-level offenses would make the city more dangerous. “The last thing we want to do is roll back law enforcement in underserved neighborhoods,” he said. “We don't want our city to turn back to the bad old days.”
The leadership change in the massive prosecutor’s office, with more than 500 lawyers, coincides with November elections for mayor and all 51 seats in the city’s legislative body. So far, the D.A. candidates have raised a combined $6.5 million, led by Weinstein’s $2.2 million, nearly double her closest rival, Bragg, at $1.3 million.
Three of the candidates - Tahanie Aboushi, Orlins and Quart - have no prosecutorial experience. Orlins called it an advantage to come from outside of the city’s “unjust and cruel” justice system. “It’s time to bring about real change,” she said.
TRUMP INVESTIGATION 
Overshadowing the race is the Trump investigation, opened in 2018 by current District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The probe initially examined alleged hush money payments made to two women who claimed during Trump’s 2016 campaign that they had affairs with him years earlier. It has since moved on to examine whether Trump’s businesses engaged in criminal tax evasion or other improprieties. Vance announced in March that he would not seek re-election to begin a “new chapter” of life, triggering the handoff of the Trump probe.
While the investigation has moved slowly, a person familiar with the probe said indictments could come this summer. Mark Pomerantz, a veteran white-collar crime lawyer in the D.A.’s office, leads much of the investigation, a role that’s expected to continue after the election, say two people familiar with the probe.

Several candidates noted their previous experience suing Trump. Bragg, for instance, was chief deputy for the New York Attorney General’s office when it sued the Trump Foundation in 2018, resulting in the charity’s dissolution. “I've done this type of work under this type of scrutiny,” he said.
Aboushi, a civil rights attorney running for D.A., said that after Trump imposed his Muslim travel ban in 2017, she spent four days at JFK Airport leading a team of lawyers petitioning for the detainees’ release. “I’ve been consistently fearless in the face of power,” said Aboushi, 35, whose campaign has said she would be the nation’s first Muslim D.A. 
Candidate Diana Florence, a former top deputy in Vance’s office, said Trump’s family business should have faced scrutiny years ago. Florence, 50, touts her 25-year career as a Manhattan prosecutor as one of her top selling points: “There is no one more qualified to take on that investigation.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday will propose that Congress spend $45 billion to provide free meals to millions more low-income children, a move that would expand anti-poverty measures adopted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Biden wants lawmakers to fund the permanent expansion of a bridge program that gives low-income families cash to pay for food in the months when school is out for the summer and lunches aren't served. He is also asking to provide more money for free meals in high-poverty areas throughout the school year.
The nutrition program is one component of Biden's $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, which would raise taxes on wealthy individuals to pay for initiatives shoring up lower-income families.
""The pandemic illustrated the need to address food insecurity,"" said Kelliann Blazek, a White House aide whose portfolio includes agriculture and rural policy. ""Some of these investments are really pulling on lessons learned during the pandemic.""
In 2019, 5.3 million children lived in households unable to guarantee food for the whole family throughout the year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The administration is also asking Congress to reward schools that expand healthful food offerings with incentive payments and also to allow individuals convicted of drug-related crimes to continue receiving food stamp benefits.

For the funding to be approved, the proposal will need the approval of a closely divided Congress.

PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed into law on Tuesday a measure banning abortions performed strictly on the basis of genetic disorders detected in the fetus, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis, unless the condition is considered lethal.
The bill, approved in Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature along strict party-line votes last week, makes it a felony for a medical professional to terminate a pregnancy solely on the basis of a hereditary abnormality in the fetus.
Doctors performing such an abortion could face prison time under the newly enacted statute, which opponents have denounced as medically unsound and unconstitutional. A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona said that group and others are weighing a legal challenge.
The bill is due to take effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns for the year.
Support from Ducey, who has never vetoed an abortion restriction and calls himself ""proudly pro-life,"" was not unexpected.
""There's immeasurable value in every single life - regardless of genetic makeup,"" Ducey, a Republican now in his second term as governor, said in a statement. ""We will continue to prioritize protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives.""
In addition to outlawing abortions based on genetic abnormalities, the measure - Senate Bill 1457 - also makes it a felony to use force or threat to intimidate a woman into terminating her pregnancy on that basis, or to accept or solicit money to pay for such an abortion.
The measure does not apply to cases in which a genetic condition is considered lethal to the fetus or to abortions sought for other reasons allowed by state law, including protection of the life and health of the mother, Ducey said.
The new law requires any doctor who performs an abortion to complete an affidavit attesting that the woman is not terminating her pregnancy due to an abnormality, and it requires the physician to inform the mother that abortions based on a child's race, sex or any genetic disorder are illegal.
Various federal courts have taken divergent stands on such restrictions.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled earlier this month that Ohio can enforce a 2017 law banning abortions when medical tests show that a fetus has Down syndrome, a genetic condition that causes cognitive impairment and developmental delays.
That court held that the Ohio statute did not create a substantial barrier to obtaining abortions, was reasonably related to the state's legitimate interests and was ""valid in all conceivable cases.""
But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared a similar Arkansas law unconstitutional in January. That split could prompt the U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority to take up the issue.
Supporters of the measure say it is intended as a safeguard against modern-day eugenics, the notion of selective reproduction to ""breed out"" hereditary disease, disabilities and traits deemed undesirable from the human population.

The American Civil Liberties Union, condemning the bill, said it ""will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for people who experience pregnancy loss of any kind and will force people to carry pregnancies to term against their will.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When he delivers his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, President Joe Biden will take on a new role: salesman in chief.
Through his first 100 days in office, Biden has often struck a somber tone as he spoke about the country's coronavirus deaths, mass shootings and millions out of work.
With his Cabinet mostly in place and a flurry of executive orders and a massive COVID-19 relief bill signed, much of Biden's upcoming agenda is at the mercy of Congress. 
So the Democratic president plans to redouble efforts to convince voters - and by extension reluctant lawmakers - that collaborative effort and trillions in spending are the way to renovate the country and compete with China, administration officials and their allies, including in Congress, said in recent weeks.
Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda is broadly popular with voters, but his coronavirus relief bill failed to win a single Republican vote in Congress. On Wednesday, he plans to outline another crowd-friendly idea - putting $1.5 trillion toward childcare and college education, and taxing wealthy Americans to pay for it. 
That is on top of a $2 trillion jobs-and-infrastructure plan paid for by raising taxes on U.S. companies, that Republicans in Congress argue is too large.
Biden is expected to try to convince Americans that infrastructure is more than just roads, that caregivers need to be paid more for their work and that taxing the wealthy more to invest in long-term projects is good for the economy. After Wednesday's speech, he will head to Georgia on Thursday and Pennsylvania on Friday, with more stops to come. 
More than half of Americans, 55%, approve of the president, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, levels of support that predecessor Donald Trump, a Republican, never achieved. Infrastructure spending is even more popular, as is making the rich pay higher taxes.
That is why Wednesday's target audience is not just the tiny group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill allowed in the room, but the tens of millions the White House hopes will tune in, Biden associates say.
At the same time, White House aides are pushing for Biden to champion an assortment of policies, ranging from police reform to foreign affairs, in the speech.
Biden's main speechwriter, Vinay Reddy, helped the president craft his 21-minute inaugural address, among the shortest in modern times, and a plea in March to end hatred following the killings of Asian Americans in Georgia.
The president's speechwriting process is generally a back-and-forth affair, aides say, lasting several weeks or months, with drafts written or marked up by hand and edited until the last minute.
Biden asks aides to boil concepts down into blunt, rib-sticking terms, and to make only promises they know they can deliver - like guaranteeing 100 million vaccine shots within 100 days during his campaign, a goal communicated broadly, achieved quickly, and then doubled.
""The whole concept of the bully pulpit was going to the people to put pressure on legislators,"" said Theodore Sheckels, a Randolph-Macon College English professor, who has written extensively about political communication.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris ""are trying to communicate more directly to the American people,"" Sheckels said.

The Senate voted 49 to 45 to confirm Kahl, 49, who served as national security adviser to Biden when the Democrat was vice president, to be undersecretary of defense for policy. The position is the No. 3 civilian job at the Pentagon.
With the Senate divided 50-50 between the Democratic and Republican caucuses, there have been many mostly partisan votes over Biden's nominees for top administration positions.
Kahl became a prime target of Republicans aiming to torpedo some Biden picks over their activity on social media. Critics accused him of making comments on Twitter that were too partisan for him to serve effectively or of releasing classified information on social media, which he denied.
Democrats have rejected such concerns, noting Republicans' loyalty to former President Donald Trump, who frequently used his Twitter feed to insult political opponents.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Tuesday urged the Biden administration to slap more sanctions on the military junta in Myanmar, including choking revenues to a state energy company, in response to its coup and violent crackdown on protesters. 
Senators Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, and four others urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a letter to ""explore new avenues to support the people of Burma in their ongoing struggle for democracy in the face of escalating crimes against humanity."" 
They want the Biden administration to stop royalties flowing from businesses including U.S. energy major  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, or MOGE, an agency within the energy ministry, that provides financial support to military leaders, including General Min Aung Hlaing, already under U.S. sanctions. 
MOGE is a partner in Yadana, a natural gas field in which Chevron has a 28.3% stake. 
Human rights groups have urged energy companies, including Chevron, Total, to cut ties to Myanmar after the military ousted the democratically-elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, detaining her and cracking down on protesters. More than 750 people have been killed since.
Gas revenues from joint ventures involving companies like Total and Chevron, are the most significant single source of foreign exchange revenue for the Myanmar government, generating cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion annually, the senators said. 
They proposed the ventures pay revenue into a trust to be held until Myanmar has a democratically-elected government or to be used for humanitarian purposes, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. 
Chevron and Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State and Treasury Departments did not immediately respond.

Chevron paid around $50 million to Myanmar between 2014 and 2018 according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which works to increase transparency in international business.

(Reuters) - A national Democratic redistricting group has brought a trio of lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Louisiana, asking courts to prepare to step in if the divided government in each of those states fails to agree on new legislative maps.
The litigation, filed after the U.S. Census Bureau released data on Monday showing how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes will be allocated to each state for the next decade, is the first salvo in what will likely be a sprawling national court battle over redistricting.
The nonprofit National Redistricting Action Fund, which is affiliated with former Attorney General Eric Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC), brought the lawsuits on behalf of several individual voters in each state.
""While these are the first lawsuits of this new election cycle, let me make this point: these are not going to be the last,"" said attorney Marc Elias, who represents the group and last year led the legal campaign to defend Joe Biden's presidential win.
Both Pennsylvania and Louisiana have Democratic governors who can veto maps produced by their Republican-controlled legislatures. In Minnesota, Democrats hold the governorship and the state House, while Republicans control the Senate.
The lawsuits ask state courts to set a schedule to take over the process and draw new maps in the likely event that state officials reach impasse.
Elias noted that the redistricting process is compressed this year due to months of delays at the Census Bureau, and said the intent of the suits was to ensure courts have enough time to produce fair maps.
Adam Kincaid, the executive director of the Republican counterpart to the NDRC, the National Republican Redistricting Trust, dismissed the litigation.
""The lawsuits are expensive press releases that likely aren't going anywhere,"" he said in an email.
Both parties are readying for a fierce contest over redistricting, the once-a-decade process by which states redraw their electoral maps for congressional and state legislative districts based on the census count.
Texas, Florida and North Carolina - all states where Republicans have pursued gerrymandering, in which one party deliberately manipulates the map to create political advantages - gained a total of four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday, when the Census Bureau released its initial 2020 data.
During a briefing for reporters, Holder explicitly tied the coming fight over redistricting to the ongoing conflict over Republican efforts to install voting limits in dozens of states.

""I have no doubt that the same Republican legislators who have pushed these bills will now try to use the redistricting process to illegitimately lock in power for that party for the next decade,"" he said.

720,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden completes 100 days in office on Friday, April 30. 
Judging a president's performance after 100 days in office is an American political tradition that historians say began with Franklin Roosevelt's first term in 1933, when he embarked on a rapid-fire rollout of measures to counter the Great Depression. 
Here are some of the key policy issues of Biden's first 100 days and how he has fared so far: 
COVID-19 RESPONSE 
Biden's major COVID-19 promise was 100 million shots in Americans' arms by his first 100 days in office. Some 290 million shots have been distributed, more than 230 million administered, and about 96 million Americans are fully vaccinated, 29% of the population.
Biden's vaccination campaign built on efforts started under President Donald Trump to manufacture and distribute the shots, but he added mass vaccination sites and ramped up government agencies to aid the distribution effort.
The United States has now vaccinated more people than any other country, although the pandemic has killed 572,000 people, more than any other country as well. 
Over 3,000 people were dying per day when Biden took office. Now that figure is under 700 a day.
Biden's next 100 days will force him to face vaccine hesitancy among millions of Americans and an uptick in variants of the virus. 
JOBS AND THE ECONOMY 
Biden, a Democrat, devoted much of his first several weeks in office to passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill to limit the pandemic's economic fallout. 
The American Rescue Plan, passed over Republican opposition, delivered on the key economic promise Biden made on the campaign trail: checks for Americans. 
Helped by the stimulus plan for families and businesses and also by the steady rollout of vaccines, economic growth is expected to top 7% this year, the fastest since 1984. It would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Nearly 1 million jobs were added in March, up from 379,000 in February. The improvement is expected to continue as normal commerce resumes and people become comfortable again with dining out at restaurants and other in-person services.
But the gap in employment levels compared with the months before the pandemic remains massive and concentrated in industries like leisure and hospitality that are important sources of jobs for the less skilled. 
U.S. payroll employment is about 8.5 million jobs short of where it was in February 2020. A million or more jobs would be needed beyond that to account for the usual month-to-month growth in the labor force and employment.

FOREIGN POLICY
Biden has proved to be unexpectedly tough on foreign policy regarding America’s chief challengers. He has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to Moscow’s interference in the 2020 elections and a massive cyber hack attributed to Russia, and referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""killer."" 
Biden has held on to Trump-era sanctions on Iran and refused to lift them as a condition for getting Tehran involved in direct negotiations over its nuclear program.
He has maintained Trump's trade tariffs on China, allowed U.S. diplomats to visit Taiwan, and ratcheted up pressure on China over its treatment of Uyghurs in its Xinjiang province and its crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong.
Those policy positions have shown that the threat posed by Beijing is now seen largely as a bipartisan issue in the United States.
  Biden has, however, ended Trump’s cozy U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and distanced himself from Riyadh’s leader-in-waiting, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Biden also set aside concerns about infuriating NATO ally Turkey when he formally recognized that the 1915 massacre of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire constituted genocide.
IMMIGRATION 
Biden moved swiftly to reverse some of Trump's hard-line immigration policies, but he has struggled to deal with a sharp rise in the arrival of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including tens of thousands of families and unaccompanied children. 
Biden halted most construction of Trump’s border wall and reversed his Republican predecessor's travel ban on 13 mostly Muslim-majority and African countries by executive order soon after taking office.
In recent months, unaccompanied children have been backed up in crowded border stations, even as the Biden administration has raced to open thousands of emergency shelter beds. 
Biden left in place a Trump-era COVID policy that blocks access to asylum for many arriving at the border, saying it is needed for health reasons. Advocates for immigrants worry that legitimate asylum seekers are being turned away. 
Biden also pledged to increase the number of refugees allowed into the United States, but then backtracked and stuck with Trump's historically low ceiling for this year. 
GUNS AND POLICING U.S. mass shootings, which slowed during the coronavirus lockdowns, surged again in 2021, to 163 such events this year, as of April 26, compared with 94 over the same period in the prior year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. 
The rise shows how little immediate power Biden has as president to change Americans' easy access to firearms, though he held campaign events with victims of gun violence promising action.
Biden has called for broad legal changes, including banning military-style assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines, but such measures would need to pass Congress. 
He is pushing the Justice Department to crack down on self-assembled ""ghost"" guns, and proposed a budget that adds hundreds of millions of dollars for measures like starting voluntary gun buyback programs.
He did not deliver on a promise to commission reports on the Justice Department's gun oversight reforms or on failures within the background check program.
Biden also stepped back from a campaign pledge to launch an oversight commission to deal with excessive police violence and improve police training, and will use the Justice Department's powers to investigate local police departments for systematic civil rights violations.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Biden moved quickly to have the United States rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change and enlisted an ""all of government"" approach to deliver on a campaign promise to decarbonize the American economy by 2050.
Responding to increasingly dire warnings about the threat of climate change and pressure from a new generation of activists, his administration's actions go beyond those of President Barack Obama's in ambition.
Last week, he unveiled a goal to cut emissions in half from 2005 levels, nearly doubling a target laid out by his former boss.
To help achieve that target, Biden has laid out a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes billions in investments in electric vehicles and clean energy that he says will create millions of good-paying jobs. His administration has paused new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters in what is widely seen as a first step toward a permanent ban. 
DIVERSITY 
Biden's Cabinet nominees were more diverse in terms of race and gender than any predecessor, at 46% women and 50% nonwhite. So far, 21 of 23 Cabinet-level nominees requiring U.S. Senate approval have been confirmed. 
Biden has appointed double the number of women than his predecessors, on average, as well as Pete Buttigieg as the first openly gay Cabinet secretary, Lloyd Austin as the first Black defense secretary, Deb Haaland as the first Native American interior secretary and Alejandro Majorkas as the first immigrant to head the Department of Homeland Security.
UNITY 
After Trump's confrontational style, more Americans have embraced Biden's more earnest, conventional style in his first 100 days in office. 
Polls show that more than half of Americans approve of the job he is doing so far, including some Republican voters. 
""He talks in such an empathetic and low-key way it's impossible to object to it,"" said presidential historian Doug Brinkley. ""He's been very calming and reassuring at a time of great strife.""
Biden's habit of drawing on personal tragedy to explain policy and his lack of appetite for political jousting has stymied Republican efforts to undercut him. 
""Biden is a very likeable president who’s cut out all of he drama,"" said Republican strategist Scott Reed. ""His command focus on the coronavirus is working.""
CATS AND DOGS 
The Bidens brought their two German Shepherd dogs to the White House and promised to introduce a cat as well. 
Major, the younger dog, was to get training outside the White House after two biting incidents at his new home, a spokesman for first lady Jill Biden said this month. 

So far, there is no cat.

Trump has made his club in Palm Beach, Florida, his home since leaving the White House on Jan. 20. But Mar-a-Lago typically closes in May for the summer.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump will move all his meetings and operations to Bedminster, about 40 miles (60 km) west of New York City, where he stayed frequently during his presidency.
He plans to remain there until Mar-a-Lago reopens again in the fall.

The move will allow him to escape the stultifying summer heat of South Florida.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -More than half of Americans approve of President Joe Biden after nearly 100 days on the job, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, a level of support that his Republican predecessor Donald Trump never achieved and one that should help Democrats push for infrastructure spending and other big-ticket items on Biden's agenda. 
The national opinion poll of 4,423 adults from April 12-16 found that 55% approved of Biden’s performance in office, while 40% disapproved and the rest were not sure. 
Biden received the highest marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with 65% supporting his response. In January, 38% approved of Trump's handling of the health crisis. Ninety-percent of Democrats, 61% of independents and 39% of Republicans said they approved of Biden's response, the poll showed. https://tmsnrt.rs/3xpA1qK
Fifty-two percent of Americans also said they liked Biden’s handling of the economy and 53% said the same about his impact on U.S. jobs, which in both cases were a few percentage points higher than Trump’s marks on jobs and the economy during his final month in office.
But Biden received his strongest criticism on immigration, as his administration continues to grapple with a surge of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border: 42% approved of the president’s border policy, while 49% disapproved. 
More than half gave Biden strong marks for bipartisanship, though Democrats were much more likely than others to credit Biden for unifying the deeply divided electorate. Fifty-six percent approved of Biden’s efforts, including 88% of Democrats, 23% of Republicans and 48% of independents. 
Americans were also generally supportive of Biden’s stance on the environment and racial inequality, with 54% and 51% approving of his record so far, respectively. 
Biden is benefiting somewhat from circumstances that are beyond his control. He had months to prepare his pandemic response before becoming president, and some coronavirus vaccines were already in use before his Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden’s economy also has the advantage of being compared against the 2020 pandemic recession, when employers shed millions of jobs as COVID-19 shuttered businesses and schools.
Still, Biden’s approval numbers reflect popular support for his ambitious agenda, including a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package and should help him pursue other initiatives, said Julian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University. 
Biden is now pushing for a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that many Republicans oppose, and he is expected to propose tax hikes on the wealthy to raise money for childcare and other programs for American workers. 
His popularity will help Biden keep his party together, Zelizer said, blunting malcontents on both the progressive and moderate wings of the party, and possibly tempering opposition from some Republicans, especially those in politically competitive states.
Lyna Sandau, a 75-year-old Republican from New York City, said she admires how Biden has aggressively supplied the United States with vaccines. Sandau voted for Trump last year, but if the election were held again, she would probably back Biden. 
“What can I say, he seems to be trying,” she said. 
BROAD SUPPORT IN SPLIT AMERICA
Republicans largely oppose Biden, with only about 20% supporting the president, but those numbers have not changed much over the past year. Biden so far has been able to counter that with near-unanimous approval among Democrats and strong support among independents. 
About 90% of Democrats approve of Biden, while 8% disapprove. Among independents, 51% approve and 39% disapprove. https://tmsnrt.rs/3xkv0Qh
Most presidents enjoy at least a brief period of elevated popularity, and Trump’s favorability numbers also rose when he entered office four years ago. But they declined a few weeks later as he pushed to ban travel from Muslim countries.
Biden’s popularity, meanwhile, has grown over the past year among a broad cross-section of the American population, not only among the white college graduates who helped put him in the White House, but also among the traditionally conservative non-college whites who still dominate the electorate in many places. 
According to the April poll, 61% of white college graduates and 46% of whites who did not get a degree said they have a favorable view of the president, which is up 7 points and 6 points, respectively, from a year ago.
Biden also has become more popular over the past year among racial minorities, with 68% of Hispanics expressing a favorable view of Biden, up 12 points from last April. https://tmsnrt.rs/3evjXuV
The latest poll also shows more Americans – 40% - think the country is headed in the right direction than at any other time in the last decade. 
That is about as good as a Democrat should expect in such a hyper-partisan political environment, said Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist and political scientist at the University of Southern California.

Republicans will likely continue to oppose Biden en masse, Shrum said. But Democrats could counter by pushing for policy initiatives that are popular among conservatives too, such as rebuilding roads and expanding internet access.
“It is very useful to have Republicans who may not give you a high job rating out in the country agree with some of or many of the steps that you want to take,” Shrum said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States, a nation with high levels of gun violence, could witness an increase in firearms carried in public if the Supreme Court rules as expected in a major new case that could recognize wider gun rights under the U.S. Constitution.
The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority believed to hold a broad view of the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Constitution's Second Amendment, on Monday agreed to hear a case that could lead to the most impactful gun rights ruling in more than a decade. It took up the case in the aftermath of a spree of mass shootings and vows by Democratic President Joe Biden to pursue new gun control measures.
The National Rifle Association-backed lawsuit challenges New York state's restrictions on people carrying concealed handguns in public. Lower courts rejected arguments by two gun owners and the NRA's New York affiliate that the restrictions violate the Second Amendment. The justices are due to hear the case in their term that begins in October.
""If the court rules as expected, that New York state law infringes the right to carry a gun in public, we're likely to see a vast increase in the number of guns carried on the streets of America's major cities,"" said University of California, Los Angeles law professor Adam Winkler.
The court issued major Second Amendment rulings in 2008 and 2010 that established an individual's right to keep a gun at home for self-defense in cases involving gun control laws in Chicago and Washington, D.C. 
""Those cases were dealing with the only two city-wide handgun bans in country, so if you take that off the books it doesn't really change the state of play for most people,"" said Joseph Blocher of Duke University School of Law's Center for Firearms Law. ""The kind of law being challenged here affects tens of millions more people.""
To carry a concealed handgun without restrictions under New York's law, applicants must convince a firearms licensing officer that they have an actual - rather than speculative - need for self-defense. 
Striking down New York's restrictions would endanger similar laws in seven other states including California, the most populous one. But the Supreme Court potentially could go further by fashioning a test for lower courts to assess the legality of gun control measures such as whether any analogous regulation existed during the country's early history.
Gun control advocates have said this could endanger measures that states already have implemented and many lower courts have upheld including expanded criminal background checks for gun buyers and ""red flag"" laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts. 
Blocher said it is unlikely that most present-day gun laws would be struck down even under such a test because ""the tradition of gun regulation in the United States is rich.""
Gun control advocates and their Democratic allies have argued that comprehensive gun control measures are needed to combat firearms violence. NRA leader Wayne LaPierre famously said in 2012: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""
Gun rights advocates and their Republican allies in the past decade have wanted the Supreme Court to further expand gun rights. With the court moving rightward with the addition of three conservative justices - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - appointed by Republican former President Donald Trump, they hope now is the time. 
Barrett last year replaced the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who dissented in the 2008 and 2010 gun rulings. Chief Justice John Roberts often takes a cautious approach in major cases but with six conservatives on the court now, the conservative bloc could prevail even without him.
In her previous role as a judge on a Chicago-based federal appeals court, Barrett wrote a 2019 dissenting opinion that could preview how she would approach the New York case. 
Barrett analyzed early U.S. history on gun laws, concluding that a measure that bars people convicted of felonies from owning firearms could be unconstitutional when applied to people who show no sign of being a danger to society.

""History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,"" Barrett wrote. ""But that power extends only to people who are dangerous.""

724,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 06:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After U.S. President Joe Biden gives his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday, one of the more progressive members of his own Democratic party, Representative Jamaal Bowman, plans to deliver a response. 
It is routine for a member of the opposition party to give a rebuttal to a president's address, and Republicans have chosen Senator Tim Scott to do so this time. But it is very unusual for someone from the president's own party to deliver a reply.
Bowman, 45, a Black former middle school principal who ousted a 16-term incumbent in New York City last November, is expected to urge Biden to push forward with a progressive agenda while the party has control of the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate.
""His main message is that this is a narrow historic moment of opportunity ... and we need to take advantage of that and meet the moment with even bolder action on climate change, bold action to combat racial and economic inequality,"" Bowman's spokesman, Karthik Ganapathy, said. ""He really feels the sense of urgency that this moment calls for.""
Biden is a moderate Democrat who pledged during the election campaign to work with Republicans on some issues, raising concerns among liberals he could slow down or water down the Democrats' agenda instead of pushing through bold changes.
The Democrats have narrow majorities in the House and Senate. History suggests they could lose those majorities as early as next year at midterm elections, which often favor the party not in the White House.
The left-wing Working Families Party, a small party with activists in over a dozen states that asked Bowman to give the livestreamed reply to Biden on Wednesday night, is keenly aware of the historical precedents.
Its national director, Maurice Mitchell, recalled that another Democrat, former President Barack Obama, was elected in 2008 with a broad mandate, but by August 2009 the conservative Tea Party movement had changed the political debate. Fueled by the Tea Party surge, Republicans made huge gains and won the House in the 2010 midterms.

""So what should we learn from that? I think what we should learn is that if we want Democrats and progressives to be in a position for success, then our movement cannot demobilize,"" Mitchell said. ""And our movement needs to stay in the fight. We need to push the realm of what's possible.""

(Reuters) -Texas, Florida and North Carolina are among the states that will gain congressional seats based on new population data from the U.S. census, a shift that could boost Republican chances of recapturing the U.S. House of Representatives from Democrats in next year's midterm elections.
The overall U.S. population stood at 331,449,281, the Census Bureau said on Monday, a 7.4% increase over 2010 representing the second-slowest growth of any decade in history.
The release of the data, delayed for months due to the coronavirus pandemic, sets the stage for a battle over redistricting that could reshape political power in Washington during the next decade. States use the numbers and other census data to redraw electoral maps based on where people have moved.
Under the U.S. Constitution, the 435 seats in the House and the votes in the Electoral College that select the president every four years are divided among the 50 states based on population, with every state receiving at least one congressional seat. 
The seats are reallocated every 10 years following the decennial census count.
The shift in seats reflects broader population trends that have seen the South and West grow more rapidly than the Northeast and Midwest for decades.
Texas will receive two more congressional seats next year, and five states - Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Montana and Oregon - will gain one congressional seat each, the census bureau said.
New York, California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia will each lose one seat. California, the most populous U.S. state, lost a congressional seat for the first time in its 170-year history.
The reapportionment can come down to razor-thin margins. If New York had 89 more people in the census count, for instance, it would have kept its seat at the expense of Minnesota, officials said.
The gains for states such as Texas, North Carolina and Florida, where Republicans control the legislatures, could be enough to erase Democrats' current narrow majority in the House. Republicans in those three states have in the past engaged in aggressive gerrymandering, the practice by which maps are deliberately redrawn to benefit one party over another.
""I'd expect, just from reapportionment, the Republicans to win a few seats,"" said Kyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia. Republicans only need to flip five seats in 2022 to retake the House.
Every state uses the census data to redraw lines both for districts and thousands of state legislative seats in a process known as redistricting.
That work cannot be completed until the census releases more precise block-by-block data, which is slated for September. The delay has raised concerns that states will be forced to rush through the complicated process of redistricting ahead of the next elections.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts have no power to restrict political gerrymandering, although racial gerrymandering - which aims to curb the political power of specific racial or ethnic groups - remains unlawful.
The four most populous U.S. states - Texas, Florida and New York, along with California - have more than 110 million residents combined and will hold about one-third of the House seats.
The shift of seven seats among 13 states was the smallest number of seats moving among states in any decade since the current method of calculating them was adopted in 1941, officials said.
SLOW GROWTH
Overall, the U.S. population grew more slowly from 2010 to 2020 than in every other decade aside from the 1930s, during the Great Depression, census officials said.
Population growth has slowed as the birth rate has declined, while the ""baby boomer"" post-World War Two generation has aged. In addition, immigration sharply decreased due to the hardline policies of the Trump administration.
Utah's population grew faster than any other state's, increasing by more than 18% since 2010. Only three states lost population: West Virginia, which saw its population decrease by 3.2%, followed by Illinois and Mississippi, which dropped by 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.
Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, grew by 14.6% to a population of 689,545. House Democrats have passed legislation to admit the district as the 51st state, but Republicans oppose the measure.

The territory of Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, has seen its population decrease by 11.8% since 2010.
Wyoming remains the least populated state, with 576,851 residents.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court stepped back into the heated debate over gun rights on Monday, agreeing to hear a challenge backed by the National Rifle Association to New York state's restrictions on people carrying concealed handguns in public in a case that could further undermine firearms control efforts nationally.
The justices took up an appeal by two gun owners and the New York affiliate of the NRA, an influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans, of a lower court ruling throwing out their challenge to the restrictions on concealed handguns outside the home. 
Lower courts rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that the restrictions violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The lawsuit seeks an unfettered right to carry concealed handguns in public.
The case could lead to the most consequential ruling on the Second Amendment's scope in more than a decade. The court's 6-3 conservative majority is seen as sympathetic to an expansive view of Second Amendment rights.
Gun control advocates are concerned that the conservative justices could create a standard for gun control that could imperil existing policies at the state level including expanded criminal background checks for gun buyers and ""red flag"" laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts. 
A state firearms licensing officer had granted the two gun owners ""concealed carry"" permits but restricted them to hunting and target practice, prompting the legal challenge.
The U.S. debate over gun control has intensified following a spate of recent mass shootings. A day after an April 15 shooting in Indianapolis in which a gunman killed eight employees at a FedEx (NYSE:FDX) facility and then himself, President Joe Biden called U.S. gun violence a ""national embarrassment.""
Biden, a long-time gun control advocate, has taken some steps to tighten federal firearms regulations. But major policy changes would require congressional passage. Senate Republicans stand in the way of Democratic-backed gun control measures already passed in the House of Representatives. 
The New York case centers on a state law that requires a showing of ""proper cause"" for carrying concealed handguns. Under it, residents may obtain licenses restricted to hunting and target practice, or if they hold jobs such as a bank messenger or correctional officer. 
To carry a concealed handgun without restriction, applicants must convince a firearms licensing officer that they have an actual, rather than speculative, need for self-defense. 
The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association and two of its members, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, sued in federal court. The men said they do not face any unique danger but want carry a handgun for self-defense. 
'RIGHT TO DEFEND OURSELVES'
""We're confident that the court will tell New York and the other states that our Second Amendment right to defend ourselves is fundamental, and doesn't vanish when we leave our homes,"" said Jason Ouimet, executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. 
New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office intends to show that the state's law complies with the Second Amendment, adding, ""We will vigorously defend any challenge to New York state's gun laws that are intended to protect public safety.""
The Supreme Court in a landmark 2008 ruling recognized for the first time an individual's right to keep guns at home for self-defense, and in 2010 applied that right to the states. The plaintiffs in the New York case asked for that right to be extended beyond the home. 

A ruling invalidating New York's law could imperil similar laws in other states setting criteria for a concealed-carry license. Seven other states and the District of Columbia impose restrictions that give authorities more discretion to deny concealed firearm permits. 
The justices will hear the case during their next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due by the end of June 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Monday launched a civil probe of the Louisville, Kentucky, police department whose officers last year fatally shot Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman, in a botched raid, sparking street protests against police violence.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said the probe, which will focus on the police department and the Louisville-Jefferson County government, will evaluate whether the police routinely use unreasonable force, including on protesters, as well as if they routinely conduct unconstitutional searches.
The move came five days after the department began a similar review of the Minneapolis Police Department after its former officer, Derek Chauvin, was found guilty of murdering George Floyd, a Black man, last year.
The inquiries mark a sharp shift in the department's focus under Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made racial justice a priority and plans to discuss police reform in his first speech to Congress on Wednesday.
Garland said the investigation would also look at whether Louisville police regularly engage in racially discriminatory practices or deny access to public services for people with disabilities.
""Those investigations and recommendations and actions that ensue do not only protect individuals' civil rights; they also assist police departments in developing measures to increase transparency and accountability,"" Garland said.
He credited the Louisville police department with having taken some measures to improve since Taylor's death, including reaching a settlement with her family.
Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said he welcomed the department's probe.
""We've been building momentum for this type of audit for months,"" he told a news conference.
Louisville Police Department Chief Erika Shields acknowledged her department had to ""rebuild our product."" 
""What I will be pushing for is more resources, more training. ... More tools other than lethal force,"" she said.
Shields was appointed to the post earlier this year after stepping down as Atlanta police chief last June following the fatal police shooting of an African-American man, Rayshard Brooks, which was caught on video and set off days of protests.
Also weighing in was Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who told reporters on Monday that ""there have been significant challenges there in my hometown since the Breonna Taylor incident. And it's not certainly not inappropriate for the Justice Department to take a look at it.”
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION ONGOING
The civil probes into policing practices in Minneapolis and Louisville are separate from the department's criminal civil rights investigations into the killings of Floyd and Taylor.
A senior Justice Department official confirmed on Monday that its criminal investigation into Taylor's death remained ongoing.
A federal ""pattern or practice"" investigation typically involves two parts - one that looks at possible violations of civil rights and another that looks at whether those violations are linked to a police department's operations, policies or training of its officers.
If the department finds evidence of misconduct, it will issue a public report with those findings and negotiate remedies. Should the city and the Justice Department disagree on how to cure the violations, the department could file a lawsuit and get a court order, Garland said.
The deaths of Floyd and Taylor helped spark nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.
Only one of three officers involved in the Taylor shooting faced charges.
But officials at the FBI and the Louisville U.S. Attorney's Office have been investigating other officers involved, a law enforcement official told Reuters.

Former President Donald Trump's administration sharply curtailed the use of court-enforcement agreements to prevent police departments from violating peoples' civil rights.
Garland rescinded that policy this month, saying the department would be returning to its traditional practices of investigating state and local police departments and allowing unit heads to approve most settlements and consent decrees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Monday that will create a task force to promote labor organizing, the White House said, at a time when just over 6 percent of U.S. private-sector workers belong to unions.
The White House task force will be headed by Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will serve as vice chair of the group.
The task force will also include over 20 heads of agencies and cabinet officials, such as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the White House economic advisers Cecilia Rouse and Brian Deese, the White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen. 
""The President and Vice President believe that the decline of union membership is contributing to serious societal and economic problems in our country,"" the White House said in a fact sheet.
""Widespread and deep economic inequality, stagnant real wages, and the shrinking of America's middle class are all associated with the declining percentage of workers represented by unions.""
The White House referred to the National Labor Relations Act, which was passed in 1935, to encourage worker organizing. ""In the 86 years since the Act was passed, the federal government has never fully implemented this policy."" 
Biden's executive order specifically directs the task force to come up with a set of recommendations within 180 days to address two key issues: How existing policies can promote labor organizing in the federal government, and looking at new policies that are needed and the associated regulatory challenges. 
The task force's goals include facilitating worker organizing around the country, increasing union membership and addressing challenges to labor organizing in underserved communities.
Over 65 percent of Americans approve of unions, the most since 2003, according to a 2020 Gallup poll, despite the much lower membership rate.

Organized labor faced one of its biggest setbacks in recent history after an organizing drive at an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) facility failed earlier this month.

Biden's historic declaration on Saturday has infuriated its NATO ally Turkey, which has said the announcement had opened a ""deep wound"" in relations that have already been strained over a host of issues.
In his first comments since Biden's statement, Erdogan said ""the wrong step"" would hinder ties and advised the United States to ""look in the mirror"", adding Turkey still sought to establish ""good neigbourly"" ties with Armenia.
""The U.S. President has made baseless, unjust and untrue remarks about the sad events that took place in our geography over a century ago,"" Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting, and repeated a call for Turkish and Armenian historians to form a joint commission to investigate the events.
""I hope the U.S. President will turn back from this wrong step as soon as possible.""
He also slammed the United States for having failed to find a solution to the decades-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh - where the United States, Russia and France were mediators - and said Washington had stood by as massacres unfolded.
""If you say genocide, then you need to look at yourselves in the mirror and make an evaluation. The Native Americans, I don't even need to mention them, what happened is clear,"" he said, in reference to the treatment of Native Americans by European settlers. ""While all these truths are out there, you cannot pin the genocide accusation on the Turkish people.""
Turkey supported Baku in the conflict last year, in which Azeri forces seized swathes of lands in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Biden's statement came at a time when Ankara and Washington have been struggling to repair ties, strained when Turkey purchased Russian defence systems resulting in U.S. sanctions; policy differences in Syria; and legal matters.

Erdogan said he expected to ""open the door for a new period"" in ties and discuss all disputes with Biden at a NATO summit in June, but warned that ties would deteriorate further unless the allies can compartmentalise issues. 
""We now need to put aside our disagreements and look at what steps we can take from now on, otherwise we will have no choice but to do what is required by the level our ties have fallen to on April 24,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Veteran U.S. Representative Tim Ryan on Monday said he will run for the Senate seat being vacated by Ohio Republican Rob Portman, as he and his fellow Democrats battle to hang onto their slim majorities in Congress in the 2022 elections.
Since being elected to the House of Representatives in 2002, Ryan, 48, has cast himself as a voice for working-class voters, many of whom have fallen on hard times in his northeast Ohio congressional district that at one time was an epicenter of U.S. industrial might.
""Ohioans are working harder than ever, they’re doing everything right, and they’re still falling behind,"" Ryan said.
His first statewide race is likely to be difficult as Ohio has been trending Republican. Former President Donald Trump, who is expected to campaign for Republican Senate candidates, carried the state in 2016 and 2020.
Portman announced in January that he would not run for a third term next year, opening the way for Ryan to try to capture the seat for Democrats who now control 50 seats in the 100-member Senate.
With congressional redistricting efforts getting underway, Ryan faced the prospect of his district, which includes Youngstown, being eliminated.
Paul Sracic, a political science professor at Youngstown State University, said Ryan's bid will be challenging.
""The problem for Tim Ryan is it wasn't just one factor that caused them (voters) to move to Trump. It wasn't just trade and the feeling the national government abandoned them,"" Sracic said. He added that Ryan has tacked to the left on some social issues, such as abortion.
In 2016, Ryan took the unconventional step of challenging Nancy Pelosi for the House Democratic leader position she held before recapturing the House speakership in 2019. The move raised his profile in the House, and he went on to launch an unsuccessful run for president in 2019. 

Republicans who have expressed interest in Portman's seat include former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in 2018; Jan Timken, a former head of the state Republican Party, and Mike Gibbons, a businessman who also ran for Senate in 2018.

U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, told reporters the Jan. 6 attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory was too serious a topic for the panel reviewing it to have a divided focus.
""What happened on Jan. 6 is unprecedented in our history, and I think that it's very important that the commission be able to focus on that,"" Cheney told reporters at a House Republican retreat in Orlando, Florida. ""It's very important that the Jan. 6 commission focus on what happened on Jan. 6 and what led to that.""
Hundreds of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol that day, fighting with police and sending lawmakers running for safety in violence that left five dead and led to Trump's second impeachment trial on a charge of inciting insurrection.
Cheney was one of just 10 House of Representatives Republicans to vote to impeach Trump, a move that has drawn the ire of the former president and his supporters.
The proposed Jan. 6 commission needs strong bipartisan support in Congress, if it is to be credible. But its scope remains a stumbling block, despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's willingness to compromise on the proposed panel's makeup and subpoena powers. 
Cheney's comments came a day after House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News that the panel should also focus on the widespread and sometimes violent protests across the United States last year after the murder of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has also called for a wide focus, saying it would help the commission find ""broad bipartisan support."" 

Cheney said she is also concerned about last year's unrest but added: ""That's a different set of issues, a different set of problems and a different set of solutions.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge by Republican-governed Texas to a law enacted by Democratic-led California that bars state-funded travel to states deemed to be hostile to the rights of LGBT people.
The 2016 measure was enacted in the most populous U.S. state in response to laws in conservative states that allowed certain businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers. Those laws cited the need to protect religious liberty.
Two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, said they would have heard the case.
Texas sued after California in 2017 added it to its list, now numbering 12, of states covered by the ban. 
Texas was placed on the list after its Republican-controlled legislature passed a measure that allowed child welfare providers to deny service based on their religious beliefs - a move California said would allow groups to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Texas said in its lawsuit, which was filed directly at the Supreme Court as is allowed in some disputes between states, that California's law violated the U.S. Constitution's so-called commerce clause by discriminating against interstate commerce. West Virginia, Kansas and Tennessee were among 19 states that filed a brief backing Texas.
Former President Donald Trump's administration had urged the court to take up the case, saying the California law ""transgresses constitutional principles that are designed to bind the states together in a single union.""

In a case also filed directly at the Supreme Court in December, Texas asked the justices to toss out President-elect Joe Biden's election victories over Trump in four key states. The court also rejected that request.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear the U.S. government's bid to prevent two former CIA contractors from being questioned in a criminal investigation in Poland over their role in interrogating a suspected high-ranking al Qaeda figure who was repeatedly subjected to waterboarding.
The justices will take up the government's appeal of a lower court ruling that Central Intelligence Agency contractors James Elmer Mitchell and John Bruce Jessen could be subpoenaed under a U.S. law that allows federal courts to enforce a request for testimony or other evidence for a foreign legal proceeding.
The case centers on Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian man who was captured in 2002 Pakistan and has been held by the United States since then without charges, spending the past nearly 15 years as a detainee at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Zubaydah, who is now 50, lost an eye and underwent waterboarding - a form of simulated drowning that is widely considered torture - 83 times in a single month while held by the CIA, according to U.S. government documents. He was ""an associate and longtime terrorist ally of Osama bin Laden,"" the leader of the al Qaeda Islamist militant group killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011, a Justice Department filing said.
Zubaydah's lawyers want Mitchell and Jessen to testify and provide documents in a criminal investigation in Poland, which is believed to be the location of a CIA ""dark site"" where the agency used harsh interrogation techniques against Zubaydah.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that Mitchell and Jessen could be subpoenaed. Mitchell and Jessen previously were questioned in other litigation about their roles in the interrogation program.
The U.S. government has disclosed that Zubaydah was held overseas and was interrogated using ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" but has not revealed the location of the sites, citing national security concerns. In 2015, the European Court on Human Rights determined that Zubaydah was held in Poland in 2002 and 2003. 
Details of CIA activities were confirmed in a 2014 U.S. Senate report that concluded that the interrogation techniques were more brutal than originally disclosed. The report found that the CIA had misled the White House and public about its torture of detainees after al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The report concluded that not a single terrorist attack was foiled as a result of the interrogations.
The U.S. government has asserted what is known as the ""state-secrets privilege"" to prevent the contractors from being questioned, saying it would risk national security. 
The 9th Circuit overturned a Washington state-based federal judge's ruling in favor of the government after Zubaydah's lawyers filed a lawsuit in 2017 seeking Mitchell and Jessen's testimony.

Following the 2001 attacks, the United States rounded up and detained without charges hundreds of suspected ""enemy combatants"" overseas, many of whom were then transferred to a detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Zubaydah is one of 40 remaining detainees, according to the Pentagon.
The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022.

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. Marine recruits, both women and men, patrolled through a mock village that suddenly was struck by simulated machine gun fire and explosions.
When the dust cleared, women emerged carrying men across their shoulders, and vice versa, practicing how to extract casualties from the battlefield. Others lifted dummies on a litter as if they were wounded comrades, passing them over a wall, before moving on to sparring in a cage with other recruits and an obstacle course.
It is all part of ""the crucible,"" a 54-hour test of strength and spirit that recruits must pass before becoming U.S. Marines.
Now, for the first time, women from the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego have gone through the crucible and earned their Eagle, Globe and Anchor emblems at Camp Pendleton, the sprawling, hilly Marine base about 40 miles (65 km) north of San Diego.
Previously, female recruits and drill instructors were limited to the only other Marine boot camp, at Parris Island, South Carolina, which graduates 3,400 female Marines a year, about 10% of the total number of new Marines created on both coasts.
The first 53 female recruits on the West Coast became Marines on Thursday, breaking one of the last gender barriers in the U.S. armed forces, and in the branch of the service that has been most resistant to integrating women.
""There's definitely a certain pressure to succeed. There's a lot of expectations for us,"" said Annika Tarnanen, 19, from Minneapolis, one of 60 women who began recruit training back in January in San Diego. Seven dropped out due to injuries. 
The Marine Corps has consistently lagged the other military branches in integrating women and was 8.6% female in 2018, about half the figure of 16.5% when considering the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines as a whole, according to a 2020 General Accounting Office report.
When former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter ordered all combat roles open to women in December 2015, the Marine Corps was alone among the services in requesting exceptions in areas such as infantry, machine gunner, fire support and reconnaissance, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The exceptions were denied.
Among the new Marines at Camp Pendleton was Emily Zamudio, 19, now a private first class who will join the infantry as a rifleman - a combat role.
""I really wanted to inspire more females to do male roles,"" said Zamudio, from Madera, California. ""I want more females to know that no matter what your size, you can do it.""
Tens of thousands of U.S. women participated in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq this century. Though not directly assigned combat roles, some saw action and were killed as the battle lines shifted.
A HIKE AND A SCREAM
The crucible has been part of Marine Corps training since the 1990s. Although the Marine Corps has different physical fitness standards for people based on age and gender throughout their careers, recruits all face the same tests at this ritual.
Female recruits used to train separately at Parris Island, but starting in 2019 they were integrated with men.
On the West Coast, where San Diego recruits relocate to Camp Pendleton to complete the crucible, the pioneering all-female Platoon 3241 was integrated with the five all-male platoons that make up Lima Company, camping in the open air with the same three hours of sleep per night.
Like the men, the women concluded with a 9-mile (15-km) hike carrying rifles and 50-pound (23-kg) backpacks, charging up one final hill with guttural screams to a peak overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Drill instructors from each platoon then bestowed them with their emblems in a solemn rite of passage.
""You are part of Marine Corps history,"" Staff Sergeant Amber Staroscik, chief drill instructor for the platoon of women, told her newly minted Marines.
Staroscik did her recruit training at Parris Island and worked as drill instructor there until moving to the West Coast. 
""I knew the significance of it when I started. We were always denied,"" Staroscik said. ""Now they see us training side by side. We're carrying the same pack and hiking the same distance. Hopefully it erases some of the gender biases.""
Staroscik said one of her best recruits was Abigail Ragland, 20, who said the platoon felt a special obligation to achieve.
""With so many eyes on us we don't want to be looked at as failures,"" said Ragland, who comes from a military family in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Ragland chose to enlist in the Marine Corps because she was told it had a special brotherhood.

""And now,"" she said, ""a sisterhood.""

(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania teenager whose profanity-laced outburst on social media got her banished from her high school's cheerleading squad is in the spotlight at the U.S. Supreme Court this week, arguing ""I shouldn't have to be afraid to express myself.""
Brandi Levy, who made her Snapchat post away from school and on a weekend, is at the center of a major case testing the limits of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. The nine justices on Wednesday are set to hear arguments in the Mahanoy Area School District's appeal of a lower court ruling in favor of Levy that found that the First Amendment bars public school officials from regulating off-campus speech.
Levy's indelicate May 2017 Snapchat post came two days after Mahanoy Area High School, in Pennsylvania's coal region, held its cheerleading tryouts. The ninth-grader, who had been a junior varsity cheerleader, was still infuriated about being left off the varsity squad. 
At a convenience store in Mahanoy City on a Saturday, she posted a picture of her and a friend holding up their middle fingers, adding a caption using the same curse word four times to voice her displeasure with cheerleading, softball, school and ""everything."" 
She was 14 years old at the time. She is now an 18-year-old college student studying accounting.
""I feel like students should be protected and be able to express themselves without getting any form of punishment for it from the school,"" Levy said in an interview. ""It'll set an example for everyone that it's okay for people to express their feelings out of school.""
Coaches ousted Levy from the squad for a year, saying she had broken various rules and undermined team cohesion. Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Levy and her parents sued the district seeking reinstatement to the squad and a judgment that her First Amendment rights had been violated. 
A judge ordered Levy's reinstatement, finding that her actions had not been disruptive enough to warrant the punishment. Under a 1969 Supreme Court precedent, public schools may punish student speech that would ""substantially disrupt"" the school community. Levy's case will determine whether this authority extends beyond the schoolhouse gates. 
After the school district appealed, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the 1969 precedent, in a case known as Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, does not apply to off-campus speech and that school officials may not regulate such speech. 
""I shouldn't have to be afraid to express myself and I should be able to do it how I want to without being punished by anybody. What I said, it wasn't targeting, it wasn't bullying, harassment, or anything like that,"" Levy told Reuters.
CURBING BULLYING
A decision in favor of Levy, according to the district and its supporters, could make it harder for teachers and administrators to curb bullying, racism, cheating and invasions of privacy, all frequently occurring online, outside school property or during off hours.
President Joe Biden's administration supports the district, arguing that off-campus student speech deserves broad protection unless it threatens the school community or targets specific individuals, groups or school functions.
""Principals have to ensure the safety and well being of everybody on their campus,"" said Ronn Nozoe, chief executive officer of the National Association of Secondary School Principals. ""It can't be the Wild West."" 
The district has argued that off-campus student speech can harm a school and its functions, noting that in the internet era the lines between on-campus and off-campus are blurred. 
""If a student on the weekend uses her private email to blast harassing messages to school email accounts, where did the speech happen?"" the district asked in a legal filing.
Levy's photo was visible for 24 hours on Snapchat, along with another post questioning a younger girl's selection to the varsity squad. Some cheerleaders and students chafed at the posts and the controversy disrupted classes, according to court papers. 
The ACLU said giving educators the power to police off-campus speech would extend censorship everywhere young people go and prompt schools to conduct ""dragnet online surveillance"" of students. 

The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will urge its Group of Seven allies to increase pressure on China over the use of forced labor in its northwestern Xinjiang province, home to the Muslim Uighur minority, a top White House official said on Friday.
U.S. President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the G7 advanced economies in person in Britain in June, where he is expected to focus on what he sees as a strategic rivalry between democracies and autocratic states, particularly China.
Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser to Biden and deputy director of the National Economic Council, said the G7 meeting in Cornwall would focus on health security, a synchronized economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, concrete actions on climate change, and ""elevating shared democratic values within the G7.""
""These are like-minded allies, and we want to take tangible and concrete actions that show our willingness to coordinate on non-market economies, such as China,"" Singh, who is helping to coordinate the meeting, told Reuters in an interview.
""The galvanizing challenge for the G7 is to show that open societies, democratic societies still have the best chance of solving the biggest problems in our world, and that top-down autocracies are not the best path,"" he said.
Singh said Washington has already taken strong actions against China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, but would seek to expand the effort with G7 allies. Joint sanctions against Chinese officials accused of abuses in the province were announced last month by the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada.
China denies all accusations of abuse and has responded with punitive measures of its own against the EU. 
Singh said details were still being worked out ahead of the meeting, but the summit offered an opportunity for U.S. allies to show solidarity on the issue. 
""We've made our views clear that our consumers deserve to know when that the goods they're importing are made with forced labor,"" he said. ""Our values need to be infused in our trading relationships."" 
Washington, he said, would be looking for the G7 to take clear steps ""to elevate our shared values, as democracies and, and those certainly apply to what's going on Xinjiang.""
Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labor and sterilizations. China says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.

The White House said on Friday that Biden will travel to the United Kingdom and Belgium in June for his first overseas trip since taking office, including a stop at the G7 Summit in Cornwall, UK, from June 11-13.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Veteran U.S. diplomat Jeffrey Feltman was named a special envoy for the Horn of Africa on Friday, as Washington looks to step up diplomatic efforts in a region hit by the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray and other crises.
Feltman also will lead international efforts to address tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan and around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
Fighting in Tigray, between rebels and government forces from both Ethiopia and its neighbor Eritrea, has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands more from their homes in the region of about 5 million. 
After serving in senior roles at the State Department, Feltman was U.N. political affairs chief from 2012 to 2018, a job that helps form U.N. policy and oversees U.N. mediation efforts.

Feltman visited North Korea in 2017, the highest-level U.N. official to visit since 2011, describing his four-day trip as “the most important mission I have ever undertaken.”
Before working at the United Nations, he was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the Obama administration and before that served as U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s office in the Irbil province of Iraq and as a senior official at the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem.

Jenner, 71, said the Democratic governor's ""over-restrictive lockdown"" has devastated small business and deprived children of in-class schooling.
""Californians want better and deserve better from their government,"" Jenner said in a statement posted on social media.
""I am a proven winner and the only outsider who can put an end to Gavin Newsom's disastrous time as governor,"" she said.
Before transitioning in 2015, Jenner was married to Kris Kardashian after two other marriages and became a step parent to her children from her previous marriage, which created the setting for the ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" reality TV show.
Jenner's achievements as an acclaimed athlete included winning the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.
The effort to recall Newsom began in February 2020, led by a conservative group called the California Patriot Coalition that opposed Newsom's liberal politics.
As the campaign picked up steam amid frustration with the state's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, closed schools and changing public health rules, prominent progressives from across the country stepped up in support of Newsom. 
Other Republicans in the recall race include San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, businessman John Cox and former U.S. Representative Doug Ose.

California's secretary of state is in the process of verifying the signatures necessary to force Newsom into a recall election. If there is one, voters would be asked whether the governor should be recalled and if so, who should succeed him.
The last time Californians recalled their governor was in 2003, when Democrat Gray Davis was replaced by Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.

(Reuters) - Leaders of U.S. police groups will meet with Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday to discuss his sweeping civil investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis and similar probes, according to a spokesman for the National Sheriffs’ Association.
The investigation, which follows this week's jury verdict that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, marks a return to more assertive federal oversight of state and local police, a policy the Justice Department largely abandoned during Republican Donald Trump's presidency.
""We are looking forward to continuing the conversation and collaborative relationship between the Justice Department and sheriffs to work on solutions to continue to keep our communities safe,"" Sheriff's Association spokesman Patrick Royal said ahead of the virtual meeting.
The national Fraternal Order of Police said its executive director, Jim Pasco, would attend the session.
Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Floyd's death was one in a long series of killings of Black men and women by law enforcement that sparked nationwide protests over racial injustice.
""Officers welcome accountability because accountability is an essential part of building trust with the community and public safety requires public trust,"" Garland said when he launched the investigation on Wednesday.
Friday's meeting with leaders of law enforcement groups was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Chauvin's conviction on all three counts of murder or manslaughter was a milestone in the fraught racial history of the United States and a rebuke of law enforcement's treatment of Black Americans. 
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said they welcomed the federal investigation, and pledged to cooperate.
There have been questions by groups representing law enforcement officers and conservative politicians over the effectiveness of federal efforts to reform police departments, which are typically achieved through court-approved settlements known as consent decrees.
During Democratic President Barack Obama's presidency, some police unions complained that the decrees stigmatize police and impose overly restrictive limits on use of force.

Garland on April 16 rescinded a Trump-era memo that curtailed the use of consent decrees in investigations of law enforcement agencies.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden wants to put ""real money"" toward helping laid-off workers get new jobs in growth industries like green energy and healthcare as part of his $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure package, a top economic adviser said. 
Biden is attempting a delicate balancing act as he calls for a reshaping of the nation's energy industry by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and coal-powered electric plants to meet aggressive climate emission goals. 
Those industries offer high-paying, union jobs that Biden promised to replace while courting the blue-collar vote on the campaign trail. 
""What we're trying to do here is put some real money where our mouths are,"" Jared Bernstein, who serves on the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Reuters. ""You don't just train somebody for a job that might or might not exist. Instead, you look around the corner and see where labor demand is going to be next year.""
A $40 billion job-training plan in the infrastructure proposal would help workers who lost jobs through no fault of their own land a new job in a growth industry, and direct income to help them pay the bills while training and utilize case managers to navigate the system, he said.
The training funding is part of a package of measures included in Biden's plan that seeks to boost unions. The Democratic president has promised to build union jobs in the United States, which he sees as key to building back a stronger middle class. 
In 2020, some 35 percent of public-sector employees could collectively bargain for wages and benefits, while just 6.3 percent of the private sector was unionized. But roughly half of U.S. states block public employees from collective bargaining. 
That ""is by far the biggest barrier,"" said a senior White House official. 
The White House wants to guarantee public workers across the country the right to collective bargaining, expand apprentice programs and ensure that all federally funded construction projects use union labor.
Biden is seeking a further $38 billion in funding to expand union apprentice programs, a gateway to a union job, which the White House says will create 1 million to 2 million registered apprenticeship slots, to fill the demand created by the spending on new construction projects. 

Biden and Democrats delivered on a high-priority item for unions when they included an $83 billion pension bailout in the COVID relief bill passed in March. Labor leaders, facing declining enrollment that is crushing their self-funded retirement systems, say the money will shore up to 200 plans.

Reports of violence against Asian Americans have spiked since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Activists and police said anti-Asian sentiment was fed by comments from former President Donald Trump blaming the pandemic on China using terms such as “kung flu.”.
The measure, authored by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono and Representative Grace Meng, designates a Justice Department employee to expedite a review of hate crimes reported to police during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides guidance for local law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes, expand public education campaigns and combat discriminatory language in describing the pandemic.
""This legislation will improve the Justice Department’s response to the appalling rise in hate incidents targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community,"" said the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin.
In one sign of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 92-6 on April 14 to advance the measure, and senators from both parties worked on changes.
""Earnest bipartisan conversations have improved this legislation considerably behind the scenes,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week.

One change, the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, would provide funds to improve reporting of hate crimes and expand resources for victims. It was named after Khalid Jabara, an Arab-American killed by a neighbor in 2016, and Heather Heyer, killed in 2017 when a car drove into counter-protesters after a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

If the initial recommendations made by the independent commission are accepted by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, it would be a major change in the military. 
Advocates and lawmakers have for years been calling for the military commanders to be taken out of the decision making process when it comes to prosecuting sexual assault cases, arguing that they are inclined to overlook the issue. 
The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Austin had not made a decision yet and would consult with leaders of the different military branches before making one. 
""The secretary has asked the services to provide their candid assessment and feedback of these initial recommendations by the end of May,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said. 
In March, the head of the commission, Lynn Rosenthal, said that all options were on the table when dealing with sexual assault in the military. 
Sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military is largely under-reported and came under renewed scrutiny recently.

Last year, an investigative panel looking into violent crimes and abuse at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas said it found a command structure that was ""permissive"" of sexual assaults.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden is expected to nominate Jennifer Homendy to chair the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Homendy has served on the board since 2018 and previously was a senior House of Representatives Democratic staffer working on transportation issues.
The White House and Homendy did not respond to requests for comment. An NTSB spokesman referred questions to the White House.
The NTSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating all civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in other modes of transportation.
Bloomberg reported Homendy's expected nomination earlier.
Homendy was the on-scene board member during the investigation into the January 2020 helicopter crash that killed Los Angeles basketball great Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others, as well as a September 2019 boat fire off the California coast that killed 34.
In recent years, the NTSB has been investigating a number of crashes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles using its driver assistance system Autopilot. The board announced Monday that it would investigate a Tesla crash in Texas that killed two people Saturday; local police said it occurred with no one in the driver's seat.
In a concurring statement filed in March 2020 on a board investigation into a fatal Tesla crash, Homendy said, ""The most dangerous way to travel in our country is on the road,"" noting that more than 36,000 people are killed annually.
She has criticized the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for failing to ensure that driver assistance systems or nascent self-driving vehicles are safe.
In an NTSB probe into a fatal March 2018 Uber (NYSE:UBER) self-driving crash, Homendy said the NHTSA had ""put technology advancement here before saving lives.""

The BLM, a division of the Interior Department, manages more than a 10th of the nation's surface area, overseeing permitting for energy development, grazing, timber harvesting and recreation.
The position will be central to the Biden administration's effort to address climate change through management of public lands, including a current review of the federal oil and gas leasing program.
Stone-Manning most recently was the senior adviser for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation, where she advocated against the Trump administration's push to maximize fossil fuel production on public lands at the expense of other land uses.
Prior to joining the NWF in 2017, Stone-Manning served as chief of staff to the Democratic former governor of Montana, Steve Bullock. She had also worked for Senator John Tester of Montana.

Also on Thursday, the White House said it would nominate Bryan Newland as assistant secretary for Indian affairs. Newland is a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community in northern Michigan and recently served as the tribal chairperson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including the largest-ever increase in levies on investment gains, to fund about $1 trillion in childcare, universal pre-kindergarten education and paid leave for workers, sources familiar with the proposal said.
The plan is part of the White House's push for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax system to make rich people and big companies pay more and help foot the bill for Biden's ambitious economic agenda. The proposal calls for increasing the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, the sources said this week. It would also nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million.
That would be the highest tax rate on investment gains, which are mostly paid by the wealthiest Americans, since the 1920s. The rate has not exceeded 33.8% in the post-World War Two era.
News of the proposal - which was a staple of Biden's presidential campaign platform - triggered sharp declines on Wall Street, with the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1% in early afternoon, its steepest drop in more than a month.
Any such hike would need to go through Congress, where Biden's Democratic Party holds narrow majorities and is unlikely to win support from Republicans. It is also unclear if it would have the unanimous backing of congressional Democrats, which would be essential in the Senate where each party holds 50 seats. 
""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC, referring to stock market indexes. 
Sources said details would be released next week before Biden's address to Congress on Wednesday. Details of the plan may change in coming days. White House officials are debating other possible tax increases that could ultimately be included such as capping deductions for wealthy taxpayers or increasing the estate tax, sources told Reuters.
Biden has promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000.
Tax details related to the plan, which has been in the works for months, were first reported by the New York Times on Thursday morning. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president would discuss his ""American Families Plan"" during his speech to Congress but declined to comment on any details. 
She said the administration had not yet finalized funding plans but stressed Biden's determination to make the wealthy and companies pay for new programs.
""His view is that that should be on the backs ... of the wealthiest Americans who can afford it and corporations and businesses who can afford it,"" Psaki said.
She said Biden and his economic team did not believe the measures would have a negative impact on investment in the United States. 
Yields on Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction to their price, fell to the day's low.
CAPITAL GAINS
Biden's new plan, likely to generate about $1 trillion, comes after a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal that has already run into stiff opposition from Republicans. They generally support funding infrastructure projects but oppose Biden's inclusion of priorities like expanding eldercare and asking corporate America to pay the tab.
Tax hikes on the wealthy could harden Republicans' resistance against Biden's latest ""human"" infrastructure plan, forcing Democrats to consider pushing it - or least some of the measures - through Congress using a party-line budget vote known as reconciliation. 
Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who wields outsize power due to the party's slim majority, said recently said he was wary of expanding the use of reconciliation.
Biden's proposal should be viewed as an aggressive negotiating tactic, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
""You should expect that you will get at least initially the biggest, baddest, most progressive policy proposals with the understanding that they won't get everything they want but define the scope of the negotiation. Maybe Biden doesn’t get 39%, he will get 29%"" tax rate, he said. 
Wealthy Americans could face an overall federal capital gains tax rate of 43.4% including the 3.8% net investment tax on individuals with income of $200,000 or more ($250,000 married filing jointly). The latter helps fund the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. 
Currently, those earning more than $200,000 pay a capital gains rate of about 23.8% including the Obamacare net investment tax instituted as part of that law. For tax year 2021, the top marginal tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 and $628,300 for married couples filing jointly.
Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said the proposal would put U.S. capital gains taxes at the top of the global charts. Average capital gains taxes in Europe are around 19.3%, and the highest rate there is in Denmark, which collects 42%. France and Finland charge 34%.

For residents of some states and cities that assess their own capital gains levy, Biden's plan would push the total capital gains rate to more than 50%, York said. The rate would rise to 56.7% in California, 68.2% in New York City and 57.3% in Portland, Oregon, York said.

McGuire was one of the senior-most Black executives on Wall Street till he left Citi last year after 15 years in various roles to join the mayor's race.
""Under our regular annual bonus program, a large portion of compensation earned by an employee each year is not paid when earned, but rather is delivered over a four-year period,"" a spokeswoman for Citi said on Thursday.   
""The treatment of Mr. McGuire's deferred amounts follows our standard policy for employees who retire after long service with Citi.""
He will receive the money in four equal installments between 2022 and 2025, the filing showed. 
McGuire headed Citi's corporate and investment banking unit for 13 years and was also chairman of banking, capital markets and advisory. Prior to Citi, he was with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The move into politics for McGuire, who until recently held the title of vice chairman at Citi, came after he was on a short list of candidates to head the New York Federal Reserve in 2018.
A successful candidacy would make McGuire only the second Black mayor of America's largest city, after David Dinkins' stint in the 1990s.
McGuire is not the first Wall Street executive to dabble in politics. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg was New York mayor from 2001-2013, and Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, is the current governor of New Jersey.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday made it easier for states to impose sentences of life in prison without parole on juvenile offenders, ruling against a Mississippi man convicted of killing his grandfather at age 15 in a case testing the Constitution's Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The justices in a 6-3 ruling rejected arguments by the inmate, Brett Jones, that his sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole violated the Eighth Amendment because the judge in his trial had not made a separate finding that he was permanently incorrigible. The court's six conservative justices were in the majority, with the three liberal members dissenting.
Jones, now 31, was convicted of fatally stabbing his grandfather in 2004 in a dispute involving the boy's girlfriend. 
The ruling, authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, marked the end of the court's recent run of decisions that put limits on life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders. The court has moved rightward with a 6-3 conservative majority after the addition since 2017 of three justices appointed by former President Donald Trump.
The ruling will lead to ""uneven and arbitrary imposition of life without parole on children, based more on geography and the race of the defendant than their culpability and capacity for change,"" the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth advocacy group, which supported Jones, said in a statement.
Juvenile life sentences without the possibility of parole have come under heavy scrutiny in recent years as part of a larger debate over criminal justice and sentencing reform in the United States. Of the 50 states, 25 have banned such sentences, with Maryland becoming the latest to do so earlier this month.
Kavanaugh said in the ruling it was the responsibility of states - not courts - to ""make those broad moral and policy judgments"" about juvenile sentencing reform.
""Jones's argument that the sentencer must make a finding of permanent incorrigibility is inconsistent with the court's precedents,"" Kavanaugh added. 
As long as the state considers the youth of the offender during sentencing, no other analysis is required, Kavanaugh wrote.
In a scathing dissenting opinion, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the court effectively gutted previous rulings that imposed new restrictions on juvenile sentencing.
""The court is fooling no one,"" Sotomayor wrote, saying that without a finding of permanent incorrigibility, judges can effectively circumvent the court's previous rulings that limited such sentences. 
Sotomayor noted that 15 state courts have found that the earlier Supreme Court rulings required a finding of incorrigibility.
""The question is whether the state, at some point, must consider whether a juvenile offender has demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation sufficient to merit a chance at life beyond the prison in which he has grown up. For most, the answer is yes,"" Sotomayor wrote.
In a 2012 ruling, the Supreme Court had decided that mandatory life sentences without parole in homicide cases involving juvenile offenders represented cruel and unusual punishment. The court had previously ruled that juveniles could not be executed and only juveniles accused of murder could be subjected to life sentences without the possibility of parole.
In 2016, the justices decided that the 2012 ruling applied retroactively, meaning that convicted criminals imprisoned years earlier could then argue for their release. 

Conservative former Justice Anthony Kennedy, who Kavanaugh replaced in 2018, was a key vote in the earlier rulings, siding with the liberal justices in favor of curbing juvenile sentences, although he stopped short of saying they were always unconstitutional. 
Kennedy wrote in the 2016 ruling that life in prison should be reserved for juveniles whose crimes reflected ""irreparable corruption.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday made it more difficult for the Federal Trade Commission to force scam artists and companies that engage in deceptive business practices to return ill-gotten gains obtained from consumers, ruling in favor of a criminally convicted payday lender who challenged the agency. 
The 9-0 ruling, authored by liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, prompted Democrats in both chambers of the U.S. Congress to promise to pursue legislation to restore the FTC's powers to seek monetary remedies in court on behalf of consumers.
The Supreme Court ""ruled in favor of scam artists and dishonest corporations, leaving average Americans to pay for illegal behavior,"" acting FTC Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said. ""With this ruling, the court has deprived the FTC of the strongest tool we had to help consumers when they need it most.""
The ruling was a victory for businessman and racecar driver Scott Tucker, who was convicted in 2017 on racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering charges. The business practices of Tucker and his company, AMG Capital Management, targeting low-income borrowers led to the largest court-ordered settlement in the FTC's history, totaling $1.27 billion. 
The justices found that the agency overstepped its authority in its practice of seeking court orders to make fraudsters return money improperly obtained from consumers in the form of restitution or disgorgement. Business groups have complained that the FTC aggressively extracted billions of dollars in monetary awards from companies in recent years. 
The ruling limits the agency's authority to seek restitution under one section of a U.S. law called the Federal Trade Commission Act that lets it sue lawbreakers and authorizes judges to issue permanent injunctions. The justices ruled that the provision does not give judges the authority to order defendants to return money to consumers.
The FTC said that it had used the so-called 13(b) authority to return $11.2 billion to consumers in the past five years.
Now the FTC will have to use other lengthier and more complicated legal avenues to obtain restitution for consumers unless Congress takes action. The FTC's commissioners last year asked Congress to pass a law specifically allowing the agency to demand disgorgement.
""Protecting consumers and compensating them for harm is a paramount duty of the FTC,"" said Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee. ""We are working to move legislation immediately to make sure this authority is properly protected."" 
""This ruling is a gut punch to the FTC,"" Democratic Senator Ed Markey added.
Breyer wrote in the ruling that if the agency believes other processes are ""too cumbersome or otherwise inadequate, it is, of course, free to ask Congress to grant it further remedial authority.""
Tucker and his company appealed a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed the agency's authority to recoup ill-gotten gains. 
Payday loans involve the lending of a relatively small amounts of money at high interest rates, sometimes to be repaid when the borrower gets their next paycheck. Payday loans have been linked to increases in defaults and personal bankruptcies.
The Justice Department has said Tucker operated a nationwide internet payday lending enterprise that systematically evaded state laws for more than 15 years to charge illegal interest rates as high as 1,000 percent on loans. Tucker in 2018 was sentenced to 16 years and eight months in prison.

After several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the businesses from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly voted, for the second time in less than a year, to make the District of Columbia the 51st state, sending it to the Senate where it faces stiff Republican opposition.
By a vote of 216-208, the Democratic-controlled House approved the initiative with no Republican support.
The population of Washington, D.C., is heavily Democratic. As a state, it likely would elect two Democratic senators, potentially altering the balance of power in the Senate, which now has 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.
Democrats, who have been advocating statehood for the capital of the United States for decades, hope to take advantage of last November's election of President Joe Biden as well as control of the Senate and House to admit a new state for the first time since 1959, the year Alaska and Hawaii joined the union.
Democrats argued statehood would fix a centuries-old wrong of ""more than 700,000 Americans citizens who pay federal taxes, who fight and die in wars, who serve on our juries and yet have no vote in the Senate or the House of Representatives,"" said Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky. ""That is the definition of taxation without representation.""
The new state would be named ""Washington, Douglass Commonwealth"" after George Washington, the first U.S. president, and Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person who became a famous abolitionist.
Republicans, accusing Democrats of a ""power grab"" to advance a ""far-left"" agenda, are expected to block the bill in the Senate, where 60 of 100 members need to agree to advance most legislation.
""This is about government-run healthcare, a $93 trillion Green New Deal, packing the Supreme Court, higher taxes and a bigger, less efficient form of government,"" said Republican Representative Nancy Mace during a spirited House debate.
The House first passed this bill last June by a vote of 232-180. Republicans, who controlled the Senate then, refused to act on it.
Statehood would also give Washington at least one House member. Its population of around 700,000 is more than that of the states of Wyoming and Vermont. About half of its residents are Black.
Currently, Washington, D.C., has only one member of Congress - a House ""delegate"" who is not allowed to vote on legislation.

If the city became a state it would maintain its three electoral votes, which are used in the presidential election process. States' electoral votes are based on population.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A Bangladeshi man convicted of setting off a pipe bomb during rush hour in New York City's busiest subway station, Times Square, was sentenced on Thursday to life plus 30 years in prison.
Akayed Ullah, 31, of Brooklyn, had claimed he wanted to kill only himself and was not acting on behalf of Islamic State when he detonated his homemade bomb on Dec. 11, 2017.
No one died and four people were injured in the explosion, which led to the temporary closure of the station and the adjacent Port Authority Bus Terminal during the morning rush. Ullah was burned in what prosecutors called a ""lone wolf"" attack.
U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan, who imposed the sentence, told Ullah he had committed a ""truly barbaric and heinous crime"" without regard for the humanity of those in his way.
""They were just people on the way to work, or school,"" Sullivan said. ""People who maybe had finished the night shift. ... To you, these people were expendable.""
Ullah, who is married and has a 3-year-old son, had faced a mandatory minimum 35-year term.
He told Sullivan he did not condone violence, and apologized to New York City, law enforcement and the United States.
""What I did on December 11, it was wrong,"" Ullah said. ""I can tell you from the bottom of my heart, I'm deeply sorry.""
Prosecutors said Ullah was angry with then-President Donald Trump and with U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and that Islamic State propaganda inspired him to kill, maim and terrorize as many commuters as possible.
""Akayed Ullah's message of hatred clearly backfired,"" U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.
At the time of the attack, Ullah had a green card, allowing him to live in the United States.
He lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn, while his wife and then-infant son lived in Bangladesh.
Ullah's lawyer Amy Gallicchio, a federal public defender, called him a ""deeply troubled soul"" who had been attracted on the internet to the ""distorted and radical messages"" of extremism.
""He is not an evil man,"" Gallicchio said, a sentiment the judge also expressed. ""He is not a monster.""
But federal prosecutor Rebekah Donaleski questioned why Ullah chose Times Square to set off the bomb if suicide was his goal.
The bomb materials had come from a nearby construction site where Ullah worked as an electrician.

""It is important to send a message that when you attack New York City, there will be no leniency,"" Donaleski said.
Ullah was convicted in November 2018. Sullivan presided over Ullah's case when he was a federal district judge.

President Joe Biden announced last week that the United States will withdraw its remaining 2,500 troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks that triggered America's longest war.

(Reuters) - Two days after a Minneapolis jury found a white police officer guilty of murdering George Floyd, the city will lay to rest Daunte Wright, another Black man whose violent death has raised fresh concerns over the way police treat people of color.
The funeral for Wright, 20, who was shot by a white police officer in a Minneapolis suburb on April 11 after a routine traffic stop, will be attended by a number of high-profile civil rights activists as well as family and friends.
The service is scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. CDT (1:00 p.m. ET) at Shiloh Temple International Ministries, a historically Black church in north Minneapolis. The Reverend Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy, as he did at Floyd's funeral last year.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz issued a proclamation calling on residents of the state to honor two minutes of silence at the start of the funeral, saying Wright's death was connected to the ""deep, systemic racism"" faced daily by Black people.
""While nothing can bring Daunte Wright back to his loved ones, we must continue to work to enact real, meaningful change at the local, state, and national levels to fight systemic racism so that every person in Minnesota – Black, Indigenous, Brown, or White – can be safe and thrive,"" Walz said.
On Tuesday a Minneapolis jury convicted Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the police force, on all three counts of murder and manslaughter for killing Floyd by pressing his knee into his neck for more than nine minutes last May.
At a public viewing on Wednesday Wright's aunt, Kristie Bryant, described Wright as a doting father to his two-year-old son, who he ""loved with all his heart"". She said Wright was always smiling and loved to play basketball.
""I feel sadness. I feel like my heart was tore out of my chest,"" Bryant said after viewing Wright in an open, white casket covered in red roses.
While Chauvin's conviction brought a measure of satisfaction to people calling for an end to brutality and racism in policing, to many Wright's death served as a reminder of the risks facing Black people during encounters with police. 
Police video of the shooting shows multiple officers attempting to arrest Wright for an outstanding warrant and an ensuing scuffle. The video then shows Kimberly Potter threatening to stun Wright with her Taser before firing her handgun. She can be heard saying she shot him a few moments later. Before resigning, former Police Chief Tim Gannon said Potter mistakenly used her gun instead of her Taser.
Potter, who also resigned after the incident, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Potter has not entered a plea and her lawyer, Earl Gray, has not commented about the case.
The shooting of Wright set off more than a week of demonstrations outside the Brooklyn Center police headquarters that turned violent at times, with some protesters hurling objects and the police using tear gas and less-lethal rounds.
""When you watch that video your conscience tells you it is the right thing to do to stand up for Daunte Wright, to speak up for Daunte Wright, and to fight for Daunte Wright,"" Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing the Wright family, said at the viewing on Wednesday.

Crump is also scheduled to deliver remarks at the funeral.

""Consultations with our ambassador are actively being held in Russia,"" RIA quoted Maria Zakharova as saying on state television. 

""We hope that the U.S. ambassador will spend his time usefully in Washington, and that he will focus on consultations with the bodies that oversee the issues in the bilateral relations with Russia to somehow formulate a position that won't lead ties to a dead end.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan U.S. congressional push to counteract China picked up steam on Wednesday as a Senate committee overwhelmingly backed a bill pressing Beijing on human rights and economic competition, while other lawmakers introduced a measure seeking billions for technology research. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee backed the ""Strategic Competition Act of 2021"" by 21-1, sending the bill for consideration by the 100-member Senate, even as committee members voiced a need to do even more to counteract Beijing. 
The committee added dozens of amendments to the bill. One would force a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics by U.S. officials, not athletes, which was also recommended by the U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom.
Separately, a group of Senate and House of Representatives lawmakers introduced the ""Endless Frontier Act,"" calling for $100 billion over five years for basic and advanced technology research and $10 billion to create new ""technology hubs"" across the country.
Both bills have strong support from both political parties and are expected to become law. The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided U.S. Congress, which is narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats. 
The Biden administration supports the measures.
""With this overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Strategic Competition Act becomes the first of what we hope will be a cascade of legislative activity for our nation to finally meet the China challenge across every dimension of power, political, diplomatic, economic, innovation, military and even cultural,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate panel. 
He and Senator Jim Risch, the panel's top Republican, wrote the ""Strategic Competition"" measure together, with Risch saying it was ""truly bipartisan."" 
The legislation was greeted with anger in Beijing. 
""It distorts facts and confuses right and wrong,"" said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry. 
""It hypes up the China threat theory and talks about full strategic competition with China. It grossly interferes with China's affairs and reeks of Cold War and zero sum mentalities."" 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND MILITARY SPENDING
The 280-page Senate bill addresses competition with China through efforts such as increasing international development funding and working with allied countries and international organizations. It pushes humanitarian and democratic values, like imposing sanctions over the treatment of the minority Muslim Uighurs and supporting democracy in Hong Kong. [L1N2M113C]
The bill stresses the need to ""prioritize the military investments necessary to achieve United States political objectives in the Indo-Pacific."" It backs steep increases in security-related funding for the region and closer ties with Taiwan. 
It would expand the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes financial transactions for potential national security risks. U.S. universities are concerned about a provision of the bill requiring CFIUS to review some Chinese grants and contracts. 
The Strategic Competition and Endless Frontier acts are part of a fast-track effort announced in February by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to pass a wide range of legislation to counter China. Schumer is a lead sponsor of the Endless Frontier bill.

Foreign Relations committee members said they want to do more. 
""I don't believe anyone would think that this legislation is going to change China's march toward a global hegemony of autocracy and repression,"" Republican Senator Mitt Romney said. ""...I would suggest we have a lot more work to do.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A panel of U.S. senators questioned officials from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Wednesday about the dominance of their mobile app stores and whether the companies abuse their power at the expense of smaller competitors.
Amy Klobuchar, the top Senate Democrat on antitrust issues, said Apple and Google can use their power to ""exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products"" and ""charge excessive fees that affect competition.""
App makers like music streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and dating services giant Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which owns the Tinder app, have long complained that mandatory revenue sharing for sales of digital goods and strict inclusion rules set by Apple's App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google's Play store for Android devices, amount to anticompetitive behavior.
Representatives for Apple and Google told senators the companies' tight control over their stores and the associated revenue-sharing requirements are needed to enforce and pay for security measures to protect consumers from harmful apps and practices.
But when asked by Senator Josh Hawley, Apple's Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer would not commit to spending all of the mandatory fees on security. 
Explanations from Andeer and Google's Wilson White, senior director for government affairs, about why the companies' fees do not apply to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and apps that sell physical goods also failed to satisfy senators.
""I feel like unfrozen caveman lawyer,"" Senator Mike Lee said. ""I'm not grasping it.""
Senator Richard Blumenthal expressed concern about a call Match said it received late on Tuesday from its business counterpart at Google.
Match's Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine said Google wanted to know why Sine's planned testimony, which had just been released, deviated from previous comments the dating company had made.
""It looks like a threat, it talks like a threat, it's a threat,"" Blumenthal said of the call, vowing to investigate Google's action further.
Google's White said the call reflected an effort to ask an honest question and the company would never threaten partners.
In his testimony, Match's Sine argued that Google and Apple both exact an onerous 30% of any digital transaction, raising prices for consumers.
Match pays nearly $500 million in fees to the app stores annually, the company's single largest expense, Sine said.
Spotify and Match said Apple's app review process was opaque. Sine said Apple blocked a safety update to the Tinder app meant to warn LGBTQ+ users if they were traveling to a country where it might be dangerous to expose their identity because Apple said the update violated the ""spirit"" of a new rule. 
But Apple would not explain how to fix the issue, Sine said. He said that Apple approved the update two months later only after senior leaders at Match's parent company at the time, IAC/Interactivecorp, raised the issue with Apple's senior leaders.
The hearing came a day after Apple said it would begin selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - in direct competition with Tile, which has sold a similar tracking device for more than a decade.
Apple said its AirTags were an outgrowth of its ""FindMy"" app, which is used for locating lost Apple devices and to share user locations and was introduced in 2010, before Tile's founding. Apple last month opened its operating system up to alternative item trackers and said that Chipolo, a startup competing with Tile and AirTags, is using the system.

Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru testified Apple's FindMy program is installed by default on Apple phones and cannot be deleted. 
""Apple has once again exploited its market power and dominance to condition our customers’ access to data on effectively breaking our user experience and directing our users to FindMy,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -One day after a former police officer was convicted of murdering George Floyd, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers was in talks on a policing reform bill, but the issue of qualified immunity for officers accused of excessive force remained a sticking point.
Republican Senator Tim Scott and Democratic Senator Cory Booker said on Wednesday that talks were making progress. Democratic Representative Karen Bass, whose George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, has also been involved.
Scott and Booker are also in informal discussions with a bipartisan group of House lawmakers known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, an aide familiar with the talks said.
""I think we are on the verge of wrapping this up in the next week or two, depending on how quickly they respond to our suggestions,"" Scott told reporters.
Scott introduced a policing bill last summer during global protests sparked by the death of Floyd, an African-American man whom white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. 
That bill failed in the Senate after Democrats said it relied too much on incentives rather than mandating changes.
Chauvin's conviction on Tuesday prompted new calls for action in Congress on police reform. The George Floyd bill, which aims to put a stop to aggressive law enforcement tactics, has not yet been considered by the Senate.
Republicans have criticized Bass' bill because it strips police officers of qualified immunity. 
Qualified immunity protects police officers and other types of government officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances, allowing lawsuits only when an individual's ""clearly established"" statutory or constitutional rights have been violated. 
Unions for police officers and sheriffs have both opposed the changes to qualified immunity made in the House bill.
Scott said his proposal would make it easier for victims of police violence to sue police departments, rather than police officers.
Civilians currently face numerous legal barriers in trying to hold police departments or municipalities accountable for civil rights violations. 
According to Supreme Court precedent, they typically must show that official policies or certain customs were the ""moving force"" behind their injuries, or that the officer had been improperly trained. Courts often dismiss those claims, citing an absence of evidence.
'A PATH FORWARD'
President Joe Biden plans to address police reform legislation in his first speech to a joint session of Congress next week, the White House said on Wednesday.
Booker said reforms remained necessary, even after Tuesday's verdict.
""Any meaningful bill must include accountability for egregious misconduct, more transparency and changing police practices to prevent police violence from occurring in the first place,"" Booker said in a statement. 
""I'm encouraged by the conversations I'm having with fellow senators on both sides of the aisle, and am hopeful we can find a path forward on meaningful policing reform,"" he added.

Bass declined to give details about the talks, but told reporters: ""There's a lot of room for discussion around qualified immunity. ... We need the individual officers and the agencies to be accountable.""
Bass said she hoped there would be a Senate bill by May 25.

(Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday pledged to aggressively tackle climate change using all the tools at her disposal, warning that a failure to do so effectively and promptly could undermine economic growth.
To bring the U.S. economy in line with international goals of eliminating carbon emissions will ""require bold and urgent action - nothing less than transforming important sectors of the global economy, especially when it comes to how we generate power and move people and goods,"" Yellen said in a wide-ranging speech to the Institute of International Finance.
""We are committed to directing public investment to areas that can facilitate our transition to net-zero and strengthen the functioning of our financial system so that workers, investors, and businesses can seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents,"" Yellen said. 
U.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled on Thursday to convene a summit of 40 world leaders on climate change, where he is expected to unveil a target to cut emissions by roughly 50% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.
Yellen's remarks reflect a sharp reversal of the policies of the Trump administration, which had pulled the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate accord and blocked greater action by the Group of Seven advanced economies.
Yellen said international cooperation was urgently needed, and the Biden administration's comprehensive approach to climate change would give financial institutions and international partners greater certainty about U.S. plans.
""This is an immense, immense task. We need to work together closely ... in order to deal with what has become an essential risk to our planet,"" Yellen said during a Q&A session after her speech, adding that the financial sector had a big role to play in funding the transition to a net-zero economy.
The costs would be ""enormous,"" Yellen said, noting that Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan would make some needed investments in greening the economy while removing tax subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost taxpayers some $4 billion a year.
But she said private capital would be needed to fill a gap that one estimate put at over $2.5 trillion for the United States alone over the next decade. 
To make that happen, she said, investors needed reliable, consistent and comparable data on climate-related risks amid the growing incidence of severe weather events.
Yellen said the Financial Stability Oversight Council would be the principal agency managing and assessing the financial risks associated with climate change, and if necessary, taking appropriate action to mitigate them.

She said the FSOC could also facilitate the sharing of data on risks among regulators, but that required greater disclosures by non-financial and financial companies of risks.
The global Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate Related Disclosure had devised a framework that was proving useful, and she hoped the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would base its own efforts on that work.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A divided U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Vanita Gupta as the first woman of color to serve in the No. 3 job at the Justice Department, a role at the forefront of the department's renewed efforts to combat systemic racism in policing.
Gupta won confirmation as President Joe Biden's associate attorney general in a final vote of 51-49. Only one Republican - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - voted to confirm her, saying she felt Gupta was personally committed to combating injustice.
""I have looked at her record. I have had an extensive sit-down with her. I'm impressed with not only her professional credentials ... but the passion that she carries with her with the work that she performs,"" Murkowski said.
Gupta has faced a fraught confirmation process amid attacks by right-wing groups and Senate Republicans who have criticized her on everything from prior statements she has made on social media to her stock holdings in a company accused of selling a key ingredient used to make heroin in Mexico.
""This nomination has revealed a lengthy trail of radical claims and hasty backtracks,"" the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday. 
As associate attorney general at the Justice Department, Gupta will play a pivotal role in supervising the department's civil rights work, including an investigation announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday into policing practices in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd..

She will also be involved with overseeing the department's civil, antitrust and environment and natural resources divisions.
Gupta served as acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration, during which time she oversaw high-profile investigations into systemic abuses by police departments in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched a sweeping civil investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis following a jury's verdict that former city police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd.
The probe is the first major action of Attorney General Merrick Garland, after President Joe Biden vowed to address systemic racism in the United States. It will consider whether the department engages ""in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including during protests,"" he said.
He added it will also examine whether the department ""engages in discriminatory conduct and whether its treatment of those with behavioral health disabilities is unlawful.""
Chauvin's conviction was a milestone in the fraught racial history of the United States and a rebuke of law enforcement's treatment of Black Americans. Floyd's death was one in a long list of police killings that prompted nationwide protests. 
""I know such wounds have deep roots. That too many communities have experienced those wounds firsthand. Yesterday's verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis,"" Garland said. 
Garland has previously said he will make cracking down on police misconduct a priority.
A separate criminal Justice Department investigation into whether the officers involved in Floyd's death violated his civil rights continues, Garland said.
“The city welcomes the federal investigation announced today and has already begun working with the Department of Justice team both in Washington D.C. and in Minnesota to help them quickly get this investigation organized and underway,"" city attorney Jim Rowader said in a statement.
The Minneapolis City Council also signaled its support for the probe, saying it welcomed ""the opportunity for the Department of Justice to use the full weight of its authority to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power."" 
The decision to open a probe into systemic policing problems marks a sharp contrast from the administration of former President Donald Trump, which sharply curtailed the use of court-enforcement agreements to prevent police departments from violating peoples' civil rights.
Garland rescinded that policy on Friday, saying the department would be returning to its traditional practices of investigating state and local police departments and allowing unit heads to approve most settlements and consent decrees.
On Wednesday, Garland said Justice Department officials had already started to reach out to community groups in Minneapolis to ask about their experiences with law enforcement and they also plan to speak with police officers there about the training and support they receive.
If a finding of misconduct is uncovered, Garland said the Justice Department would issue a public report, and it could also potentially file a civil lawsuit so that it could seek relief from a judge.
Currently, the Justice Department has four police practice probes open in addition to the one in Minneapolis. The others, which were opened prior to Garland’s tenure, are focused on the Orange County, Ca. district attorney and sheriff's offices, as well as the police department in Springfield, Mass. 
It is also currently enforcing a total of 16 settlements with law enforcement agencies across the country.
A 12-member jury on Tuesday found Chauvin, 45, guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses, including bystanders, police officials and medical experts.
In a confrontation captured on video, Chauvin, a white veteran of the police force, pushed his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020. Chauvin and three fellow officers were attempting to arrest Floyd, accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a grocery store.
The conviction triggered a wave of relief and reflection not only across the United States but in countries around the world.

Even as crowds celebrated the verdict, protesters called for justice in the case of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer after a routine traffic stop on April 11, just a few miles from where Chauvin stood trial. Kimberly Potter, who has turned in her badge, has been charged with manslaughter in that case.
As the country focused on the guilty verdict in Minneapolis, police in Columbus, Ohio, fatally shot a Black teenage girl they confronted as she lunged at two people with a knife, as seen in police video footage of the encounter, authorities said. The incident sparked street protests in Ohio's largest city.

769,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - More than 250 people demanded Russian President Vladimir Putin free jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, chanting ""Freedom to Navalny"" outside the Russian embassy in London on Wednesday.
Navalny has become the leader of the disparate opposition groups which oppose Putin, a former KGB spy who has ruled Russia since 1999 when Boris Yeltsin handed him power. 
""Putin is an old fashioned demagogue but with a background in the secret service so he is very well equipped to be a tyrant,"" said John Taylor, a British man who joined the protest holding a white plastic lavatory brush.
The lavatory brush has become a symbol of protest in Russia as Navalny's video investigations alleged that Putin had opulent lavatory brushes installed in a palace. Putin has repeatedly dismissed Navalny's claims as nonsense, as has the Kremlin.
Mostly Russian protesters outside the embassy chanted ""Free Navalny, Free Russia"" in both Russian and English while some held a giant picture of Navalny, 44, and others a placard which read ""Today Navalny, tomorrow you"".
""We all want Alexei Navalny to be freed and to receive medical help,"" Marina Litvinenko, the widow of ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210, in 2006.
""Mr Putin - the people don't want you."" Litvinenko told Reuters.
Other protesters included former Russian mobile phone entrepreneur, Yevgeny Chichvarkin, who fled Moscow in 2008.
""We came here to show our support for Alexei,"" Chichvarkin said. ""He is the proper leader of the opposition and what has happened to him in Russia is completely unacceptable.""
Navalny travelled to Germany last August for treatment following a nerve agent poisoning attack he blamed on Putin. He was arrested in January when he returned to Russia and jailed for 2-1/2 years in February for parole violations he said were fabricated. 

The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied any Russian role if he was.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - For some of those who encountered Derek Chauvin's policing or witnessed his use of force as an officer there is no sympathy for the man convicted of killing George Floyd.
    Chauvin was the subject of at least 17 complaints during his career, according to police records, but only one led to discipline. Prosecutors sought permission to introduce eight prior use-of-force incidents, but the judge would only allow two. In the end the jury heard none.
    Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lawyer, has defended his client's use of force as appropriate in potentially dangerous situations. 
    ""I don't have no sympathy for him. I think he got what he deserved,"" Julian Hernandez, 38, a carpenter now working in Pennsylvania, told Reuters.
    Hernandez said he never heard anything from the Minneapolis police after submitting a complaint about Chauvin, who he said ""choked him out"" during an encounter in a Minneapolis night club in 2015. A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department declined to comment.
    According to Chauvin's police report, Hernandez failed to follow orders and resisted arrest when Chauvin, who was working as an off-duty security guard, tried to escort him out of a night club. Chauvin's report said this prompted him to apply ""pressure toward his Lingual Artery"" to subdue Hernandez.      
    Hernandez said Chauvin picked him out of the crowd for no reason and quickly escalated to violence. He said Chauvin should have been removed from the police force.
    As Monroe Skinaway, 75, took in news of Chauvin's conviction, he flashed back to the night he witnessed Chauvin pin another man to the pavement with the same detached look as when he knelt on Floyd's neck.
    It was March 2019, 15 months before Floyd's death would spark global protests against racism and police brutality. 
    But Skinaway still remembers what he deemed the indifference on Chauvin's face that night as he pressed Sir Rilee Peet's head into a puddle deep enough that he, like Floyd, struggled to breathe.
    A jury on Tuesday found Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, guilty of all three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, an outcome welcomed by activists as progress in holding law enforcement accountable for its treatment of Black Americans. Chauvin is white and Floyd was Black.     
    ""We people of color very seldom get a good verdict,"" said Skinaway, who is Native American. ""I'm kind of amazed.""
'I CAN'T BREATHE, MAN'
Skinaway says he did not know Chauvin at the time he and another officer arrested Sir Rilee Peet, a young Native American man with a history of mental illness. But Skinaway later recognized him as the officer charged in Floyd's death.  
    Skinaway says he was speaking with the officers about the recovery of a stolen car when Peet approached and did not comply with requests to back away. A police report about the incident states that a struggle ensued and Chauvin maced Peet, applied a neck restraint and pinned him to the ground so he could be handcuffed.
    The incident was one of the six prior use-of-force incidents that Judge Peter Cahill blocked prosecutors from presenting at trial, ruling they would be prejudicial.
    In court filings, prosecutors said Chauvin restrained Peet in a manner that was beyond what was necessary or reasonable - an assertion also made by Skinaway in interviews with Reuters.
    Skinaway says Chauvin grabbed Peet by the back of his hair and pressed his face into a rain puddle. That began a cycle where Peet would gasp for air and say ""I can't breathe, man"" before Chauvin would force his head down again.
    Skinaway said he saw similarities between Chauvin's treatment of Peet and Floyd. 
    ""He basically did the same thing to that Native kid,"" Skinaway said. ""I think the incident would have gone longer possibly if the ambulance didn't show up.""
    Peet, who was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction of the legal process, could not be reached for comment. Earlier this year Peet told the Marshall Project he did not recall the incident. It was not clear what happened to the charges against him.
    Jimmy Bostic, who ended up in the hospital after a scuffle with Chauvin and other officers in April 2016, said he was ""ecstatic"" when he heard the verdict, seeing it as a sign that police officers, too, could be held accountable.
    According to a police report, Bostic was refusing to leave a store and threatening to spit on its owner. As the situation escalated, Chauvin wrote in the report that he ""closed distance with"" Bostic and ""secured his neck/head area with my hands.""
    Bostic, who is currently in prison on an unrelated burglary conviction, said he struggled to breathe after the encounter and was taken to the hospital due to an asthma attack.

    ""George Floyd could have very well been Jimmy Bostic Jr,"" the 23-year-old said in an interview after the verdict. ""I'm just happy that there was an example set today.""

(Reuters) - The trial and conviction of former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin for murdering George Floyd came with America at a crossroads, a moment of anguish, but also of possibility, which historians and activists compared to the Civil Rights era.
From policing and race relations to the criminal justice system, the three-week trial of Derek Chauvin became ""a symbol and stand in for our emotions, our fears and our hopes surrounding this whole set of issues,"" said David Greenberg, a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University.
The audience for the trial was hard to measure, but likely vast because of the many streaming services that carried it live. 
Even the president was paying close attention. Joe Biden called Floyd's family after Tuesday's verdict, which he said could be a step ""forward in the march toward justice in America.""
That the case was about more than one Black man's death at the hands of a white police officer was underlined during the trial - just miles away another Black man was fatally shot by a white police officer who had pulled him over for a traffic violation. 
The trial resonated all the more for many because Floyd's death was captured in a painfully intimate video that showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for almost 10 minutes, with two other officers on his back.
Civil rights historian Clayborne Carson, director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Institute at Stanford University, was beaten by baton-wielding police during 1960s civil rights protests.
Then as now, Carson said, periods of agitation and activity were marked by atrocities that moved the public: The 1955 lynching of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy murdered in Mississippi after a white woman lied about being insulted; kids firehosed while marching for civil rights in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963; and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.
VIDEO WITNESS
Carson points to the video of Floyd's killing - made by teen passerby Darnella Frazier with her cell phone, shared around the world via social media and shown repeatedly during the trial in which she testified - as being the chief reason his death and the trial of his killer drew such attention.
Floyd is seen in the video prone on the street, telling police he can't breathe and crying out for his dead mother. Lawyers for Chauvin had argued he followed his police training. 
Mary Moriarty was chief public defender in Hennepin County, where Floyd died, until last year. She said she had long tried to draw attention to episodes of police brutality reported to her office, often recorded by officers' body-worn cameras.
Moriarty recalled the horror of seeing the video of Floyd.
""Poor George Floyd is begging for his life, and here you have a cop just nonchalantly killing him in broad daylight in front of bystanders who are begging him to stop, and he knows he's being videoed, and he just continues to do it,"" she said. ""So I think this was the last straw here.""
Police departments in many American cities are engaged with community leaders on dozens of reform efforts brought forth since Floyd's murder. Most of the reforms focus on banning controversial tactics - like choke holds - and making police who do wrong more accountable. 
Still, the changes are mostly in the proposal stage and do not go nearly far enough for many activists.
Issues of racism and police brutality ""didn't just arise when George Floyd took his last breath,"" said Councilwoman Andrea Jenkins who represents Minneapolis's Ward 8, which includes the intersection where Floyd was killed. 
But pandemic shutdowns, she said, allowed Americans to see problems in a more intimate way. With lives slowed down, people had time to view and reflect on the video of Floyd's killing.
His death and the trial also came during a period of anxiety and vulnerability in America, with over half a million dead from the virus, and with economic instability and political divisions rattling the country.
YEARS OF UPHEAVAL
For Mark Bray, a human rights historian and author, the current era of social and political upheaval started years before the pandemic and Floyd's death.
The most recent era of activism was awoken in 2011 during the month long occupation of the Wisconsin statehouse, when protesters opposed a proposed anti-union bill, Bray said. 
It continued in the early Black Lives Matter protests following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and to repeated demonstrations that followed more police killings of African Americans. 
""The template for radical resistance over the past decade is that something happens in one city - and then it spreads as others ask 'what are we going to do in our city to show solidarity?'"" Bray said.
But the protests over Floyd's death stretched beyond people who might embrace the term radical; people who may not normally demonstrate turned out in massive protests around the world. 
Such protests are what must be built upon to draw attention to the root causes of police violence and racism, said Patrick Ngwolo, a Houston criminal defense attorney and pastor who met Floyd over a decade ago. 
He said guilty verdicts were essential - but also that the country has to confront the larger issues at play.

""What does it look like for us as a country to try to make this whole, to try to address the centuries of systemic racism that this country has gone through?"" he said. ""What does it look like for us to think about sitting down and coming up with constructive ways to unite these yet-to-be-United States of America?""

During a news conference following Chauvin's conviction on three criminal counts, Pelosi called the outcome ""a step in the right direction for justice.""
""Thank you, George Floyd for sacrificing your life for justice,"" Pelosi said, referring to Floyd's death in May as Chauvin pinned his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.
The comment drew widespread criticism online.
""Speaker Pelosi's comment about George Floyd was totally inappropriate. At a minimum, she should apologize,"" said Josh McLaurin, a Democratic member of the Georgia state legislature, on Twitter. ""But more than that, I think the gaffe clarifies how much this country would benefit from a Black Speaker of the House.""
Black Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who holds a high position in House Democratic leadership, is seen as a possible future speaker or House majority leader.
The Pelosi-led House has passed the ""George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,"" which aims to put a stop to aggressive law enforcement tactics that have targeted African Americans and other minorities.
The bill, which has not yet been considered by the Senate, would ban police chokeholds and no-knock warrants, limit military equipment used by police departments and require officers to wear body cameras. It also would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct.
Antonio Romanucci, a Chicago attorney on the team representing Floyd's family, noted that Pelosi had twice called the family on Tuesday.

""Our speaker is a great leader. She is somebody that wants to see this through,"" Romanucci said, referring to the bill.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a petition by Michael Cohen, the onetime personal lawyer and fixer for former President Donald Trump, to release him from home confinement in May, six months ahead of schedule.
U.S. District Judge John Koeltl said the petition was premature because prosecutors were not yet required, under a 2018 law allowing early release for some prisoners, to credit Cohen for hundreds of hours of work and courses he completed while imprisoned at a federal facility in New York state.
The Manhattan judge also said Cohen had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and faced no irreparable harm because there was ""no basis to conclude that Mr. Cohen's service of his sentence violates his constitutional rights.""Cohen, 54, who represented himself, is serving a three-year sentence for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and other crimes to which he pleaded guilty in December 2018.
He spent a little over one year in the Otisville, New York, prison before being allowed to serve his term in his Manhattan apartment, as the COVID-19 pandemic began tearing through the nation's prisons.
Cohen had sought to end home confinement on May 29.
His projected release date is now Nov. 22, reflecting more than five months of credits for good behavior.
In a text message, Cohen said that despite the ""adverse decision"" on his petition, ""all attention"" should be directed to the murder conviction on Tuesday of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and the ""justice for George Floyd.""

Last July, Cohen was returned to prison for two weeks amid a dispute with federal officials over his plan for a tell-all book critical of his former boss.
The book, ""Disloyal: A Memoir,"" was published in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans could produce their own ""conceptual"" counter-proposal to President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan this week, but their version could be less than a third of the size of the White House's, lawmakers said .
After discussing infrastructure with the White House, Senator Shelley Moore Capito told reporters on Tuesday that the Republican plan would include projects and means to pay for them and offer a contrast to a sweeping Biden proposal that Republicans oppose because of its size and proposed corporate tax hike. 
""We need to settle on a conceptual sort of idea, and hopefully we'll do that in the next several days,"" the West Virginia Republican said. ""Hopefully, by the end of the week.""
Another Republican working with her, Senator Roger Wicker, said he thought the initial offer ""might be somewhere south of $600 billion."" 
Wicker told reporters the Republican plan might be paid for at least in part by reallocating other funds that have not been spent. He also said, ""There may be an effort to make the electric cars pay their fair share, which they are not doing under the current gas tax.""
Biden has proposed an infrastructure plan that includes projects on roads, bridges and ports as well as addressing broadband access, climate change and human services including elder care. He would pay for the plan by raising the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21%.

The president and his staff have held multiple discussions with bipartisan groups of lawmakers, including Capito, in hopes of winning Republican support and asked Republicans on Monday to produce a counter-proposal by mid-May.
Biden could need Republican support to move legislation though the Senate and House of Representatives, where Democrats hold slim majorities. Wicker said he did not expect every Republican to support the Republican offer, but he thought it possible to develop a bipartisan compromise that could get 70 to 80 votes in the 100-person Senate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. lawmakers, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, on Tuesday reintroduced their ""Green New Deal"" resolution, their set of aggressive climate goals intended to transform the U.S. economy.
Initially introduced in 2019, the non-binding resolution seeks to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade and transition the economy away from fossil fuels.
""For so long, our movement toward a sustainable future has been divided with really just this false notion that we have to choose between our planet and our economy. And we decided to come together in sweeping legislation that not only rejects that notion, but creates a plan for 20 million union jobs in the United States of America"" in several sectors, Ocasio-Cortez said at a news conference.
It was not immediately clear whether the plan would receive a significantly warmer reception from President Joe Biden's administration than it did from the administration of former President Donald Trump, which did not believe action on climate change was necessary.
Biden, who is hosting an online climate summit this week and announced in January that the United States would rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement to fight climate change, has promised to put the country on track to net-zero emissions by 2050 - a much later deadline than the Green New Deal's.
Asked if the lawmakers wanted to go beyond what Biden has proposed, Markey said: ""Yes. We believe that this is the moment that requires us to act big, think big, have a program that matches the magnitude of the problem that we're confronted with.""
Markey and Ocasio-Cortez highlighted successes achieved since the release of the resolution, including General Motors (NYSE:GM)' announcement that it would sell all of its new cars, SUVs and light pick-up trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035 and the House of Representatives' vote to allow the construction of more public housing.
The plan has received backing from 103 House lawmakers, Ocasio-Cortez said, including first-term congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri, a vocal supporter. 
Republicans and Trump slammed the Green New Deal when it was first introduced, claiming adopting its goals would force Americans to cease traveling and not be able to eat meat.
""The green new disaster is back,"" Republican Senator John Barrasso said in a statement on Monday, ahead of the relaunch. ""Free market innovation is the best way to protect our air, water and communities – not heavy-handed government regulation or taxation.""
The plan calls for 100 percent of power demand to be met from zero-emission energy sources like wind and solar, modernizing transportation infrastructure, cutting carbon emissions from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, making buildings and homes more energy efficient and increasing land preservation.
It also aims to create an economic safety net for communities affected by climate change and the shift away from fossil fuel use, including through guarantees of healthcare, jobs and job training.
The plan's name references President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s, which sought to help Americans ailing from the Great Depression with huge government-led infrastructure projects.
Separately, Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, on Monday introduced their Green New Deal for Public Housing Act.
The bill would modernize the country's 950,000 housing units to make buildings more energy efficient. It would also require jobs created under the initiative to meet certain labor standards and allow for the creation of more public housing units.

It was not immediately clear how likely the bill is to pass in either congressional chamber.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -When President Joe Biden entrusted Vice President Kamala Harris in March with leading U.S. diplomatic efforts to cut immigration from Mexico and Central America's ""Northern Triangle,"" experts described the job as both ""perilous"" and a ""political grenade."" 
The subsequent weeks have shown just how challenging the role will be as the administration seeks to defuse a crisis at the border that Republicans have used to hammer Biden, a Democrat.
Harris has pushed Central American countries to increase troops at their borders, administration officials said, and she said she plans to visit Guatemala and Mexico, which could happen in as soon as a month. 
At a meeting with advisers last week, which focused heavily on anti-corruption efforts, Harris spoke about tackling the root causes of migration that have plagued the region for decades - gang violence, drug-trafficking cartels, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes - with diplomacy. 
But thorny issues have already surfaced with the leaders of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and unaccompanied children continue to show up at the U.S. border with Mexico. 
Representatives for Harris did not comment but cited administration statements on the issue. 
To succeed in her task, Harris needs to balance opposing priorities, experts and advisers said.
They include maintaining political distance from Central American leaders while conveying that the United States wants to cooperate, and long-term strategies to fix the underlying reasons people are fleeing those countries as well as small wins that can result in immediate success at home.
Harris is still calibrating the right tone, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, who recently participated in a meeting Harris convened about problems in the region.
""The tone issue looks at how do you both recognize the need to work with the people in the region and at the same time call attention to some of the real deficits of governance in these countries,"" Selee said. 
The vice president is working with members of Biden's Cabinet and the U.S. special envoy to the Northern Triangle, Ricardo Zuniga, and having weekly lunches with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a senior White House official said. 
She gets updates on the region during the President's Daily Brief and holds regular meetings on Central America with her team, the official said. 
The White House's immigration team has shown signs of strain. Roberta Jacobson, the high-profile ""border czar,"" is leaving at the end of the month, the White House said unexpectedly on April 9. 
Tensions are also rising between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the White House over overloaded shelters at the border. 
Harris has started working as well with the private sector to expand investment opportunities in the Northern Triangle and with international organizations about strengthening those economies, while overseeing the use and flow of aid and trying to increase ways for asylum seekers to apply from home, the official said.
""When we're looking at my focus, which is a diplomatic focus on the Northern Triangle, it is about bringing together... the members of the Cabinet,"" Harris told reporters on Monday. 
The Commerce Department is planning a virtual trade mission, she said, and the Department of Agriculture is focusing on ways to support agriculture in the region. Harris added she asked Japan's prime minister Yoshihide Suga to assist, and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield to rally allies. 
TOUGH SPOT FOR DIPLOMACY 
In what some U.S. experts called a challenge to the Biden administration, Guatemalan lawmakers refused on Monday to swear in a corruption-fighting judge, Constitutional Court President Gloria Porras, who U.S. officials had seen as key to the fight against graft there.
Harris spoke with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on March 30, when he asked her about the possibility of purchasing COVID-19 vaccines, officials told Reuters, a question that was not included in the U.S. readout of the call.
On April 5, Guatemala said it was purchasing 16 million Russian Sputnik V vaccines instead, to inoculate about half the country's population. 
Getting vaccines to those countries is an immediate way to show that the United States cares, said Selee, adding it was high on their list ""because it is key to restarting economic life."" 
An administration official said it was not politically tenable to assure vaccine supplies to other countries before inoculating every American. A spokeswoman for Harris declined comment on the issue.
El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, who won a landslide victory in 2019 on a pledge to root out corruption but has faced criticism from rights groups for what they see as autocratic leanings, criticized the U.S. strategy after Harris' new role was announced.
""A recycled plan that did not work in 2014 will not work now,"" he wrote on Twitter.
In March, a U.S. court sentenced the brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez to life in prison for drug trafficking. There is also a U.S. Senate bill proposing sanctions on the Honduran president for corruption.
Harris ""must keep a distance from the Honduran government right now,"" said Lisa Haugaard, co-director of the Latin America Working Group, who attended last week's meeting with Harris. 
Harris has yet to speak with Bukele or Hernandez.
EARLY 'WIN' CRITICIZED BY SUPPORTERS 
Under U.S. pressure, Honduras and Guatemala increased troops at their borders to stop people from fleeing during a caravan in March. This approach is already being criticized by aid groups.
""Restricting people from fleeing for their lives is not a win, it is illegal,"" said Noah Gottschalk, the global policy lead for Oxfam America. ""We are concerned this will lead to human rights violations by security forces."" 
A representative from Oxfam participated in last week's meeting.
Harris' focus on diplomacy, not the way that asylum seekers are treated at the border, is a hard political sell at home, for Republicans and Democrats, experts said. 

""Democratic voters do not care as much about diplomatic maneuverings as they do about the handling of migrants at the border and that is how they will ultimately judge Harris,"" said Jennifer Piscopo, associate professor of politics and Latin American studies at Los Angeles-based Occidental (NYSE:OXY) College. 
""It will be hard to separate her from what is happening at the border.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a gunman killed eight workers and himself at an Indianapolis FedEx (NYSE:FDX) center last week - the city's third mass shooting this year - the chief deputy coroner spoke of the toll the deaths had taken on her coworkers.
""It is a very difficult job,"" said Alfarena McGinty of the Marion County Coroner's Office. ""The staff is definitely suffering and is going to need long-term counseling.""
John Fudenberg knows such strain all too well.
In 2017, after a gunman killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas, Fudenberg's staff at the Clark County Coroner's Office was responsible for telling families their loved ones were dead. He said they delivered the devastating news several times an hour in the days following the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.
""I saw several employees experience what I believe was PTSD and trauma,"" said Fudenberg, who retired as coroner last year. Within months of the shooting, which had a final death toll of 60, five full-time staff quit or retired.
The recent flurry of mass shootings in the United States has shined a fresh spotlight on the country's gun debate and left dozens more families grieving victims of the violence. Often unnoticed is the behind-the-scenes work carried out by coroners: identifying the victims, completing death certificates and notifying families that their loved ones are gone.
Even in a job where death is part of every day, psychologists and several coroners said the mental and physical stress of working through mass shootings is immense. At least 154 mass shootings have taken place this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that tallies gun deaths.
Johanna O'Flaherty, a crisis psychologist, counseled Fudenberg's team after the Las Vegas shooting and just returned from helping the coroner's team in Boulder, Colorado, after the March 22 shooting that left 10 people dead at a grocery store.
O'Flaherty said coroners often lack the mental health support network offered to first responders such as police and firefighters.
""How many think of the coroners - the last responders?"" she said, calling them ""the forgotten group.""
Mounting deaths from COVID-19 have further stretched coroners' offices, and she said she has now been facilitating support groups to help them cope with that as well.
'HORRIFIC' CONVERSATIONS
For some coroners, mass shootings are horribly personal.
Sara Canady, a justice of the peace in Wilson County, Texas, whose responsibilities include serving as a coroner, arrived at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs soon after a gunman killed 26 worshippers and injured 20 others on Nov. 5, 2017. Canady knew many of the victims.
""To see people you know and love in such a horrific state, it's just mind-blowing,"" she said, fighting back tears in an interview.
Rae Wooten was the coroner in Charleston, South Carolina, when a 21-year-old white supremacist gunned down nine Black congregants at a church in 2015.
She knew the painful work ahead of her team, having dealt with the deaths of nine firefighters in a furniture store fire eight years earlier.
At the hotel where terrified relatives of the churchgoers gathered, Wooten and her staff asked them for details of their loved ones: height, age, birth marks, scars, jewelry, hair color and physical appearance.
All night long, Wooten and her two deputies went back and forth from the church to the hotel, informing relatives as soon as they had an identification.

""The communicating, it was horrific,"" Wooten said. ""Each family member reacts differently. Some cry, some scream and become hysterical, some go mute, some sob quietly.""
Wooten, who retired in January, said people often asked why she did such difficult work. She said seeing people move on from their darkest hour sustained her.
""I tell them that their loved one is dead, and they are physically and emotionally and spiritually reduced to their knees. They don't think they can live,"" she said. ""Months later, they start to live again and that's a reward.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to set aside 6,000 seasonal guest worker visas for people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to two sources familiar with the matter, a small step toward establishing more legal pathways to the United States from the region.
The 6,000-visa allotment would be part of an additional 22,000 H-2B visas made available to employers in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, a U.S. official and a second person familiar with the matter said.
The increase has been sought by business groups but opposed by labor unions amid high unemployment related to the coronavirus pandemic.
President Joe Biden has grappled in recent months with a rising number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, including families and unaccompanied children. In March, about 85,000 of the 172,000 migrants caught at the border came from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Biden officials have urged migrants not to travel to the border while systems are established that allow them to seek asylum from their home countries or come to the United States through other legal pathways.
The extra H-2B visas would be in addition to the annual allotment of 66,000 visas for the fiscal year, a tally that was exhausted in February. The visas are used for landscaping, food processing and hotel work, among other seasonal jobs.

If the 6,000 visas are not used by companies seeking to hire people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, they would go back to the general visa pool sometime before Sept. 30, the two people familiar with the matter said.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Walter Mondale, a leading liberal Democratic voice of the late 20th century who was U.S. vice president under Jimmy Carter and lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election, died on Monday at age 93, his family said.
""Well my time has come. I am eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor,"" Mondale said in a statement to his staff and released to the public after his death, referring to his late wife Joan, who died in 2014, and daughter Eleanor, who died in 2011 at age 51. ""Before I go I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me.""
Mondale, the first major U.S. party presidential nominee to pick a woman running mate, believed in an activist government and worked for civil rights, school integration, consumer protection and farm and labor interests as a U.S. senator and vice president during Carter's (NYSE:CRI) troubled one-term presidency from 1977 to 1981.
He also served as U.S. ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996 under Bill Clinton.
Mondale had spoken in recent days with Carter, Clinton, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, a family spokesperson said.
""It's with great sadness that Jill and I learned of the passing of Vice President Walter Mondale, but great gratitude that we were able to call one of our nation’s most dedicated patriots and public servants a dear friend and mentor,"" President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said in a statement.
""Walter Mondale was the first presidential nominee of either party to select a woman as his running mate, and I know how pleased he was to be able to see Kamala Harris become Vice President,"" Biden's statement added.
""Today I mourn the passing of my dear friend Walter Mondale, who I consider the best vice president in our country's history,"" Carter, 96, said in a statement that also praised Mondale's political skill and integrity."" 
""He was an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States, and the world.""
Widely known as ""Fritz,"" Mondale was the Democratic nominee in 1984 against Reagan, a popular incumbent Republican who had beaten Carter four years earlier, and selected New York Democratic U.S. congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate. Ferraro died in 2011 at age 75.
Despite the historic selection of a woman, Mondale suffered one of the worst defeats ever in a U.S. presidential election, losing in 49 of the 50 states and carrying only his native Minnesota as well as Washington, D.C. 
It was the first of two times that Mondale was sent into political retirement by a crushing defeat.
Eighteen years later, grieving Minnesota Democrats beseeched Mondale, then 74, to run for the Senate after Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash 11 days before the 2002 election. Mondale lost narrowly to Republican Norm Coleman, who depicted him as the graying representative of a bygone era.
During his race against Reagan, Mondale promised Americans he would raise their taxes, a vow that did little to help his candidacy.
""I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds,"" Mondale said during his speech in San Francisco accepting the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. ""Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.""
The remark helped sink his campaign. Even years later, he expressed no regrets. ""I'm really glad I did it,"" he told PBS in 2004. ""It's something that I felt good about, and I thought I told the truth.""
Earlier that year, Mondale made a memorable political quip when, during a primary debate, he tried to depict Gary Hart, a rival for his party's presidential nomination, as all style and no substance by asking: ""Where's the beef?""
The line, borrowed from a humorous hamburger commercial popular at the time, hurt Hart's campaign.
Mondale was a protege of fellow Minnesota liberal Hubert Humphrey, also a senator and vice president, who lost the 1968 presidential election to Republican Richard Nixon.
Mondale served in the Senate from 1964 until he was elected as vice president in Carter's 1976 victory over incumbent Republican Gerald Ford, who had become president after Nixon resigned in 1974 due to the Watergate corruption scandal.
Mondale became a more engaged vice president than many who preceded him. He played a key role in buttressing the sometimes frayed relationship between Carter's White House and the Democratic-controlled Congress.
'CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE'
He did not always agree with Carter, as when he privately opposed Carter's preachy 1979 speech in which the president told Americans, besieged by a bad economy, that they were suffering from a ""crisis of confidence."" Mondale even considered resigning over the speech.
Carter increasingly looked like a weak president as he struggled with a hostage crisis in Iran, a Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and tough economic times at home.
The Carter-Mondale ticket lost in 1980 against Reagan and his running mate, George H.W. Bush. Mondale, still associated in voters' minds with Carter, faced the daunting task of trying to defeat a popular incumbent amid economic prosperity in 1984.
The contest between Mondale and Reagan presented Americans with a clear choice between liberal and conservative candidates and doctrines.
Mondale was seen as the victor in their first debate, with the older Reagan coming across to some as out of touch and uncertain.
Reagan rebounded in the second debate. He allayed concerns about his age with his response to a question as to whether, at age 73, he was too old to be seeking four more years as president.
""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,"" Reagan joked, provoking laughter in the audience at the debate, and even from Mondale.
""I think the public wanted to vote for Reagan,"" Mondale said later. He said that after the second debate, ""I was almost certain the campaign was over. And it was.""
Mondale's loss and a similar thrashing of fellow liberal Michael Dukakis in 1988 opened the way for more centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton to assert themselves in the party.
Born in Ceylon, Minnesota, on Jan. 5, 1928, Walter Frederick Mondale was the sixth of seven children. His father was a Methodist minister, his mother a music teacher.
Minnesota was dominated by farming and mining, and it had a tradition of liberal, populist politics, with many Scandinavian-American residents like the Norwegian Mondales.
After serving in the U.S. Army, he earned a law degree at the University of Minnesota. His political life started with his work on the re-election campaign of Humphrey, then mayor of Minneapolis.
When Humphrey became vice president in 1964, Mondale succeeded him in the Senate, coming to Washington during Democratic President Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society,"" a time of great hope and excitement for liberals, though their optimism was crushed by the Vietnam War.

Mondale married wife Joan in 1955. She died in 2014. They had three children, Eleanor and sons Theodore and William.
Plans for memorials will be announced later for both Minnesota and Washington D.C., Mondale family said.

783,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -At least four moderate Democratic lawmakers have returned contributions from a political action committee formed by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that Republicans said had signaled they endorsed their party's most liberal policies.
The Republican Party's congressional campaign arm launched a website on Monday calling on more than two dozen Democrats, some from highly competitive districts in the U.S. House of Representatives, to give back $5,000 donations from the fundraising effort started last year by Ocasio-Cortez. 
At least three Democrats who were not on the list had already refunded contributions made in March by the end of the month, campaign finance records at the Federal Election Commission show. A fourth Democrat, Representative Chris Pappas, had also returned the money, a spokesman said on Monday evening.
Ocasio-Cortez, a star among U.S. liberals, is a top fundraiser among Democrats, with her re-election campaign raising $2.8 million in the first three months of this year. That compares with roughly $4 million raised by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Republicans picked up about 10 House seats in November’s election and hope to win an outright majority next year. Democrats currently have a six-seat majority, although there are several vacancies.
Some moderate Democrats blamed the party's congressional losses in 2020 on the willingness of some colleagues to embrace the idea of defunding police departments as well as policies labeled ""socialist"" by conservatives.
Democrats who called for legislation to address climate change, the expansion of healthcare to all Americans and the reform of U.S. immigration laws were accused by Republicans of advocating extreme left-wing policies, for example.
Republicans are clearly hoping to exploit those themes again in 2022.
Ocasio-Cortez set up her PAC, called The Courage to Change, after refusing to pay dues to the House Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
One of the lawmakers who gave back the PAC's cash, Representative Elissa Slotkin, said in a campaign finance report it was ""unsolicited.""
The report from another Democrat, Representative Ron Kind, showed $5,000 to The Courage to Change had been refunded on March 31. The campaign of freshman Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux also returned the money.
The offices of Kind and Bourdeaux did not respond to inquiries seeking comment. A Slotkin aide declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Ocasio-Cortez said she was committed to protecting a Democratic majority in the House and had contributed to more than 30 candidates in key seats to help protect that majority.

""The Congresswoman is proud to stand for guaranteed healthcare, housing, and education for all people in the United States and will continue to do so regardless of how hysterical it makes the members of the Republican Caucus,"" the spokeswoman said.
It is common for lawmakers to give to one another's campaigns. The Courage to Change gave $160,000 to federal candidates and other political committees during the first three months of the year, according to a campaign finance disclosure.

(Reuters) - Four drugmakers helped cause the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing their drugs and downplaying their addictive risks, a lawyer for several California counties argued on Monday at the start of multibillion-dollar trial.
Those counties accuse Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit of fueling a drug crisis that according to the U.S. government resulted in nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
The plaintiffs - the populous Santa Clara, Los Angeles and Orange counties and the city of Oakland - say the drugmakers should have to pay more than $50 billion to cover the costs of abating the public nuisance they created, plus penalties.
Their lawyer, Fidelma Fitzpatrick, told Orange County Superior Court Judge Peter Wilson that the case was about the companies' ""deadly legacy"" of trying to boost their profits by promoting opioid painkillers to treat chronic pain, resulting in a ""mountain"" of addictive pills flooding the state and country. 
""The evidence will show each of these companies, all of them, knew what would happen: that their opioids would cause the crushing burden of addiction, overdose and death that California and its people have experienced,"" she said.
Defense lawyers countered that their drugs made up a small part of the overall opioid market, that doctors were fully warned of their risks and that the counties could not show that they caused the health crisis.
""You won't hear from a single doctor who was ever misled,"" said Collie James, Teva's lawyer.
Mike Yoder, J&J's lawyer, said that healthcare company's painkillers, which it no longer markets, were rarely abused. 
""They did not cause any opioid crisis and they did not cause any public nuisance,"" he said.
More than 3,300 similar lawsuits are pending nationally over the opioid crisis. The only other case to go to trial in the opioid litigation resulted in the state of Oklahoma in 2019 winning a $465 million judgment against J&J, which is appealing.
Other cases are slated to go to trial in the coming months, creating new pressure for the companies to reach settlements.

The nation's three largest drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) - and J&J have proposed paying a combined $26 billion to resolve the cases against them. The proposed deal has not been finalized.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden met on Monday with a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have all served as governors or mayors, as the White House seeks a deal on his more than $2 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal.
Biden said he handpicked the group of former state and local leaders with experience as compromise seekers, hoping he can get Democrats and Republicans to agree on an ambitious jobs and infrastructure package. The group included one Republican lawmaker who tried to block Biden's presidential victory.
""I am prepared to compromise and prepared to see what we can do and what we can come together on,"" Biden said at the outset of the meeting. ""I've noticed everybody's for infrastructure. The question is who's going to pay for it.""
The meeting included five Democrats -- Senators John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and U.S. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, Charlie Crist of Florida and Norma Torres of California; four Republicans -- Senators John Hoeven of North Dakota and Mitt Romney of Utah and U.S. Representatives Carlos Gimenez of Florida and Kay Granger of Texas; and one independent -- Senator Angus King of Maine.
Lawmakers emerged from the meeting optimistic they could reach a deal, but divided over how to fund it and what should be included. 
Romney said he favored making the consumers who use the nation's ports, highways and airports help fund the effort, not relying exclusively on taxing corporations. 
""So if we're going to redo an airport, I think it makes sense to look at the people who are flying to pay for the cost over some period of time,"" he told reporters
Biden has opposed user fees, citing his pledge not to raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000.
Gimenez, who voted against certifying Biden's election victory, said Republicans made it clear they wanted a narrow bill that does not raise corporate taxes. He told Reuters Biden asked Republicans to come back with a counterproposal in mid-May.
""There is room for compromise as far as we’re concerned, on infrastructure,"" Gimenez said. ""The difference is: what is the definition of infrastructure?""
Cleaver said he argued that affordable housing should be considered infrastructure. To drive home his point, he showed others a photo of a house he lived in for seven years as a child. ""It's shack,"" he said.
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican leading the effort to produce a conceptual framework on infrastructure, said she expects to speak to the White House on Tuesday. 
Shaheen, a former governor, emerged from the meeting optimistic. ""There is common ground in Congress on these infrastructure priorities - we can and should get this done,"" she said. 
It was the second time Biden hosted a bipartisan group of lawmakers to try to craft an infrastructure bill. 
Most U.S. voters support fixing the country's crumbling roads and bridges and asking companies to pay the bill. But Republicans in Congress say Biden's proposal is too big and most of them oppose raising corporate taxes.
Last week, Biden met with eight members of Congress in the Oval Office for nearly two hours to discuss the bill. Afterward, Republicans indicated little signs of support.
Biden's $2 trillion-plus American Jobs Plan calls for spending on traditional infrastructure projects like roads and bridges along with addressing climate change and expanding access to home and community-based care.
The eight-year spending plan would be funded by increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, while limiting the ability of American companies to avoid taxes by shifting profits overseas. 

Representative Crist, a former governor, said Biden felt ""pretty strongly"" about raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent as part of the package. 
He said Biden was ""a bit skeptical"" about scaling back the tax hike, as suggested by some such as Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a key vote in the Senate given the razor-thin majority his party has there.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought an end to another lawsuit related to the Nov. 3 presidential election filed by a Republican former congressional candidate who had challenged the extension of Pennsylvania's deadline to receive mail-in ballots.
The justices, in a brief order, decided that the dispute was moot. They threw out a Nov. 13 decision by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia that found the candidate, Jim Bognet, as well as four individual voters, did not have legal standing to challenge the ballot deadline extension. 
Bognet, who lost his race for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to Democratic rival Matt Cartwright, and the voters had filed the suit before the election, challenging a Sept. 17 ruling by Pennsylvania's top court ordering officials to count mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later.
The high court's action in the lingering dispute was expected as it has previously rejected many others pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the presidential election.
Trump, a Republican, lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, who took office on Jan. 20. Biden defeated Trump by more than 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania. Trump made false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities.
The election dispute in Pennsylvania, like in several other states, involved changes implemented to facilitate voting during the coronavirus pandemic, a public health crisis that prompted a surge in mail-in ballots as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court sided with the state's Democratic Party and various Democratic officials and candidates who argued that an Election Day mail-in ballot receipt deadline would violate the state constitution's guarantee of ""free and equal"" elections given the pandemic and warnings by the U.S. Postal Service over its ability to deliver ballots in time.
The 3rd Circuit in its ruling against Bognet and the voters said that they cannot represent the state legislature, whose power they claimed had been undermined by the state court.

""Because plaintiffs are not the General Assembly, nor do they bear any conceivable relationship to state lawmaking processes, they lack standing to sue over the alleged usurpation of the General Assembly's rights,"" the 3rd Circuit said.

Pompeo, who was former President Donald Trump's last secretary of state, served until Jan. 20, when Republican Trump left the office after being defeated by Democrat Joe Biden in the November election. 
Pompeo is seen as among a handful of Republicans with presidential ambitions for 2024, even though the former top diplomat has not confirmed that.
Pompeo and his wife asked a political appointee and other employees in his office to carry out tasks such as ""picking up personal items, planning events unrelated to the Department's mission, and conducting such personal business as pet care and mailing personal Christmas cards,"" the State Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) said in the report.

Among the incidents detailed in the report were a request from Susan Pompeo for an aide to make two hair salon appointments for her. On another occasion, an under secretary of state appeared to help the Pompeos' son secure a discount for a hotel room, the report said.
Pompeo slammed the report, saying it was politically motivated and filled with factual errors.
""At no time did I, or my wife Susan, misuse taxpayer money or violate rules or ethical norms,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""Our actions were constantly reviewed by dozens of lawyers, and we made massive efforts, and did, comply with every requirement,"" he said.
Pompeo during his tenure had a contentious relationship with the Department's watchdog. A former inspector general, Steve Linick, was fired by Trump at Pompeo's recommendation.
Linick was probing whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife. 

OIG said it had completed most of its fieldwork on the report by August 2020. Its completion of the report was delayed because Pompeo refused to grant an interview to the OIG for several months until sitting down with them in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden faced increased pressure on Friday to stem gun violence amid a rash of mass shootings across the United States, but he faces an uphill battle to significantly change the country's permissive firearms laws.
The day after a shooter killed eight people and himself at a FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) facility in Indianapolis, Biden insisted he could tackle the problem while also pushing a sweeping jobs package and working to rein in the coronavirus pandemic.
""This has to end. It's a national embarrassment,"" Biden said at a White House press conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. 
Biden said Congress should ban military-style ""assault"" weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines. Biden authored a similar ban in the U.S. Senate that expired in 2004. 
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said earlier in the day that Congress should also allow victims to sue gun manufacturers.
The Indianapolis shooting was at least the fifth such event in as many weeks, an unwelcome return to frequent high-profile violence as many in the nation emerge from a pandemic bubble.
Biden has taken limited steps so far to tighten federal gun regulations, and has called for more money to fight the problem. 
He will have to persuade congressional Republicans to agree to take more significant steps. That is a challenge given that previous attempts at legislation have stalled repeatedly over the past decade, even as hundreds of thousands of Americans have died. 
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives this year passed legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers, But it faces steep odds in the Senate as lawmakers from rural states where gun ownership is widespread wield disproportionate influence. 
Democrats and Republicans in that chamber are discussing a possible compromise. Congress has yet to take up Biden's proposed assault-weapon ban, though several states have prohibitions in place.
Opinion polls show broad public support for tighter gun laws.
Gun-control advocates said on Friday that Senate Democrats should be ready to override Republicans if necessary by ditching longstanding rules that require a supermajority to advance most legislation in the chamber. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between the two parties. They also said Biden should demonstrate that the issue is a priority by discussing it in a planned April 28 speech to Congress.
VICTIMS FRUSTRATED
At a news conference organized by The Time is Now Coalition, an advocacy group, several people who have suffered losses from gun violence said on Friday that they were frustrated by the inaction.
""The time is indeed now to act but the time has been now to act for years, for decades,"" said Peter Read, whose daughter Mary was one of 32 people killed in a mass shooting at Virginia Tech University 14 years ago.
With about 121 firearms for every 100 residents, the United States is by far the most heavily armed society in the world, and the number of gun deaths has climbed steadily in recent years. 
Some 43,539 Americans died of gun violence last year, with more than half of those due to suicide, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a research group.
At least 30 people have been killed in U.S. mass shootings in the last month alone. Those events draw headlines, but they typically account for less than 1% of firearms deaths each year. 
The Indianapolis shooting came on the heels of deadly shootings at spas in the Atlanta area and a supermarket in Boulder. Police say suspects in those incidents purchased their weapons legally.
Biden earlier this month said his administration would crack down on self-assembled ghost guns and tightly regulate stabilizing braces that effectively turn pistols into rifles. He also said he would make it easier for states to adopt red-flag laws that allow authorities to take gun from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.

Those initiatives do not require cooperation from Congress, but they will take time to put in place. 
The Department of Justice needs to create a paper trail to show that any rule change was not abrupt or political and has a strong foundation in law to stave off anticipated legal challenges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo met with environmental groups on Friday to discuss ways to leverage the corporate tax system to help address climate change, Treasury said in a statement.
Yellen discussed the importance of ""using all the tools at our disposal, including the tax code, to drive toward net-zero emissions,"" the statement said. 
She noted that President Joe Biden's proposed tax changes would begin to modernize how the United States treats the fossil fuel industry by removing subsidies that date back to the early 1900s, the statement said.
Yellen and Adeyemo met virtually with officials from the Center for American Progress, Corridor Partners, Environmental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth, League of Conservation Voters, Moms Clean Air Force, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, NextGen America, and Sierra Club, Treasury said.
No comment was immediately available from the groups.
Biden and his administration are moving rapidly to reverse the policies of Republican former President Donald Trump, a vocal climate change skeptic, who had pushed policies to maximize fossil fuel development.
The Treasury meeting came days before Biden's summit with global leaders on climate change.
The U.S. Interior Department on Friday also sought to erase the Trump administration's pro-fossil fuels legacy by revoking a series of policies that boosted drilling and mining, and ordering that climate change be put at the forefront in future agency decisions.
During the Treasury meeting, Adeyemo discussed proposed changes in the corporate tax law and how they will interact with other parts of the climate agenda, Treasury said. 
He described Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes funding for funding electric vehicles and other alternative energy projects, as ""the most significant investment in the fight against climate change the country has ever made. 

Treasury said participants discussed ""the benefits of removing tax subsidies for fossil fuel producers and creating tax incentives for clean energy producers.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over a dozen Democratic senators on Friday urged U.S. President Joe Biden to withhold financial assistance to Brazil unless it demonstrates it is reducing deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cracking down on environmental crimes.
The letter, signed by 15 senators led by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy and New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, was sent days before Biden hosts a virtual climate leaders summit on April 22-23, which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is due to attend. It also comes as U.S. climate envoy John Kerry engages with Brazil to secure climate commitments.
They warned Biden to be wary of pledges by the right-wing South American leader. Deforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest has skyrocketed under Bolsonaro, hitting a 12-year high in 2020 with an area 14 times the size of New York City being destroyed, government data show. Bolsonaro has also weakened environmental enforcement and urged development in the area.
""In recent weeks, the Bolsonaro administration has repeatedly expressed interest in working with the United States on environmental issues. But, until now, it has demonstrated no serious interest in working with the multiple actors within Brazil who would play essential roles in any serious efforts to save the Amazon rainforest,"" the letter said.
The U.S. and Brazil have been in talks since February over a potential deal to finance efforts to combat illegal deforestation, although sources told Reuters the negotiations are at an impasse ahead of next week's summit because the U.S. is demanding results up front.
Bolsonaro said in a letter to Biden on Wednesday that Brazil would end illegal deforestation by 2030, reaffirming a commitment the country made in 2015. 
Brazil is seeking $1 billion in aid from the United States and other countries as a pre-condition to reducing deforestation by between 30% and 40% over a 12-month period. 
Kerry said in a tweet on Friday that Bolsonaro's ""recommitment to eliminating illegal deforestation is important"" and called for his ""engagement with indigenous populations and civil society so this announcement can deliver tangible results."" 

Norway's environment minister told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/brazil-must-show-amazon-protection-is-working-top-donor-norway-says-2021-04-14 this week that it will withhold payments into the Amazon fund, created a decade ago to combat deforestation, until Brazil can demonstrate that it is protecting the rainforest.

Republican former President Donald Trump, a vocal climate change skeptic, pushed policies to maximize fossil fuel development on federal lands and waters with a mantra of ""energy dominance.""
In a statement, the agency said Secretary Deb Haaland issued an order revoking 12 policies issued under Trump. They ranged from orders to review Obama-era policies that hindered energy development, rolling back a moratorium on coal leasing, and an effort to expedite permitting of infrastructure on public lands.
In addition, the agency withdrew a legal opinion issued in the final week of Trump's presidency that said federal law requires the Interior Department to implement an offshore oil and gas leasing program that includes at least two sales every five years. 
The agency is reviewing its onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing programs in what is widely seen as a step toward delivering on Biden's campaign pledge to ban new federal leasing.
In another order issued on Friday, Haaland established a climate change task force to coordinate efforts like boosting renewable energy development on federal lands and waters. 
In the same order, the department outlined how science should guide decision-making and instructed officials to maintain robust environmental reviews that analyze climate change and engage tribes and underserved communities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn his election defeat on average raised less in campaign funds in the first three months of the year than those who opposed it, federal records show. 
Sixty-five House Republicans who voted in January to accept election results that put President Joe Biden in the White House raised about $360,000 on average for their re-election campaigns, according to a Reuters review of Federal Election Commission disclosures through Thursday's filing deadline.
That is about 25% higher than the roughly $290,000 on average raised by re-election campaigns for 136 House Republicans who voted in support of Trump's false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread election fraud.
Among prominent House Republicans who voted against Trump's claims, Wyoming's Liz Cheney raised $1.5 million, Illinois' Adam Kinzinger took in over $1 million and Washington state's Jamie Herrera Beutler raised more than $700,000.
Some individual Trump backers, however, out-raised them.
Firebrand freshman Marjorie Taylor Greene raised $3.2 million in her first three months in office. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and No. 2 Steve Scalise, who both voted to object to the presidential results, raised $2.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
The vote to support Trump's claims came just hours after hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to overturn the election results, leaving five dead.
The figures show the effect of vows by some corporate-controlled donor groups not to support lawmakers who voted in support of Trump's false claim.
Democrats won the White House and narrow margins of control in both houses of Congress in November's election. Both parties are gearing up for the 2022 midterm elections, when the full House and one-third of the Senate will be up for election.
'STRAW IN THE WIND'
Republicans have history on their side, as the president's party typically loses seats in the first midterm election after taking office. If they succeed in winning a majority in either or both houses, they could use that to block Biden's agenda.
""These figures may well be an interesting straw in the wind about political sentiments in early 2021,"" said William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""But whether that money gap turns out to have a significant impact on the political performance of candidates, on one side or the other of the Jan. 6 breach, is a different question.""
The party as a whole did well: the National Republican Congressional Committee said it raised $33.7 million in the first quarter, a record for a year without congressional elections. Its Democratic counterpart has not yet reported first-quarter results.
The data includes filings from the 201 Republicans who won House seats in November and are seeking re-election in 2022 after casting votes on whether to accept Biden's victory.
Political action committees, or PACs, which include the corporate committees as well as other institutional donor groups, gave more than twice as much to lawmakers who voted to uphold the election. Many of those lawmakers also represent more competitive districts, making fundraising more important to their success.
Dozens of large U.S. companies vowed to halt donations to Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn the election loss. Their pledges drew significant attention, which belied the fact that corporate money in recent years has played a smaller role in U.S. politics, with small individual donations representing a greater share.
Large donors also showed signs of favoring Republicans who voted to accept Biden's victory, who on average took in about $150,000 from individuals giving more than $200. Republicans who voted to overturn Biden's win on average raised about $100,000 from large donors.
The gap could also suggest that House Republicans who voted to certify the 2020 election have a greater impetus to raise campaign donations because they are in more competitive districts or anticipate primary challenges. 

""A higher percentage of the people who voted to certify are in competitive districts,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Democratic senators will introduce legislation on Friday that would reassert Congress' oversight of international weapons deals, after President Joe Biden's administration decided to go ahead with a $23 billion sale to the United Arab Emirates that had worried lawmakers, congressional aides said.
The bill, seen by Reuters, will be introduced by Senators Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Dianne Feinstein, a senior member of the intelligence committee.
The ""Secure F-35 Exports Act of 2020"" would apply to the sale of the sophisticated U.S. military technology to countries that are not NATO members or Israel, Australia, Japan, South Korea or New Zealand.
Among other things, it would bar the sale of the F-35s - which can take years after a deal is agreed - unless any president makes detailed certifications to Congress that the critical technology would not fall into the wrong hands, or otherwise compromise advanced technology.
It also would require that any sale to a Middle Eastern country other than Israel not compromise Israel's military advantage over such countries, and come with assurances that the aircraft would not be used in operations harmful to Israel's security.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration had told lawmakers it was proceeding with more than $23 billion in weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates, including advanced F-35 aircraft, armed drones and other equipment.
The Democrat's administration had paused the deals agreed to by former Republican President Donald Trump to allow a review.
The sales to the Gulf nation were signed right before Trump left office on Jan. 20, and many members of Congress - especially Biden's fellow Democrats - felt they had been rushed through without proper review.
""We must enact protections to ensure the incredibly sensitive technology of these aircraft is not compromised by powers hostile to the United States, including making sure the UAE pulls back from its burgeoning relationship with China and other U.S. competitors,"" Menendez said in a statement provided to Reuters.
The Trump administration told Congress in November it had approved the U.S. sale to the UAE as a side deal to the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered agreement in September in which the UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel.
In the last months of the Trump administration, Israel reached deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco as part of the accords.
The $23.37 billion package contained products from General Atomics,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, including 50 F-35 Lighting II aircraft, up to 18 MQ-9B Unmanned Aerial Systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives have also said they are worried by Biden's decision. Representative Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday he and other lawmakers were concerned about the decision and would review the transactions. [L1N2M735P]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unlikely duo is steering President Joe Biden's efforts to restore U.S. credibility on fighting climate change: a patrician former presidential candidate and a plain-speaking, long-time civil servant – both with Boston roots and baseball loyalties. 
    John Kerry and Gina McCarthy worked together under former President Barack Obama, when Kerry served as secretary of state and McCarthy led the Environmental Protection Agency. 
    Now their mission is more targeted.
    The two must deliver in the coming days a new, ambitious pledge to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and win back trust from foreign allies after former President Donald Trump pulled the country from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
    The pledge, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC, will be released ahead of a U.S.-led climate summit with world leaders on April 22-23, Biden's first major foray into climate talks since re-entering the Paris accord.
    ""The NDC ... is a critical component of our currency abroad,"" Kerry told Reuters in an interview when he started his new job as international climate envoy.
    The White House declined to give details about the makeup of the plan, but sources familiar with the process expect a pledge to cut U.S. emissions by around 50% by 2030 from 2005 levels – perhaps in a range of 49% to 53%.
McCarthy, who as Biden's domestic climate adviser has the responsibility for spearheading the effort, has been working for months to set the emissions goal and a strategy to implement it, while Kerry has been pressing other countries to set ambitious targets of their own.
    ""Kerry's been very clear with Gina that if it doesn't have a 5 in front of the number, it's a non-starter in the international community,"" one source familiar with the issue said.
    That target would hew to the world’s goal of halving global emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050 in order to hold global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. 
    Kerry said he and McCarthy would engage with lawmakers to bring legislative aspects of the plan to fruition. 
   ""It's going to be very important to have buy-in,"" he said, ""and we'll work to get it."" 
CHALLENGES AND CREDIBILITY
With Kerry on a world tour this month to persuade China and other large emitters to increase their own pledges, McCarthy has been working with a small team to bring U.S. industries and the American public on board.
Biden's credibility at home is also at stake. The president has made fighting climate change a top domestic priority, and his support among progressive voters will depend in part on the plan McCarthy can help deliver.
At the same time, the plan needs enough teeth to last beyond Biden’s time in office, even if he serves a second four-year term, so that it cannot be changed easily by a successor who may not share Biden's views.
    A White House official emphasized this week what Biden's aides often say: the team is taking a “whole-of-government” approach, relying on different agencies to help bring down emissions in the sectors they oversee.
    ""We're not ruling out any tool,"" McCarthy told Reuters in an interview earlier this year, listing legislation and regulation as key options to reach the target.
In fact, the Biden administration has already set its climate plans in motion – unveiling a $2 trillion infrastructure package in March that includes investments in renewable energy and clean transportation. Democrats aim to pass the bill by July, but it faces resistance from Republicans over tax increases embedded in the legislation.
    McCarthy’s ""biggest challenge is to make sure that the agencies are hitting their marks, but she also has to ensure, working with the rest of the team in the White House, that the Congress passes those investments,"" said John Podesta, a former climate adviser to Obama.
    Biden has been restoring environmental rules scrapped under Trump, while U.S. officials make frequent media appearances to sell the administration’s vision of a green economic recovery and job creation to the American public.
    But the impact of McCarthy’s work extends beyond U.S. borders, where a weak U.S. plan would undercut Kerry’s push for stronger climate action by the rest of the world. 
    ""Our ability to project, internationally, the leadership that is so sorely needed depends on our ability to deliver domestically,"" said Ali Zaidi, McCarthy's deputy.
    'IF NOT PRESIDENT...'
Kerry’s international climate efforts have been helped by his hard-earned stature in diplomatic circles. Aside from serving as Obama’s secretary of state, he had a long career as a U.S. senator and was the Democrats’ 2004 presidential nominee. 
    His job in the Biden administration gave Kerry a seat at the diplomatic table once again at the conclusion of his career. But the tall, globe-trotting Kerry has had to tow a tricky line in wooing foreign leaders, while being careful not to step on current Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s toes. 
    ""As a former secretary, he knows he needs to stay in his lane, and I think he will,” Podesta said. Kerry would ""have access not to the energy or the environment ministers, but to heads of state or heads of government, and ... that's a good thing."" 
    Kerry, when he is in town, has office space in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House and at the State Department, his former stomping grounds, where he has a sizable staff. 
McCarthy works from an office in the lower level of the White House's West Wing – good real estate for its proximity to the president. She was serving her first year as president of the Natural Resources Defense Council when, with encouragement from Kerry, she agreed to go back into government. 
The two have a shared love of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, and Kerry quipped that McCarthy has a ""better"" Boston accent. On climate, she remains focused on the domestic challenges while he handles diplomacy.
""John Kerry is more of the internationalist diplomat. That's what he loves, that's what he's done,” said Christine Todd Whitman, a former EPA administrator under Republican President George W. Bush. “And if not president, then that's a pretty good place to be."" 
    She noted that Kerry and McCarthy have “very different personalities.”

    “But I think that's what's going to make it interesting, and going to make it work.""

800,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>",,,,,"(Reuters) - Washington state lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday setting a target to stop sales of gasoline-fueled vehicles there beginning in 2030, five years sooner than California.
The target is not a firm mandate and is contingent on the state adopting a tax on vehicle miles traveled, a measure to help pay for new transportation infrastructure, according to the text of the bill. 
The move by the Pacific Northwest state comes as efforts to boost adoption of electric vehicles are accelerating over concerns about fossil fuels' contribution to climate change.
Transport is the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States ahead of the power sector, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
California's governor issued an executive order last year requiring all new cars and trucks sold in the top U.S. auto market to be zero-emissions by 2035, and the Canadian province of Quebec has set a similar mandate. 
Automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has said it aspires to stop selling gas-fueled passenger cars by the same date. 
Washington's 2030 electric vehicle goal would kick in once three-quarters of the state's registered vehicles are subject to a so-called road usage charge, according to the bill's text.
The legislation must be signed by Democratic Governor Jay Inslee before becoming law. Inslee's office did not immediately respond to a question on whether he would sign it.

Washington-based environmental activist group Coltura called the passage of the bill a victory for the fight against climate change, saying it would accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.

Pence, 61, who previously disclosed an ""asymptomatic"" heart condition, underwent the procedure at the Inova Fairfax medical facility in Virginia after experiencing symptoms associated with a slow heart rate over the past two weeks, spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a statement.
“I am grateful for the swift professionalism and care of the outstanding doctors, nurses and staff at Inova Heart and Vascular Institute,"" Pence said in a statement, adding thanks to his doctors in his home state of Indiana.
When he was nominated as Donald Trump's running mate in the 2016 presidential election, the former Indiana governor disclosed his medical history, including a diagnosis of asymptomatic left bundle branch block, a condition that can be a sign of an underlying heart condition.
""The routine surgery was successful, and he is expected to fully recover and return to normal activity in the coming days,"" O'Malley said.
Trump criticized Pence sharply in the final month of his administration after Pence refused to intervene to stop the congressional certification of the 2020 electoral vote tally, an authority the vice president did not have.

The vote certifying Democrat Joe Biden's election victory was the backdrop for the events on Jan. 6 when pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
Trump, who falsely claims he lost the November election because of widespread fraud, told donors on Saturday that he had spoken to Pence recently and told him he was still disappointed in him, an attendee at the dinner for Republican National Committee donors said.

The bill, seen by Reuters, is a new version of a similar measure that passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December 2019, but was never considered by the full Senate, then controlled by Republicans.
If a president attempts to leave NATO without Senate approval, the bill would prohibit funding for such a move and authorizes the Congressional Legal Counsel to challenge the administration in court.
""This bill expresses clear congressional support for the continuing value of NATO and clarifies that no President acting alone can sever the bonds of the alliance,"" Senator Tim Kaine, one of the measure's lead sponsors, said in a statement.
Former Republican President Donald Trump was a critic of NATO, criticizing allies for failing to pay their fair share, calling it outdated and once suggesting that Washington could withdraw.
NATO has been in the spotlight this month as Russia has built up troops near Ukraine and Crimea, the peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014. NATO foreign and defense ministers held emergency discussions this week on the massing of Russian troops.
""With Moscow’s growing subversive aggressions, we must ensure no U.S. President withdraws from NATO without the advice and consent of the Senate,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the bill's other lead sponsor, said in a statement.
Kaine and Rubio both sit on the foreign relations committee.
The bill's other sponsors include three Republicans, nine Democrats and one independent, Senator Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats. 

The bill's sponsors are optimistic about its chances of passing and becoming law, given President Joe Biden's recent expressions of strong support for the alliance. Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control both the Senate and House of Representatives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have advanced a bill that could pave the way to reparations for Black Americans as part of a broader effort to address centuries of enslavement and institutional racism.
The House Judiciary Committee late on Wednesday voted 25-17 to create a commission to draft reparation proposals, an idea first proposed in Congress three decades ago. No Republicans voted to support the measure, a committee spokeswoman said.
""Slavery was this country’s original sin. Our Constitution protected it and we continue to grapple with its effects today,"" Democratic Representative Steve Cohen, a senior committee member, tweeted late on Wednesday.
The partisan vote underscores the difficulties the legislation faces in a Congress where prominent Republicans oppose the measure and none have joined the 175 members of President Joe Biden's Democratic Party as co-sponsors.
With Republicans expected to try to block the bill in the Senate, some Democrats already were weighing a new strategy.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Wednesday told reporters that he hoped Biden would use his own powers to create the commission. Biden took office in January, having defeated Republican President Donald Trump in a November election.
The House Democrats' bill would set up a commission to examine enslavement and discrimination from 1619 to the present and draft reparation proposals. It would be modeled on a commission Congress approved in the 1980s to document the World War Two incarceration of thousands of Japanese-Americans.
""This is not a cry for a handout. It is a cry for an acknowledgement that there has never been a response to the unpaid labor that helped build this nation,"" Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee told reporters this week.
The idea is gaining traction in some parts of the United States. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, last month became the first U.S. city to offer reparation money to Black residents. 
The action coincides with anti-racism protests in cities across the country and while a former Minnesota police officer is on trial, accused of murdering a Black man, George Floyd, in one of a long series of killings that have stirred outrage.
Even if the bill passes the Democratic-controlled House, where it would need a simple majority, it would face a higher hurdle in the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans and all 50 Democrats would have to support the bill for it to pass.
When the measure was last debated in Congress in 2019, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell opposed it, saying at the time: ""No one currently alive was responsible"" for enslaving Black people brought to America during centuries of slave trade. 
Toward the end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865, freed slaves were promised ""40 acres (of land) and a mule"" but the pledge was annulled following President Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Thursday is the 156th anniversary of his death. 

Today African-Americans, who comprise around 13 percent of the U.S. population, suffer disparities in pay, housing and healthcare, including in distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden wants three Central American countries to crack down on corruption as part of a plan to spend billions of dollars in the region to stem illegal migration.
Yet accusations of graft and authoritarianism dog some of very leaders Biden must work with in Central America, feeding concerns about their desire to clean up government.
Since taking office in January, Biden's administration has pledged to set up a regional task force to fight graft, and threatened to freeze U.S. bank accounts of corrupt officials in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - three countries known as the Northern Triangle that account for much of undocumented immigration to the United States.
With apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexican border at their highest level in two decades, Biden is pursuing a $4 billion plan in Central America.
Washington regards corruption and poor governance, alongside poverty and violence, as key factors behind Central American emigration, and is worried that any U.S. financial aid for the region could fall prey to corruption.
The Biden administration is urging the region's governments to meet targets on combating corruption, to support judicial and electoral independence, and to protect human rights, a U.S. State Department official told Reuters.
Leaders in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador need to oversee ""systemic change,"" the official said.
""We're not going to be able to have a close partnership with governments that are not committed to working against corruption,"" Brendan O'Brien, acting head at the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador, told Reuters.
The region's record on corruption is patchy.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez is himself under investigation by U.S. prosecutors for alleged links to drug cartels and has warned that the allegations could harm international cooperation. He denies any involvement in drug smuggling. His brother was sentenced to life in prison for narcotics trafficking by a U.S. court last month.
    To many in Washington, Honduras is the main worry in Central America. Elections to replace Hernandez are due in November but several of the front-runners have already been embroiled in corruption probes.
In El Salvador, the growing concentration of power by President Nayib Bukele, who last year sent troops into the national parliament to pressure lawmakers into approving law and order legislation, also unsettles U.S. officials.
Bukele has criticized Biden's plans as a rehash of the Obama-era Alliance for Prosperity, a regional economic development scheme, which he said failed to yield results. 
Last week he ignored a request from the U.S. envoy to the Northern Triangle, Ricardo Zuniga, for a meeting during a visit to El Salvador.
    In Guatemala, President Alejandro Giammattei raised alarms in Washington by appointing his lawyer to sit on the country's highest tribunal, the Constitutional Court.
On Tuesday, Guatemala's Congress refused to swear in a renowned anti-graft campaigner as the new president of the court, leaving it controlled by judges with ties to political parties, corruption scandals and the military establishment.
""It's going to be difficult for the Biden administration to find reliable allies among Central American governments,"" said Adam Isacson of the Washington Office for Latin American Affairs, a human rights advocacy group.
WORRY
    Publicly, the three governments have pledged to eradicate graft. Hernandez's cabinet chief Carlos Madero said Honduras was committed to tackling corruption and would remain a reliable partner for Washington in counter-narcotics.
Guatemala's presidency told Reuters combating corruption was a top priority: not based on ""dispositions or conditions from abroad"" but because it was ""the right thing to do.""
El Salvador's government, which did not reply to requests for comment, has promised to clean up public life, launching an internationally backed anti-graft commission in 2019.
But with the Biden administration planning to increase aid to the region and U.S. lawmakers wary about wasting taxpayers' money, Washington will not cut ""a blank check"" to its governments, a senior U.S. official told Reuters.
U.S. officials say Washington wants to channel support to civil society groups, limiting direct aid to governments.
    Still, one U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, expressed concern that NGOs were often not equipped to absorb the millions of dollars Washington wanted to deploy, and that they too required higher levels of transparency.
    The United States is considering conditional cash transfers to help address the economic hardships that lead people from the Northern Triangle to trek to the United States, as well as sending COVID-19 vaccines to those countries.
U.S. officials say Central American countries should support a regionally backed and independent anti-corruption commission, similar to ones established in Guatemala and Honduras that were shuttered in 2019 and 2020.
Washington also wants more Justice and Treasury Department officials working in the region to combat crime, and to create a new office for investigating corruption, one U.S. official said.
In El Salvador, Bukele must commit to a clear separation of powers and transparency, the official added.
    Corruption is just one factor fueling migration. Governments are also struggling to combat endemic violence by street gangs, and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Two hurricanes also devastated the region in November.

""The people get poorer and they, the officials in charge, get richer,"" said 39-year-old Laura Escobar, a Salvadoran who plans to emigrate after losing her job in the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it is backing Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema with campaign contributions, rewarding them for their opposition to some of President Joe Biden's legislative initiatives and for trying to work with Republicans.
In disclosures made public on Thursday, the Chamber said its political action committee during the first quarter made about $17,000 worth of contributions to the two senators and nine house members. These included Carlos Gimenez of Florida and Steve Chabot of Ohio, two Republican congressmen who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results after attacks on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump.
After the U.S. Capitol incident, the largest U.S. business lobbying group said it would evaluate members on the ""totality"" of their actions, including working in a bipartisan manner.
""The U.S. Chamber supports elected officials based on their position on issues important to the business community and their commitment to governing,"" a Chamber spokesperson said. ""This quarter we were pleased to support Republicans and Democrat members who have demonstrated a willingness to do the hard work of coming together and finding solutions to the problems facing our country.""
Manchin and Sinema are opposed to ending the Senate's filibuster https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-filibuster-explainer/what-is-the-u-s-senate-filibuster-and-why-is-everyone-talking-about-it-idUSKBN2B921T, a custom that requires a 60-vote majority to advance most legislation. The Chamber also has called for preserving the filibuster to require Democrats, who control a single-vote Senate majority, to seek support from Republicans on major non-budgetary initiatives. 
The Chamber also supported two Republican House members who voted in favor of impeaching Trump in January, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and freshman Peter Meijer of Michigan. Both are facing primary challenges for 2022 elections.

The Chamber also said it made contributions to pro-trade Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar and Republican House members Dan Crenshaw, Don Bacon, and freshmen Nancy Mace and Young Kim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday named a liaison to Asian Americans, who are contending with rising violence, after facing pressure to ensure greater diversity among top administration officials.
Biden picked onetime congressional aide Erika Moritsugu to spearhead outreach to the increasingly politically significant Asian American and Pacific Islander diaspora. In a statement, the White House said Moritsugu would be ""a vital voice"" to advance the administration's priorities.
Moritsugu's hire coincided with White House efforts to mollify concerns among Democrats over Asian American representation in the administration's senior leadership after the community was targeted in the aftermath of lockdowns to cope with the novel coronavirus, which was first identified in China in 2019.
Biden tapped Kamala Harris, an Asian American as his vice presidential running mate, and he has named other officials of Asian descent to top jobs, including Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. Yet, other than Harris, Biden's senior-most ""permanent"" Cabinet positions include no Asian Americans.
Moritsugu was most recently vice president at National Partnership for Women & Families, a non-profit where her portfolio included congressional outreach and advocacy on policy issues affecting women of color.
She also has significant experience on Capitol Hill, including working for Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who had threatened to block Biden's nominees over insufficient Asian American representation in his administration. Duckworth dropped that ultimatum after Biden agreed to create the new liaison role.
Biden has promised action on racial equity, calling it one of his top priorities.
The administration backs a Senate bill that would expand Justice Department reviews of anti-Asian crimes. Senators on Wednesday moved to let an up-or-down vote be held on the bill.
A recent report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, showed that crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders jumped by 145% in 2020.

Asian-American voters turned out in record numbers in presidential battleground states in the 2020 election, helping tip states such as Georgia to Biden.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate is expected to take its first step forward on President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure package next week, while Senate Republicans are preparing a narrower proposal less than one-third the size. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday that he intends to take up a $30 billion water resources bill as an initial test of Republican willingness to work with Democrats on Biden's sweeping infrastructure proposal. 
""The water infrastructure bill is a small but important part of that overall effort,"" Schumer said in a floor speech, adding the measure had unanimous bipartisan support from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
""It will authorize tens of billions of dollars to make sure American families, especially low-income families, have access to safe and clean drinking water,"" he said. 
Schumer announced the move amid growing bipartisan talks in the Senate and at the White House about how to advance infrastructure legislation that can create jobs and stimulate the economy as it recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito told reporters that Republicans were working on their own infrastructure proposal and said in a CNBC interview there could be bipartisan support for a package of $600 billion to $800 billion. 
Eight members of a bipartisan group of House of Representatives lawmakers known as the ""Problem Solvers Caucus"" discussed infrastructure Wednesday with White House officials. Several lawmakers urged the White House to consider a more ""manageable"" and traditional infrastructure package, participant Republican Representative Dusty Johnson told Reuters.
The Biden package would not only repair America's roads and bridges but seek to rechart the course of the U.S. economy by tackling climate change and boosting social programs such as eldercare. 
Republicans say the plan is dominated by spending unrelated to traditional infrastructure, and they reject a proposal to finance the initiative by raising taxes on U.S. corporations.
Johnson said there is a ""fair amount of skepticism"" among Republicans that the Biden administration's desire for bipartisanship on infrastructure is genuine - but added that the two White House officials at the meeting, chief of staff Ron Klain and presidential counselor Steve Ricchetti, seemed sincere. ""We will be looking for ... the next few steps they take to reinforce their message,"" Johnson said. 

Biden has started to meet bipartisan groups of lawmakers at the White House in an effort to win Republican support for his infrastructure plan. But Democrats have said they will move forward without Republicans through a legislative process called reconciliation if their opposition continues. 
Republicans say they want to focus on roads, bridges, airports, ports, waterways and broadband access, and pay for the improvements with user fees such as road-related taxes and unspent COVID-19 relief funding.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A law enforcement internal probe of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol found significant shortcomings within the police department charged with securing the complex and made dozens of recommendations for avoiding a repeat of the violence.
The U.S. Capitol Police inspector general, in two reports submitted to Congress last month, focused on ""deficiencies"" within the police department's unit that handles civil disturbances, along with poor coordination and training within its intelligence operations.
Summaries of the two reports were reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.
The House of Representatives Administration Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on Thursday with Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton testifying.
On Jan. 6, as Congress was attempting to certify Joe Biden's election victory, supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, injuring scores of police officers.
That came shortly after Trump rallied his supporters and urged them to fight to stop the certification of Biden's win.
It took hours for police, battling the rioters, to restore order to the Capitol. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Police officer.
The inspector general found the department's Civil Disturbance Unit was operating that day ""at a decreased level of readiness."" It also said the department had to do a better job of ensuring that weapons and ammunition, as well as riot shields, are properly maintained and supplied to officers.

The department in a statement said it ""fully agrees"" with many of the recommendations but it would need additional funding to implement them.
In early March, a task force headed by retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Russel Honoré made similar recommendations and called for the creation of a quick-reaction force in Washington to deploy to similar disturbances.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Hate crime legislation intended to combat violence against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic advanced in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, easily overcoming the Senate procedural tool known as the filibuster.
Senators on Wednesday took a procedural vote on whether to limit debate on the overall bill. Under the chamber's filibuster rule, at least 60 senators must consent to take that step, requiring bipartisan support since the chamber is divided 50-50.
It cleared the initial hurdle with a bipartisan vote of 92-6.
It was not immediately clear when the Senate would vote on final passage of the bill. Schumer told Democrats in a meeting on Tuesday that the goal was to pass the bill by the end of the week, according to a Senate Democratic source in the meeting.
The bill, led by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono and Congresswoman Grace Meng, comes after a spate of high-profile attacks on Asian Americans. It designates a Justice Department employee to expedite a review of hate crimes reported to police during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It would also provide guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes, expand public education campaigns and issue guidance to combat discriminatory language in describing the pandemic.
Reports of violence and discrimination against Asian Americans have surged during the pandemic, after former President Donald Trump started calling the coronavirus the ""China virus.""
""At a time when the AAPI community is under siege, this bill is an important signal that Congress is taking anti-Asian racism and hatred seriously,"" said Hirono, using an acronym referring to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, before the vote.
Hirono said she was working with Republican Senator Susan Collins on additional language to broaden support for the bill and supported a bipartisan amendment that would add the ""No Hate Act"" to the legislation. 

That amendment, led by Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Jerry Moran in the Senate, would train law enforcement agencies on hate crime investigations and expand resources for victims, among other measures.
The bill, which was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 2016 by Congressman Don Beyer, was reintroduced in that chamber earlier this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Supreme Court justices from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum are calling on Americans to learn to talk civilly to each other or risk lasting damage to the nation's democratic system.
Speaking in a pre-recorded discussion released on Wednesday, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch both bemoaned the current state of public discourse, which they said was abetted by the spread of disinformation on social media.
The United States in the past year has endured a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election, an attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob and police incidents that triggered protests against racial injustice.
""We have a ... very heated debate going on. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can turn into an awful thing, into something that destroys the fabric of our community, if we don't learn to talk to each other,"" Sotomayor said.
The event - focusing on how a lack of civics education can harm national security - was co-hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank and the National Security Institute at George Mason University's law school.
Sotomayor, appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, said she was heartened by the high turnout in last year's election but lamented that ""at the same time we see some of the cracks in our system.""
Gorsuch, appointed by Trump, said people could learn from the court, where the justices tout their ability to remain cordial despite their differences.
""How can a democracy function if we can't talk to one another and if we can't disagree kindly, with respect for one another's differences and different points of view?"" Gorsuch asked.
Gorsuch noted that some surveys have shown that only a third of Americans think living in a democracy is important.

""It's no surprise that a lot of the false information spread on social media is deliberately spread by our enemies to sow disagreement internally in the country,"" Gorsuch said. ""If we allow them to destroy our sense of 'we the people' - our sense of community, our sense of our shared liberties that we love and treasure - that's hard to come back from.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted 53-45 to confirm Brenda Mallory as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), a key role that is central to federal environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects and coordinating the administration's environmental justice and climate change policies.
Mallory will be the first African American to serve as CEQ Chair after previous stints at the Environmental Protection Agency, as CEQ General Counsel and most recently as head of regulatory affairs at the green advocacy group Southern Environmental Law Center.
The CEQ coordinates White House energy and environmental policies across federal agencies, and can have broad influence on the outlook for big infrastructure projects from pipelines to industrial facilities.
""By helping forge unity of purpose – across communities, across the country, and across government – CEQ will help our nation rise to the environmental challenges of our time, from climate change and the nature crisis to the environmental injustices that have plagued our country for too long,"" Mallory said in a statement.
She began her career in private practice as a lawyer dealing with the application of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a bedrock environmental law administered by CEQ.
In an interview with Reuters ahead of her nomination last December, Mallory said she hoped the council would reverse changes made by the Trump administration, which sought to ease and speed up NEPA approval of big energy infrastructure projects.

The Trump-era changes eased requirements to weigh climate change impacts of a project and limited the amount of public comment, a move seen as diminishing the voice of low-income and minority communities that are often opposed to these projects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Nearly a year after President Joe Biden called for ""real action"" on police brutality as part of a pledge to fix U.S. racial inequality, he is coming up against the limits of presidential power.
The White House shelved a proposed police oversight commission this week to focus on a police reform bill that has narrow hopes in Congress. The move comes as anger grows over the killing of another Black man, Daunte Wright, who was stopped by police just miles from where George Floyd was killed last May.
Though Democrats, Republicans, police unions and civil rights activists agree that U.S. policing must change, there still appears to be no immediate path to broad national reform, activists say. 
""It kind of feels as if we're stuck,"" said DeAnna Hoskins, a former Justice Department policy adviser and now president of JustLeadershipUSA, an advocacy group. ""The good intentions are there, but we also know good intentions pave the road to hell.""
The U.S. has a far higher rate of police killing of civilians than other wealthy countries, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. Black men are more than twice as likely to die in police custody than white men, a 2018 study https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-race-police-deaths/police-involved-deaths-vary-by-race-and-place-idUSKBN1KL2M4 showed. 
GEORGE FLOYD ACT
The Biden White House shelved the idea of a police oversight commission this week, after consulting with police unions and civil rights activists, since past administrations had already tried the idea.
Instead, it will put its weight behind a broad reform bill known as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, while revamping the Justice Department, which holds the administration's most tangible power over police departments.
However the bill, which passed the House of Representatives in March, is being fought by police unions and Republicans. Both support some reforms, including restricting police chokeholds and deploying body cameras, but oppose limiting ""qualified immunity,"" which shields officers accused of crimes from lawsuits.
The Fraternal Order of Police labor group has discussed police reform with Biden administration officials, but has not indicated support for the bill, said spokeswoman Jessica Cahill. ""We will reserve our comments for internal discussions with legislators,"" while the bill is still being negotiated, she said.
That may leave the issue short of the 60 Senate votes it would need to overcome a legislative filibuster and secure passage.
The police group, the nation's largest with more than 355,000 members, endorsed former President Donald Trump over Biden in the 2020 campaign.
Civil rights advocates, on the other hand, want the bill beefed up with items like restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to police departments. Biden could also do more with executive orders, some say. 
Asked about activists' demands Wednesday, press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House is ""working very closely with them on pushing for the passage of the George Floyd Act."" 
""I know that does not solve all the issues, we’re not suggesting that,"" she said. Biden's presidency is less than 100 days old, she said, adding ""there is more to come."" 
PRESIDENTS AND POLICE OVERSIGHT
The White House has no direct oversight of 18,000 local police departments and similar agencies.
President Barack Obama, who Biden served under as vice president from 2009 to 2017, made halting progress on police reform. Without major legislation, the DOJ ramped up investigations and recommended reforms on local police departments found to systematically abuse civil rights. Trump's administration shelved many of those efforts.
Biden officials are hoping to reinvigorate earlier efforts with his nominee to lead the DOJ civil rights division, Kristen Clarke, who previously called for defunding some policing operations and funneling the money into other community needs. 
Clarke faced sharp questions from Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday on the topic. She said did not support defunding the police, but was advocating for law enforcement to be more effective by ""channeling resources to emotional health treatment and other severely under-resourced areas,"" she said.
Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, are pushing for broader reforms. 
Both Wright and Floyd's fatal encounters with police were for relatively minor infractions: an expired vehicle registration and a suspected counterfeit $20 bill. 
Low-level misdemeanor crimes, including marijuana use, should be treated more leniently to reduce the likelihood of deadly interactions with law enforcement, advocates say. Some are also pushing for DOJ subpoena power to investigate police departments. Both measures also require congressional action.

Lauren-Brooke Eisen, director of the justice program at the Brennan Center, a legal advocacy group, says there is a growing number of people who believe police officers should not be called to respond to as many incidents as they do.
""As a country we should be focusing on ways to shrink law enforcement's contact with our community,"" she said.

Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Marsha Blackburn and Mike Lee introduced the bill in the Senate, Lee's office said in a statement. A version of the bill was also introduced in the House of Representatives by a group of Republican lawmakers.
""If Major League Baseball is going to act dishonestly and spread lies about Georgia's voting rights bill to favor one party against the other, they shouldn't expect to continue to receive special benefits from Congress,"" Cruz said in a statement, saying that MLB has enjoyed a special exemption from antitrust laws that other professional sports leagues do not.
MLB could not be reached immediately for comment.
MLB said earlier this month that it would move its All-Star Game out of Georgia to protest the state's new voting restrictions.
Major League Baseball won exemption from the Sherman Antitrust Act under a 1922 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which determined that professional baseball is not interstate commerce, according to a 2019 article in the Wake Forest Law Review. MLB's exemption has protected the league in its exclusive contracts for airing home team games on local cable television networks, the article said.
Under a bill passed by Congress in 1998, the Curt Flood Act, MLB did, however, lose its antitrust exemption related to labor issues.

Other professional sports leagues enjoy more limited antitrust exemptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate voted 53-45 on Wednesday to confirm former derivative markets regulator Gary Gensler as head of the country's top securities markets regulator, spelling a tougher regulatory regime for Wall Street. 
Gensler is expected to be sworn in as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman in the coming days.
A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, Gensler most recently led President Joe Biden's transition plan for financial industry oversight and served under former Democratic President Barack Obama as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
Wall Street banks, brokers, funds and public companies enjoyed four-years of easier rules and enforcement under former Republican President Donald Trump's administration, but that ended with Democratic President Joe Biden's appointment of SEC commissioner Allison Lee as interim chair.
She has wasted no time unraveling https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-financial-regulators-analys/analysis-with-quick-fixes-bidens-agencies-reverse-trumps-wall-street-friendly-rules-idUSKBN2BZ16N Trump's Wall Street-friendly policies using quick-fix legal tactics, including beefing up the agency's enforcement team and pursuing new corporate disclosure requirements.
Gensler, who developed a reputation as a tough operator willing to stand up to powerful Wall Street interests during his stint at the SEC, is expected to take an equally tough stance. 
Last month, he told Congress https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-financial-regulators/bidens-sec-nominee-vows-review-of-gamestop-trading-issues-climate-disclosures-idUSKBN2AU136 that he would pursue new regulations for cryptocurrencies, which he said can be a ""catalyst for change"" but pose investor protection concerns, and would explore new climate and political spending corporate disclosures.

""Gary Gensler has the perfect mix of market expertise, regulatory experience and commitment to the public interest to be an outstanding SEC Chairman,"" said Barbara Roper, chief investor advocate at Washington-based Consumer Federation of America.
""He'll have a long list of pressing issues to address once he is sworn in, but I have no doubt that he will dive into that workload with gusto.""

A chief architect of then-President Donald Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Brady told a business conference in his native Texas that he faces a six-year term limit as the top Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. He chaired the panel before handing the gavel over to Democratic Representative Richard Neal in 2019 after Democrats won a majority in the House.
Brady, 66, who was first elected to Congress in 1996, has played key roles in U.S. legislation on taxes, trade, retirement and healthcare.
He fought Democratic efforts to obtain Trump's income tax returns and late last year signed onto a House Republican amicus brief supporting a Texas lawsuit contesting the results of the 2020 president election, in which Trump was defeated by Democratic President Joe Biden. 
Brady said his departure has nothing to do with partisanship on Capitol Hill.
""I won't be able to chair the Ways & Means Committee in the next session when Republicans win back the House majority. Did that factor in? Honestly, some,"" he said in remarks prepared for delivery at the Woodlands Area Chamber of Commerce Economic Outlook Conference in his district near Houston. 

Brady won his 13th term two-year in office last November with nearly 73% of the vote.

Among the concerns to be discussed is whether the Supreme Court could rule that the FTC overstepped its authority when seeking ill-gotten gains from those accused of deceptive practices. The FTC, which cannot bring criminal charges, has said a ruling against it would severely curtail its ability to undo damage done by fraudsters.
FTC data shows that there have been 259,763 reports of fraud between January 2020 and April 2021, with a median loss of $340.
The witnesses will be FTC Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter and Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who has been nominated to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both are Democrats. Also testifying will be Republican Commissioners Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Kristen Clarke, President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Justice Department's civil rights division, fended off attacks from Republicans during her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying she does not support defunding the police while promising to find common ground with law enforcement.
In a combative hearing, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee took aim at Clarke for everything from articles she wrote and events she attended while she was an undergraduate at Harvard University, to her social media posts and an opinion piece she wrote in June headlined: ""I Prosecuted Police Killings. Defund the Police — But Be Strategic.""
""I do not support defunding the police,"" she said repeatedly throughout the hearing, noting that editors had written the headline of the June opinion piece.
The intention of the article, she added, was actually to convey the opposite view by advocating for finding better strategies to make it easier for law enforcement to be more effective by ""channeling resources to emotional health treatment and other severely under-resourced areas."" 
Clarke, a former Justice Department civil rights attorney who recently led the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, appeared for her confirmation hearing along with Todd Kim, the administration's pick for assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division.
Kim is a former Justice Department attorney, a former solicitor general for the District of Columbia and was a onetime contestant on a spinoff of the TV game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" 
If confirmed by the Senate, they will be assuming their posts at a critical time in history. 
The nation has seen a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic, while Republican-led legislatures in some states are advancing bills that critics say would disenfranchise Black voters, and criminal justice reform advocates are urging a wide range of reforms.
The Biden administration has also vowed to tackle environmental racial justice amid concerns that air and water pollution more often tend to hurt minority communities.
Clarke on Wednesday called the increase in attacks on Asian American and Pacific Islanders a ""crisis"" that warrants attention, and said more should be done to improve data reporting on hate crimes.
Kim received very few questions throughout the hearing, which was largely dominated by questions from both Republicans and Democrats directed towards Clarke, who unlike Kim has faced multiple political attacks from right-leaning groups.
""As I look at your record, I see the record of someone who has spent a career as a partisan,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz said.
Democrats, meanwhile, staunchly defended her record.
""People are trying to say you're wrong for this job when, dear God, you are what we need in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department,"" Democratic Senator Cory Booker said.
""If you're wrong for this job, then Thurgood Marshall was wrong,"" Booker continued, referring to the late civil rights attorney and Supreme Court justice. He said Marshall ""stood up for the disposed, despised and the hated and the vilified and the overlooked and spent his career trying to fight for those who others ignore.""
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, in his opening remarks on Wednesday, called accusations that Clarke is anti-police ""false"" and claims by her attackers that she is anti-Semitic based on a speaker she invited to an event at Harvard decades ago ""absurd.""

""Ms. Clarke has been a strong defender of human rights,"" he said.
""Anti-Semitism is real,"" Clarke said. ""It's something that I have fought throughout my career.""

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) -Foreign troops under NATO command will withdraw from Afghanistan in coordination with a U.S. pull-out by Sept. 11, Washington's top diplomat said on Wednesday, after Germany said it would match American plans to leave after two decades of war.
Around 7,000 non-U.S. forces from mainly NATO countries, also from Australia, New Zealand and Georgia, outnumber the 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but still rely on U.S. air support, planning and leadership for their training mission. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels that it was time for NATO allies to make good on their mantra that allies went into Afghanistan together and would leave together. 
""I am here to work closely with our allies, with the (NATO) secretary-general, on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together and out together,"" Blinken said in a televised statement at NATO headquarters.
An integral part of NATO's current mission, Resolute Support, is to train and equip Afghan security forces fighting the Islamist Taliban, which was ousted from power by a U.S. invasion in late 2001 and has since waged an insurgency. 
With non-U.S. troop numbers reaching as high as 40,000 in 2008, Europe, Canada and Australia have moved in tandem with the United States in a mission also providing long-term funding to rebuild Afghanistan despite the resurgence of Taliban-led violence and endemic official corruption in the country.
""We will work very closely together in the months ahead on a safe, deliberate and coordinated withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan,"" Blinken said, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
SEPT. 11 ANNIVERSARY
Sept. 11 is a highly symbolic date as it will be 20 years since al Qaeda attacked the United States with hijacked airliners, triggering military intervention in Afghanistan.
After withdrawing, the United States and NATO aim to rely on Afghan military and police forces, which they have developed with billions of dollars in funding, to maintain security though peace talks are struggling and the insurgency is resilient.
A key reason for a coordinated withdrawal is the fact that NATO relies on U.S. airlift capabilities and shipping to move valuable equipment back home out of landlocked Afghanistan. NATO also wants to avoid any hardware falling into the hands of militants, as happened after the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.
""A lot of a lot of armoured vehicles, helicopters and ammunition have been put into Afghanistan and four months is not a lot of time to get them home,"" said Jamie Shea, a former NATO official and now an analyst at the Friends of Europe think-tank.
""Many European forces won't want to abandon that equipment worth billions of dollars,"" he said, noting that some could be donated to Afghan security forces.

NATO foreign and defence ministers will discuss their plans later on Wednesday via video conference. 
German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said no NATO ally was expected to oppose U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement, expected later on Wednesday, for a complete U.S. withdrawal by Sept. 11. ""We have always said we are going in together, and we are going out together,"" she said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Yogurt was everywhere as volunteers opened boxes of fruit, frozen meat and dairy products that had shifted and spilled in transit to a food bank in Walworth County, Wisconsin.
They rushed to clean and transfer the packages of frozen meatballs, apples, milk and yogurt into cars for needy families to take home before they spoiled.
The food came from The Farmers to Families Food Box program that the Trump administration launched to feed out-of-work Americans with food rescued from farmers who would otherwise throw it away as the coronavirus pandemic upended food supply chains.
The government hired hundreds of private companies last spring to buy food no longer needed by restaurants, schools and cruise ships and haul it to overwhelmed food banks. But the program faced spilled and spoiled food, high costs and uneven distribution nationwide, according to interviews with food banks and distributors, and an analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) invoice data obtained through Freedom of Information requests.
Some of the companies charged the government more than double the program average while delivery to food banks was sometimes late. When the government contracted new vendors, some food banks relying on the program stopped receiving food at all. At the same time, the contractors delivered to churches or daycare centers that lacked adequate refrigeration.
""Food was abandoned to spoil,"" said Susan Hughes, managing director of the Walworth County Food and Diaper Pantry.
The USDA spent $4 billion on the food box program in 2020 – six times its normal emergency food budget. After reviewing the program, President Joe Biden's administration has decided not to continue it after May, USDA Communications Director Matt Herrick told Reuters.
Under newly appointed Secretary Tom Vilsack, the USDA is focused on different hunger initiatives, including expanding food stamp benefits and increasing food purchases through existing government food distribution programs, Herrick said. 
""We're not going to replace the program,"" he said. 
While food bank operators are thankful for the large volumes of fresh food from the food box program - and they stress that aid is still needed - many say far more families could have been fed by sticking to existing programs with proven quality and oversight.
Greg Ibach, USDA's former undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs under the Trump administration, helped design the food box program in about a month. He said it worked as well as other USDA programs that took years to develop.
""We were in a hurry. People were hungry; there wasn't food in grocery stores - if there was, they couldn't afford it,"" Ibach said. ""We got a lot of food out the door and in peoples' hands.""
HIGH COSTS, INCONSISTENT BOXES
When the food box program was rolled out in May 2020, the Trump administration touted it as a way of getting food to hungry Americans quickly. But by late June, the program fell short of delivery targets, Reuters reported. The government provided little guidance to food pantries and sometimes inexperienced distributors, who were often left to connect with one another on their own. [L1N2E91DJ]
After some states, including Montana and Nevada, received very little food early on, the Trump administration in June contracted with Gold Star Foods, a California-based school food distributor, to reach underserved areas, Gold Star's CEO Sean Leer said in an interview.
Gold Star billed the government between $87 and $102 in October and November for food boxes containing fruit, meat and dairy products. That's more than double the average of similar boxes from other companies at the time, according to USDA invoice data. Leer said the cost reflected the increase in food and freight prices during the pandemic supply chain disruption.
Leer said the company has at times delivered the food boxes at a loss. He noted that during the February cold snap in Texas, Gold Star sent food to the state from California because the weather caused supply problems in Texas.
Food delivered by Gold Star accounted for less than 2% of federal money spent on the food box program in 2020, though that will increase to just under 9% through April 2021, according to Reuters' review of USDA invoice data.
Companies delivered food in varying quantities at first, making cost comparisons between different vendors difficult. But in September USDA standardized the food boxes at no more than 24 pounds after feedback from food banks. 
From October through December, invoice data shows seven out of 105 companies, including Gold Star Foods, charged the government double the program's median price per pound of food. Three of those companies were awarded contracts by the Trump administration for nearly $32 million in January 2021.
The Biden administration says some companies may have overcharged the USDA.
""There was an unequal cost associated with the distribution and filling of these boxes. Some people made a significant percentage from filling the boxes,"" Vilsack said on a March 3 call with reporters.
The USDA specified food boxes delivered in 2021 to the continental U.S. cost between $27 and $48 per box. But cheaper boxes presented new challenges and put additional burdens on food banks, said Emily Broad Leib, director of Harvard Law School's Food Law and Policy Clinic. The lower-cost boxes contained lower quality food, and food companies at times refused to deliver them to smaller pantries, leaving local organizations scrambling to find extra money for delivery, she said.
RURAL AREAS LEFT OUT
Though some regional food banks have taken on the labor of delivering to multiple counties, most smaller food banks serve only one county. Deliveries to additional counties are at the expense of food banks, said Brian Greene, CEO of the Houston Food Bank.
Reuters' analysis of USDA data showed the program struggled in particular to reach rural counties. While cities and well-populated counties received millions of boxes of food, 896 counties - or nearly a third - received none, according to USDA data.
USDA's Herrick said the Biden administration's assessment of the program exposed problems in how the food aid was delivered.
""A lot of rural communities went unserved entirely,"" he said.
Counties that did receive food worked with as many as a dozen food companies over seven months in 2020. Every six to twelve weeks, the USDA introduced a new phase of the program, changing food suppliers and forcing food banks to scramble to connect with new vendors or lose food supplies.
""USDA didn't give (distributors) any guidance as to who to serve or keep serving,” said Harvard's Broad Leib. ""You can't rely on something if one day it's there, then the next day it's not.""

Despite the program's flaws, food banks say the nearly 133 million boxes of food delivered in 2020 averted an even greater crisis.
There are hungry Americans in nearly every city and county nationwide, said Kate Leone, senior VP of government relations at Feeding America, a national network of food banks. The organization estimates that about half of the children in some counties are food-insecure - worried about where their next meal might come from.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday will try to advance a bill that could lead to reparations for Black Americans as part of a broader effort to address centuries of enslavement followed by modern-day institutional racism.
It faces an uphill climb in Congress, where prominent Republicans oppose the measure and none have joined the 175 Democrats who signed on as co-sponsors. Representative Jim Jordan, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee that is scheduled to vote on the measure on Wednesday, intends to oppose it, an aide said.
The measure would establish a commission to draft reparation proposals. It would be modeled on a commission Congress approved in the 1980s to document the World War Two forced removal and incarceration of thousands of Japanese-Americans.
""This is not a cry for a handout. It is a cry for an acknowledgement that there has never been a response to the unpaid labor that helped build this nation,"" Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee said at a Monday news conference.
The idea is gaining traction in some parts of the United States. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, last month became the first U.S. city to offer reparation money to Black residents. 
The action coincides with anti-racism protests in cities across the country and while a former Minnesota police officer is on trial, accused of murdering a Black man, George Floyd, in one of a long series of killings that have stirred outrage.
Even if the bill passes the Democratic-controlled House, where it would need a simple majority, it would face a higher hurdle in the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans would have to join all 50 Democrats in support of the bill for it to pass.
When the measure was last debated in Congress in 2019, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his opposition.

""No one currently alive was responsible"" for enslaving Black people brought to America during centuries of slave trade, he said at the time. A McConnell spokesman on Wednesday said he did not have anything to add to previous statements.

""The President has accepted the invitation of the Speaker of the House to address a Joint Session of Congress on April 28, the night before his 100th day in office,"" the White House said in a prepared statement.
The speech will give Biden, 78, an opportunity to deliver a sales pitch to millions of Americans for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal, which is the subject of a partisan debate in Congress.
It comes as he faces several daunting domestic challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic and record numbers of migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico. Abroad he must manage confrontations with Russia over Ukraine, China over Taiwan and Iran over its nuclear program.
Biden on Tuesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to reduce tensions over a military build-up on Ukraine's border and proposed a summit of the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of disputes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd and former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg headed to Taiwan on Tuesday at President Joe Biden's request, in what a White House official called a ""personal signal"" of the president's commitment to the Chinese-claimed island and its democracy. 
A senior Biden administration official told Reuters the dispatch of the ""unofficial"" delegation comes as the United States and Taiwan mark the 42nd anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, for which Biden voted when he was a U.S. senator.
The delegation will meet with senior Taiwanese officials and followed ""a long-standing bipartisan tradition of U.S. administrations sending high-level, unofficial delegations to Taiwan,"" the official said.
The official called it ""a personal signal"" from the president, who took office in January.
""The selection of these three individuals – senior statesmen who are longtime friends of Taiwan and personally close with President Biden – sends an important signal about the U.S. commitment to Taiwan and its democracy.""
Taiwan's presidential office said President Tsai Ing-wen would meet with the delegation on Thursday morning.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the group would arrive at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport mid-afternoon on Wednesday.
The State Department said on Friday it was issuing new guidelines to enable U.S. officials to meet more freely with officials from Taiwan, a move that deepens relations with Taipei amid stepped-up Chinese military activity around the island, which China claims as its own.
Former President Donald Trump angered China by sending several senior officials to Taiwan, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced days before the Trump presidency ended in January that he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a major bone of contention with Washington, which is required by U.S. law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. 
""The United States is committed to engaging Taiwan and deepening our cooperation on shared interests in line with the U.S. 'one-China' policy,"" the Biden administration official said, referring to the long-standing U.S. policy under which Washington officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei.
The official waved off a question as to whether dispatch of the delegation might have been coordinated to coincide with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry's visit to Shanghai this week, saying climate talks with Beijing ""shouldn't be linked with other areas of the relationship."" 
""And it's certainly not to the diminishment of any of our concerns about Beijing's behavior,"" the official said. ""Our unofficial engagement with Taiwan ... should stand on its own.""

Asked about future official-level contacts with Taiwan after the State Department announcement, the official replied: ""We don't have specific plans at this time, for particular travel, but... I certainly do expect for us to be having engagements and travel consistent with our one-China policy.""
The official said Taiwan and preserving the status quo across the Taiwan Strait would be part of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga when he visits Washington for talks with Biden later this week.

(Reuters) - The top executives of more than three dozen Michigan-based companies, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, on Tuesday issued a joint statement opposing Republican-backed legislation to restrict voting.
The move appeared to be pre-emptive, after Georgia companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) endured public backlash for failing to take a stronger stance before that state enacted a raft of voting limits last month.
""Government must avoid actions that reduce participation in elections - particularly among historically disenfranchised communities,"" the statement, which bore the names of 37 top executives, read in part.
Republican lawmakers in numerous states have proposed a slew of voting limits, after former President Donald Trump, a Republican, falsely claimed he lost November's election to President Joe Biden due to widespread fraud.
In Michigan, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has vowed to veto bills that Republicans have proposed, including new restrictions on absentee and mail ballots.
The state Republican chairman, however, has previously suggested the party could attempt to circumvent Whitmer via a petition drive. The state constitution allows the legislature to pass a law that is not subject to veto if the proposal gathers enough voter signatures.
In addition to GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and Ford CEO Jim Farley, the statement's signatories included Swamy Kotagiri, CEO of  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA); Jay Farmer, CEO of Rocket Companies Inc's Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage; and Jerry Norcia, CEO of DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE).
The city's major sports franchises are also represented: Christopher Ilitch, CEO of the company that owns Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers and the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings; Rod Wood, CEO of the National Football League's Detroit Lions; and Arn Tellem, vice chairman of the National Basketball Association's Detroit Pistons, all signed the statement.
Georgia's new law, which imposed tougher requirements for absentee ballots and made it illegal for members of the public to offer food and water to voters in line, drew criticism from many companies, including Delta and Coca-Cola. 
Ford's Farley said at the time that the U.S. automaker wanted lawmakers to ""assure everyone who's entitled to vote is able to exercise that freedom.""
Some business leaders have also publicly opposed Republican-led efforts in Texas to pass new voting restrictions.

Most CEOs on a recent private call to discuss voting limits said they would reassess donating to candidates who support such measures and would reconsider whether to invest in states that pass them, Reuters reported on Sunday.

829,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seventeen New York state Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday said they will not support proposed tax increases to pay for President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan unless it also rolls back a 2017 tax change that hurt high earners in some states.
The group urged the full repeal of the provision, which limited to $10,000 the state and local taxes that households itemizing deductions could write off their federal returns. 
Known as the SALT cap, it was part of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed by President Donald Trump in 2017.
""We stand ready to work with you on this critical issue, and we will not hesitate to oppose any tax legislation that does not fully restore the SALT deduction,"" the group, led by Representatives Tom Suozzi and Jerry Nadler, wrote in a letter to House Democratic leadership.
Biden's party narrowly controls the House of Representatives and the Senate, meaning he can ill afford to lose such a large number of Democratic votes. His $2.3 trillion proposal to rebuild crumbling U.S. roads and bridges would be paid for by hiking the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.
Leading Democrats in Congress are sympathetic to the idea of repealing the SALT cap, which would benefit primarily people making over $100,000 a year in high-tax states like New York and California. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, has expressed sympathy for repeal, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, has co-sponsored legislation to eliminate the cap.
But the White House has said removing the cap is not part of the infrastructure proposal. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said recently that if Democrats want to eliminate the deduction - and propose a way to pay for it, ""we're happy to hear their ideas.""

Capping the SALT deduction helped pay for the Republicans' 2017 tax law, which lowered taxes for wealthy Americans and slashed the corporate tax rate. Republicans generally oppose restoring the deduction, which they view as largely benefiting Democratic voters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Joe Biden's nominee Wendy Sherman to be deputy secretary of state, the number two position at the department.
The Senate backed the nomination by 56-42, as a handful of Republicans joined Biden's fellow Democrats to vote in Sherman's favor.
Sherman, 71, a foreign policy veteran, ran into Republican resistance because she helped negotiate the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran, which was fiercely opposed by Republicans as well as some Democrats.
Former Republican President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018. The agreement has unraveled as Iran breached its limits on nuclear enrichment and Trump re-imposed sanctions.
But the Biden administration has sought to re-engage and Iran and world powers last week held what they described as ""constructive"" talks to salvage the accord.
The issue was complicated when Iran said on Tuesday it will start enriching uranium to 60% purity, a move bringing the fissile material closer to levels suitable for a bomb, after accusing Israel of sabotaging a nuclear installation.
Israel's government opposed the nuclear pact.
Sherman had promised a new approach on Iran at her March confirmation hearing, noting that the world has changed since the pact was implemented in 2016.

Dealings with Iran must ""be decided on the merits of where we are today, not nostalgia for what might have been,"" Sherman said.
Sherman was State Department counselor from 1997 to 2001, when she was also policy coordinator on North Korea. From 1993 to 1996 she served as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs.

Democrats say the bill, which updates voting procedures and requires states to turn over the redrawing of congressional district lines to independent commissions, is needed to overcome Republican efforts to make voting across the country harder.
Many Republican-controlled state legislatures are exploring steps that voting-rights advocates say would reduce turnout after record-setting participation in the November 2020 general election.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it wants more people brought into the political process but that the bill would have ""precisely the opposite effect – pushing certain voices, representing large segments of the electorate and U.S. economy, out of the political process altogether.""

The Chamber, in a letter to senators, said the legislation would ""regulate and ultimately silence Americans who choose to petition their government or participate in the political process through the collective action of an association or corporation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. climate envoy John Kerry will travel to China this week to discuss international efforts to tackle global warming, seeking to press his counterparts to make ambitious emissions reduction targets despite tension in the U.S.-China relationship.
The U.S. State Department said Kerry would travel to Shanghai and Seoul, South Korea, for talks on April 14-17, ahead of President Joe Biden's virtual summit with world leaders on climate change next week.
Kerry will ""discuss raising global climate ambition,"" during his visits, the State Department said.
A source familiar with the plans said Kerry was due to arrive in Shanghai late on Wednesday and hold meetings on Thursday and Friday.
Kerry's trip comes after an earlier summit in Alaska between U.S. and Chinese officials led to fiery interactions that illustrated the depth of tension between the world's two largest economies at the beginning of Biden's tenure in office.
""He'll be focused on discussing climate and how we can work with leaders around the region to get control of ... the climate crisis,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday about Kerry.
The former secretary of state, who Biden selected to represent the United States in international climate talks, will seek to find common ground on climate change with China's Xie Zhenhua. Kerry referred to his Chinese counterpart as a ""leader"" and “capable advocate” in an interview with Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-kerry/u-s-climate-envoy-kerry-calls-new-chinese-counterpart-leader-and-believer-idUSKBN2A42ZZ earlier this year. 

Kerry has been urging countries around the world to set ambitious targets for cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is set to announce its own new target for emissions cuts by 2030 in the coming week. 
Biden's Earth Day summit, scheduled for April 22-23, will be a chance for the White House to reassert U.S. leadership on climate change. Biden, a Democrat, brought the United States back into the Paris climate accord after his predecessor, Republican President Donald Trump, withdrew in 2017.

833,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 12:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators on Tuesday introduced a bill to expedite refugee applications from Uighurs, matching an effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to assist members of the largely Muslim ethnic group that advocates say face persecution in China. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Chris Coons put forward the ""Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act,"" which would grant Priority 2 refugee status to Uighurs and other groups, including Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, who have faced repression in or fled from China's Xinjiang region. 
Priority 2 status would allow hundreds, or possibly thousands, of Uighurs to forgo a United Nations referral and apply directly as refugees to the U.S. government, reducing concerns that Beijing could be notified by a third country and seek their deportation back to China.
China denies abuses, but the United States has declared that Beijing is perpetrating a genocide. 
""The United States must continue to speak out against the PRC's human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and we must also provide assurance and protection for the Uyghurs and all those facing persecution as a result of their religious or ethnic identity,"" Coons said in a statement referring to the People's Republic of China, the country's formal name.
The Senate bill, complementing a House version put forward in March, has Republicans and Democrats increasingly optimistic that the refugee upgrade could become law, even as the U.S. Congress forges ahead with a sweeping package of other legislation to counter China's influence. 
""From a substantive perspective, the end game here is extremely similar,"" one Senate aide comparing the Senate and House bills, told Reuters. ""We see this as an area of easy bipartisan support,"" he said. 
U.N. experts and human rights groups estimate that more than one million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls a vocational training campaign to battle terrorism.

The bill also encourages U.S. partners and allies to make refugee accommodations for Uighurs.

Johnson, 48, one of the highest-paid and most popular actors in the United States, has been flirting with a possible White House bid for several years.
""I do have that goal to unite our country and I also feel that if this is what the people want, then I will do that,” Johnson said when asked about his presidential ambitions in an interview broadcast on the ""Today"" show on Monday.
The former professional wrestler did not say which party he would represent or when he might launch any bid for the White House.
His remarks follow an online public opinion poll released last week by consumer trends company Piplsay that found some 46% of Americans would consider voting for Johnson.
Johnson, known as ""The Rock,"" said he was humbled by the poll.
""I don’t think our Founding Fathers EVER envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick-up truck driving, fanny-pack wearing guy joining their club - but if it ever happens it’d be my honor to serve you, the people,"" he said in an Instagram posting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday named Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley as the State Department's first chief diversity officer, a position created to make the U.S. diplomatic corps more representative.
The appointment is part of the Biden administration's efforts to put diversity, equity and racial justice at the top of the national agenda after nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias last year.
Introducing Abercrombie-Winstanley, Blinken said the department and the country were at a ""moment of reckoning"" on racial equality, referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and attacks against Asian-Americans.
Abercrombie-Winstanley, a career diplomat since 1985 who served as U.S. ambassador to Malta, will report directly to Blinken, he said.
Promoting diversity inclusion was the job of every department official, but the new officer would hold department leadership accountable on that score, Blinken said.
The lack of diversity at the highest levels of the department was ""alarming,"" he added, but could be traced through its history and seen in the portraits of former secretaries that line the corridor to his office.
""It's hard not to notice that almost every one of the secretaries along the hallway is a white man,"" Blinken said. 

With 76,000 employees globally, racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented at the department, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released last year. Abercrombie-Winstanley is Black.
""The truth is this problem is as old as the department itself. It's systemic,"" Blinken said. ""It goes deeper than any one institution or any one administration, and it's perpetuated by policies, practices and people to this day.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will urge Congress to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research when he meets with top executives from nearly 20 major companies on Monday about the global chips shortage that has roiled the automotive industry and technology firms.
The push is part of his broader focus on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing as a powerhouse for the world's largest economy - and a source of good-paying jobs - after years of declining investments and productivity growth, a senior administration official said.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that no immediate decision or announcement was likely to come from the meeting.
“One of the reasons the president is stopping by this meeting ... is to hear directly from companies about the impacts, what would help the most through this period of time,"" she said.
The White House meeting is billed as the ""CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience"" and will include White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese.
Biden is expected to stop by the meeting to push his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes $300 billion aimed at expanding manufacturing, especially in disadvantaged areas and communities of color through loans, grants, investments and the targeted use of federal procurements.
While the proposed investments will take time to implement, the administration is also seeking ""short-term and medium-term solutions that will be discussed during the summit,"" the official said. No further details were immediately available.
As of midday Friday, 19 major companies had agreed to send executives, including General Motors (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV CEO Carlos Tavares.
The ""summit reflects the urgent need to strengthen critical supply chains,"" Deese said in a statement. 
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will also take part, as well as executives from GlobalFoundries, PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, AT&T (NYSE:T), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC),  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).
A U.S. auto industry group last week urged the government to help and warned that a global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
Over the weekend, GM canceled more truck production shifts at two U.S. plants.
""Trying to address supply chains on a crisis-by-crisis basis creates critical national security vulnerabilities,"" Sullivan said in a statement.
Automakers have been hit particularly hard by the global chip shortage after many canceled orders when their plants were idled by the coronavirus pandemic.
When they were ready to resume production, they found chipmakers were busy fulfilling orders for the consumer electronics industry, which has seen demand for premium devices - both for work and leisure - boom as people spent more time at home.
Broadband internet, cellphone and cable TV companies also face delays in receiving ""network switches, routers, and servers,"" according to an industry group.
""Shortages in semiconductors and the associated delays will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in impact to the broadband and cable television industry this year,"" the group said last week.
Biden wants at least $100 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor production and fund investments to support production of critical goods, but officials said this funding will not address short-term chip needs.

Later this week, the Senate Commerce Committee will hold its first hearing on a bipartisan measure to bolster technology research and development efforts in a bid to address Chinese competition.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The race to succeed the only sitting U.S. congressman to have died from COVID-19 has drawn a free-for-all of 23 candidates in a Republican-leaning district of north Texas, where Democrats have made gains in recent years.
Representative Ron Wright, a Republican, died of COVID-19 in February. The May 1 special election to replace him will be the first test of the Texas electorate, where Democrats hope to advance, since President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
Former President Donald Trump won the state's electoral votes with 52% of the vote in the 2020 election. The north Texas region has sent a Republican congressman to Washington since the 1980s, but Trump only narrowly won the district last year. He has not endorsed anyone in the race. 
With so many people competing to represent the suburban Dallas-Fort Worth area, the special election is expected to produce a summer runoff between the two top performers. The contest could pit a Republican against a Democrat or feature two Republicans, depending on the results of the May 1 vote.
The race may be the most competitive of several special elections this year to replace House members who have either died or gone to work for Biden's administration. Others will be held in New Mexico in June and Ohio in November; the date for a Florida special election has not been set.
Every House seat counts. Democrats currently have just a seven-seat majority, and it will shrink to six later this week with the swearing-in of Representative-elect Julia Letlow of Louisiana, the widow of a Republican who died of COVID-19 before he could take the oath of office. Democrats will be battling to keep their majority in the November 2022 congressional election.
The sheer number of candidates in the Texas district - 10 Democrats, 11 Republicans, an independent and a Libertarian - suggests anything can happen. Early voting starts on April 19. If no one gets a majority on May 1, the governor will schedule the runoff. 
Wright's widow Susan, a conservative party activist with a string of endorsements from Texas Republicans, is thought by analysts to have the edge over a Republican field that includes Texas state legislator Jake Ellzey; two former Trump administration officials, Brian Harrison and Sery Kim; and an anti-Trump Republican, Michael Wood.
Prominent Democratic candidates include Jana Lynne Sanchez, whom Wright defeated in 2018; Lydia Bean, who lost a 2020 race for the Texas state legislature; and Shawn Lassiter, a Black former science teacher.
“Democrats are a relevant force and if they don’t overly fragment their own vote, should be able to place a Democratic nominee in the runoff,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's congressional campaign arm, has yet to throw its weight behind anyone. 
Last year Democrats made a big play for Texas in the congressional election by targeting 10 seats including the 6th district, but they lost all of them. The late Wright beat a Democrat by nearly nine points in November.
Democrats think they have a chance in May if their voters turn out.
""In a special election you can have disproportionate turnout and it gives Democrats a shot here,"" said Matt Angle of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic political action committee.
Others are doubtful.

""As much as they may talk about flipping this congressional district, their recent track record suggests that's unlikely to happen,"" said Joshua Blank, research director at the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump vowed to help Republicans win seats in Congress in 2022 elections but lashed out at two top party figures, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and former Vice President Mike Pence, at a donor retreat on Saturday.
At a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago Club for Republican National Committee donors in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump made clear he is still irked at his inability to hang on to the White House despite losing the Nov. 3 election to Democrat Joe Biden, who is now president.
McConnell drew Trump's ire in the aftermath of the election for stating the obvious - that Biden had won the presidency - and the two remain at odds. Parting from the prepared text of his speech, Trump called the senator a ""son of a bitch,"" an attendee told Reuters.
Before leaving office, Trump had scolded Pence for not intervening to stop the congressional certification of the vote tally, an authority the vice president did not have.
The vote certification was the backdrop for the events on Jan. 6 when pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
Departing again from his prepared text, Trump said he had spoken to Pence recently and told him he was still disappointed in him, the attendee said.
Representatives for McConnell and Pence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In prepared remarks seen by Reuters, Trump sought to position himself as the Republican kingmaker, saying he wanted to talk ""about the future of the Republican Party - and what we must do to set our candidates on a course to victory.""
""I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House (of Representatives) and we are going to reclaim the Senate. And then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House,"" he said.
Trump has spent the 2-1/2 months since his chaotic exit from the White House considering requests from 2022 candidates for his endorsement and has been giving them his blessing based on whether they support him and his agenda or not.
He has said any talk of his own plans - the Constitution gives him the right to seek another four-year term - should wait until after the November 2022 elections.
A variety of other Republicans are considering their own potential runs for the party's presidential nomination in 2024, such as Trump's former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
While Biden defeated Trump by millions of votes, the Republican made inroads among traditional Democratic voters such as Hispanics and African Americans.
Trump, who also sprinkled his remarks with attacks on Biden, said the key to victories in 2022 is to build on those gains, saying ""the Republican Party will succeed and grow in the future by embracing its destiny as the champion of working-class Americans.""

Trump's active role in Republican politics despite losing the 2020 election is unlike other former presidents, who have tended to retreat from the limelight after leaving the White House.
“Saturday’s speech will be welcomed words to the Republican donors visiting Mar-a-Lago to hear directly from President Trump. Palm Beach is the new political power center, and President Trump is the Republican Party’s best messenger,"" said Trump adviser Jason Miller.

Crenshaw, 37, a former Navy lieutenant commander who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said the retina in his left eye appeared to be detatching as a result of extensive damage suffered in a 2012 attack in Afghanistan's Helmand Province.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Friday it has opened an investigation into Republican congressman Matt Gaetz involving allegations including possible sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.
The panel's Democratic chairman and top Republican said in a joint statement they had become ""aware of public allegations"" that Gaetz, one of former President Donald Trump's most prominent supporters in Congress, may have violated ""House rules, laws or other standards of conduct.""
Gaetz is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department for possibly violating sex-trafficking laws by paying travel expenses for a 17-year-old female with whom he was romantically involved, according to a U.S. law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The Florida congressman has not been charged with any crimes and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
The ethics committee leaders said the allegations included whether Gaetz ""may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift.""
Gaetz's office responded in a statement: ""Once again, the office will reiterate, these allegations are blatantly false and have not been validated by a single human being willing to put their name behind them.""
Speaking at a ""Save America Summit"" at the Trump National Doral resort in Miami on Friday, Gaetz said that ""wild conspiracy theories"" were being used to smear him.
""I'm built for the battle, and I'm not going anywhere,"" Gaetz said.
The summit was organized by a pro-Trump group called Women for America First. That group also organized a Jan. 6 rally near the White House that preceded the deadly rampage by a pro-Trump mob at the U.S. Capitol.
Earlier, Representative Adam Kinzinger became the first congressional Republican to call for Gaetz to quit his post.
""Matt Gaetz needs to resign,"" Kinzinger, an outspoken critic of Trump, said in a Twitter post on Thursday night.
A friend of Gaetz, a former Florida county tax collector named Joel Greenberg, is expected to plead guilty in a sex trafficking and fraud case in a Florida federal court, officials said on Thursday.
Greenberg's attorney Fritz Scheller told reporters on Thursday, ""I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today."" Scheller may have been referring to media reports that Greenberg could cooperate with federal investigators in their probe of Gaetz.

Two New York criminal defense lawyers on Friday confirmed they had been hired by Gaetz. 
""Matt has always been a fighter ... and he's going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him. His legal team, led by Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner, will take the fight to those trying to smear his name with falsehoods,"" said a statement on the lawyers' behalf by Erin Elmore of the Logan Circle Group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden called for funding to investigate complaints of white supremacist beliefs at U.S. immigration enforcement agencies in his first budget request to Congress on Friday, but officials offered no explanation for what prompted his request.
The Biden administration is asking Congress to increase the funding level for workforce oversight offices within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) to $470 million, a 22% increase over the current level, for the fiscal year that begins in October.
The additional funding would ensure that workforce complaints - ""including those related to white supremacy or ideological and non-ideological beliefs"" - are investigated quickly, according to a summary of Biden's budget proposal.
It was unclear whether any specific incidents sparked the call for the increased funding. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Representatives at the border patrol and ICE unions did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Biden administration has made battling domestic extremism a priority. An October 2020 DHS report said domestic violent extremists, including white supremacists, pose ""the most persistent and lethal threat"" to the United States.
Border patrol agents faced scrutiny in 2019 when media outlets exposed racist and misogynistic comments posted to a private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group for current and former agents. Posts included jokes about the deaths of migrants and sexually explicit comments referring to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat like Biden. 
The budget summary released on Friday did not make a similar funding request for the U.S. military, which has also faced concerns over white nationalism and other extremism in its ranks. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is under pressure to show progress fighting extremism after current and former military service members were found to have participated in a Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
John Sandweg, an acting ICE director under former President Barack Obama, said while complaints should be investigated, Biden's decision to single out CBP and ICE employees risks sparking opposition from agents and officers.
""This type of language could create some concerns in the workforce that there will be political ideological tests,"" Sandweg said, adding that the specific language may change when the budget is enacted.
Broadly increasing funding for the internal offices that probe workplace complaints is a good idea though, Sandweg said.
'ROOTING OUT THE BAD APPLES'
Roy Villareal, a former chief patrol agent with the U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona, said he was ""disgusted"" by Biden's decision to single out his former agency.
Villareal, who retired in December, said he supports ""rooting out the bad apples"" but said there was not widespread white supremacy and racism at CBP.
Hispanics made up more than half of the Border Patrol workforce in 2016, according to DHS data.
Some advocacy groups have called for greater oversight of U.S. immigration enforcement agencies, however.

In a February report, the Washington-based American Immigration Council said the Border Patrol has been ""steeped in institutional racism"" since its creation in 1924. The report detailed past instances of agents using racial slurs, sexual comments and other offensive language.
The White House budget proposal is a request of Congress to provide funding in fiscal year 2022, which begins on Oct. 1, 2021. The document reflects Biden's position on the spending, which will ultimately need to be appropriated by Congress.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House border coordinator Roberta Jacobson is leaving her job at the end of April, the White House said on Friday, a surprise move that solidified Vice President Kamala Harris' control over U.S. diplomatic efforts in Central America.
While the White House insisted Jacobson's departure was planned, the announcement still was unexpected as she had been engaged in media interviews in the hours leading up to her announcement and had shown no sign of planning to step down.
""Consistent with her commitment at the outset to serve in the administration's first 100 days, Ambassador Jacobson will retire from her role as coordinator at the end of this month,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.
The statement made no mention of a replacement for the role, saying only that Harris had been asked by President Joe Biden to lead the administration's work with Mexico and the 'Northern Triangle' countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Biden named Harris on March 24 to lead U.S. efforts with the region to try to stem the flow of migration to the United States. The White House has stressed that Harris' top chore is the diplomatic angle, not border security itself, a job led by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
Diplomatic efforts remain a challenge as the Biden administration tries to focus on the root causes of migration. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed on Friday that El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele refused to meet visiting U.S. envoy Ricardo Zuniga this week but said he had constructive meetings with other officials in his trip to the region. [nL1N2M12XE[
Jacobson told the New York Times on Friday that she supported the decision for Harris to engage in diplomatic talks with the region.
""Nobody could be more delighted to see the vice president take on that role. It didn't have anything to do with my decision,"" she said.
The New York Times said that Jacobson, in a separate interview two weeks ago, had talked expansively about her plans to travel to Central America as part of her job.
She told Reuters on Friday that the United States was considering a conditional cash transfer program for the Northern Triangle, to help address economic woes.

The White House has struggled to contain the flow of migrants across the U.S. southern border with Mexico, creating an early challenge for Biden. It has sent a mixed message to the region, saying the border is closed but that unaccompanied children will be provided shelter.
Sullivan said Jacobson, the former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, had launched renewed diplomatic efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle nations, and helped the Biden administration's ""commitment to reenergizing the U.S. immigration system.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Friday formed a bipartisan commission to study potential U.S. Supreme Court changes including expanding the number of justices beyond the current nine, a goal of some liberal Democrats hoping to end its conservative majority.
Under an executive order signed by the Democratic president, the 36-member commission will consider the ""merits and legality"" of potential reforms to the nation's top judicial body including adding justices or imposing term limits on their service instead of the current lifetime appointments.
The number of Supreme Court justices has remained at nine since 1869, but Congress has the power to change the number and did so several times before that. Imposing term limits would likely require a constitutional amendment, though some scholars have proposed ways to accomplish it by statute.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the commission will represent the full political spectrum. It will include liberal and conservative legal scholars, former federal judges and lawyers who have appeared before the court. It will hold public meetings and have 180 days to report its findings.
Biden promised in October, late in the presidential election campaign, to establish the commission - a step that enabled him to avoid taking a firm position on the proposal floated by some liberals to expand the court, though he has opposed the idea in the past.
Republicans fiercely oppose the idea of what is sometimes called ""court packing."" Some Democrats and liberal activists have said all options including expansion must be considered to counter an entrenched conservative majority that could threaten abortion rights, civil rights, gun control and access to healthcare in the coming years. 
Republican former President Donald Trump was able to appoint three justices during his four years in office, giving the court a 6-3 conservative majority. 
Democrats accused Republicans of ""stealing"" a Supreme Court seat in 2016 when the Senate, then controlled by Republicans, refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill a vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.
Senate Republicans at the time, led by then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said it would be inappropriate to confirm a justice during a presidential election year. Their gambit paved the way for Trump in 2017 to replace Scalia with another conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch. 
Democrats accused Republicans of hypocrisy last year when the Senate quickly confirmed Trump's appointment of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett a week before the presidential election after the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the prior month.
Calling it a ""faux-academic study of a non-existent problem,"" McConnell blasted Biden's commission as a political attack on the court. 
""It's just an attempt to clothe those ongoing attacks in fake legitimacy,"" McConnell said.
McConnell played a pivotal role in helping Trump move the Supreme Court and the broader federal judiciary rightward by making Senate confirmation of judicial appointments a paramount priority. 
The court's oldest member is liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, 82. If Breyer retires this year, as liberal activists have urged him to do, Biden would make his first appointment to the high court. Biden has promised to name a Black woman, which would be a historic first. But replacing a liberal with a liberal would not change the court's ideological balance.
Psaki said Biden ""believes that's a decision for Justice Breyer to make when he decides it is no longer time to serve on the Supreme Court.""
In a speech at Harvard Law School on Tuesday, Breyer indicated that changes to the court could undermine its authority. The court, Breyer said, depends on ""trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics.""
Some liberal activists on Friday demanded immediate action to expand the court.

""Adding seats is the only way to restore balance to the court, and Congress should get started right away,"" said Aaron Belkin, who heads the liberal group Take Back the Court. 
The last attempt to expand the court was a failed effort in the 1930s by Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt after a series of rulings frustrated some of his policies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday proposed $14 billion in spending on initiatives to fight climate change in the 2022 budget, including large cash injections for environmental regulation and science research.
The proposal underscores the administration's ambitions to decarbonizing the economy by 2050 to stem global warming, reversing a policy direction set by former President Donald Trump to slash red tape that hindered fossil fuel production.
Biden's so-called ""skinny"", or preliminary, budget proposal includes $11.1 billion for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a 21.3% boost over last year's enacted level. 
It also includes $10.2 billion for the National Science Foundation, up 20% from the 2021 enacted level, with $500 million of that going to climate and clean energy research. 
An administration official told reporters that the infusion of funding would help restore the federal government's ability to respond to climate change after the previous administration slashed funding for scientific and regulatory agencies.
""Despite the growing threat of climate change, we've cut funding for climate science and technology,"" the official said, adding the new funding would ""help restore the capacity needed to carry out core climate functions, to secure environmental justice for communities that have been left behind and to help developing countries reduce emissions.""
The budget includes major new climate change investments and financial support for communities hardest hit by pollution or by the rapid transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
The proposal allocates the largest amount ever to invest marginalized and overburdened communities - $1.4 billion, including $936 million toward a new Accelerating Environmental and Economic Justice initiative at the EPA, as well as $100 million to develop a new community air quality monitoring and notification program.
It also invests $550 million in a program to remediate abandoned oil and gas wells nationwide, tripling current funding, an effort that would create 250,000 jobs.
The request would also increase the Energy Department's budget by 10.2% to $46 billion. Among new programs it would fund, the DOE would invest $1.9 billion to launch a clean energy and workforce initiative that would help the Biden administration meet a goal of decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035 through a clean electricity and energy efficiency standard.
GLOBAL CLIMATE FINANCE
The budget also gives a boost to U.S. efforts to boost climate aid overseas, a key goal of the administration that seeks to return to a leadership role on climate change ahead of the next U.N. climate summit in Glasgow in November.
Biden will host a climate leaders summit on April 22 and is expected to release a climate finance plan ahead of the online forum.
The budget request calls for a $1.2 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, a downpayment of the remaining $2 billion it owes. The Obama administration promised $3 billion to support the fund that assists developing countries reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. 
The request also proposes $485 million to support other multilateral climate initiatives, including $100 million for international climate adaptation programs and $691 million for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development to assist developing countries in adapting

to climate disruptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden faces a Sunday deadline to decide whether to intervene in a trade dispute between two South Korean electric vehicle battery makers that could impact a Georgia factory and his push for more electric vehicles.
The companies, LG Chem and rival SK Innovation Co, have spent months trying to take advantage of past and promised U.S. investments, and ties to politicians. 
The Biden Administration, through the U.S. Trade Representative's office, is set to decide as early as Friday whether to take the rare step of reversing the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), unless the Korean battery companies reach a last-minute settlement.
The White House declined to comment on Thursday.
The ITC in February sided with LG Chem in its trade secrets claims, but permitted SK to import components for batteries for Ford EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s North American EVs for two years.
Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh said Wednesday Biden's intervention was critical: ""The White House could accelerate the future of zero-emission vehicles and green jobs, or threaten to reduce U.S. battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles.""
The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs. Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EV sales and charging.
Unless the White House intervenes, SK says the ITC ruling would force it to halt construction on a $2.6-billion factory in Georgia, where two newly-elected Democratic Senators are the linchpin of Biden's slim Democratic Congressional majority.
Last month, Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK's plant will employ nearly 2,600: ""Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.""
Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff has held numerous meetings with the Korean battery makers and Biden Administration, his office confirmed, and stressed ""the urgent need for both companies to come to the negotiating table and agree to a settlement to save the Georgia plant,"" a spokeswoman said. 
LG's battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and is close to announcing plans build a $2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters.
LG plans to invest at least $4.5 billion in U.S. battery production over the next four years. LG insists it can handle automakers battery needs if SK abandons its Georgia plant.

SK argues LG could not handle VW and Ford contracts and warns Chinese manufacturers may replace lost battery capacity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee introduced legislation on Thursday to boost the country's ability to push back against China's expanding global influence by promoting human rights, providing security aid and investing to combat disinformation.
The draft measure, titled the ""Strategic Competition Act of 2021,"" mandates diplomatic and strategic initiatives to counteract Beijing, reflecting hard-line sentiment on dealings with China from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
The 280-page bill addresses economic competition with China, but also humanitarian and democratic values, such as imposing sanctions over the treatment of the minority Muslim Uighurs and supporting democracy in Hong Kong.
It stressed the need to ""prioritize the military investments necessary to achieve United States political objectives in the Indo-Pacific."" It called for spending to do so, saying Congress must ensure the federal budget is ""properly aligned"" with the strategic imperative to compete with China.
The bill recommends a total of $655 million in Foreign Military Financing funding for the region for fiscal 2022 through 2026, and a total of $450 million for the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative and related programs for the same period.
It would expand the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes financial transactions for potential national security risks. However, like many provisions of the bill, this clause could be changed as it moves through the committee and full Senate.
The draft legislation calls for an enhanced partnership with Taiwan, calling the self-ruled island ""a vital part of the United States Indo-Pacific strategy"" and saying there should be no restrictions on U.S. officials' interaction with Taiwanese counterparts. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular news briefing on Friday that China ""resolutely opposes"" the bill and called for senators to do more to help the stable development of China-U.S. relations.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou expressed thanks for the Senate's show of support, adding it would pay close attention to the development of the legislation.
The bill also says Washington must encourage allies to do more about Beijing's ""aggressive and assertive behavior,"" including working together on arms control. 
Introduced by Senators Bob Menendez, the committee's Democratic chairman, and Jim Risch, its ranking Republican, the draft bill was released to committee members to allow a markup, a meeting during which the panel will discuss amendments and vote, on April 14.
""I am confident that this effort has the necessary support to be overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week and the full Senate shortly thereafter,"" Menendez said in a statement.
Risch said in a statement he was also pleased the bill included a ""strong and actionable"" plan to counteract China's influence efforts at U.S. universities.
The measure is part of a fast-track effort announced in February by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to pass legislation to counter China.

""Congress is extremely focused on the various challenges that China poses to American interests and is trying to develop effective responses that are within its purview,"" said Center for Strategic and International Studies Asia expert Bonnie Glaser.
The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on April 14 on its bipartisan measure, the ""Endless Frontier Act,"" to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A friend of embattled Republican U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida is expected to plead guilty in a sex trafficking and fraud case in a federal court in Florida, two law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers are in discussions about Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Florida's Seminole County, entering a guilty plea, and a judge on Thursday gave him until May 15 to do so, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Greenberg is a friend of staunch Donald Trump supporter Gaetz, who also faces a federal probe into a relationship with an underage girl, a law enforcement source has said.
Gaetz has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. A Gaetz representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
At a court hearing in Orlando, Greenberg's attorneys and prosecutors said they expected a plea deal to resolve charges including sex trafficking of a child, aggravated identity theft and wire fraud, according to local media.
Asked by reporters whether Gaetz should be worried about a Greenberg plea, Greenberg's attorney Fritz Scheller replied, ""I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today."" 
Scheller may have been referring to media reports that Greenberg may cooperate with federal investigators in their probe of Gaetz.
""This is devastating news for Matt Gaetz,"" State Attorney for Palm Beach County in Florida Dave Aronberg said in an interview with CNN.
Aronberg, who is not involved in the investigation, said Greenberg had every incentive to cooperate in the Gaetz probe ""because he is facing a potential life sentence and at least a 10-year mandatory minimum for child sex trafficking related to the same 17-year-old girl in the Matt Gaetz investigation.""
In a column published on Monday on the Washington Examiner website, Gaetz declared he had no plans to resign from Congress.

""There are exactly zero credible (or even non-credible) accusers willing to come forward by name and state on the public record that I behaved improperly toward them,"" Gaetz wrote.
Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, last month said he would not strip Gaetz of his committee assignments absent proof that he has engaged in wrongdoing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and his Attorney General Merrick Garland announced limited measures to tackle gun violence in the United States on Thursday in what the White House described as a first step to curb mass shootings, community bloodshed and suicides.
The new measures include plans for the Justice Department to crack down on self-assembled ""ghost guns"" and make ""stabilizing braces"" - which effectively turn pistols into rifles - subject to registration under the National Firearms Act. 
Biden said he will ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to release an annual report on firearms trafficking in the United States, and make it easier for states to adopt ""red flag"" laws that flag at-risk individuals who own guns. 
Biden also outlined more ambitious goals that he needs the support of Congress to accomplish, including reintroducing a ban on assault weapons, lifting an exemption on lawsuits against gun manufacturers, and passing a nationwide red flag law. 
The executive orders unveiled on Thursday are not legislative. The White House promised that more action was coming.
""Today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis,"" Biden said, speaking in the Rose Garden to an audience filled with family members of victims of gun violence. 
He noted another mass shooting in South Carolina this week.
""This is an epidemic, for God's sake, and it has to stop,"" Biden said.
Advocates for gun restrictions welcomed the measures.
""This is a significant set of actions,"" said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, a gun violence prevention group, praising Biden for promising to do more. ""Some of the most important words that he uttered were: this is just the start.""
Biden, a Democrat who has a long history of advocating for gun restrictions, has come under pressure to step up action after recent mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia. 
Biden announced the measures alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Merrick Garland, who Biden said would prioritize gun violence as head of the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
""We've had more tragedy than we can bear,"" Harris said. ""People on both sides of the aisle want action .... So all that is left is the will and the courage to act."" 
The DOJ will issue a proposed rule on ghost guns in 30 days, and proposed rules on stabilizing braces within 60 days. 
Garland said the department will also be rethinking the way that it analyzes criminal cases and investigations to try learn more about modern gun-trafficking patterns. 
Gun control is a politically divisive subject in the United States, which has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades.
The National Rifle Association, which advocates for gun rights, criticized the measures. ""The proposals Biden announced today could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders,"" it said in a statement. 
Most Americans support strengthening U.S. gun laws. An overwhelming majority support expanding background checks and keeping guns from the mentally ill, polls by Reuters and others show https://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-anniversary-poll/americans-support-gun-control-but-doubt-lawmakers-will-act-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1PX11I. 
A series of gun control measures have failed in Congress, however. 
""Enough prayers. Time for some action,"" Biden said on Thursday, asking Congress to pass a proposed bill requiring background checks at gun shows and online. 
The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, and state attempts to limit who can buy guns or how they can carry them have been challenged in court by pro-gun lobby groups. 

""Everything that is being proposed today is totally consistent with the Second Amendment,"" Biden said. ""And there's a wide consensus behind the need to take action.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The president of the Navajo Nation on Thursday urged U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to protect 1.9 million acres of land as the Bears Ears National Monument during her visit to Utah, expanding the site that was slashed in size by former President Donald Trump to open it to mining, grazing and drilling.
Jonathan Nez, president of the largest Native American tribe, met with Haaland in Bluff, the gateway to the Utah monument, during her two-day visit to the southwestern state, where she is meeting with tribes and political officials to discuss the potential restoration - or expansion - of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, two national monuments that were drastically downsized by Trump. 
The visit is the centerpiece of Haaland's first multi-state tour since being confirmed last month as the first Native American cabinet member, holding symbolic power given the importance of the monuments to Southwestern tribes.
""Bears Ears is sacred and deserves to be protected,"" Nez said in a statement. 
Nez said having Haaland sit at the head of the table during the consultation is a ""historic moment"" for Indian Country and made the case that the site is sacred for the Navajo and four other tribes who joined together in 2015 to propose the creation of the monument to protect cultural sites from vandalism, looting and energy development.
Haaland, whose job gives her oversight of America's vast public and tribal lands, visited Utah's San Juan county on Thursday and will visit Kane county on Friday as part of a review of their boundaries launched by Joe Biden on the Democrat president's first day in office.
Trump, a Republican, had cut the size of the two formerly massive monuments by 2 million acres (8,000 square kilometers) combined at the request of Utah's Republican lawmakers, removing protections that had hindered ranching, drilling, mining, and other development in an area twice the size of the state of Rhode Island.
President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had created the 1.3 million acre Bears Ears National Monument in 2016 under the U.S. Antiquities Act after tribes originally proposed the site to cover 1.9 million acres. Trump cut it to around 200,000 acres.
Tribes in the region consider the areas sacred and home to thousands of important cultural and archeological sites and want Haaland to recommend to Biden to go further than restoring Bears Ears to Obama's boundaries, according to Pat Gonzales-Rogers, director of the Inter-Tribal Coalition.
""We are consistent in what we are asking for. The original tribal proposal and a path to making that permanent,"" he said.
Grand Staircase-Escalante, meanwhile, was created by former President Bill Clinton, also a Democrat, in 1996 at 1.9 million acres and was cut roughly in half by Trump.
Under the Antiquities Act, presidents have the authority to create or alter national monuments unilaterally, which makes their protections uncertain over time.
Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox, Senator Mitt Romney and Congressman John Curtis - who have advocated for a smaller protected area for both monuments - also met Haaland on Thursday.

""I'm hopeful this visit will ... highlight to the Secretary the importance of working with Congress toward a permanent legislative solution for the monuments' boundaries and management that reflects the input of Utah's state, local, and tribal leaders, rather than unilateral action,"" Romney spokesperson Arielle Mueller said.
Earlier this month, the Utah delegation met tribal leaders from the Hopi, Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute, Pueblo of Zuni, and Ute Indian ahead of Haaland's visit to try to reach a compromise on legislation to protect a smaller area of Bears Ears.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's hopes of working with congressional Democrats to craft a legislative solution to the rising number of immigrant asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border will hang heavily on moderates like Texas Representative Henry Cuellar.
Cuellar, one of the most conservative House Democrats, has not been shy about warning the new Biden administration that it is moving too fast in reversing some of former President Donald Trump's tough anti-immigration policies.
""If you don't stop this flow, like I told the folks at the White House when I was with them, what's your endgame? ... They don't know,"" the Mexican-American representative said in an interview.
Last month, about 168,000 migrants were picked up by border patrol agents between ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, the highest monthly tally since March 2001. 
The son of migrant farm workers, Cuellar, 65, is one of a handful of Democrats representing border communities who sometimes find themselves out of step with their party.
Democrats control both houses of Congress by very slim majorities, giving the party's House and Senate moderates outsized power in dictating the outcome of any legislative efforts.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working to save immigration bills passed by the House in March, which face Republican opposition in the Senate, where its rules make it easy for the minority party to block legislation. 
The House bills would grant legal status to a large group of immigrants brought into the United States as children years ago and some migrant farm workers. Talks center around expanding the bills to even more workers, while also addressing what many call a crisis at the southern border. 
Cuellar, whose Texas district hugs the banks of the Rio Grande River just opposite Mexico, said Biden should reform and not scrap one of Trump's most controversial initiatives.
That policy, known as the ""remain in Mexico"" program, dispatches Central American asylum seekers to Mexico, where conditions are dangerous, as they await decisions by U.S. immigration courts.
Like influential House progressives, Cuellar condemned Trump's policy of separating migrant children from their families. He also believes in the merits of former President Barack Obama's U.S. investments in Central America - that were reined in by Trump - which funded civil society and economic development.
2022 ELECTIONS LOOM LARGE
Whether the bitterly divided Congress can pass reform legislation this year has huge implications for the approximately 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, who either arrived without visas or overstayed them.
It also could have a profound impact on Biden's presidency and whether Democrats can hang onto their majorities in the 2022 congressional elections, when the president's party typically loses seats.
Republicans already are positioning immigration as a ""wedge issue"" for voters.
""While some Republicans will certainly look for areas of possible compromise, it won't stop the vast majority from using border security like a cudgel against their opponents"" in 2022, one Republican strategist predicted.
Cuellar's district, which encompasses Laredo and is around 78% Latino, is a microcosm of the complexities surrounding immigration.
Its economy depends on vibrant cross-border trade. Business leaders cringe when they hear some Republican politicians dangle the idea of closing the border.
Constituents, ranging from ranchers to school administrators, have complained about property being damaged by migrants and have concerns about drug smugglers coming across the border, Cuellar said.
All this helps explain why Cuellar and like-minded lawmakers emphasize stemming the border crossings even as the progressive wing of the Democratic Party pushes for a more welcoming tone. 
Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a member of the Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus, said he has heard complaints from moderate Democrats in Congress who worry that a liberal message on immigration will turn off voters.
They want Democrats to emphasize ""security and enforcement,"" Grijalva said, adding a balance was needed between ""deportation and humane treatment.""
""We have had the enforcement-only philosophy for four-plus years on the border and it has not worked,"" he said.
Another Democrat from a border region working on the immigration bill compromise with a moderate track record includes Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who voted against stimulus checks for undocumented workers.
Matt House, a former aide to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, stressed the importance of moderates in the fight for immigration legislation.

But he added, ""It's so easy to predict it breaking down. Almost everything else does.""

854,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats trying to advance President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan were left wondering on Thursday whether one of their own, Senator Joe Manchin, might revolt if the party tries to act without Republican buy-in.
The West Virginia senator, in a column published by the Washington Post, said lawmakers should be ""alarmed"" at the possibility that Senate Democrats could use a maneuver called ""reconciliation"" to pass the package with only Democratic votes, as they did last month with a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.
Biden's Democrats hold half the 100-seat Senate, claiming a majority thanks only to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. A defection by Manchin or any other member could doom the bill's chances in the weeks - or months - Congress debates it after it returns next week from a spring break.
Manchin narrowly won re-election in 2018 in an increasingly Republican-leaning state, which is home to some of the nation's worst roads - which the infrastructure package could help fix - but also a coal industry that would lose subsidies under some of its proposals.
While raising concerns over reconciliation, Manchin did not specifically say if he would vote against the infrastructure bill in that scenario.
An aide to Manchin did not respond to requests for comment.
The White House said that it wanted to have ""an open dialogue"" with lawmakers.
""We continue to reach out not only to Senator Manchin but to senators on both sides of the aisle, and to members of the House on both sides of the aisle,"" White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told CNN.
Besides criticizing the process for debating the infrastructure bill, Manchin has objected to Biden's call for raising the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28%, suggesting a 25% target as more appropriate. The Republican-controlled Congress reduced it in 2017 from 35% to 21% as part of a sweeping tax reform. 
More than a dozen White House and corporate officials interviewed by Reuters this week said they could live with a 25% rate.
Robust infrastructure investments could be an important source of new revenues for Manchin's home state, where road and bridge conditions are among the worst in the country, according to an analysis of 2018 Federal Highway Administration data by TRIP, a nonprofit transportation group that examined the share of roads and bridges in each state that were in poor condition.
At the same time, West Virginia's heavy reliance on fossil fuel industries means its companies could take a hit from Biden's proposal to cut subsidies for oil, natural gas and coal companies to help pay for the infrastructure plan.
While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has a difficult balancing act in moving Biden's initiatives through the evenly split Senate, Manchin walks a political tight-rope as well.
West Virginia is a deeply Republican state, having overwhelmingly voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.

Manchin is not up for re-election until 2024. But he may be mindful that his winning percentage in 2018 was only 49.6 percent of the vote, down from his comfortable 60.6 percent in 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a judge on Wednesday to throw out a voting machine company's $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit relating to his false claims about the November 2020 presidential election being rigged.
Giuliani's lawyer said in a court filing that Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and because the company has not adequately justified its request for money damages.
The filing said Giuliani denies defaming Dominion, adding that the former New York City mayor would present a more forceful defense on the merits if his jurisdictional arguments are rejected by the federal judge in the District of Columbia who is assigned to the case.
""Should this matter reach legal or factual adjudication on the merits, Giuliani will provide a vigorous and complete response,"" the court filing stated.
Megan Meier, a lawyer for Dominion, said in a statement that
""Giuliani said he wanted to present the 'evidence' for his defamatory statements about Dominion, but now he's trying to avoid a trial and still offering no evidence at all."" 
Trump and his allies spent two months denying his election defeat, and claiming without evidence that it was the result of widespread voter fraud, before the then-president's supporters launched a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
Denver-based Dominion alleged in its Jan. 25 lawsuit that Giuliani ""manufactured and disseminated the ‘Big Lie,’ which foreseeably went viral and deceived millions of people into believing that Dominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election.”
Dominion said it filed the lawsuit “to set the record straight” and to “stand up for itself, its employees, and the electoral process.”
Founded in 2002, Dominion is a major U.S. manufacturer of voting machines, and various Dominion machines were used in more than two dozen states during the 2020 election.

Dominion has similar defamation lawsuits pending against Fox News, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, and pro-Trump businessman Mike Lindell of My Pillow Inc. Like Giuliani, they have denied defaming Dominion.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden has championed raising the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% as the main way to fund his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, but few people in Washington, including inside the White House, really think the rate will land there.
Biden made it clear on Wednesday that he is open to compromise, after a reporter asked if he would be willing to agree on a tax rate below 28%.
""I'm willing to listen to that, I'm wide open to it,"" Biden said. 
Reuters interviewed more than a dozen corporate and White House officials engaged in the infrastructure push. Most expect the White House and business groups to compromise on a 25% corporate tax rate - a level neither side would have chosen, but both can live with.
""We don't like it, but we expect to be at 25 percent,"" a lobbyist at a top U.S. energy firm said, requesting anonymity. ""If so, we are going to consider that a win."" 
The U.S. corporate tax rate dropped to 21% from 35% after the 2017 tax cut pushed by former President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, but many big U.S. companies pay much less. Increasing what companies pay into the more than $4 trillion federal budget is an important part of Democrat Biden's plan to restructure the U.S. economy to reduce inequality and try to counter China's rise. 
U.S. multinational companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Merck & Co are among several that have been adept at reducing their taxes, tax and legal experts said. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports a hike in the corporate tax rate https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BT30J as part of an infrastructure overhaul, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of the largest U.S. retailer, said on Tuesday. Biden said last week that Amazon was one of 91 Fortune 500 companies that ""use various loopholes where they pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax,"" in sharp contrast to middle class families paying over 20% tax rates.
Biden's infrastructure and investment package includes roads and bridges and funding for affordable housing and elder care workers, among other items. 
In addition to raising the corporate tax rate, the White House is pushing a minimum U.S. and global tax for companies, and increasing enforcement of tax laws, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday.
OPPOSITION 
Trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia who is a moderate on some issues, have said the 28% rate is too high. However, Manchin, whose support is crucial to any bill passing in the 50-50 Senate, said he could support a rate of 25%.
The White House knew that proposing an increase to 28% would face opposition, including from some Democrats. It is prepared to discuss alternatives - including setting the rate to 25%, three administration officials familiar with the discussions told Reuters. 
Unlike the coronavirus pandemic relief bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Biden in mid-March, where expiring unemployment benefits created a sense of urgency, the White House believes the infrastructure plan can be debated, and expects Congress will play a more pivotal role. 
In 2013, then Vice President Biden and President Barack Obama proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 28% from 35% and to 25% for manufacturers, but Republicans in Congress blocked the plan https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama/obama-offers-grand-bargain-on-corporate-tax-rate-infrastructure-idUSBRE96T0F820130730. So far, Republicans have voiced no support for raising corporate taxes, and criticized the plan for being too large. 
""Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable. Changes are certain,"" Biden said during a speech at the White House on Wednesday. He said he would soon invite Republican lawmakers to the White House and that the administration is ""open to good ideas and good-faith negotiations.""
Increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% is expected to generate $850 billion, a significant chunk of Biden's proposal, according to the non-profit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget public policy organization.
At 25% a little under $500 billion would be generated, the committee said, forcing Democrats to search for additional revenue streams or cut spending. 
That effort will be made more complicated by Biden’s campaign pledge to not raise taxes on any American earning less than $400,000, making items such as raising the gas tax or establishing a per-mile tax politically toxic. 

""It’s a very difficult tax pledge and promise,"" said the committee's president Maya MacGuineas.

857,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 05:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday that infrastructure legislation could win support from Republicans in Congress if it targets traditional projects involving roads, bridges and broadband and does not unwind 2017 tax cuts.
""If we could agree on what the definition of infrastructure is – and I think it clearly must include roads and bridges and broadband – there may be a way forward. But it needs to be credibly paid for, not through completely revisiting the tax reform act of 2017,"" McConnell told a press conference in Madisonville, Kentucky.
His remarks came after President Joe Biden said he was willing to listen to alternatives to his sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, which would fund traditional projects but also seek to change the course of the U.S. economy by addressing climate change and boosting human services such as elder care.
The president is expected to meet with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on infrastructure in coming weeks. 
But McConnell, the top Senate Republican, made it clear that he does not favor Biden's broad-based approach, which he has described as ""a Trojan horse"" for massive tax increases and unnecessary spending.

The Biden plan would be financed by higher taxes on U.S. corporations, including an increase to 28% in the current 21% corporate tax rate that Republicans set in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress have until the end of May to negotiate provisions of an infrastructure bill before Democrats opt to move sweeping legislation on their own, one of U.S. President Joe Biden's closest Senate allies predicted on Wednesday.
Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Biden's home state of Delaware said several senior Senate Republicans had privately signaled they would support a package of up to $1 trillion that targets roads, bridges and other typical infrastructure areas and includes some tax increases to pay for legislation.
Biden has proposed a more sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure package, which invests in traditional projects but also seeks to change the course of the U.S. economy by addressing climate change and boosting human services such as elder care.
The president and his Democratic allies, who narrowly control both houses of Congress, have insisted that they want Republican support for the package but will not wait long before deciding whether to move forward on their own. 
""I believe that President Biden is open to spending the next month negotiating what the possibility is,"" Coons told Punchbowl News in an interview. He said he spoke to the president earlier this week. 
If no clear deal exists by the May 31 Memorial Day holiday, Coons added, ""I think Democrats just roll it up into a big package and move it.""
Biden is expected to meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on infrastructure next week, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki. 
Coons said talks with ""several fairly seasoned senior Republicans"" suggest bipartisan support for a narrower bill that could be funded partially by higher gasoline taxes and a new fee for electric vehicles to be dedicated to road infrastructure.
But the president's larger plan faces determined opposition from Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who describes the Biden package as ""a Trojan horse"" for tax hikes and unnecessary spending. 
""There's broad bipartisan support for tackling the infrastructure issue. But it depends on what your definition is,"" McConnell told a Wednesday news conference in his home state of Kentucky. 
""Infrastructure is roads, is bridges. It's broadband. But beyond that, they've thrown everything but the kitchen sink into it,"" he said. 

Republican opposition raises the odds Democrats will use a maneuver called reconciliation to pass a package with just their own votes. Democrats control half the 100 seats in the Senate with Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president, the tie-breaking 51st vote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday fleshed out the details of a corporate tax hike plan linked to President Joe Biden's infrastructure investment proposal, aiming to raise $2.5 trillion in new revenues over 15 years by deterring tax avoidance. 
Yellen's plan relies on negotiating a 21% global minimum corporate tax rate with major economies and a separate 15% minimum tax on 'booked' income aimed at the largest U.S. corporations. Dozens of big U.S. companies use complex tax strategies to reduce their federal tax liabilities to zero.
Yellen said that promises of increased U.S. investment by corporations under the 2017 Republican tax cuts failed to materialize. Instead, the Trump-era cuts led to a dramatic drop in tax revenue as a share of economic output, with continued incentives to shift profits offshore, she told reporters on a conference call.
""Our tax revenues are already at their lowest level in a generation. And as they continue to drop lower we will have less money to invest in roads, bridges, broadband and R&D.""
The Treasury plan also would eliminate a range of tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry, a move it said would raise revenues by $35 billion over 10 years. It will replace these with new clean energy tax incentives including for electric vehicles and efficient electric appliances.
The Treasury plan would modify the 2017 version of a global minimum tax, the 10.5% Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income tax (GILTI), by raising the rate to 21% and applying it on a country-by-country basis. 
It would also replace a separate 10% minimum tax aimed at stopping the shift of profits to tax havens, replacing it with a new system, also at 21%.
Biden has sharply criticized Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other large companies for paying ""not a penny"" in corporate income taxes in recent years. A new 15% alternative minimum tax for corporations, based on booked income reported to shareholders, aims to ensure that they pay at least some taxes.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos late on Tuesday said he supports a hike in the U.S. corporate tax rate, but did not specify a specific level that was acceptable.
Treasury said it estimates that some 45 corporations would have seen an average $300 million annual tax liability under the proposed minimum, raising some $13.5 billion in new revenues.

The announcement of a fourth batch of checks was made by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. It brings to 156 million payments the amount disbursed, with a total value of $372 billion.
The latest payments of up to $1,400 began processing last Friday, with some people receiving direct deposits, Treasury said in a statement.

The pandemic-hammered U.S. economy has been on the rebound, with 916,000 jobs created last month, bringing the jobless rate down to 6%.

""I think the Federal Reserve is an independent operation and starting off my presidency I want to be real clear that I'm not going to do the kinds of things that have been done in the last administration,"" Biden told reporters.
Biden still has significant room to make his mark on the Fed. Powell's term is up next February, when Biden can choose to extend his appointment, and there is an empty seat on the Fed's Board of Governors. 
Biden already withdrew former President Donald Trump's nomination of Judy Shelton to fill that seat.
The Fed was designed to keep a degree of independence in setting interest rates and other key policies from politicians.

Trump clashed openly with Powell, whom he appointed, threatening to fire him multiple times for not keeping rates low enough. The Fed eventually lowered rates near zero percent, where it has kept them as the economy weathered the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Biden has closely coordinated economic policy with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, herself a former Fed chair and colleague of Powell's. When asked about Powell, Biden mentioned that he speaks regularly with Yellen.

Moreno, 54, is the fifth Republican Senate hopeful to join an increasingly crowded field for 2022 that includes former Ohio Republican Party Chairwoman Jane Timken and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel. Several other Republicans are considering runs.
Portman, 65, a Republican who entered the Senate a decade ago, announced his retirement in January, saying that deepening political divisions had made it harder to break through the partisan gridlock in Congress. 
A car dealer and technology entrepreneur, Moreno posted a two-minute campaign video on Twitter in which he vowed to combat the agenda of ""the socialist left,"" saying that he left his native Colombia for the United States as a child with his mother and siblings to escape socialism. 
He also vowed to ""crack down on China"" and pledged to reject campaign contributions from corporate political action committees.
""Four years ago, we sent Donald J. Trump, an outsider and businessman, to Washington to shake things up. And he did. We need to protect his victories,"" Moreno says in the video.
""If we're going to protect this country from the socialist left and keep this precious idea built on the concept of freedom, then we need outsiders who back up their words with action.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic U.S. Representative Alcee Hastings has died at the age of 84, his office said on Tuesday, further narrowing the party's majority in the lower chamber of Congress.
His office did not provide details on the cause of death. In January 2019, Hastings said he was diagnosed with and receiving treatment for pancreatic cancer. 
""I'm heartbroken at the passing of my dear friend, Alcee Hastings,"" fellow Florida Democratic lawmaker said Ted Deutch in a statement. ""Alcee spoke up for the quiet voices that would otherwise go unheard. He never backed down from a fight for the people he represented and anyone else who needed defending.""
Hastings, who became the first African American elected to Congress in Florida since the post-Civil War period, was serving his 15th two-year term in the U.S. House of Representatives in a Florida district that now includes parts of Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and the area around Lake Okeechobee, his website said. He was first elected in 1992.
He most recently won his seat with 78.7% of the vote, according to the Florida Department of State.
To fill the vacancy, Florida's governor will issue an executive order calling for a special election, a fairly long process that will involve a primary, said Wendy Sartory Link, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, one of the counties in Hastings' district.
There is no deadline on when a special election must take place. Florida's state legislature is currently considering a raft of changes to its election procedures that may need to be implemented for the election, she said.
Hastings served on the powerful Rules Committee, which determines the conditions under which legislation in the House is considered, and was a commissioner on the Commission of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors and encourages compliance of human rights.
Lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Whip James Clyburn and Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern mourned the death of Hastings in public statements.
""We sat side by side in the committee for many years and I watched him take down phony arguments and lift up the truth with a turn of a phrase that only he could deliver,"" McGovern said. ""I have lost a friend, this Congress has lost a giant, and those who all too often go unseen in America have lost a champion,"" 
Before his election to Congress, Hastings was an attorney and civil rights activist.
The son of parents who were domestic workers, Hastings was born in 1936 and attended a segregated high school. He spoke about how his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents were not allowed to vote, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported.
In 1979, he was appointed to be a federal district court judge. But two years later, Hastings was indicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice for soliciting a $150,000 bribe for reducing the sentences of two mob-connected felons convicted in his court, according to the Senate website. 
Though Hastings was acquitted, he was impeached and removed from office by the U.S. Senate in 1989. He was not disqualified from holding future elected office.

His death leaves a sixth vacancy in the House of Representatives, which Democrats would now control with 218 seats, against the Republicans' 211, according to a tally by the House press office. 
The further narrowing of the Democrats' majority could make it even more difficult for the party to pursue their legislative agenda.

William Evans, an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police force and father of two children, died at the hospital after he was struck by the vehicle, the district's Metropolitan Police Department said.
""It is our hope that this tribute will be a comfort to the family of Officer Evans, particularly his children Logan and Abigail, as will the knowledge that so many Americans mourn with and pray for them at this sad time,"" House of Representatives' Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
The ceremonial arrival will take place in the morning of April 13, with a congressional tribute and viewing period to follow.
Lying in honor - the public viewing of a person's casket - is one of the highest possible honors Congress has for a civilian. Only five other people have received the distinction since the honor was created in 1998. 
Three of those people were Capitol Police officers who died in attacks on the Capitol, including Brian Sicknick, the officer who died from injuries suffered on Jan. 6, when hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the institution.

Spokesman Justin Goodman said that Democrats had not decided whether to use reconciliation, which they employed to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill last month without Republican votes.
But Monday's ruling by Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough means they can do so with just a simple majority in the Senate, by treating the measure as a revision of budget legislation. Doing so would bypass a potential Republican filibuster, in which legislation would need 60 votes to pass.
The Senate is currently divided 50-50 between the Democratic and Republican caucuses, but Democrats have control of the chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie.
""The Parliamentarian’s opinion is an important step forward that this key pathway is available to Democrats if needed,"" Goodman said.
Biden last week proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which Republicans have said they would oppose.
Biden has said he wants to negotiate the measure with lawmakers from both parties. But he would be willing to push through the infrastructure bill without the support of Republican lawmakers in the absence of a bipartisan agreement, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Sunday.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Biden's plan would raise taxes and increase debt, and he vowed to fight it ""every step of the way.""

Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the chamber's Finance Committee, said he was pleased by the parliamentarian’s ruling.
""The American people want bold action to address our country’s many challenges, and Democrats now have more options to overcome Republican obstruction and get things done,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The attorneys general of five U.S. states and the District of Columbia on Monday called on President Joe Biden's Justice Department to withdraw legal briefs filed in support of fossil fuel companies in litigation during the Trump administration, arguing they contradict the new president's position on climate change.
The top law enforcement officials of Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to inform courts that the Justice Department no longer supports those briefs in pending litigation. 
""Those positions are not only misplaced - as almost all the courts to consider them have ruled to date - but also directly contravene President Biden’s 2020 pledge to 'strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters,'"" the letter said.
The states have filed lawsuits against the oil industry https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-advertising-insight-idUKKBN28R1OB alleging that companies have violated state consumer protection and deception laws by downplaying the risks of climate change or ""greenwashing"" their image by portraying themselves as part of the solution.
Their attorneys general argue that the fact that the Trump-era DOJ amicus briefs are still on record lets oil companies prolong the litigation and argue that cases should be moved to federal courts rather than state courts.
Industry prefers that federal courts weigh these cases because it argues that federal laws pre-empt any claim under state law that carbon emissions from fossil fuels cause climate change and related damages. 
The state officials said those briefs undermine their ""efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for harms caused in our states - to our consumers, our investors, our infrastructure, our real property, and our natural resources.""
The Justice Department was not immediately available for comment.

The Supreme Court is deliberating a lawsuit filed by the city of Baltimore against energy companies and weighing whether that case and others like it should be heard in a state court or in a federal court. The city is seeking monetary damages due to the impact of global climate change.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell lashed out at corporate America on Monday, warning CEOs to stay out of the debate over a new voting law in Georgia that has been criticized as restricting votes among minorities and the poor.
In a sign of a growing rift in the decades-old alliance between the conservative party and U.S. corporations, McConnell said: ""My advice to the corporate CEOs of America is to stay out of politics. Don't pick sides in these big fights.""
McConnell warned companies there could be risks for turning on the party, but he did not elaborate.
""Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order,"" McConnell told a news conference in his home state of Kentucky.
Big business ties with Republicans began fraying under former President Donald Trump's leadership and the party's focus on voting restrictions has soured businesses embracing diversity as key to their work force and customer base.
Major Georgia employers Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have spoken out against the law signed by Governor Brian Kemp, and Major League Baseball pulled the 2021 All-Star Game out of the state over the law strengthening identification requirements for absentee ballots and making it a crime to offer food or water to voters waiting in line.
""I found it completely discouraging to find a bunch of corporate CEOs getting in the middle of politics,"" McConnell said.
Trump spent months after losing his re-election bid falsely claiming that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud. He failed in dozens of legal challenges. Nonetheless, lawmakers in 47 states this year have introduced 361 bills imposing new restrictions on voting, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
The Georgia law brought a backlash from some U.S. companies with strong ties to the state.
 Coca-Cola Co  Chief Executive James Quincey called the law ""unacceptable"" and a ""step backwards."" Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said: ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 election.""
Independent reviews have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is rare in the United States, and state and federal probes found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election which the Republican Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
Corporate America has long thrown its political muscle behind Republican candidates and office-holders, often funneling more campaign contributions to conservative candidates than Democratic ones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Since the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the event that left five dead and scores of others wounded. His supporters appear to have listened. 
Three months after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to try to overturn his November election loss, about half of Republicans believe the siege was largely a non-violent protest or was the handiwork of left-wing activists ""trying to make Trump look bad,"" a new Reuters/Ipsos poll has found. 
Six in 10 Republicans also believe the false claim put out by Trump that November's presidential election ""was stolen"" from him due to widespread voter fraud, and the same proportion of Republicans think he should run again in 2024, the March 30-31 poll showed.
Since the Capitol attack, Trump, many of his allies within the Republican Party and right-wing media personalities have publicly painted a picture of the day’s events jarringly at odds with reality. 
Hundreds of Trump’s supporters, mobilized by the former president's false claims of a stolen election, climbed walls of the Capitol building and smashed windows to gain entry while lawmakers were inside voting to certify President Joe Biden’s election victory. The rioters - many of them sporting Trump campaign gear and waving flags - also included known white supremacist groups such as the Proud Boys. 
    In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said the rioters posed “zero threat.” Other prominent Republicans, such as Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have publicly doubted whether Trump supporters were behind the riot. 
Last month, 12 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against a resolution honoring Capitol Police officers who defended the grounds during the rampage, with one lawmaker saying that he objected using the word “insurrection” to describe the incident.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a large number of rank-and-file Republicans have embraced the myth. While 59% of all Americans say Trump bears some responsibility for the attack, only three in 10 Republicans agree. Eight in 10 Democrats and six in 10 independents reject the false claims that the Capitol siege was ""mostly peaceful"" or it was staged by left-wing protestors. 
“Republicans have their own version of reality,” said John Geer, an expert on public opinion at Vanderbilt University. “It is a huge problem. Democracy requires accountability and accountability requires evidence.”
The refusal of Trump and prominent Republicans to repudiate the events of Jan. 6 increases the likelihood of a similar incident happening again, said Susan Corke, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.
""That is the biggest danger – normalizing this behavior,"" Corke said. “I do think we are going to see more violence.”
In a fresh reminder of the security threats the U.S. Capitol faces since Jan. 6, a motorist rammed a car into U.S. Capitol police on Friday and brandished a knife, killing one officer and injuring another and forcing the Capitol complex to lock down. Officers shot and killed the suspect.
Allie Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said its members condemned the Capitol attack and referred to a Jan. 13 statement from Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. ""Violence has no place in our politics ... Those who partook in the assault on our nation's Capitol and those who continue to threaten violence should be found, held accountable, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" McDaniel said.
A representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. 
'DANGEROUS SPIN ON REALITY'
The disinformation campaign aimed at downplaying the insurrection and Trump's role in it reflects a growing consensus within the Republican Party that its fortunes remain tethered to Trump and his devoted base, political observers say.
According to the new Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trump remains the most popular figure within the party, with eight in 10 Republicans continuing to hold a favorable impression of him.
“Congressional Republicans have assessed they need to max out the Trump vote to win,” said Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. “That that is the path back to the majority.”
Republicans in Congress show few signs of breaking with Trump. Right after the deadly Capitol siege, 147 Republican lawmakers voted against certifying Biden's election win. The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Trump for ""inciting an insurrection"", making him the only U.S. president to be impeached twice, but most Senate Republicans acquitted him of the charge in a trial. 
Last week, Republican congressman Jim Banks of Indiana said the party must cater to the working-class voters that comprise Trump’s political base ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections that will dictate control of Congress.
""Members who want to swap out working-class voters because they resent President Trump’s impact... are wrong,"" Banks wrote in a memo to Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy, contents of which he posted on Twitter.
Banks was one of the 147 lawmakers who voted to block certification of Biden's win, and he later voted against impeaching Trump. Banks did not respond to requests for comment.
Some mainstream Republicans contend that after Republicans lost both the White House and control of both chambers of Congress on Trump's watch, the party must move on from the former president in order to attract suburban, moderate and independent voters.
In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, only about three in 10 independents said they have a favorable view of Trump, among the lowest level recorded since his presidency. Most Americans -- about 60% -- also believe Biden won the November election fair and square, and said Trump should not run again.
Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of Trump's top Republican critics in Congress, has criticized the push to rewrite the history of the Capitol attack.
The disinformation effort is “such a dangerous, disgusting spin on reality,” Kinzinger wrote in a fundraising appeal to supporters last month, “and what’s even worse is that it goes unchallenged by so many in the Republican Party.” 
The window for the Republican Party to distance itself from Trump seems to have passed, Miller said.
“There was a chance after January 6 for Republican leaders to really put their foot down and say, ‘We can’t be the insurrectionist party,’” he said. “Now that opportunity is totally gone.”

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,005 adults between March 30-31. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) -A Minneapolis homicide investigator said police officer Derek Chauvin used ""totally unnecessary"" deadly force when kneeling on George Floyd's neck during an arrest last May in testimony at Chauvin's murder trial on Friday.
Chauvin, who is white, was fired by the city's police department the day after he was captured on video on top of a dying Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, in a scene that sparked protests against police brutality around the world. 
""Totally unnecessary,"" Lieutenant Richard Zimmerman told the jury when prosecutors asked him what he thought of Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. ""If your knee is on a person's neck, that can kill them.""
Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges. Prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office called Zimmerman to testify in part to undermine a central dispute in the case: Chauvin's assertion that he correctly followed his police training. 
Here are some of the most important moments from the fifth day of witness testimony:
LIEUTENANT ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, MINNEAPOLIS POLICE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATOR
Zimmerman, who joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 1985 and is now its most senior officer, was at home on May 25, 2020, when he was called to the intersection outside Cup Foods, where Floyd was suspected of passing a fake $20 bill earlier in the evening.
He arrived just before 10 p.m., about half an hour after Floyd had been declared dead at a downtown hospital, and said he helped ensure that evidence was properly secured and any witnesses were found.
Zimmerman said officers were responsible for the care of anyone they arrested and are trained to give first aid to an injured or distressed detainee even if they know an ambulance is coming.
""His safety is your responsibility, his wellbeing is your responsibility,"" he told the jury.
He described how officers are trained only to respond to any threat with a proportionate amount of force. 
""Once a person is cuffed, the threat level goes down all the way,"" Zimmerman told the jury after prosecutors called him to testify. ""They're cuffed. How can they really hurt you, you know?""
And he warned of the dangers of leaving a person in a prone position.
""Once you've secured or handcuffed a person you need to get them out of the prone position as soon as possible because it restricts their breathing,"" he said.
He offered harsh testimony against the way his former colleague and other officers at the scene restrained Floyd.

""Pulling him down to the ground face down, and putting your knee on the neck for that amount of time is just uncalled for,"" Zimmerman said. ""I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that's what they felt, and that's what they would have to feel in order to use that kind of force.""
In cross-examination, Zimmerman agreed when Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, pointed out that the lieutenant does not train officers in how to use restraints and that as an investigator he has to use force less often than a patrolling officer.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A push to attract young and diverse talent and global consumers is behind some of corporate America's willingness to speak out on politically charged issues like Georgia's new voting law, executives and corporate governance experts said.
Georgia's decision last month to strengthen identification requirements for absentee ballots and make it a misdemeanor to offer food and water to voters waiting in line, among other changes, drew condemnation from many U.S. companies this week, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
A number of companies say it disenfranchises some voters. Some, such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co., are based in Georgia, where state lawmakers have the power to raise state taxes. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a public memo that his decision to speak out was informed by discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community.
The companies criticizing the law so far represent a sliver of the U.S. business landscape. Yet they are part of a growing group of companies shedding their reluctance to speak out on politically controversial social issues that matter to many of their employees and customers globally, business leaders interviewed by Reuters said.
""Young people want more than words, they want action,"" Debra Lee, the former chair and CEO of BET Networks, a TV network owned by ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc, said in an interview on Thursday. ViacomCBS has also criticized the Georgia law.
A new focus from investors on environmental, social and governance issues such as climate change and the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements has also emboldened companies.
Recent examples range from companies criticizing former President Donald Trump's claims of election fraud, to Washington Redskins football stadium sponsor Fedex Corp asking for a team name change. Retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) Inc, for example, have adopted new restrictions on gun sales following mass shootings. 
Some companies that are reluctant to criticize specific laws or policies are still willing to come out with more general statements. For example, roughly 330 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 Index issued comments last year in support of social justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in the custody of Minneapolis police, according to shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. 
This approach, however, does not always appease activists looking for bigger change. Olivia Knight, the group's racial justice initiative coordinator, said companies often did not follow up with any action, and that many were limited to vague statements of support.
""I don’t think we can make the assumption the corporate world is a pot of social justice advocacy and should be looked to for guidance on these issues,"" she said.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's political action committee is resuming making political donations. It said it will not rule out making donations to Republican lawmakers who voted against President Joe Biden's election certification on Jan. 6. Former  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) CEO Ken Chenault, who co-authored a letter with other Black business leaders this week calling on companies to condemn the Georgia voting law, said in an interview that some firms may be hesitant to speak out for fear of appearing partisan.
But he noted that more than 60 big U.S. companies recently signed a statement opposing state bills focused on sexual orientation, showing a willingness to weigh in at least on some topics. In the battle on voting bills, ""we are in the early stages,"" Chenault said.
WORKERS AND CONSUMERS
Speaking out against politically sensitive issues can be risky. Shares of some western apparel companies declined after they faced boycotts in China over their statements expressing concern about labor conditions, amid investor worries they would lose access to a vast, growing market. However, companies that spoke out against the Georgia voting law saw little impact on their share price.
Shivaram Rajgopal, a Columbia Business School professor who follows corporate cultural issues, said corporate America is focused on satisfying its skilled young workers, who are getting more politically active on social media.
""The younger workforce expects you to take a stand on these social justice issues,"" Rajgopol said.
A 2019 study by the Pew Research Center found members of the U.S. generations known as Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z, born after 1996, share more liberal attitudes than older generations on a range of issues, such as favoring more racial diversity and activist government.
""If we are not speaking up against these voter suppression efforts, we're really taking a chunk out of ourselves and who we are as aviation,"" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, speaking at a U.S. aviation summit on Wednesday. 
The views of global customers and investors also matter more to international conglomerates like Coke and Delta than local politics, said Ric Marshall, executive director at sustainability ratings firm MSCI.

""Management at these companies is much more beholden to this broader stakeholder group,"" Marshall said. Conversely, companies that have said less about voting rights could be wary of alienating a more domestic customer base, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday rejected the idea of raising gas taxes as a way to pay for President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, setting the stage for a fight with business groups that are calling for U.S. drivers to foot the bill instead of corporate tax hikes.
Biden's plan calls for raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, and proposes other tax increases and policy tweaks to ensure companies do not dodge domestic tax bills by shifting profits overseas.
The tax proposal, announced Wednesday, was opposed by Republicans in Congress, trade groups including the National Association of Manufacturers, and business lobbies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable. 
Many critics, including the Chamber and some right-leaning think tanks, said taxes should instead be raised on motorists. U.S. fuel taxes are some of the lowest in the world, and have not been increased since 1993. Business groups also proposed a new mileage tax that would include electronic vehicles to help plug holes in the national highway fund. 
Echoing earlier comments by administration officials, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that the White House does not support increasing gas taxes. 
""We don't agree with that, we don't believe that cost should be on the back of the American people,"" she said. ""We believe that corporations should be able to bear the brunt for investing in America's workers."" 
A gas tax would weigh more heavily on lower-income Americans, who often drive longer distances for work, and the Biden administration has pledged not to tax anyone making less than $400,000 a year for the infrastructure plan. 

To be sure, gas taxes are also unpopular with most voters, and a politically risky move for any president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday faced the prospect of all-out political war with Republicans over his $2 trillion blueprint to revitalize America's infrastructure, with a top Democrat also offering only partial support over how to pay for the package.
A day after the Democratic president unveiled his ""American Jobs Plan"" in Pittsburgh, the Senate's top Republican said Biden has no public mandate for the proposal and predicted that Republicans would not support it. Biden's plan combines spending on roads and bridges with climate change initiatives and human services like elder care.
""I'm going to fight them every step of the way, because I think this is the wrong prescription for America,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference in Owensboro, Kentucky.
""That package that they're putting together now, as much as we would like to address infrastructure, is not going to get support from our side,"" McConnell added.
Meanwhile, a key House of Representatives Democrat said lawmakers could significantly change the tax proposals included in Biden's plan.
""We will accept some of what he is proposing,"" said Democratic Representative Richard Neal, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
""If we can improve upon the president's proposal, we want to do that,"" Neal added. 
Biden wants to cover the cost of the plan by raising corporate tax rates and making it harder for the companies to use offshore tax shelters. Neal said he would consider bonds and expanded tax credits to pay for it. 
Democrats control both chambers of Congress by narrow margins. Passage could be difficult if Republicans line up against the plan. 
Some liberal Democrats have said the bill should be dramatically bigger. Moderate Democrats have said it must increase federal tax deductions for state and local taxes, a step that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday she would support. 
The scope of the infrastructure package could also give pause to some moderate Senate Democrats.

House Democrats have said they hope to pass Biden's infrastructure package by July 4. Much of the legislation could be written in the first week of May, Pelosi said. The White House said Biden would like to see the plan passed by this summer.
Without Republican support, Democrats might have to resort to a parliamentary procedure that would enable it to pass the 100-seat Senate with a simple majority vote rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. However, that could require them to drop elements that do not affect taxes and spending, such as provisions that would make it easier for workers to organize labor unions.

875,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The Biden administration said on Thursday it will seek to pass a law requiring utilities to source more power from renewable and other clean sources as part of an ambitious effort to address climate change through investing in infrastructure.
A so-called clean energy standard (CES) would help put the United States on a path to delivering on President Joe Biden's campaign promise to decarbonize the nation's electricity sector by 2035, and the whole economy by 2050. 
Nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage technologies would be included in the policy, Gina McCarthy, White House national climate adviser, said during a briefing with reporters.
""We're interested in pursuing this and talking to Congress about it,"" McCarthy said. ""The industry itself sees it as one of the most flexible and most effective tools."" 
McCarthy's remarks came a day after Biden unveiled a $2 trillion plan to reshape the world's largest economy and counter China's rise. Much of the proposal was aimed at mitigating climate change through investing in clean energy technologies that could create union-represented jobs.
The administration did not give details on how it would seek to structure a national clean energy standard. 
Democrats in Congress last month introduced a bill that would require 80% of retail power sales to come from sources that produce little or no carbon emissions by 2030, rising to 100% by 2035. Some Republicans have said the legislation would raise energy prices and destabilize the grid.
The federal government has lagged many states in developing policies requiring clean power sources. Most U.S. states have already set such goals, though fewer than 10 have set goals to move entirely away from fossil fuels and none would achieve net-zero emissions by 2035.

Many of the nation's biggest utilities, responding to investor pressure or state-mandated targets, have already pledged to eliminate all of their carbon emissions by 2050, with a few promising earlier timelines.
But the industry has said that rapid advances in technologies like batteries, carbon capture and advanced nuclear will be critical to reaching those goals.

(Reuters) - Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers has asked a federal judge to order Donald Trump to cover $145,000 in legal fees the state spent to defend against the former Republican president's unsuccessful effort to overturn its 2020 election results.
In a filing in Milwaukee federal court on Wednesday, Evers' lawyers said there was ""no doubt that Trump and his attorneys brought and litigated this lawsuit in bad faith.""
""Unconscionably, they did so for the purpose of sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, with a goal of disenfranchising nearly 3.3 million Wisconsin voters in order to secure the presidency contrary to majority will,"" they wrote.
The lawsuit, one of dozens Trump filed in courts around the country, had claimed that alleged flaws in Wisconsin election procedures meant the results of its presidential election, which awarded the state's 10 electoral votes to Democratic President Joe Biden, should be thrown out.
""Simply put, a message must be sent that this type of behavior cannot be tolerated in the judicial system, and that attorneys should avoid these types of frivolous attempts to disenfranchise voters in the future,"" Evers' lawyers said.
""We deny the claims,"" said William Bock, a lawyer representing Trump in the case. ""They're attacking in the pleadings my motives and the motives of my partners, of which they know nothing. The statements made about our motives were absolutely false.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Federal Communication Commission to loosen local media ownership restrictions, handing a victory to broadcasters in a ruling that could facilitate industry consolidation as consumers increasingly move online.
In a 9-0 ruling authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the justices overturned a lower court decision that had blocked the FCC's repeal of some media ownership regulations in 2017 for failing to consider the effects on ownership by racial minorities and women. Critics of the industry have said further consolidation could limit media choices for consumers.
The justices acted in appeals by the FCC, companies including News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), Fox Corp and Sinclair Broadcast (NASDAQ:SBGI) Group Inc and the National Association of Broadcasters. 
The associations for other broadcast networks' local affiliates, including ABC, NBC and CBS, backed the appeals, arguing that consolidation would help ensure the economic survival of local television amid heavy competition from internet companies that provide video content. Broadcast television stations have said they are increasingly losing advertising dollars to digital platforms. 
In 2017, the FCC - then led by Republicans during former President Donald Trump's administration - voted to eliminate a ban in place since 1975 on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets.
The FCC, now equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, is led by acting chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, who voted against the 2017 decision. The agency is set to have a Democratic majority once President Joe Biden nominates and the Senate confirms a new commissioner. The FCC could then seek to reverse the 2017 order. 
Rosenworcel did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the ruling.
Writing for the unanimous court, Kavanaugh said that the FCC reasonably reviewed the ownership rules to find that repealing or modifying them ""was not likely to harm minority and female ownership."" 
Kavanaugh added: ""The FCC reasoned that the historical justifications for those ownership rules no longer apply in today's media market, and that permitting efficient combinations among radio stations, television stations and newspapers would benefit consumers."" 
The case highlighted diverging views on the best way to ensure a competitive environment that promotes a broad range of local news and information. Critics of the FCC's action have said relaxing ownership rules could jeopardize a wider array of sources at the local level. 
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had thwarted the FCC's efforts to revise the rules since 2003 in a series of decisions. The new rules were challenged by a number of community advocacy groups led by the Prometheus Radio Project. The 3rd Circuit in 2019 blocked the new rules. 
Former FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly, a Republican who voted for the 2017 order, said he expects there will be some ""strategic deals"" to consolidate in which a local newspaper could be acquired, but that ""no massive deals"" are going to happen given the struggling local media sector.
Cheryl Leanza, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who challenged the 2017 FCC decision, said that ""the good news is the Biden FCC, once it gains a working majority, can quickly get to work building a solid record to promote the public interest standard and media ownership diversity.""

Advocacy group Free Press said the Biden FCC and Congress ""must recognize that hedge-fund and Wall Street-driven consolidation harms local communities, and only decimates what's left of competition and diversity. ... The silver lining here is (the court) deferred to the agency's judgment and left room for a new commission to get this right.""
David Chavern, CEO of the News Media Alliance group that represents more than 2,000 news organizations, hailed the ruling and said the previous restrictions ""had shackled the newspaper industry for far too long. The repeal of the ban will generate much needed investments and cross-platform synergies that will help sustain local news media.""

MADISON, Va (Reuters) - Virginia will elect a new governor this November, one of the first state-wide races in the post-Trump era.
Judging from the crowded field of seven Republican hopefuls vying for that seat, former President Donald Trump still looms large and could well determine the outcome.
Most have not disavowed the false narrative put out by Trump that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden because of voter fraud. Candidate Amanda Chase, one of the early favorites for the May 8 Republican nominating contest, has gone a step further. Following the ex-president's November loss, she encouraged him in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post to impose martial law to cling to power. She cheered the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. capital on Jan. 6 as ""patriots.""
It’s a playbook that could spell trouble for Republican hopes in Virginia, experts and pollsters say. The former battleground state in recent years has elected a Democratic governor, a Democratic-controlled state legislature and two Democratic U.S. senators, largely on the strength of college-educated, suburban voters.
Fealty to Trump is emerging as a litmus test for Republican hopefuls looking to appeal to the former president's devoted base to win next month's nominating battle. But conspiracy theories about election fraud are likely to turn off many moderate voters needed to win the Nov. 2 general election, said Frank Luntz, a veteran Republican pollster.
""This is probably the most significant political conundrum I have ever seen,"" said Luntz, who called Virginia a test case for the future of the Republican Party.
Virginia's off-year contests are traditionally viewed as a harbinger for national political trends in the wake of a presidential election. The Republican campaigns here signal that the election-fraud myth is now a key plank for party hopefuls, said Al Cardenas, a veteran Republican strategist.
""'The Big Lie' will continue to be perpetuated,"" he said.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll conducted March 30-31, 55% of Republicans believe that Biden's win was ""the result of illegal voting or election rigging,"" and just 27% said they believe he won legitimately.
Trump lost Virginia by 10 points in November, doubling his 5-point defeat in 2016 in large part because his scorched-earth politics repelled moderate, suburban and female voters.
Under state law, incumbent Democratic Governor Ralph Northam can't run for a second, consecutive term. Several Democrats are looking to replace him, including Terry McAuliffe, who held the office from 2014 to 2018.
McAuliffe said he found it “disgusting and despicable"" that his Republican rivals continue pushing the false claim that Biden's election was illegitimate. He believes they'll pay a price in November with Virginia voters, a good number of whom work for the federal government and were outraged by the bloodshed unleashed by the pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6.
""It's Looney Tunes on the other side,"" McAuliffe said. ""They are all trying to out-Trump each other.""
Pollster Luntz said the ascendance of Chase -- a twice-elected state senator who is leading the Republican field with nearly 20% support, two recent polls show -- spells particular danger for the party.
The Virginia state Senate censured Chase in January in a bipartisan vote over what it called her ""conduct unbecoming of a Senator"" including her ""patriots"" comment. The censure resolution also noted that Chase said Democratic state Senator Jennifer McClellan, who is Black and also running for governor, could not represent all Virginians because she helps lead the Black Caucus.
McClellan, in a March 16 statement, said ""Chase’s bigoted comments have no place in Virginia politics.""
Chase, 51, who has been dubbed ""Trump in heels,"" told a crowd at a recent campaign event that her censure was punishment for standing up for the former president. A resident of suburban Chesterfield County near the state capital and a former supervisor at the Federal Reserve of Richmond, she contends that her appeal is broad enough to win a statewide contest.
“I am from the suburbs. And I win in the suburbs. I am a professional, young, woman candidate,"" Chase told Reuters in an interview. She said her Republican doubters are ""establishment elite"" who continue to support losers.
Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia, declined to comment on Chase when asked if he had concerns about her ability to win a general election.
“I’ve worked very hard to keep my thumb off the scale,” he said.
'HANGOVER FROM TRUMP'
In recent polls conducted by YouGov and Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, Chase leads her rivals by almost double-digit margins heading into next month's race for the Republican Party's nomination. She has 19% and 17% support respectively in those polls, with her nearest rivals polling at 10%. The contest remains fluid: Both polls showed 55% of self-identified Republicans are still undecided.
After months of infighting over the methods of selecting their nominees for November, the state Republican Party's governing board last month opted this year to replace its traditional primary election with a convention due to what it said were COVID-19 concerns. Voters will be able to cast ballots at 37 drive-up locations across the state.
Another change is a move to so-called rank-choice voting, in which voters cast ballots for multiple candidates by their first choice, second choice and so on. If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote on the first ballot, the candidate in last place is eliminated and their ballots redistributed based on their voters' second-choice picks. The process repeats until a nominee emerges with over 50% support.
Chase had called for a statewide primary. She told Reuters she believed this year's system had been rigged against her, because in a primary she would need just a plurality of votes to win.
John March, a spokesman for the state Republican Party, would not comment on her accusation.
Interviews with a dozen Virginians who intend to vote in November revealed sharp divisions over Chase.
In the suburban enclave of Alexandria in northern Virginia, communications specialist Steve Fong, 53, said he finds the stolen-election narrative offensive, and Chase too extreme. “I could not even consider voting for her,"" he said. 
Mary Slaughter, 65, who runs a landscaping business in the rural community of Natural Bridge, said the presidential election was ""clearly stolen"" and that she would vote for Chase in November if she becomes the Republican nominee. “She’s a female Donald Trump,"" Slaughter said approvingly.
Other Republican hopefuls for governor have likewise put voter fraud at the forefront of their campaigns.
Glenn Youngkin, a former hedge fund executive, is calling for an “election integrity task force.” Businessman Pete Snyder is running an ad promising to ""stop liberals from rigging the system."" Peter Doran, a former think tank CEO, touts a ""Voter Integrity Plan"" on his website. 
The campaigns did not respond to questions asking if their candidate believed Biden was the legitimate winner of November's election. 
The one Republican candidate who has declared Biden the winner is Kirk Cox, the former Virginia House speaker who lost his majority in 2019 in large part due to Trump’s unpopularity in the suburbs.
Cox said he does not believe his stance will damage him in next month's nominating fight, citing his long conservative record of defending gun rights and opposing abortion.
The ranked-choice system opens the door for candidates like Cox to win if they receive more second-choice votes than Chase.
But any Republican faces an uphill battle to win back the suburban voters who left the party on Trump's watch, says Bob Holsworth, a non-partisan analyst of Virginia politics.

    ""There is a large hangover from the Trump era that is not going to be erased here in Virginia,"" Holsworth said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday resisted calls to punish a staunch ally of President Donald Trump who, according to a U.S. law enforcement source, faces a federal probe into a relationship with an underage girl.
Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would not strip Representative Matt Gaetz of his committee assignments absent proof that he has engaged in wrongdoing, as Democrats have demanded. 
Gaetz is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department for possibly violating sex-trafficking laws by paying travel expenses for a 17-year-old girl with whom he was romantically involved, according to a U.S. enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.
The story was first reported in the New York Times.
""Those are serious implications. If it comes out to be true, yes, we would remove him, if that was the case. But right now, Matt Gaetz says that it's not true and we don't have any information. So let's get all the information,"" McCarthy said on Fox News. 
He said he expected to speak to Gaetz later on Wednesday.

Gaetz, an outspoken 38-year-old conservative who has cast himself as an avid leader in Trump's America First movement, has denied the allegations and said in a statement that he and his family are the victims of an ""organized crime extortion."" 
Democrats called on McCarthy to strip Gaetz of his committee assignments while the federal probe is under way, especially his seat on the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department. Gaetz also sits on the House Armed Services Committee.

881,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down Governor Tony Evers' mask mandate, saying he exceeded his authority and violated the separation of powers by reissuing emergency orders during the pandemic.
In its 4-to-3 ruling, which voids a Feb. 4 face-covering order currently in effect, the court found that Evers effectively breached a statute that limits his emergency powers to 60 days without approval of the state legislature.
""The question in this case is not whether the governor acted wisely; it is whether he acted lawfully,"" Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority. ""We conclude he did not.""
Evers, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency last March, which the Republican-controlled legislature never extended beyond its statutory 60-day limit.
In a partisan battle similar to others across the country over face-covering requirements aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, Evers reissued his orders roughly every 60 days, changing some of the requirements each time. 
His most recent renewal of an emergency health order on Feb. 4 came shortly after the legislature voted to repeal his earlier order requiring face coverings in public places.
The court's majority likened the governor's recurring orders to a game of whack-a-mole in which he sought to dodge the legislature, which opposed his extended emergency powers, by altering each new order even though it was substantially similar. 
""The governor cannot make an end run around legislative revocation simply by itemizing a previously unidentified justification for the state of emergency,"" it said.
Responding to the ruling, Evers said he followed the guidance of health experts to keep residents safe.
""While we work to get folks vaccinated as quickly as we can, we know wearing a mask saves lives, and we still need Wisconsinites to mask up so we can beat this virus and bounce back from this pandemic,” he said in a statement.
Two of the justices, including Chief Justice Patience Roggensack, issued a separate concurring opinion.
In their dissent, three justices faulted the majority for granting standing to the plaintiff, Jere Fabick, a Midwest dealer in  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) products who sits on the board of a conservative think tank, arguing that he was unharmed by the orders as a taxpayer.

""Unfortunately, the ultimate consequence of the majority's decision is that it places yet another roadblock to an effective governmental response to COVID-19, further jeopardizing the health and lives of the people of Wisconsin,"" Justice Ann Walsh Bradley wrote in her dissent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Congress is poised for a long battle over President Joe Biden's infrastructure investment plan as Democrats argue with Republicans and among themselves over the $2 trillion cost and how the money should be parceled out in coming years.
Democrats, with effective control of the Senate and a slim majority in the House of Representatives aim to deliver a final bill for the Democratic president to sign into law between July 4 and early September.
They have said they want Republican support for the plan, but have also pledged to move unilaterally if they cannot make prompt progress.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer invoked special fast-track budget rules to pass Biden's recent $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill without Republican support. Schumer may have to go that route again, as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he would not support tax increases or deficit spending in the bill.
""I'm going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh on Wednesday unveiling the proposal. ""We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to get this done,"" 
Liberal Democrats urged Biden to be more ambitious.
""Needs to be way bigger,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. Senator Ed Markey, a fellow progressive, has called for $11 trillion in spending over the next decade. 
The Associated General Contractors of America, a construction group, praised the job creation that Biden's plan would ignite, but attacked a measure it said would provide new protections for workers trying to join labor unions. 
Biden's plan initially calls for $2 trillion in new spending on everything from roads and bridges to broadband and elderly care, along with higher corporate taxes. Economists say the measures could create millions of blue-collar jobs.
Biden may also unveil a second spending package in April. 
Republican former President Donald Trump had pledged infrastructure legislation in 2017, but it never got off the ground in part because of partisan disagreements over funding mechanisms. 
Last month, Congress passed Biden's coronavirus aid package without Republican support.
This time around, a dizzying array of congressional committees, ranging from House and Senate tax-writing panels to those that oversee health policy, the environment and transportation, are expected to struggle to find consensus.
ARRAY OF QUESTIONS
Many Republicans are wary of Biden's infrastructure plan, especially if it is financed with tax increases. Some moderate House Democrats have said they will only support it if there is a bigger write-off for state and local taxes. 
An array of thorny questions, including whether to use the legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, could produce delays along the way.
Sam Graves, top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, lamented that only 25% of the proposal was devoted to transportation infrastructure like roads and bridges and objected to tax increases.

Graves called on lawmakers to back proposals that could gain bipartisan support. Bill Shuster, a retired Republican congressman who was chairman of the transportation and infrastructure panel, predicted that elements like green energy and broadband investment could gain backing from both Democrats and Republicans.
Current and former lawmakers say it may take until September to pass the bill. The environment gets more difficult after that point as moderate Democrats could be pressed to defend Biden's deficit spending ahead of the 2022 congressional elections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Iowa Democratic congressional candidate who had challenged the certified election results of a disputed seat in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Wednesday that she had withdrawn her contest.
The dispute had been poised to become a political maelstrom, as some Republicans warned the case would set a dangerous precedent and some Democrats expressed misgivings about it.
Rita Hart, a former state senator who had run for Iowa's 2nd Congressional District seat, lost her race to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks by six votes out of nearly 400,000 cast. 
Miller-Meeks was sworn into office in January, after state election officials certified the results.
But Hart petitioned the U.S. House, which holds an extremely narrow Democratic majority, to intervene, saying 22 votes were improperly excluded from the count. 
""Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional election in 100 years has effectively silenced the votes of Iowans,"" Hart said in a statement.
A spokesman for Miller-Meeks' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zoe Lofgren, the chair of the House Administration Committee, said the panel would recommend that the House dismiss the contest now that Hart had withdrawn her challenge.
""We are glad Rita Hart finally came to her senses,"" said Mike Berg, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Former President Donald Trump, a Republican, refused to publicly accept the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election, in which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. After a fiery speech Trump made in Washington, hundreds of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a bid to stop the certification of Biden's victory.
The events directly led to Trump's second impeachment trial, on a charge of inciting an insurrection. 

Nine of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump drew a parallel between that incident and the Iowa election, saying the dispute ""reinforces the false belief by many in our country that our election system is rigged.""

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has removed a video of an interview with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who remains banned from the platform, from his daughter-in-law Lara Trump's Facebook page, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. 
Lara Trump, who is married to the former president's son Eric and recently joined Fox News as a contributor, had promoted an interview with Trump for her own online show ""The Right View"" in Instagram posts on Tuesday.
She later posted a screenshot of an email from Facebook that said her video with Trump speaking had been removed, citing the ban on his accounts. 
Trump was suspended from Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram indefinitely over incitement of violence following the Jan. 6 riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Facebook has sent the case of Trump's suspension to its independent oversight board. 
""In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts,"" the email read.
The Facebook spokeswoman, who spoke on condition that her name not be used, confirmed the email was real but declined to comment. Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the action.
In another email shared by Lara Trump on her Facebook page, Facebook said the guidance applied to all campaign accounts, messaging vehicles and former Trump surrogates on the site. 
Since the ban, the former president has been shown speaking on Facebook's platforms in news coverage from outlets such as Fox News and Newsmax.

Trump was barred by several social media platforms after the riot, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), which has said its ban is permanent, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube, which said it will reinstate his account when the risk of violence decreases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure plan with higher corporate taxes faces hurdles in Congress from Republicans who say it will kill jobs and some of his fellow Democrats who want a bigger write-off for state and local taxes.
The plan, which Biden will unveil at an event in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday, would hike the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28%, from its current 21%, to secure more revenue from corporations that have used offshore tax shelters and other measures to reduce their tax burdens. 
""President Biden's reform will reverse this damage and fundamentally reform the way the tax code treats the largest corporations,"" the White House said earlier as it released details of the plan.
The Biden tax provisions quickly came under fire from American business interests and Republicans on a key tax committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
""The proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure,"" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that warned the tax hikes would ""slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally.""
Unveiled along with Biden's infrastructure plan, the tax provisions would roll back many of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy. 
Biden's overall infrastructure plan charts a dramatic shift in the direction of the U.S. economy, with investments in traditional projects like roads and bridges along with climate change and human services like elder care. 
The president hopes to draw bipartisan support from Republicans in Congress but will need solid backing from Democrats in the Senate and the House, if Republicans uniformly reject the legislation as they did his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.
But some moderate Democrats hope to reverse Trump's cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, which is felt most acutely in Northeastern states with higher taxes. 
""We say, no SALT, no deal,"" three House Democrats from New York and New Jersey said this week. 

Democrats control the House by a margin of 219 to 211, so they will need to stay united if no Republicans support the plan. The party has not yet decided how to shepherd the package through Congress, a House Democratic aide said.
Republicans on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee decried the initiative in a pre-dawn statement as ""a series of job-killing tax hikes"" that would saddle American companies with a higher tax rate that their competitors in ""Communist China.""

887,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Capitol Police officers have filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, saying he incited the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection and was responsible for physical and emotional injuries they suffered as a result.
James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, an 11-year veteran, filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking damages of at least $75,000 each.
""This is a complaint for damages by U.S. Capitol Police officers for physical and emotional injuries caused by the defendant Donald Trump’s wrongful conduct inciting a riot on January 6, 2021, by his followers trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election,"" the lawsuit said.
Trump has denied responsibility for the rioting, which left five people dead, including a police officer. His office did not immediately return a call for comment on the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit cites the former Republican president's conduct before and beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won, including comments in speeches, on Twitter and during presidential debates.
It said Trump stoked violence throughout the 2020 presidential campaign and escalated his false assertion that the election was rigged after the election was called for Biden.
""During his 2016 campaign, and throughout his presidency, Trump had threatened violence towards his opponents, encouraged his followers to commit acts of violence, and condoned acts of violence by his followers, including white supremacists and far rightwing hate groups,"" it said.
The lawsuit also cited Trump's encouragement to supporters to come to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and ""Stop The Steal"" in the months after the election, including a tweet on Dec. 19: ""Big protest on D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild."" 

""Trump’s December 19th tweet about the January 6th rally was taken by many of his supporters as a literal call to arms,"" the lawsuit said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's plans to spend billions of dollars on the United States' crumbling roads and mass transit include a novel twist - making companies and wealthy households, rather than drivers and riders, pay the cost. 
Biden will unveil more details about the first stage of his infrastructure plan, which could be worth as much as $4 trillion, in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. 
Business groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been pushing Biden to raise U.S. fuel taxes, some of the lowest in the world, for the first time since 1993. They also want a new mileage tax that would sweep in electronic vehicles to plug holes in the national highway fund. 
But the White House has rejected those ideas, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN on Monday. A gas tax is politically risky and would weigh more heavily on lower-income Americans, who often travel longer distances for work. 
Instead, Biden is expected to propose the biggest federal tax increase in decades, according to two sources familiar with the plan. It includes raising corporate income to 28%, and increasing the marginal tax rate on high-earners, according to two sources familiar with the plan.
White House aides say that Biden may also rely on some federal borrowing to fund the package, given historically low interest rates. 
Whatever the plan, it is likely to inspire heated debate among Republicans, Democrats, economists and academics about the right way to plug the holes in the U.S. economy opened by the vast spread of COVID-19. 
""The president has a plan to fix the infrastructure of our country… and he has a plan to pay for it,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. If members of Congress don’t like it, ""we’re happy to look at their proposals,” Psaki added.
THE IMMENSE U.S. HIGHWAY SYSTEM The nation's nearly 50,000 miles https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.cfm#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20Interstate%20System%20is,41%2C000%20miles%20at%20the%20time) of interstate highways were considered one of the world's cutting-edge infrastructure projects when they were constructed. But the national piggy bank for funding road and mass transit projects since 1956, the Highway Trust Fund, has been in the red since 2008.
Congressional budget forecasters warn it could have a $207 billion shortfall by 2031 without new sources of revenue. 
The fund is fed by an 18.4 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and a 24.4 cent tax on diesel, both of which have not been raised in nearly three decades, even as fuel efficiency standards have improved. 
That makes fuel cheap. German drivers paid $6.12 per gallon of fuel in 2019, versus $2.87 in the United States, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. In Britain, taxes account for 63% of the fuel price at the pump, versus 19% in the United States. 
Biden has vowed not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 a year, which includes the overwhelming majority of the country.
Influential trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have failed to convince lawmakers to raise the fuel tax to pay for roads. ""We believe in a user-based system for roads, bridges and transit"" said Ed Mortimer, its vice president of Transportation and Infrastructure. 
Senate committee leaders John Barrasso, of Wyoming, and Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, floated the idea of tying the fuel tax to inflation and a national electric vehicle fee to pay for a five-year, $287 billion highway bill sought last year.
The purchasing power of the U.S. fuel tax has declined by 43 percent since 1993 due to inflation, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.
Some sort of compromise on funding is necessary. 
""If the White House and lawmakers can't find agreement on the Highway Trust Fund, then it doesn't bode well for the rest of the package,” said Quincy Krosby, chief markets strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), who consults on transportation financing. 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES GET A BREAK
Biden is also expected to ignore calls from lawmakers for a new way to tax motorists based on how far they drive, not how much fuel they use, a third source familiar with the plan told Reuters. 
A vehicle's miles traveled, or VMT, tax would mean electric car owners help pay for the nation’s infrastructure and help to offset rising fuel efficiency standards that have led to declining trust fund revenues. 
Just about 2% of cars sold in the United States in 2020 were electric, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts. Biden's plan calls for a nationwide network of charging stations, but no additional taxes for drivers of those vehicles. 
""We offer tax incentives for electric vehicles, so it seems counterproductive then to tax them,"" said a Democratic legislative aide engaged in the talks.
A VMT tax could take years to implement fully, but it does have bipartisan support. ""As a conservative, I strongly believe in the user-pays principle, and I believe that we need to start ensuring that all users pay their fair share for the roads they’re using,"" said Sam Graves, the ranking Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 

The committee's chairman, Peter A. DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, has supported raising the gas tax but also wants to provide seed money to experiment with a VMT system, which he calls inevitable. (This story corrects to eliminate reference to 2017 tax rate in the fifth paragraph)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. border official said on Tuesday he expects more than a million migrants will arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border this year, a sign of a growing humanitarian challenge for President Joe Biden on the southwest border.
If the figures reach 1 million, it could mirror a similar increase in border crossings in 2019 during Donald Trump's presidency, when nearly 978,000 migrants were taken into custody.
Border Patrol arrested about 100,000 migrants in February, the most in a month since mid-2019. More migrants typically cross between April and June, Raul Ortiz, deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, told reporters.
""We're already starting to see some higher days of 6,000-plus apprehensions,"" Ortiz said. ""So I fully expect our border patrol agents to encounter over a million people this year.""
The Biden administration allowed several reporters to interview border officials and tour a crowded migrant processing facility in Donna, Texas, on Tuesday following growing demands from news outlets for more access. The footage was shared with Reuters and other outlets.
The Donna facility is holding 4,100 migrants, most of whom are unaccompanied minors, according to a pool report, four times its pre-COVID capacity.
More than 2,000 unaccompanied migrant children have been held there for longer than a legal limit of 72 hours, Border Patrol official Oscar Escamilla said. Of those, 39 children had been stuck in the tent facility for more than 15 days as they await placement in a shelter overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
""It's out of my hands,"" he told reporters. ""For whatever reason, they have fallen through the system or through the cracks.""
The HHS refugee office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tens of thousands of Central American migrants have trekked to the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months. The increase is driven by poor economic conditions in the region, the effects of devastating hurricanes last year, and hope among migrants that they will be allowed to remain in the United States as Biden reverses some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies. 
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a written statement that federal officials were ""working around the clock"" to quickly move children out of the packed border facilities.
During the tour of the Donna facility, reporters visited an area for young children, who sat inside a playpen, used coloring books and watched a movie.
The children, as young as 3 years old, also sleep in the area, Escamilla said, since other areas for unaccompanied children were too crowded.
Escamilla said one young girl told him she did not know the U.S. state to which she was traveling, just that ""it snows there."" He said another girl had lost the phone number of a contact in the United States.

In video footage from inside the facility, children were crowded into plastic-walled ""pods,"" laying on floor mats and covered with Mylar blankets. Other footage showed shelves stocked with snack bars, diapers and baby bottles.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to allow a proclamation from his Republican predecessor that had blocked many temporary foreign workers from coming into the United States to expire on Wednesday, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The Democratic president has rolled back many of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies since taking office on Jan. 20 including last month revoking a proclamation that had blocked many applicants for permanent residency - known as a green card - from entering the United States.
Trump first issued his directive on temporary foreign workers in June 2020 and renewed it through March 31 before leaving office, portraying it as necessary to protect American workers amid high unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. jobless claims dropped to a one-year low in mid-March as the public health situation improved and temperatures warmed. Still, a Labor Department report last week showed a large number of Americans - nearly 19 million - were still receiving unemployment checks.
Major U.S. business associations, including the National Association of Manufacturers and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, sued in July to try to overturn Trump's temporary worker ban. A California-based federal judge in October blocked the policy as it applied to hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses with membership in the associations that had sued.
The judge found Trump's policy would cause ""irreparable harm"" to the businesses by interfering with their operations and leading them to lay off employees and close open positions.
Bloomberg News first reported Biden's plan to allow the foreign worker ban to expire. 

Among those affected by the restrictions are skilled foreign workers on so-called H-1B visas that let U.S. employers temporarily hire foreign employees in specialty occupations. Companies that provide outsourcing services typically make up the bulk of the H-1B program's top users.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former singer for the punk rock band The Misfits who was in Washington on the day of the U.S. Capitol riot has emerged as a possible trial witness as defense lawyers seek to undermine the prosecution's bid to prove conspiracy charges against some members of the right-wing Proud Boys group.
Michale Graves, the lead singer of the veteran band from 1995 to 2000, said a Proud Boys member asked him to play some songs for a private concert planned for the afternoon of Jan. 6. That was the day of the Capitol attack that left five people dead, including a police officer. 
Graves, who said he became a member of the Proud Boys last year, told Reuters he did not think the group was capable of planning an invasion of the Capitol, as prosecutors have said.
""These guys have a hard time getting an order together for McDonalds,"" Graves, whose legal name is Michael Emanuel, said in an interview.
Lawyers representing Ethan ""Rufio"" Nordean, a prominent figure in the Proud Boys and one of the defendants charged with conspiracy, said in a court filing on Monday that he had planned on holding what they called a ""carefree music party"" on Jan. 6 that would have featured Graves.
Though this party never occurred, defense lawyers said planning for such an event scheduled for a time when the riot actually was still taking place contradicted the notion that the group had a plan to ""topple the government"" that day. 
Defense lawyers said 1,500 messages exchanged by members of the Proud Boys on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 on the Telegram messaging app - collected as evidence by the FBI - also cast doubt on the existence of a conspiracy.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the defense filing or on Graves' account of concert plans.
Prosecutors at a hearing on Thursday are set to ask a judge to order Nordean detained pending trial. They have failed in two prior requests for Nordean's pretrial detention. Evidence cited in the new defense filing could be raised at the hearing.
Proud Boys members were among those in a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol on the afternoon of Jan. 6. Prosecutors have accused Nordean and other right-wing figures of conspiring to take the Capitol by force to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory. 
Graves, 46, said he traveled to Washington and performed music at a Jan. 6 rally organized by a group called ""Latinos for Trump"" held before the Capitol attack unfolded. 
Graves said he met up with Nordean one day earlier. Graves said Nordean asked him to play a private concert on Jan. 6 between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. at a house that the Proud Boys had rented to boost the morale of the group's members after its leader, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested on Jan. 4 on gun charges. 
Graves said he agreed to perform, but that he and his manager later ""ghosted"" his Proud Boy friends on Jan. 6 and left Washington as chaos engulfed the Capitol.
Arturo Santaella, who serves as manager for Graves and joined him in Washington on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, vouched for his account of the events.
""They are not this well-oiled machine,"" Santaella said of the Proud Boys.
In the court filing, defense lawyers said Telegram messages show the group was in disarray during the attack. 
One message read: ""Ummm I don't think the plan was to attack ... damage, and attempt to control the building.""

""This is so unorganized!"" another message read. ""Where is our order?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid reports of a rising number of hate crimes against Asian Americans, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday announced he is launching a 30-day ""expedited review"" into how the Justice Department can bolster its efforts to prosecute hate crimes and improve data collection of such incidents.
In his first memo to employees since taking over the helm of the department earlier this month, Garland said he wants to find ways to improve reporting of hate crimes, ""prioritize criminal investigations and prosecutions,"" and work with civil authorities to address cases of bias which may not rise to the statutory definition of a hate crime.
The recent rise in incidents ""requires renewed energy and emphasis on investigation and prosecution, increased community outreach, and the improved collection of data critical to understanding the evolving nature and extent of hate crimes and hate incidents in all their forms,"" Garland wrote.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been raising the alarm over a rise in violence against them that many say coincided with the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which then-President Donald Trump referred to as the ""China virus.""
The incidence of hate crimes against Asian Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
The community's fears were heightened by the fatal shooting of eight people on March 16 at Atlanta-area spas, six of whom were women of Asian descent.

Police have expressed skepticism that race played a role in the actions of suspected gunman Robert Aaron Long, but Asian-American community advocates and lawmakers including Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Asian-American herself, say they believe it was a hate crime.

(Reuters) - Civil rights groups intensified their legal fight against Georgia's new voting restrictions with a third federal lawsuit, while Atlanta-based corporations Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co continued to face boycott calls from activists who say they need to do more to oppose the law.
The Republican-backed law, which Governor Brian Kemp signed last week, strengthened identification requirements for absentee ballots, gave lawmakers the power to take over local elections, sharply limited the use of ballot drop boxes, shortened early voting periods for runoffs and made it a misdemeanor for members of the public to offer food and water to voters waiting in line.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta late on Monday called the law racially discriminatory and ""an attack on democracy itself"".
""This law is voter suppression, plain and simple, and aimed at making it harder for Black and brown and other historically disenfranchised communities to have a voice in our democracy,"" said Sophia Lakin of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
""It is an absolutely shameful response to the historic participation by these communities in the last election cycle.""
The ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed the latest lawsuit on behalf of several grassroots groups. They included the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), which takes in more than 500 churches in Georgia, and the historically Black sorority Delta Sigma Theta.
The state already faces two other similar lawsuits brought by civil rights groups over the law.

Republican lawmakers in several other political battlegrounds, including Florida and Arizona, are pursuing voting restrictions as well, which they say are aimed at curbing fraud. Research has shown that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.
Delta and Coca-Cola, both headquartered in Atlanta, have faced boycott calls on social media from critics who say the companies have not taken a forceful enough stand against the restrictions.
""While we are disappointed in the outcome, we don't see this as the final chapter,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement released on Monday. The company said it would ""continue to press for improvements to Georgia's election laws in future sessions"".
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Friday the airline had ""engaged extensively with state elected officials in both parties to express our strong view that Georgia must have a fair and secure election process"", and that the legislation had ""improved considerably"" during legislative deliberations.
""Nonetheless, we understand concerns remain,"" Bastian said.
In an open letter on Monday, Bernice King, the daughter of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., criticized the Atlanta business community for its ""shocking silence,"" especially after last year's civil unrest prompted a national reckoning on race.
The letter was also signed by the sons of two other civil rights icons: John-Miles Lewis, whose father was the late congressman John Lewis, and Al Vivian, son of the late Reverend C.T. Vivian.
Democrats won Georgia in November's presidential election for the first time in decades, and then followed it up by sweeping two U.S. Senate races in January, giving the party narrow control of Congress.
Republican former President Donald Trump has claimed falsely that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was due to massive voter fraud, including in Georgia.

Multiple state recounts found no significant irregularities.

""This trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession,"" Biden said in a statement that emphasized their ""broad diversity of background experience and perspective.""
The nominees, which include nine women, must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
The three Black women nominated for federal circuit court vacancies are Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Tiffany Cunningham for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and Candace Jackson-Akiwumi for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
Jackson is widely expected to be one of Biden's top picks if a seat opens on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Zahid N. Quraishi, a New Jersey magistrate judge, would be the nation’s first Muslim American to serve on a federal district court. 
Judge Florence Pan would be the first Asian-American judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the White House said in a statement. 
The nominees also include Judge Deborah Boardman for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Boardman is described in a Federal Bar Association newsletter as being of Palestinian descent on her mother's side. 
Regina Rodriguez, the nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado is Hispanic, while Judge Rupa Ranga Puttagunta, nominated for the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, is of South Asian descent.
Biden's slate was cheered by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund as ""an exciting and important beginning.""
""This list powerfully affirms that nominees who are racially diverse and whose professional background reflects a broad range of practice are available to serve on the federal bench,"" Sherrilyn Ifill, the group's president, said in a statement.
With 100 current and future vacancies to fill, the appointments were critical in ensuring ""qualified, fair-minded and diverse"" judges, the American Constitution Society said.

""The courts should look like the people they represent and serve,"" it said. ""Numerous district courts across the country have still never had a judge who is a person of color or a woman. This first slate sets the standard that diversity should be prioritized when picking judicial candidates.""

White House officials said in a statement that the Department of Justice is also focusing on a rising number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans.
""We can’t be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop.""
The measures come after a shooting in Atlanta earlier this month left eight people dead, six of them Asian-American women.
The shooting stoked fears among those in the Asian-American Pacific Islander community, which has reported a spike in hate crimes since March 2020 when then-President Donald Trump began referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""China virus.""
Biden's new steps include $49.5 million of pandemic relief funds for ""community based, culturally specific services and programs for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault"" as well as a new task force dedicated to countering xenophobia against Asians in healthcare.

The Justice Department is also planning new efforts to enforce hate crime laws and report data on racial crimes, the statement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state's highest court on Tuesday cleared the way for a former contestant on ""The Apprentice"" to sue Donald Trump for defamation, after the former U.S. president called her a liar for accusing him of sexual assault.
Trump had argued before leaving the White House on Jan. 20 that Summer Zervos could not pursue her case because a sitting president could not be sued, but the state Court of Appeals said in a brief order that ""the issues presented have become moot.""
Zervos' case will now return to a Manhattan trial court, where her lawyers may have an opportunity to question Trump under oath. The case had been on hold during Trump's appeal.
""Now a private citizen, the defendant has no further excuse to delay justice for Ms. Zervos, and we are eager to get back to the trial court and prove her claims,"" Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer for Zervos, said in an email.
Lawyers for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zervos came forward during the 2016 presidential campaign with accusations that Trump subjected her to unwanted kissing and groping after she sought career advice in 2007, two years after her appearance on his reality television show.
She sued Trump in January 2017 after he branded such allegations by women ""lies"" and retweeted a post calling Zervos' claims a ""hoax.""
Zervos has sought a retraction or an apology, plus compensatory damages and punitive damages.
Trump has denied Zervos' claims, and called her case politically motivated.
Former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll is also suing Trump for defamation, after he denied having raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the mid-1990s.

Trump has also denied claims by several other women of improper sexual conduct.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Monday unveiled a goal to expand the nation's fledgling offshore wind energy industry in the coming decade by opening new areas to development, accelerating permits, and boosting public financing for projects.
The plan is part of President Joe Biden's broader effort to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an agenda that Republicans argue could bring economic ruin but which Democrats say can create jobs while protecting the environment.
The blueprint for offshore wind power generation comes after the Biden administration's suspension of new oil and gas leasing auctions on federal lands and waters, widely seen as a first step to fulfilling the president's campaign promise of a permanent ban on new federal drilling to counter global warming.
The United States, with just two small offshore wind facilities, has lagged European nations in developing the renewable energy technology. The administration of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had vowed to launch offshore wind as a promising new domestic industry but failed to permit any projects.
""We're ready to rock and roll,"" National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said at a virtual press conference to announce the administration's moves.
The plan sets a target to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, which the administration said would be enough to power 10 million homes and cut 78 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.
One of the first steps will be to open a new offshore wind energy development zone in the New York Bight, an area off the densely populated coast between Long Island, New York and New Jersey, with a lease auction there later this year.
The industry will employ 44,000 workers directly by 2030 and support 33,000 additional support jobs, the administration said, with a promise that they would be ""good-paying union jobs.""
Many of those jobs will be created at new factories that will produce the blades, towers and other components for massive offshore wind turbines and at shipyards where the specialized ships needed to install them will be constructed. The administration predicted the nation would see port upgrade investments related to offshore wind of more than $500 million.
The administration said it will also aim to speed up project permits, including environmental reviews, and provide $3 billion in public financing for offshore wind projects through the Department of Energy.
The plan was met with skepticism by a fishing industry group that noted the plan's pledge of just $1 million for research into the effects of offshore wind on fisheries. Fishing groups worry that massive turbines in the ocean would interfere with fishing routes and impact commercial species.
""Where's our roadmap to not completely stomping out one of our main sources of food production and our main source of jobs in coastal communities?"" Annie  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), executive director of the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance, said in an interview.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, in her remarks at a press conference, vowed to ""work through those tensions"" between fisheries and wind development.
The United States currently has just two small offshore wind farms, the 30-megawatt Block Island Wind Farm off Rhode Island and a two-turbine pilot project off the coast of Virginia. There are more than 20 GW of proposed projects in various stages of development.

Europe, by contrast, has more than 20 GW of capacity and plans to expand that more than ten-fold by 2050. Many of the companies developing U.S. projects are European, including Norway's Equinor, Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), and a joint venture between Avangrid (NYSE:AGR), the U.S. arm of Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), and Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.

Alaska Administration Commissioner Kelly Tshibaka announced her Senate campaign with a vow to defeat Murkowski, who has been in the Senate since 2002 but has not yet announced formal plans to seek re-election next year. 
""I'M IN!"" Tshibaka said on Twitter. ""I am running for the Senate to represent our conservative Alaska values. We're going to defeat Lisa Murkowski and show the DC insiders what happens when Alaska has strong conservative leadership!""
A Murkowski spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. 
Murkowski, 63, who was appointed to the Senate in 2002, has been elected three times, including once in 2010 after she lost her Republican primary to a Tea Party candidate but mounted a successful write-in campaign in that year's general election. 
Tshibaka's announcement made no mention of Trump but came less than a month after the former president vowed to campaign against Murkowski, calling her a ""failed candidate"" and a ""disloyal and very bad senator."" 
A Trump critic, Murkowski was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict him at his Senate impeachment trial last month. 
The Alaska Republican Party censured Murkowksi over her impeachment vote and pledged to recruit a primary challenger to oppose her. 
But under a new election system adopted in 2020, Murkowski and Tshibaka would not square off in a party primary. Instead, all Senate candidates will run in an open, all-party primary. 

Other potential Senate contenders include Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thirteen U.S. House Democratic lawmakers on Monday urged the U.S. Postal Service's governing board to halt implementation of a contract that could be worth $6 billion to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
In February, the USPS awarded a contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp to build a mix of gasoline-powered and electric vehicles instead of choosing Workhorse Group Inc to build an all-electric fleet. 
The lawmakers, including Representative Gerald Connolly, who chairs a subcommittee that oversees USPS, Jared Huffman, Tim Ryan, Debbie Dingell and others, also suggested the decision was in defiance of an executive order issued by President Joe Biden to electrify the federal government's vehicle fleet. They urged a delay until a full review is completed and Biden's three nominees to the Postal Board of Governors are seated.
""Squandering this once-in-a-generation opportunity by spending billions of dollars on vehicles that will be custom built for obsolescence – indeed, by the end of their operating lives they will be the last internal combustion fleet vehicles on the road – and defying President Biden’s Executive Order is utterly unacceptable,"" the lawmakers wrote.
Last month, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said USPS was committed to having EVs make up at least 10% of its new fleet.
The lawmakers said ""even the 10% target is highly questionable.""
DeJoy defended the decision to award the contract to Oshkosh, telling Reuters last week he was briefed after the decision had been made. ""(USPS) thoroughly vetted and evaluated the decision,"" DeJoy said, adding he was ""pretty confident"" in the decision.

USPS has asked Congress for about $8 billion to boost the number of EVS it will buy, adding that ""with the right level of congressional support, we can commit... (to) a fully electric fleet by 2035.""

NEW CASTLE, Del. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden, weighing executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence following two mass shootings, said on Friday his administration is exploring whether he has the authority to take action on firearms made using 3D printers as well as on imported guns.
While Democratic-backed gun control legislation faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Congress because of Republican opposition, Biden could decide to take executive action in certain areas without the approval of lawmakers.
""We're looking at what kind of authority I have relative to imported weapons - as well as whether or not I have the authority,"" the Democratic president told reporters in Delaware.
Biden also mentioned ""these new weapons that are being made by 3D equipment that aren't registered as guns at all. There may be some latitude there as well.""
Often homemade, guns made using 3D printers have been a source of controversy. Some states have tried to limit the sales of blueprints that show users how to make them. 
The president, a long-time advocate of gun control measures including increased background checks on gun buyers and banning assault-style weapons, has publicly committed to taking action following two mass shootings that killed a total of 18 people in Georgia and Colorado this month.
The White House has said it needs to review potential actions to ensure they have a solid basis in law and can survive an expected legal challenge.
""They have to go through a review process,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
Psaki said Biden would sign an executive order on guns but did not say when, adding, ""We have to address this epidemic, address the threat of gun violence across many avenues. And he will. He's committed to doing that.""
Biden on Tuesday urged the Senate to approve two bills passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on March 11 that would broaden background checks on gun buyers. Biden also called for a national ban on assault-style weapons. A previous ban expired in 2004.

Biden said on Thursday passing new gun control measures in Congress is ""a matter of timing.""

(Reuters) -Georgia's sweeping new voting restrictions came under attack on Friday, with civil rights groups challenging them in court and President Joe Biden saying the U.S. Justice Department was examining what he called an ""atrocity"" of a law.
Among other limits, the Republican-backed law enacted on Thursday imposes stricter identification requirements, limits drop boxes, gives lawmakers the power to take over local elections and shortens the early voting period for all runoff elections. It also makes it a misdemeanor for people to offer food and water to voters https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BH2TC in line, in a state where people sometimes wait for hours in the heat to vote. 
The legislation has alarmed Democrats, who just months ago celebrated historic wins in the presidential election and two Senate campaigns in Georgia that helped deliver the White House and U.S. Senate control to their party in Washington.
Biden, the first Democratic presidential candidate in three decades to win Georgia, on Friday accused Republicans there and in other states of mounting a broad assault on voting rights.
""It's an atrocity,"" Biden told reporters, shortly after comparing the restrictions for a second straight day to racist ""Jim Crow"" laws, which were put in place in Southern states in the decades after the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War to legalize racial segregation and disenfranchise Black citizens.
Biden said it was unclear what, if anything, the White House could do to address the law but added that the Justice Department was ""taking a look."" He again urged Congress to pass Democratic-backed legislation that would require automatic registration, expand absentee voting and temper voter ID laws.
Thus far, Republican opposition in the U.S. Senate has stymied that effort.
A coalition of civil rights groups sued the state in Atlanta federal court just hours after Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed the legislation into law on Thursday, arguing that the measures are intended to make it harder for people – particularly Black voters – to cast ballots.
Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who spearheaded the party's election legal efforts last year, is representing the groups, which include The New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise, Inc.
""These provisions lack any justification for their burdensome and discriminatory effects on voting,"" the lawsuit said.
Kemp issued a statement on Friday in response to Biden's comments, saying the law ""ensures election integrity.""
""There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person,"" he said. ""President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box.""
Other Republican-controlled state legislatures are pursuing voting restrictions in election battleground states, including Florida and Arizona, after former President Donald Trump repeatedly blamed his loss to Biden on massive voter fraud without evidence.
Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the restrictions, which passed the Georgia legislature solely with Republican support, will further harm voters in minority communities that are already plagued by long lines and inadequate election infrastructure.
As he contested his national loss to Biden, Trump focused much of his energy in Georgia. At one point, he personally called the state's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and urged him to ""find"" votes Trump claimed had gone missing.
That phone call is part of a criminal investigation by state prosecutors into whether Trump broke election laws by pressuring officials to alter the results.
In a statement on Friday, Trump applauded Georgia Republicans for their action.
""They learned from the travesty of the 2020 Presidential Election, which can never be allowed to happen again,"" he said.

Trump's false assertions about voter fraud have reinforced long-standing Republican warnings that stricter laws are needed, despite research showing that such cases are vanishingly rare. 
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll in February, 62% of Republicans said they were ""very concerned"" that elections were tainted by ineligible people casting votes. Weeks before the election in October, 47% of Republicans expressed the same level of concern.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Friday said she was maintaining the threat of U.S. tariffs on goods from Austria, Britain, India, Italy, Spain and Turkey in retaliation for their digital services taxes.
In a statement, Tai announced that her office would proceed with steps to impose potential tariffs, including filing public notices and collecting public comments as part of investigations launched originally by the Trump administration into the taxes aimed largely at American internet companies and e-commerce platforms.
The taxes target in-country revenues of digital services platforms, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced the decision despite Democratic President Joe Biden's renewed commitments to pursue a global agreement on digital services taxes through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
Tai also said that the USTR was terminating ""Section 301"" tariff investigations against Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union and Indonesia because these jurisdictions have not adopted or implemented digital services taxes that were previously under consideration. If they do adopt a digital services tax, USTR said it may open a new tariff probe.
The move is among the first negotiating tactics revealed by Tai since she took office last week. Tai said in her confirmation hearing in February that tariffs were a ""legitimate tool"" for U.S. trade policy. 
""The United States remains committed to reaching an international consensus through the OECD process on international tax issues,"" Tai said in a statement. ""However, until such a consensus is reached, we will maintain our options under the Section 301 process, including, if necessary, the imposition of tariffs.""
The Internet Association, which represents major U.S. internet platforms, applauded the move to keep the tariff threat alive against the six countries, calling its industry a ""great American export"" that supports millions of jobs.
""Today's move by USTR is an important affirmation in pushing back on these discriminatory trade barriers as the U.S. continues to work to find a viable solution at the OECD,"" the trade group said in a statement. 
The United States also is maintaining a more advanced tariff threat against $1.3 billion in imports of French Champagne, cosmetics, handbags and other goods in retaliation for France's digital tax.

Like the French tax, the USTR investigations into the taxes adopted by Austria, Britain, India, Italy, Spain and Turkey found that they discriminate against U.S. technology companies and are inconsistent with international tax norms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Friday introduced a resolution to rescind a rule they say curbs shareholder voting rights, their second move aimed at unraveling business regulations introduced by former President Donald Trump's administration.
Introduced by Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown, the resolution aims to undo a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule which investors say curbs their power to push for corporate action on issues like climate change and compensation.
The resolution was introduced under the Congressional Review Act which requires only a simple majority vote in both chambers of Congress to reverse recently finalized rules. Democrats hold slim majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
""These rules were yet another ploy by the Trump Administration to undermine shareholder democracy. Last year's changes to the SEC rule on shareholder proposals made it much harder for working families and investors to hold corporate management accountable,"" said Brown in a statement to Reuters.
""Congress must repeal the rule. We also need to find ways to increase shareholder participation and to make executives more accountable.""
In a major win for the corporate lobby which had pushed for changes to overhaul shareholder voting rights, the SEC in September raised the stock ownership threshold at which investors can force a shareholder vote on specific issues.
It said it was modernizing its rules to stop resolutions hanging around on corporate ballots with diminishing support, but critics saw it as an attempt to stifle shareholder activism on environmental, social or corporate governance issues.
The SEC, now led by Democratic acting chair Allison Lee, who voted against the September rule, declined to comment.
Barbara Roper, a director at the Consumer Federation of America, applauded Friday's move, noting that under the Congressional Review Act the SEC would be forbidden from writing a similar rule in future.
""This is a rule that is ideally suited for CRA. It is designed to dramatically curtail shareholder rights and discriminates against retail investors,"" she said. 
Industry groups, like the National Association of Manufacturers, outcried Friday's move as ""heavy-handed.""
""The NAM does not believe the CRA is the appropriate mechanism for review of the SEC's rule to modernize the proxy process () and looks forward to engaging with the SEC to defend the vital reforms included within it.""
Tom Quaadman, an executive at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told Reuters that if successful, the CRA resolution ""would bring us back to a world where institutional investors were rare and shareholder communications sparse,"" adding that the Trump-era measures were meant to modernize rules that were ""antiquated, inefficient and drowned out important issues for consideration."" 
Friday's move followed an earlier resolution introduced by Democrats on Thursday to reverse another Trump-era rule which consumer groups said allows predatory lenders to evade state interest rate caps. 
Speaking to Reuters on Friday, a staff member in the office of Congressman Jesus ""Chuy"" García, who is backing the earlier resolution in the House, said Democrats had the votes in both chambers to get it through. 

""Undoing this measure protects Americans in red and blue states, who equally agree that states should have interest rate caps,"" said the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The Trump-Era True Lender Rule discouraged these state-set caps, and it's time we repeal the harmful rule and enable states to put a stop to predatory lending.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Republican state officials on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow them to take over the defense of a hardline immigration rule issued by former President Donald Trump's administration that barred immigrants likely to require government benefits from obtaining legal permanent residency.
The 14 Republican state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, asked the justices to put on hold an Illinois-based federal judge's decision that threw out the so-called ""public charge"" rule nationwide. 
The administration of President Joe Biden, who took office in January, decided to drop the government's legal defense of the regulation. As a result, the Supreme Court on March 9 dismissed two appeals launched before Trump left office that sought to preserve the rule after lower courts ruled against it.
The Republican attorneys general said that the Biden administration's change of position and refusal to defend the rule were an attempt to evade the normal and lengthy process of unraveling a federal regulation. They previously asked the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to allow them to intervene to defend the policy, but were rejected.
Biden, who has criticized Trump's immigration approach, was widely expected to dump the public charge rule. A coalition of immigrant rights groups that along with the states of New York, Connecticut and Vermont challenged the rule, calling it an illegal ""wealth test.""
Judges who ruled against the policy said it likely violated federal immigration and administrative law by impermissibly expanding the definition of who counts as a ""public charge"" and greatly increasing the number of people who would be rejected for residency.
Friday's filing was the first emergency application made at the Supreme Court against a Biden administration policy move. Such applications are made via the court's secretive ""shadow docket."" As reported by Reuters this week, the ""shadow docket"" has come under increasing scrutiny over concerns that it is not sufficiently transparent, with decisions made quickly with little explanation. 
A central issue in the various legal challenges to the ""public charge"" rule was which immigrants would be eligible for legal permanent residency, commonly known as a ""green card.""
U.S. immigration law has long required officials to exclude people likely to become a ""public charge"" from permanent residency. U.S. guidelines in place for the past two decades had said immigrants likely to become primarily dependent on direct cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, in a nursing home for example, at public expense would be barred.

Trump's policy expanded the public charge bar to anyone deemed likely to receive a much wider range of benefits for more than an aggregate of 12 months over any 36-month period including the Medicaid healthcare program, housing and food assistance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States has invited the leaders of China and Russia to participate in a global summit on climate change in April, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were among 40 world leaders invited to the April 22-23 summit, according to a White House statement.
Biden told reporters he had not yet spoken to the two leaders about it, ""but they know they're invited.""
Biden's Earth Day global summit on climate is part of his effort to elevate climate change as a top priority. It will be held virtually given pandemic restrictions and will be live-streamed for public viewing.
Climate change is one area U.S. officials believe it is possible to do business with China and Russia, despite deep differences on a host of other issues.
At his first solo news conference since taking office, Biden on Thursday called Xi and Putin supporters of autocracy.
The White House statement said a key goal of the Earth Day summit and a separate gathering in the Scottish city of Glasgow in November will be to galvanize efforts to keep within reach a goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Biden, speaking as he departed the White House for a weekend at his Delaware home, also said he had just spoken with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, indicating the subject was also the climate summit.
Climate was also a topic when Biden spoke to European leaders on Thursday in a virtual summit of the European Council.
The Biden administration is expected to announce what the White House called ""an ambitious 2030 target"" for reducing carbon emissions by the time of the summit.
Any target Biden announces is likely to face opposition from Republicans concerned that the Democratic president will sacrifice jobs and economic growth while pursuing his climate plans.

Biden is urging world leaders to use the summit as an opportunity to outline how their countries will contribute to reduced emissions, the White House said.
The summit will bring together 17 countries responsible for 80 percent of global emissions and global GDP. The invitee list of 40 nations includes Canada and Mexico as well as allies in Europe and Asia as well as Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria and South Africa.

As House sergeant-at-arms, Walker would oversee security and protocol. The appointment is subject to a vote by the House, which is controlled by Pelosi's Democrats.
Walker has commanded the D.C. National Guard since 2018 and has 39 years of military experience, including a long stint as a special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
""His historic appointment as the first Black American to serve as Sergeant-at-Arms is an important step forward for this institution and our nation,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""It is essential that we work to strengthen our institution and keep our Capitol community, and all who visit, safe.""
National Guard troops were dispatched to the Capitol grounds after the attack and some have remained ever since. They are now expected to stay until mid-May. Tall fencing was erected around the building, although the fenced-off area has been reduced in recent days.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a statement praising the selection of Walker. ""Every member, staffer, employee and visitor to the Capitol should feel safe with Maj. Gen. Walker at the helm of Sergeant at Arms operations.""

Timothy Blodgett has been serving as acting sergeant-at-arms since Paul Irving resigned following the Jan. 6 riot. Irving told lawmakers after he resigned that intelligence ahead of the melee had not warranted having troops at the Capitol that day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is ""worried"" about a set of sweeping new voting restrictions approved in the state of Georgia, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday.
The Democratic president is concerned that the new law signed on Thursday by Republican Governor Brian Kemp would prevent people from bringing water to voters in line, reduce open hours at polling locations and restrict the use of absentee ballots, she said.
""There's nothing more precious than the right to vote and speak up,"" Psaki told reporters, adding that she expected Biden to soon make a statement on the issue himself.
""It should not be harder - it should be easier to vote. We should not put limitations in place. People should be able to vote from home. They should be able to use absentee ballots. There should be a range of restrictions that are undone, not put back in place.""
She also voiced support for efforts by congressional Democrats to pass federal voting rights and election reform legislation. Such efforts have already run into strong Republican opposition.
Georgia's new law will impose new limits, including stricter identification requirements, limiting drop boxes, giving lawmakers the power to take over local elections and shortening the early voting period for all runoff elections. Offering food and water to voters waiting in line will now be considered a misdemeanor crime.
Kemp said he offered no apology for ""taking another step to making our elections fair and secure"" but opponents describe the law as among the country's most damaging attempts to limit access to the ballot box and designed to reduce the influence of Black voters.
A Black Georgia state representative, Park Cannon, was arrested and released after knocking on the door to Kemp's office as he signed the law. Psaki said anyone who saw a video of the arrest would be ""deeply concerned"" by the actions of law enforcement.
Democrats just months ago celebrated historic wins in the presidential election and two Senate campaigns in Georgia that helped deliver the White House and U.S. Senate control to their party in Washington. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992.

Other Republican-controlled state legislatures are pursuing voting restrictions in key battleground states, including Florida and Arizona, after former Republican President Donald Trump blamed his loss to Biden on unproven allegations of massive voter fraud.

912,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Friday nominated a former senior Justice Department official from the administration of President Barack Obama to head the U.S. Marshal Service.
The White House said Biden was nominating Ronald Davis, a former California police chief and Justice Department official, to serve as Marshal Service director.
The Marshal Service acts as the enforcement arm of U.S. federal courts. Its responsibilities include apprehending federal fugitives, protecting federal judges and witnesses, transporting federal prisoners and enforcing court and law enforcement orders related to civil disturbances and acts of terrorism.
Davis served in the Obama administration as director of the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), whose mission is to build trust and mutual respect between police and communities, according to the department's website.
Subsequently, Obama named Davis to serve as executive director of a Presidential task force on 21st Century Policing.
Before joining Obama's Justice Department, Davis had served for over eight years as police chief of East Palo Alto, California and for 20 years as a member of the Oakland, California police department.

(Reuters) -Businessman Mike Lindell appeared on the cable network Newsmax last month and launched into a baseless conspiracy theory blaming a voting machine company for fraud in the 2020 presidential election.
After muting Lindell’s microphone, a Newsmax anchor told viewers that the My Pillow Inc founder’s claims were unsubstantiated and unverified. The anchor then read a prepared statement that included: “Newsmax accepts the (election) results as legal and final.”
Lindell, an ardent ally of losing presidential candidate Donald Trump, refused to drop the subject, and the anchor stormed off mid-interview.
The on-air reality check highlights a new trend in conservative media: In an apparent effort to minimize liability for defamation, Newsmax and some other outlets are relying on prepared disclaimers or additional pre-recorded programming to repudiate pro-Trump conspiracy theories spouted by guests and hosts.
Legal experts say this practice, also used in some form by One America News Network (OANN) and other conservative TV and radio networks, is a response to lawsuits recently filed or threatened by Dominion Voting Systems Inc and Smartmatic Inc, two election technology companies targeted by pro-Trump conspiracy theorists.
A Newsmax spokesman declined to comment. OANN did not respond to a request for comment.
The suits could test the effectiveness of disclaimers on news coverage more broadly, as well as the conservative media’s appetite for guests and hosts who make unsubstantiated claims about hot-button issues, legal experts say. The suits also pose an “existential threat” to the smaller networks, which can ill afford a big verdict or settlement, said Columbia University historian Nicole Hemmer, author of a book on conservative media.
Dominion pushed forward with its legal challenges on Friday, saying it filed a $1.6 billion defamation suit against Fox News parent company Fox Corp in Delaware Superior Court, accusing it of falsely claiming the voting company rigged the election to boost its ratings.
Earlier, on Feb. 4, Smartmatic sued Fox, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others, claiming Smartmatic was falsely accused of rigging the election in favor of President Joe Biden. That suit seeks more than $2.7 billion in damages from the network and its hosts or guests.
Floyd Abrams, a prominent media lawyer and First Amendment advocate, said disclaimers could be modestly useful in bolstering the argument that the networks were “simply carrying the views” of Trump surrogates, rather than acting with malice toward Dominion and Smartmatic.
Fox did not run disclaimers, taking a different approach. In the case of Smartmatic coverage, the network aired a three-minute taped interview of an expert who expressed skepticism about electoral fraud claims. The segment ran three times in December. It first aired days after Smartmatic demanded that Fox retract false statements made on its shows, and weeks after those statements were originally broadcast.
Fox did not retract anything. A Fox spokeswoman pointed to instances in November and December when the network reported on the lack of evidence behind the voter fraud allegations.
“If the First Amendment means anything, it means that Fox cannot be held liable for fairly reporting and commenting on competing allegations in a hotly contested and actively litigated election,” the network said last month after filing a motion to get the Smartmatic lawsuit dismissed.
In that filing, Fox said it had invited Smartmatic to appear on the network to address the allegations made by Trump’s surrogates, and that Smartmatic declined.
A Smartmatic attorney declined to comment on the invitation.
Dominion has filed earlier defamation lawsuits against Trump allies, including Giuliani and Lindell, based in part on their statements on networks and social media. Dominion has formally advised social media networks to preserve posts and data from Fox, Newsmax, OANN, Trump and others, saying they are relevant to pending and forthcoming claims.
Giuliani did not return a request for comment but told Reuters in January that his comments about Dominion were constitutionally protected free speech. Lindell told Reuters he was “happy” that Dominion sued him, because it would allow him to seek evidence from the company. He said that he planned to countersue Dominion for trying to silence him.
As for the networks, Dominion counsel Tom Clare and an attorney for Smartmatic said the disclaimers and counterarguments came too late.
They “cannot undo the damage to Dominion,” Clare said in an interview prior to filing Friday's lawsuit.
‘THEY’VE GOT TO WARN YOU ABOUT ME?’
When Giuliani hosted a show in February on conservative talk radio station WABC in New York, the station inserted a statement mid-broadcast that the host’s “views, assumptions and opinions” do not necessarily represent the opinions, beliefs or policies of the station, its owner, other WABC hosts or advertisers.
Giuliani, returning to the microphone after the disclaimer, appeared blindsided. “Rather insulting,” he said. “We’re in America. We’re not in East Germany. They’ve got to warn you about me?”
WABC did not respond to a request for comment.
New York media lawyer Ryan Cummings said disclaimers could help media outlets argue that their hosts and guests were presenting opinions, not news. Under U.S. law, opinion enjoys more legal protection than reporting that purports to assert facts. However, radio and cable news outlets generally don’t provide cues to make the distinction obvious to viewers.
Disclaimers could also help Newsmax and others argue that they were not acting recklessly, said Stanford Law School professor Robert Rabin. Under U.S. law, a false statement about a well-known person or company is deemed defamatory only if it is made with “actual malice” or a reckless disregard for the truth.
Fox, the conservative network with by far the greatest reach, took a different route with its pre-recorded interview titled “Closer Look at Claims About Smartmatic.”
The network first presented the skeptical expert’s views in December, five weeks after it originally aired the false claims about Smartmatic. The segment ran during the same shows on which the false statements originally were made. 
The questions in the segment, voiced by an unidentified off-camera interviewer, were quick and to-the-point.
For instance, the interviewer asked, ""Have you seen any evidence that Smartmatic software was used to flip votes anywhere in the U.S. in this election?"" The voting technology expert, Eddie Perez, responded: ​“I have not seen any evidence that Smartmatic software was used to delete, change, alter anything related to vote tabulation.”
Perez told Reuters that Fox had been vague about the interview when it booked him, and did not say that the questions would be exclusively about Smartmatic. However, he said, Fox’s audience “needed to hear sober factual information.” The network had been “leading them astray for weeks,” Perez said.
“On the other hand,” he added, “I am not so naive to think that one five- to seven-minute piece that answers those questions would miraculously change minds.”
Smartmatic saw the taped interview as “an admission of guilt or an admission of liability on the part of Fox News,” said Smartmatic’s counsel, Erik Connolly. “And that’s how we have positioned it in our lawsuit.”
IS TRUMP IMMUNE?
As legally fraught as election fraud claims can be, the subject is enormously appealing to many pro-Trump viewers and voters. And conservative media continue to make Trump, the most powerful voice in the Republican Party, a focal point of their coverage.
Some media lawyers say the president - who led the way in making and spreading election fraud claims - may be in less legal peril than his surrogates and the conservative networks that cover him.
That’s partly because he made specific public claims about the companies only while he was still president: Sitting presidents are immune from suits related to their official acts, a protection that has been interpreted broadly by the courts. Rabin, the Stanford lawyer, said the protections are meant to ensure that high-level government officials can speak out and perform their responsibilities without fear of defamation suits.
Since leaving office, Trump has kept his remarks vague, not mentioning the election technology companies by name. “The broader or the vaguer the articulation of election fraud, the clearer it is that it will be protected by the First Amendment,” Abrams said. 
Trump has not been personally sued by Smartmatic or Dominion. A senior Trump adviser did not respond to requests for comment.

By comparison, even if they issue disclaimers and keep their coverage vague, the networks are at risk for what already has been said on their news programs.
“There’s a certain irony in it,” Rabin said, referring to the contrast between Trump’s legal exposure and that of the media who cover him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden vowed on Thursday to push China to play by international rules, criticized his Republican opponents and defended his policy to provide shelter to children crossing the U.S. border from Mexico at his first solo news conference since taking office.
Appearing before reporters for more than an hour, Biden seemed well-prepared, read from written papers occasionally, and calmly took questions, a sharp contrast to the often raucous, combative news conferences held by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Amid the worst U.S.-Chinese relations in decades, Biden compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling them both supporters of autocracy.
But he said the United States was not looking for confrontation with China over differences on trade, Beijing's rollback of democracy in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs and military buildup.
“He’s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future, (and) democracy can’t function in an ever-complex world,” Biden said of Xi. ""He doesn't have a democratic - with a small 'd' - bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy."" 
He said he would insist the Chinese leader ""play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.""
Biden also criticized Republican-backed measures in many state legislatures to restrict voting rights, saying they were worse than ""Jim Crow,"" referring to laws put in place in Southern states in the decades after the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War to legalize racial segregation and disenfranchise Black citizens.
Struggling to contain a surge in unaccompanied children seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border, Biden suggested his Republican critics who say his policies are at fault were inhumane. 
No previous administration had refused care and shelter to children coming over from Mexico, except that of Trump, Biden said. Rather than leaving those children to ""starve to death"" at the border, Biden said his administration would care for them. 
Biden noted that he had selected Vice President Kamala Harris to lead diplomatic efforts with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to stem the flow of migrants. 
Biden faces opposition from congressional Republicans to his ambitious plans for what could end up being a $3 trillion plan for infrastructure and other priorities and tax increases to pay for it.
He said he believed the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate should make it harder for Republicans to use a parliamentary blocking maneuver called the filibuster that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber, saying it is being abused.
He called for a return to the “talking filibuster” - a tradition from decades ago that required senators to occupy the floor and make their case against legislation if they opposed it.
NEW VACCINATION TARGET
Biden's own political future came up at the news conference.
At 78 years old, many political analysts believe Biden could decide to serve only one term. But he said he planned to run for re-election in 2024, keeping Harris as his running mate. ""That’s my expectation,"" he said. 
On Jan. 20, Biden became the oldest U.S. president to be inaugurated.
Biden also on Thursday set a new goal of administering 200 million vaccination shots against COVID-19 in the United States in his first 100 days in office.
He said his initial goal of administering 100 million vaccination shots in his first 100 days in the White House was reached last week, 42 days ahead of schedule, and that he was doubling the target. 
""I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close,"" the Democratic president said. 
Biden backed away from a May 1 deadline to withdraw U.S. troops in Afghanistan after Trump tried but failed to pull them out before leaving office. 
""It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline,"" said Biden. But he added: ""We are not staying a long time"" in Afghanistan, site of America's longest war.
He said he did not think the troops would still be there next year.
NORTH KOREA
Biden read carefully from talking points in responding to a question about North Korea's missile launches, which have alarmed U.S. allies Japan and South Korea. ""If they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly,"" he said.
He said he was prepared for ""some form of diplomacy"" with North Korea, ""but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.""
Pyongyang wants the United States and other nations to ease economic sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons program. U.S. officials have said they have tried to engage with North Korea diplomatically but received no response.
Biden was repeatedly pressed to defend his migration policy along the U.S. border with Mexico.
Biden said the increase in migration was cyclical.
""It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months,"" he said. ""It happens every year.""

He said many migrants were fleeing problems in their home countries and blamed Trump for dismantling parts of the U.S. immigration system.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee voted on Thursday to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force that allowed the war in Iraq, as lawmakers renewed their effort to pull back the authority to declare war from the White House.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 28 to 19 to repeal the authorization, or AUMF, 19 years after it passed. The vote cleared the way for the measure's consideration by the full House. There was no immediate indication of when that might take place.
To become law it also must pass the U.S. Senate, where members are undertaking a separate effort to repeal and replace past war authorizations.
The U.S. Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. However, that authority has gradually shifted to the president as Congress passed AUMFs that did not expire - such as the 2002 Iraq measure, as well as one that allowed the fight against al Qaeda in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
""It was passed to authorize a war against Saddam Hussein almost 20 years ago,"" Representative Gregory Meeks, the committee's chairman, said, arguing for the repeal of the 2002 AUMF. ""Saddam Hussein is long gone.""
Opponents worry that repeal would risk U.S. security by limiting the powers of the president.
Representative Michael McCaul, the committee's top Republican, said lawmakers should craft a new AUMF before repealing the old one.
""I believe we must do this as part of a comprehensive, updated replacement to provide clear authorities against the terrorists who still plot to kill Americans here and abroad,"" he said.
Supporters of repeal argue the AUMFs were not intended to last for decades. ""It's time we end these forever wars,"" said Democratic Representative Barbara Lee, a leader of the repeal effort.

The White House has said President Joe Biden believes the AUMFs should be re-examined.

(Reuters) - Even now, more than two decades after the Columbine school shooting, survivor Heather Martin is trying to learn how to take care of herself.
She struggled with her mental health for a decade before seeking professional help. There were dark days and years including intense trauma after the 9/11 attacks. Those struck more than two years after she barricaded herself in a Columbine classroom with 59 other students in 1999.
Martin, 39, heard about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks over the radio while driving to work. She has blacked out most of what happened next. She only remembers her coworkers at a restaurant asking why she was hiding behind an ice machine.
Survivors of mass shootings like Martin, family members of those who died in those attacks and psychologists agree that people who have experienced violence like the recent killings in Boulder and Atlanta need the care of mental health professionals, not just in the immediate aftermath but for years or decades afterward. 
The United States lacks that effective and ongoing care. Survivors of mass shootings have stepped in themselves to fill gaps in a system that is a patchwork of local resources not designed to provide sustained response. 
""All the help in the world is there for the shooting survivors right after the event,"" Martin said. ""But society quickly forgets and moves on. The survivors and their families cannot forget, ever.""
Thirteen years after Columbine, a gunman opened fire in nearby Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people in a movie theater. 
A few days after that shooting, Martin received a text from a fellow Columbine survivor, Jen Hammer, asking if she wanted to form a support group for those who survived the shooting. She agreed immediately.
""We wanted to offer something that we didn't have access to in 1999 - peer support,"" Martin said.
In forming their Rebels Project, Martin and several other Columbine survivors had to confront lingering demons. 
""We learned that 13 years later we were still struggling - there was a whole group of us who were still a mess,"" she said.
FILLING THE GAP
Like the Columbine survivors, Shiva Ghaed has found mental health support to be lacking. 
Ghaed started thinking about the missing support shortly after she survived the 2017 Las Vegas shooting at a packed music festival that killed 60 people and injured nearly 900. 
A San Diego-based clinical psychologist who well before the shooting specialized in PTSD and trauma disorders, Ghaed escaped the Las Vegas shooting without physical injury. 
The National Center for PTSD has estimated that 28% of people who have witnessed a mass shooting will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and about one-third acute stress disorder. 
Virtually all who do suffer PTSD can recover with the proper treatment, the course of which can vary widely depending upon the individual, Ghaed said. 
""After I came home following the Las Vegas shooting, I realized, 'Oh, my God, I'm not hearing anything about any mental healthcare support for those who were there,'"" she said. 
She immediately formed a weekly support group. Amid the pandemic and other issues, that group has now disbanded. Ghaed continues to seek ways to provide support through her Route 91 Therapy website. 
Sandy Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was among those killed in the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting, created the Survivors Empowered group. 
A day after Monday's shootings in Boulder, Phillips' group worked with three trauma therapy organizations to ensure that survivors and their families would not need to wait for government assistance or insurance approval to speak with a counselor. 
""We know that trauma therapy early on gives a huge difference in the ability to at least move forward in a healthy manner,"" Phillips said. 
Laura Wilson, a clinical psychology professor at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia, whose research has focused in part on survivors of mass shootings, said she is concerned that the pandemic is overlooked as a complicating factor. 
""Community is a really powerful mechanism for recovery,"" Wilson said. ""The pandemic has complicated that because people can't get together; they can't safely hug someone outside of their household."" 
Wilson said the mental health community agrees that the most efficient therapies are cognitive processing therapy, which seeks to change negative beliefs and behaviors, and prolonged exposure therapy, in which a patient gradually confronts the cause of anxiety. 
Wilson's research has shown that mass shootings - while representing just about 1% of gun deaths in the United States in any given year - have an outsized impact on the public at large. 
Those directly involved are most acutely affected, ""but individuals across the country that don't personally know anybody impacted can experience a psychological reaction,"" Wilson said. ""We see people posting on Twitter that their loved one was just going to buy milk, and the next thing they knew they were being shot at or killed, and that can impact anybody regardless of proximity to the event."" 
ACTIVIST FAMILIES
Colorado state Representative Tom Sullivan only recently embraced therapy to cope with the loss of his son Alex, who was murdered at the Aurora movie theater in 2012 on his 27th birthday. Sullivan poured his energies into activism and politics, pushing for stricter gun laws. 
Michael Morisette also channeled grief into activism after his daughter Kristina was murdered in the Borderline Bar and Grill shooting in 2018, when a gunman killed 12 people in Thousand Oaks, California. 
Morisette choked on his sobs as he spoke about his daughter's death at age 20 and his efforts to help other trauma victims. He left a retail sales job to become the California outreach coordinator for Give an Hour, an organization that provides no-cost mental health care. 
He said family members of mass shooting victims ""need peers who are walking alongside us, who have been through what we face.""
Coni Sanders, whose father Dave was a teacher and basketball coach at Columbine and the lone adult killed, said her grief motivated her to become a therapist who works with violent offenders in the Denver area. She hopes to prevent future tragedies. 
She said that mental health efforts following mass shootings focus on the immediate weeks afterward. 
""But for many people that does not fit. I didn't go to therapy until a few years after, which I found I couldn't cope by myself anymore,"" she said. ""It's a tricky journey, and support is needed at different times for years.""
